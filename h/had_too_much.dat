5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike. It was ultimately replaced by The Empty Planet as the production team was concerned it <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of {{the feel of the}} 1970s Gerry Anderson science-fiction series, UFO.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E

50|$|In 1938, the {{government}} fined Rutter Brothers Dairy for <b>having</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> butterfat in its milk. What initially {{seemed like a}} setback turned into {{a very good thing}} for a fledgling dairy as the public learned that Rutter’s had been cited for <b>having</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a good thing.|$|R
5|$|Later in the day, Đôn privately {{met with}} CIA agent Lucien Conein and reiterated that the Americans were mistaken in {{believing that the}} ARVN was responsible. Đôn insisted that Diem {{remained}} in control although Nhu had to approve all of the generals' meetings with Diệm. Đôn insisted Nhu had orchestrated the raids, fearing that the generals <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power. He asserted that Nhu used the cover of martial law to discredit the generals by dressing the Special Forces in ARVN uniforms. Đôn insisted that {{he was unaware of}} the plans and was at Joint General Staff headquarters with Khiêm when he received a radio message informing him of the assaults. Police Commissioner Trần Văn Tu, supported by Tung's men, were in charge of the operation at ground level, and by the time Don arrived, the mission had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} certain {{personal}} issues regarding the new king that caused concern. Shortly before his death, Edward I had exiled Prince Edward's favourite and possible lover Piers Gaveston, whom the king believed <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{influence over the}} prince. At his deathbed he had supposedly exhorted some of his closest followersHenry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke and Robert Cliffordto keep watch over his son, and particularly {{to make sure that}} Gaveston did not return. One of Edward II's first actions as king was nevertheless to recall Gaveston from exile. He also gave him the title of Earl of Cornwalla title normally reserved for members of the royal familythereby furthering the aggravation against the favourite. Another source of discontent was Edward II abandoning the Scottish Wars pursued by his father. This left the way open for Robert the Bruce to regain land the English had conquered, to the detriment of many English magnates.|$|E

5|$|After the pit stops, which {{concluded}} on lap 91, Riggs reclaimed {{the first}} position. Kahne {{closed the gap}} to teammate Riggs, who was holding a lead of four-tenths of a second, by lap 95. One lap later, Kahne passed Riggs (who complained his car <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> understeer) for first place. Earnhardt moved into second when he passed Riggs on the 100th lap. Lap 105 saw the fifth caution; Waltrip lost control {{of his car and}} hit the turn four outside wall, causing him to spin while attempting to make a pit stop for fuel. During the caution, all drivers again made pit stops. Kahne maintained the lead at the lap-110 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Bowyer. Gordon passed Bowyer to claim third position one lap later. Bowyer lost two further positions when Burton and Johnson overtook him on the 115th lap. A sixth caution was prompted on the following lap when Kurt Busch spun leaving turn two and hit the inside wall on the backstretch; while attempting to avoid Busch, Sorenson lost control in turn two, and went towards the inside backstretch wall. Most of the leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops for fuel. Harvick and Kahne avoided a collision on pit road. Sadler led the field at the lap-121 restart, followed by Raines and Robby Gordon. Raines passed Sadler to reclaim the lead two laps later, while Sadler drove back to pit road with engine problems on lap 125.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m {{backstroke}}, 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his judgment and race strategy.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar chain, {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain in order to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company.|$|E

25|$|Even after {{crowning}} himself Emperor Wu, Liu Yu remained frugal. However, he did {{not care}} for education and trusted unsavory people. He felt that the nobility <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power, so he tended to appoint the lower classes to government positions and gave military power to imperial kinsmen. Ironically, because the imperial kinsmen stabilized their military power and wished to gain political power, Emperor Wu was afraid they would have thoughts of usurping the throne. Thus, he also frequently killed his kinsmen.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{few years}} a new problem arose. There was too much scrip and a {{shortage}} of babysitting. As new members joined, more scrip {{was added to the}} system until couples <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but new members were not able to spend it because no one else wanted to babysit. In general, the cooperative experienced regular problems because the administration took in more than it spent, and at times the system added too much scrip into the system via the amount issued to new members.|$|E
25|$|After {{his defeat}} {{for a fourth}} term in the House, La Follette {{returned}} to Madison to begin a private law practice. In the early 1890s, he began to believe {{that much of the}} Republican Party had abandoned the ideals of its antislavery origins and become a tool for corporate interests. In his home state, he was convinced industry and railroad interests <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> sway over the party. To counter this, La Follette began building an independent organization within the party that stressed voter control.|$|E

From 1977 onwards the GMC consistently opposed further development, and would not support any before 1986. Trade increased in the early 1980s, though GMC policy against development and for retaining {{the relative importance of}} the retail centres remained. By the mid-1980s, the trend in retailing had moved from city-centres to out-of-town. The opening of Meadowhall Centre in 1990 added to the retail impact in the Sheffield city centre.|$|E

25|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} by the government in May 1988. The first center, in Mo i Rana, opened on 31 January 1989 and was opened by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Kristensen. The centers were established under the presumption that they would be fully occupied with publicly financed projects, but in reality they were forced to attempt to find various private projects and all <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> capacity. They thus became a financial failure because they had massive overcapacity in computing power and few project which were able to pay for the costs. By 1991, one of the centers was bankrupt and the rest were struggling financially. The only center with success was the one in Tromsø, which was used for Tromsø Satellite Station.|$|E
25|$|Simón Bolívar became {{president}} of Gran Colombia in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens {{did not like the}} government's position under Bolívar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military <b>had</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.|$|E
