5000|$|Compliance with ISO 13485 {{is often}} seen {{as the first step}} in {{achieving}} compliance with <b>European</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements.</b> The conformity of Medical Devices and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Device according to European Union Directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC must be assessed before sale is permitted. One of the major requirements to prove conformity is the implementation of the Quality Management System according ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 and ISO 14971. Although the European Union Directives do not mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 the preferred method to prove compliance to such standards is to seek its official certification which is issued by certifying organizations known as [...] "Registrars". Several registrars also act as Notified Body. For those medical devices requiring the pre-market involvement of a Notified Body, the result of a positive assessment from the Notified Body is the certificate of conformity allowing the CE mark and the permission to sell the medical device in the European Union.A very careful assessment of the company Quality Management System by the Notified Body, together with the review of the required Technical Documentation, is a major element which the Notified Body takes into account to issue the certificate of conformity to the company product(s).|$|E

40|$|International audienceA liquid {{chromatography}} - high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1, G 2), ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins in wheat flour, barley flour and crisp bread has been developed. Data presented show {{the process of}} obtaining. Mycotoxin fragmentation patterns obtained by High Energy Collision Dissociation (HCD) have been investigated to obtain quantitative and confirmatory information (two characteristic masses per mycotoxin) using OrbitrapTM based high resolution mass spectrometry. LC-HRMS (full scan) detection carried out by HCD allowed to monitor the pseudo-molecular ion and an additional characteristic fragment (for each mycotoxin) with mass accuracy in the range 0. 1 - 3. 9 ppm, meeting the current <b>European</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> for LC-MS confirmatory analysis. A sample preparation procedure based on polymeric solid phase extraction cartridges was applied, allowing recoveries higher than 74 % for all tested toxins, with relative standard deviation lower than 13 %. Detection limits in the range 0. 5 - 3. 4 µg/kg were obtained for all tested matrices. A critical comparison between the proposed method and a validated method based on triple quadrupole mass spectrometry showed similar performances in terms of detection limits, recoveries and repeatability, and matrix effects. Based on an efficient sample extraction and clean up, the LC-HCD-HRMS method developed herein represents a reliable and robust alternative tool for mycotoxin analysis in food matrices as compared to well established triple quadrupole based approaches...|$|E
40|$|Background Efficacious {{and safe}} {{monotherapy}} options {{are needed for}} adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. As an adjunctive treatment for partial seizures, pregabalin compares favourably with lamotrigine and is an effective, approved treatment. We studied the efficacy and safety of pregabalin as monotherapy, using a design that complied with <b>European</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> and International League Against Epilepsy guidelines. Methods This phase 3, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin and lamotrigine monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed partial seizures at 105 centres, mostly in Europe and Asia. Randomisation to treatment groups (1 : 1 ratio) was by a computer-generated pseudorandom code (random permuted blocks), with patients sequentially assigned numbers by telephone. Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to the assigned treatment. After randomisation, patients were titrated to either 75 mg oral pregabalin or 50 mg oral lamotrigine twice daily during a 4 -week dose-escalation phase, followed by a 52 -week efficacy assessment phase during which the daily dose could be increased as needed {{to a maximum of}} 600 mg and 500 mg, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who remained seizure-free for 6 or more continuous months during the efficacy assessment phase; analysis included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment groups and received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00280059. Findings 660 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (330 pregabalin, 330 lamotrigine), of whom 622 entered the efficacy assessment phase (314 pregabalin, 308 lamotrigine). Fewer patients in the pregabalin group than in the lamotrigine group became seizure-free for 6 or more continuous months (162 [52...|$|E

40|$|Identification {{of serious}} adverse drug {{reactions}} (sADRS) associated with commonly used drugs can elude detection for years. Reye’s syndrome (RS), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) among {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) patients were recognized in 1951, 2000, and 1998, respectively. Reports associating these syndromes with aspirin, gadodiamide, and epoetin, were published 29, 6, and 4 years later, respectively. We obtained primary information from clinicians who identified causes of these sADRs and reviewed factors contributing to delayed identification of these toxicities. Overall, 3, 500 aspirin-associated RS cases in the United States, 1, 605 gadolinium-associated NSF cases, and 181 epoetin-associated PRCA cases were reported. Delays in FDA regulation of over-the- counter medications and administration of aspirin to children contributed to development of RS. For NSF, in 1996, the Danish Medicine Agency approved high-dose gadodiamide administration to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing MR scans. Overall, 88 % of Danish NSF cases were from two hospitals and 97 % of United States’ NSF cases were from 60 hospitals. These hospitals frequently administered high-doses of gadodiamide to CKD patients. Another factor was the decision to administer linear chelated contrast agents versus lower risk macrocyclic chelated agents. For PRCA, increased use of subcutaneous epoetin formulations to CKD patients, {{in part due to}} convenience and cost-savings considerations, and a <b>European</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirement</b> requiring removal of albumin as a stabilizer, led to toxicity. Overall, 81, 13, and 17 years elapsed between drug introduction into practice and identification of a causal relationship for aspirin, erythropoietin, and gadodiamide, respectively. A substantial decline in new cases of these sADRs occurred within two years of identification of the offending drug. Clinicians should be vigilant for sADRs, even for frequently-prescribed pharmaceuticals, particularly in settings where formulation or regulatory changes have occurred, or when over-the-counter, off-label, or pediatric use is common...|$|R
25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with <b>European</b> Union <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements.</b> Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine intake air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall warning horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEU Member States are in {{the process}} of {{transposing}} <b>European</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>requirements</b> that define the high-level conditions of a storage permit into their national laws. This regulatory framework defines a range of performance standards which recognise specific high-level uncertainties and long-term issues which storage developers will have to address. However, with one or two notable exceptions, the level of site characterisation required to obtain a storage permit has not been systematically evaluated. To determine the required geological site characterisation necessary to demonstrate adequate understanding of site performance, two storage case studies identify those issues that might remain challenging in the permitting process. These case studies, an onshore aquifer and an offshore multi-store site, produce credible dry-run storage permit applications from site geological characterisation activities, which are evaluated by a separate team, acting as a regulator. The applications, though necessarily reduced in scope from those anticipated for full storage projects, comprise the key elements of a permit. Issues identified during this process include:•Defining the storage complex boundaries, which for certain sites may be challenging, especially where expected pressure responses may extend for some distance or where lateral boundaries may not be clearly defined. We present examples of how these regulatory boundaries have been defined for the two case studies. •Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include a range of metrics against which site performance can be measured, both during the operational and closure phases, providing a basis for the design of the geological monitoring program and the corrective measures plan. Defining qualitative terms such as ‘expected’ or ‘acceptable’ in appropriate quantitative metrics has been attempted for site ‘sufficient’ measured, both during the operational and closure phases, providing a basis for the design of the geological monitoring program and the corrective measures plan-specific KPIs in the case studies described. Whilst it might be relatively straightforward to define qualitative indicators, we conclude that KPIs will need to be defined quantitatively for them to be the most effective...|$|E

40|$|Undoubtedly, {{the most}} {{important}} advance in the environmental regulatory monitoring of elements {{of the last decade}} is the widespread introduction of ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) due to standards developed by the European Committee for Standardization. The versatility of ICP-MS units as a tool for the determination of major, minor and trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Ti, V and Zn) in surface water, groundwater, river sediment, topsoil, subsoil, fine particulates and atmospheric deposition is illustrated in this paper. Ranges of background concentrations for major, minor and trace elements obtained from a regional case study (Flanders, Belgium) are summarized for all of these environmental compartments and discussed {{in the context of a}} harmonized implementation of <b>European</b> <b>regulatory</b> monitoring <b>requirements.</b> The results were derived from monitoring programs in support of EU environmental quality directives and were based on a selection of (non-polluted) background locations. Because of the availability of ICP-MS instruments nowadays, it can be argued that the main hindrance for meeting the European environmental monitoring requirements is no longer the technical feasibility of analysis at these concentration levels, but rather (i) potential contamination during sampling and analysis, (ii) too limited implementation of quality control programs, validating the routinely applied methods (including sampling and low level verification) and (iii) lack of harmonization in reporting of the chemical environmental status between the individual member states...|$|R
