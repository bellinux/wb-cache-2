[...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> {{see more and more}} of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam Raimi was {{repeatedly}} praised for his direction. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} film was [...] "lean, elegant, and emotionally complex – a marvel of backwoods classicism" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "proof that Raimi, after the splatterific Evil Dead series and the lushly operatic Darkman, has now grown into a filmmaker of ravishing maturity and skill." [...] Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, said that the film was [...] "an exceedingly well-directed genre picture by ... does an excellent job of presaging the lethal violence that follows. From his very first images we know that bodies are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> pile up." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film a [...] "quietly devastating thriller directed by ...who makes a flawless segue into mainstream storytelling." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "... for Raimi, whose mastery of visual effects has driven all of his previous films, A Simple Plan marks a tremendously successful break from the past. He's drawn lovely, complex performances from Paxton and Thornton and proven that he can work effectively – and movingly – in a minor emotional key." ...|$|E

500|$|As the storyline developed, it {{held the}} {{potential}} to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a [...] "good place" [...] and they think [...] "Amy's all happy." [...] The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a [...] "dark place" [...] as she is [...] "too young to be coping with something like this." [...] As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do [...] "something dangerous." [...] Though, Amy has Victoria {{to fall back on}} and is described as [...] "her rock". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives {{of a lot of people}} around Amy. At times he said the narrative is [...] "truly heart breaking" [...] and dangerous. [...] "I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> understand Amy an awful lot more." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> come out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{complained that}} because Pietersen changed {{from being a}} right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that [...] "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming {{will depend on the}} placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying [...] "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit {{to one side of the}} field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." [...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Stephen Shore's [...] "Factory: Andy Warhol," [...] "Andy and I {{were hanging}} around together. I had an {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for," [...] Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and {{was the son of}} a barber, recalled. [...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, I just got a new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E

She did not, she said, look upon a clandestine marriage as a happy resource.

She did not say what alternative she would choose in the event of her being unable to obtain her father's consent before his return. She did not suggest what was to become of her when Sir Marmaduke's leave of absence should be expired.

No studies have been made on extra customizations and special needs that is linked with physical education or teacher’s definitions and experiences of extra customizations and special need which gave the study relevance. The study has been implemented with a didactic theory. The material has been collected through semi structured interviews. The material has then been analyzed with a content analysis where the didactic questions what, how and why {{has been used to}} categorizing the material. The study showed that the teachers experiences of extra customization is small customizations in the lessons of physical education. Many teachers don’t experience that they make customizations when their educating but the teachers say that individualization is important in physical education. Some teachers realized under the interviews that they were making customizations in their ordinary teaching.
