5|$|Laborintus II is a 2012 album by Belgian {{orchestra}} <b>Ictus</b> Ensemble, vocal group Nederlands Kamerkoor and American vocalist Mike Patton. It is {{a recording}} of the 1965 work {{of the same name}} by Italian composer Luciano Berio, which featured lyrics taken from fellow Italian Edoardo Sanguineti's 1956 poem Laborintus. The performance was recorded live at the 2010 Holland Festival.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ictus</b> marks {{above are}} placed in {{accordance}} with the word-accents, rather than on the second half of each foot as is sometimes done.|$|E
25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the <b>ictus</b> was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the <b>ictus,</b> Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|Here, the two {{instances}} of <b>ictuses</b> {{moved to the}} right tend to set a deliberate pace, whereas the following two {{instances of}} <b>ictuses</b> moved to the left suggest an abrupt rhythm.|$|R

5000|$|A reader's {{sense of}} meter usually arises chiefly from {{stresses}} {{inherent in the}} text. Line ten provides {{a case in which}} the reader's sense of meter must condition the accents applied to the text. Without the benefit of reading ahead to the eleventh line, a neutral prose reading of second half of line 10 would observe stresses on the words [...] "love" [...] and [...] "fair". However this does not produce a well-formed pentameter line. A sensitive reader will place an accent on [...] "my" [...] which in turn will allow <b>ictuses</b> to rest on [...] "my" [...] and [...] "is", producing the well-formed iambic pentameter scanned below, even before the textual reason for the contrastive accent on [...] "my" [...] (as compared to [...] "any mother's") is understood: ...|$|R
25|$|The first <b>ictus</b> of line 10 {{might be}} placed {{on any of the}} first three syllables, {{depending}} on the shade of meaning intended by the reader.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{even though}} both lines begin {{with a series of}} long syllables, it is {{immediately}} obvious on reading them that the first is iambic and second trochaic. Those who argue that there is no <b>ictus</b> say that, given that there is generally a word-break (caesura) after the 5th element of the iambic senarius, the word accents tend to fall naturally on the second and fourth elements rather than on the anceps elements. In the final metron, there is often a clash between <b>ictus</b> and accent.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} has an initial reversal, and concludes with the fourth <b>ictus</b> {{moving to the}} right (resulting in a four-position figure, ××//, {{sometimes}} referred to as a minor ionic).|$|E
40|$|Do {{generalized}} tonic-clonic seizures {{in infancy}} exist? Christian Korff, MD; and Douglas R. Nordli, Jr., MD Abstract—Objective: To determine {{the frequency of}} generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in infants (1 month to 2 years). Methods: From a total of 2, 112 patients monitored in our video-EEG lab from May 2000 through January 2005, 109 distinct seizures in 77 infants were reviewed. Eight events in eight patients {{were excluded because of}} video files insufficiently reliable to determine the clinical characteristics with precision. The clinical manifestations and electro-graphic features of the remaining 101 seizures in 69 infants were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The authors did not observe a single GTCS. Four patients had <b>icti</b> that resembled GTCS, but careful analysis of these episodes revealed that three of them had a focal onset and that the fourth had a slightly different sequence of events. Conclusions: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are rarely, if ever, seen in infants younger than age 2 in a tertiary-care pediatric epilepsy unit. Instead, they more commonly occur in older children, particularly in the well-characterized epilepsy syndromes of childhood and adolescence.

Slovene {{free verse}} {{in the first}} third of the 20 th century. - The cult of the new, which was {{initiated}} in European culture {{at the turn of}} the century, is also seen in the invention of new verse forms. The predominant forms in Slovene poetry of the 19 th century were regular accentual-syllabis and strict-stress meters (the first posotopn in the verse is weak, while the intervals between <b>icti</b> are mono- or disyllabicstrict-stress meters account for abouth fifth of the output). Irregular accentual-syllabic meters also occurred occasionally (Levstik, Gregorčič) : classical lines of varying lenght, but in the same meter occur in unpredictable succession (e. g. 5 -, 6 -, 8 -, 11 -syllabic amphibrachs). Irregular strict-stress meter, the irregular intertwining of one- to four-ictic lines was, however, very rarethis occuredonly in Levstik 2 ̆ 7 s and Stritar 2 ̆ 7 s work. In the Slovene moderna the number of modifications of classical forms increased: a) new kinds of irregular iamb and amphibrach (a mixture of classical and extra-long lines), the contrasting of short and long lines, the breaking of classical measures into various verses (e. g. On the Market, Na trgu, by Kette) b) irregular accentual-syllabic verse, where iambic and trochaic, and amphibrach and dactylic lines are intertwined (A. Vodnik, F. Albrecht) c) the experiment with irregular strict-stress meter was renewed and given new forms: lines of up to six <b>icti,</b> the first position in the verse is strong (Župančič). Only on the rare occasions are there experiments with free verse in the moderna. Such free verse sometimes does not rhyme and is either syntagmatic (borders of verse-lines coincide with borders of syntagmas/phrases, one sentence running over a few verses: Of the Holy Spirit, O svetem duhu, by Župančič), or sentential (borders of verse-lines coincide with borders of sentences: Spring Romance, Pomladanska romanca, by Murn). Poems which are not devided into stanzas, and poems which have stanzas of various length are predominant. The continuous development of free verse begins between 1913 and 1917 with Joža Lovrenčič, who used sentential free verse. He wrote poly-type verses (accentual-syllabics and free verse within the same poem), which later occurs in Jarc 2 ̆ 7 s plays. In the 2 ̆ 7 Twenties, sentential free verse was predominant, withtypical parallelism as the rhythmic factor in Seliškar 2 ̆ 7 s work. Syntagmatic free verse is rarely in use, but we can find it in Kosovel 2 ̆ 7 s work. Anti-syntactic free verse (borders of verse-lines are within syntagmas, and the sentence borders thus within versesenjambment is the foundation of such verse) occurs in the thirties in Kocbek 2 ̆ 7 s writings...|$|R

25|$|Further {{emphasizing}} and {{elevating the}} artistry {{of the language}} of the plays of Plautus is the use of meter, which simply put is the rhythm of the play. There seems to be great debate over whether Plautus found favor in strong word accent or verse <b>ictus,</b> stress. Plautus did not follow the meter of the Greek originals that he adapted for the Roman audience. Plautus used a great number of meters, but most frequently he used the trochaic septenarius. Iambic words, though common in Latin, are difficult to fit in this meter, and naturally occur at the end of verses. G.B. Conte has noted that Plautus favors the use of cantica instead of Greek meters. This vacillation between meter and word stress highlights the fact that Latin literature was still in its infancy, and that there was not yet a standard way to write verse.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{live at the}} Holland Festival on June18, 2010, in the Muziekgebouw aan'tIJ. The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian <b>Ictus</b> Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by <b>Ictus</b> Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Loïc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player Géry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. Patton has said of the work, [...] "I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as I can to Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized... Maybe because of the language barrier, maybe because it’s not easily understood. Berio, who was teaching in California when he wrote this piece, was listening to jazz, pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Review aggregation website Metacritic awarded it an average score of 58 out of 100, based on eight reviews. Writing for The A.V. Club, Chris Mincher rated the album B−, calling it [...] "challenging, uncompromising, and bordering on inaccessible". Mincher {{felt that the}} album was abstract and difficult but contained [...] "hidden payoffs" [...] to reward repeated hearings. He called Patton's arrangements [...] "haunting" [...] and [...] "wraithlike". AllRovi's Thom Jurek rated the album 3.5 stars out of 5, describing the recording as [...] "a very nearly dazzling endeavor that rewards patience mightily". Jurek felt that, as an album, Laborintus II was difficult to grasp at first, {{by virtue of being}} a recording of theatrical music, but he praised the performance of <b>Ictus</b> Ensemble, writing of their [...] "bracing freshness and mischievous glee". Eli Kleman of Sputnikmusic rated it 3.5 out of 5, finding it [...] "fascinating if not unwieldy". He felt that Laborintus II was perhaps Patton's most ambitious album to date, but noted that the musician has previously produced similarly avant-garde records in the past. Kleman described the composition as [...] "somber, beautiful, and ominous, but always affecting".|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} accents above {{indicate}} the presumed underlying <b>ictūs</b> or [...] "beats", {{not necessarily the}} stressed syllables. (As noted above, the existence of <b>ictus</b> is not accepted by all scholars.) Where the word accent {{is at odds with}} the <b>ictus,</b> it is more natural to follow the accent (just as is the case when reading Virgil). Occasionally, however, an apparent clash between <b>ictus</b> and accent may indicate the actual pronunciation; for example, it is believed that the phrase volŭptás mea [...] "my darling" [...] was pronounced with the accent on -tas. Similarly, vae miseró mihi [...] "o wretched me!" [...] appears to have been pronounced with the accent on -ro.|$|E

2500|$|Other Roman {{writers who}} wrote anapaests, such as Seneca and Boethius, also {{regularly}} placed the word-accent on {{the beginning of}} each foot. Whether Roman poets wrote anapaests without regard for <b>ictus,</b> or whether the Roman anapaest differed from the Greek in that the <b>ictus</b> came on {{the beginning of each}} foot, as in the trochaic metre, is unclear. For this reason, the <b>ictus</b> has not been marked in the samples below. Certainly, some half lines (such as | u u – u u – | u u – – – |) are identical in the trochaic and the anapaestic metres; and the tendency to form [...] "square" [...] verses is another point in common with the trochaic metre.|$|E
2500|$|In Greek anapaestic poetry it is {{generally}} assumed that the verse-ictus was heard on {{the second half of}} the foot. However, in Plautus, except in {{the second half of the}} anapaestic septenarius, the word-stress generally comes on the first half of each foot. For those scholars who believe there was no <b>ictus</b> in ancient poetry, this presents no problem; the fact that each metron usually ends with a word-break automatically means that the stress will be heard on the early part of the feet. But for those that support the idea of <b>ictus,</b> it does present a problem. As Lindsay puts it, [...] "It seems difficult to believe that the same poet, who in other metres so successfully reconciles accent with <b>ictus,</b> should tolerate lines like: ...|$|E

Similarly in the line quoted below, the long word legionibus, with its coincidence of <b>ictus</b> and accent, filling the third metron, makes up {{for the fact that the}} word-accent of praefectust clashes with the ictus: ...|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{controversy}} among scholars over whether Greek and Latin verse had a regular [...] "beat" [...] (<b>ictus)</b> like modern western music. On one side, supporting {{the idea of}} <b>ictus,</b> are scholars such as W. Sidney Allen, Lionel Pearson, and from an earlier generation Wallace Lindsay. [...] However, many scholars, such as Paul Maas, Italian Plautus expert Cesare Questa, and the Loeb edition editor Wolfgang de Melo argue {{that there was no}} beat or [...] "ictus"; in their view, rhythm is [...] "simply the regulated sequence of short and long syllables". Similarly, Benjamin Fortson writes: [...] "The theory that there was a verse-ictus, never universally accepted, has by now been thoroughly discredited." [...] Gratwick, in his edition of the Menaechmi, takes an intermediate position, rejecting [...] "both the Anglo-German view that the lines are isochronous with a regular metrical beat attached to every longum, and the Franco-Italian view that there is no <b>ictus</b> at all in such verses".|$|E
