25|$|With Florida constituting a major {{component}} of the geographic range of this butterfly, the migration pattern of gulf fritillaries in Florida <b>is</b> <b>well-documented.</b> In Florida, gulf fritillaries have two major flights during the year. The first major migration involves huge populations of butterflies flying northward while the second migration involves the butterflies moving southward throughout the state, especially throughout the peninsular parts of Florida. The first and second migrations occur in the spring and the fall, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and {{the value}} of {{adaptability}} and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects. Beyond the rationale, there <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> empirical evidence of communication related to tasks; examples include the waggle dance of honey bee foragers, trail marking by ant foragers such as the red harvester ants, and the propagation via pheromones of an alarm state in Africanized honey bees.|$|E

25|$|Downing was {{undoubtedly}} {{a man of}} great political, diplomatic, and financial ability, but his character has often been maligned by his enemies because of his willingness {{to make the most of}} changing political circumstances, and to brutally betray former comrades in order to win favour from his current masters. Today his reputation is undergoing a revision among scholars of the period as his contributions as a financial reformer and diplomat are again recognised. On the other hand, one of his many less attractive personal qualities – miserliness – <b>is</b> <b>well-documented.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is also {{believed}} {{that the reason for}} the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is due to shoreline erosion. Since all that was found was a rustic looking fort on the north shore, and this location <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> and backed up, it is believed that the settlement must have been nearby. The northern shore, between 1851 and 1970, lost 928 feet because of erosion. If in the years leading up to and following the brief life of the settlement at Roanoke, shoreline erosion was following the same trend, it is likely the site of the dwellings is underwater, along with any artifacts or signs of life. Archaeological investigations continue to find tantalizing clues and funding is being sought to continue recent excavations.|$|E
25|$|Mahipala II, the {{successor}} of Vigrahapala III, brought a short-lived reign of military glory. His reign <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> by Sandhyakar Nandi in Ramacharitam. Mahipala II imprisoned his brothers Ramapala and Surapala II, on {{the suspicion that}} they were conspiring against him. Soon afterwards, he faced a rebellion of vassal chiefs from the Kaibarta (fishermen). A chief named Divya (or Divvoka) killed him and occupied the Varendra region. The region remained {{under the control of}} his successors Rudak and Bhima. Surapala II escaped to Magadha and died after a short reign. He was succeeded by his brother Ramapala, who launched a major offensive against Divya's grandson Bhima. He was supported by his maternal uncle Mathana of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, as well as several feudatory chiefs of south Bihar and south-west Bengal. Ramapala conclusively defeated Bhima, and killing him and his family in a cruel manner.|$|E

25|$|Edible insects {{have long}} been used by ethnic groups in Asia, Africa, Mexico and South America as cheap and {{sustainable}} sources of protein, and the major role of entomophagy in human food security <b>is</b> <b>well-documented.</b> Up to 2,086 species are eaten by 3,071 ethnic groups in 130 countries. While more attention is needed to fully assess the potential of edible insects, they provide a natural source of essential carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins and offer an opportunity {{to bridge the gap}} in protein consumption between poor and wealthy nations but also to lessen the Ecological footprint. Many insects contain abundant stores of lysine, an amino acid deficient in the diets of many people who depend heavily on grain. Some argue that the combination of increasing land use pressure, climate change, and food grain shortages due to the use of corn as a biofuel feedstock will cause serious challenges for attempts to meet future protein demand.|$|E
500|$|According to a {{scholarly}} theory, the name [...] "Bolokhoveni" [...] may have derived from Voloch, the East Slavic term for Romanians, or Vlachs. If this theory is correct, the Bolokhoveni were Romanians {{living in the}} western regions of Kievan Rus'. Place names, hydronyms, and personal names of Romanian origin abound in written sources relating to those regions. However, this theory is contradicted by archaeological evidence, which indicates that the Bolokhoveni's material culture resembled that of its contemporaries in the western parts of Kievan Rus'. Furthermore, it <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> that the Bolokhoveni princes had family ties with boyars of the Principality of Halych.|$|E
500|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> {{compared}} to most other extinct Caribbean macaws, {{since it was}} mentioned and described by several contemporary writers. Parrots {{thought to be the}} Lesser Antillean macaw were first mentioned by the Spanish historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in 1553, referring to a 1496 account by the Spanish bibliographer Ferdinand Columbus, who mentioned chicken-sized parrots—which the Island Caribs called [...] "Guacamayas"—in Guadeloupe. In 1774, the French naturalist Comte de Buffon stated that the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus had found macaws in Guadeloupe. The French botanist Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre gave the first detailed descriptions in 1654 and 1667, and illustrated the bird and other animals found in Guadeloupe. The French clergyman Jean-Baptiste Labat also described the bird in 1742. Writers such as George Edwards and John Latham also mentioned the presence of red and blue macaws on the islands off America.|$|E

500|$|Contemporaneous letters {{unanimously}} {{described the}} revolt as a peasant war against their lords. On 22 July 1437, the judge royal, Stephen Báthory, {{referred to the}} Transylvanian events as the [...] "peasants' war"; on 30 September, Roland Lépes mentioned that a nobleman had been wounded [...] "in the general fight against the peasantry"; and Bishop Lépes wrote of the [...] "war of the peasants" [...] on 27 January 1439. Other documents (including {{the records of the}} meetings of the town council of Nagyenyed) emphasized that craftsmen and townspeople also joined the revolt. No contemporaneous source recorded that national hatreds played any role in the uprising. On the contrary, the cooperation of the Hungarian and Vlach commoners during the rebellion <b>is</b> <b>well-documented.</b> The first compromise between the rebels and the noblemen explicitly mentioned their common grievances. For instance, the rebels complained that [...] "both the Hungarians and the Vlachs who lived near castles" [...] had arbitrarily been compelled to pay the tithes on their swines and bees.|$|E
500|$|Many historians {{debate the}} {{reliability}} of the reports of the Gesta concerning Menumorut and the other opponents of the Magyars who are not named in other primary sources. Kristó writes that Anonymus, who had little information of the real conditions of the Carpathian Basin around 900, could only turn [...] "to one thing when he outlined the history of the Hungarian conquest: his own imagination," [...] and György Györffy says that Menumorut was one of the personalities whom Anonymus invented and named after a location. The existence of two villages named [...] "Morut's house" [...] (Marótlaka in Hungarian) and a clan Morut in Bihar County in the 13th century <b>is</b> <b>well-documented,</b> proving that at least one Morut had settled in this region. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes that the majority of events that the Gesta mentions in connection with Menumorut are [...] "a simple repetition, with variants" [...] of the story of Salan in the same chronicle, showing that Anonymus [...] "had little material on which to work" [...] when writing about Menumorut. Historian Ryszard Grzesik says that Menumorut [...] "never existed and never ruled over Bihar", but [...] "it was not an invented person". He writes that Menumorut's name derived from the Turkic adjective ménü ("great") and the Moravians' Hungarian exonym, marót, thus he says that Menumorut was the [...] "personification" [...] of Svatopluk I of Moravia.|$|E
500|$|While some of {{the larger}} mines {{provided}} separate eating areas for bal maidens, others obliged male and female workers to eat together, a cause of consternation among some observers concerned that exposure to the [...] "coarse joking" [...] and [...] "rude behaviour" [...] of men had a negative effect on the [...] "modesty and delicacy" [...] expected of women. Other contemporary concerns were that heavy protective clothing led them to be unfeminine, that working in the constant view of men caused the bal maidens to have an unhealthy interest in their own appearance and attractiveness, that spending long hours at work meant {{that they did not have}} time to learn the skills to be good housewives. [...] (Barham's 1841 investigations found no evidence to the claim that bal maidens grew up to be poor housewives, concluding that [...] "they are for the most part tender mothers and industrious wives [...] the laborious occupations to which they have been inured make household duties appear comparatively light".) Other contemporary observers noted that bal maidens were generally good natured and well behaved, and often devoutly religious, but it <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> that bal maidens typically took great pride in their own appearance and clothing. Many contemporary observers commented on the high fashion of the clothing worn by bal maidens on Sundays and holidays; although the disposable income of a bal maiden was low, they would sometimes form [...] "dress clubs" [...] to buy fashionable clothing which they would take turns wearing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, this hotel was {{considered}} one of the most fashionable in the city; its lodgings and restaurant were patronized by politicians and high-ranking military officers. [...] Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, Commanding General of the United States Army William Tecumseh Sherman, and Rear Admiral Samuel Rhoads Franklin all lived there for a time. It <b>is</b> <b>well-documented</b> that President Ulysses S. Grant and President Andrew Johnson both dined in the restaurant frequently, as did abolitionist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher. Future president William McKinley and his wife lived there from 1877 to 1890, during his entire congressional career. He dined almost nightly with his wife in the restaurant. His close friend, Representative and later President James A. Garfield, visited McKinley often in the hotel. McKinley departed from the hotel for his presidential inaugural. Presidents Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Warren G. Harding all drank in the bar there. Chief Justice of the United States Salmon P. Chase lived there while working in the capital (and died there in October 1886). Rear Admiral John Lee Davis also lived and died there. William Howard Taft lived there from 1890 to 1892 when he was United States Solicitor General.|$|E
