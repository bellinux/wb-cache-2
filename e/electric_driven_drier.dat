40|$|A Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) utilises an <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> and a {{conventional}} {{internal combustion engine}} to achieve increased fuel economy and/or performance. The architecture of the vehicle, and the design focus, significantly affects the demands made on the <b>electric</b> <b>drive.</b> These demands are typically expressed as the <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> duty, in terms of motor speed and torque. This duty can therefore vary significantly for the architecture and vehicle drive cycle selected and {{can have an impact}} on <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> technology selection. For any given vehicle, there is no simple <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> rating calculation for the range of hybrid vehicle architectures possible. However, the duty on the <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> can be determined by a consideration of the whole vehicle power demand. A powertrain simulation model has been used to determine this power demand made on the two sources of traction power, the internal combustion engine and the <b>electric</b> <b>drive,</b> {{as a result of the}} required vehicle dynamics, given by drive cycle velocity and acceleration demand. This model can therefore determine the duty on the <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> and consequent physical size and rating of the <b>electric</b> <b>drives</b> employed in a selection of different architectures in a given vehicle. In this paper, preliminary results are presented showing the variation in <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> duty for four architectures with fixed vehicle parameters, over a specified drive cycle.
