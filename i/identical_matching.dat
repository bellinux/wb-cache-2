5000|$|Some {{automotive}} historians {{say that}} the term originated with stolen vehicles being refitted with another engine and repainted. In {{the early days of}} automobile manufacturing there was no <b>identical</b> <b>matching</b> transmission, body frame, and engine numbers. It was possible to change engines and repaint the car or truck and in effect turn it into a different vehicle and thus it became near impossible to prove that the vehicle was stolen. The term [...] "hot" [...] was equivalent to being stolen. The term [...] "rod" [...] was equivalent to any motorized vehicle. Even today, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment in its vehicle emissions regulations, refers to a [...] "hotrod" [...] as any motorized vehicle that has a replacement engine differing from the factory original. Another possible origin includes replacement of the camshaft with a new ("hotter") version, sometimes known as a hot stick or hot rod. Roadsters were the cars of choice because they were light, easy to modify, and inexpensive. The term became commonplace in the 1930s or 1940s as the name of a car that had been [...] "hopped up" [...] by modifying the engine for higher performance. A term common in the early days was [...] "gow job". This has fallen into disuse except with historians.|$|E

In this tool, when opening the source file and applying the translation memory so that any [...] "100% matches" [...] (<b>identical</b> <b>matches)</b> or [...] "fuzzy matches" [...] (similar, but not <b>identical</b> <b>matches)</b> within the text are instantly extracted and placed within the target file. Then, the [...] "matches" [...] suggested by the translation memory can be either accepted or overridden with new alternatives. If a translation unit is manually updated, then it is stored within the translation memory for future use {{as well as for}} repetition in the current text. In a similar way, all segments in the target file without a [...] "match" [...] would be translated manually and then automatically added to the translation memory. Another significant milestone of TMS is the projects at IBM's European Language Services (Denmark) in which massive translation memory were used to remove language barrier.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{pattern is}} an entity, imprecisely described, {{that could be}} given a name, fingerprint, image, {{handwritten}} word, human face, speech signal, DNA sequence etc. Pattern recognition is the allocation of a label to a given input value. Pattern recognition algorithms usually intend to supply a logical answer for all probable inputs and to perform "most likely " and <b>identical</b> <b>matching</b> of the inputs, taking into account their statistical discrepancy. Pattern recognition is becoming ever more significant {{in the era of}} automation and information handling and retrieval. In order to categorize a set of objects and afterward on to identify a fresh or an already known one, one needs to gather, examine, store and process data in a significant way. Among the different conventional approaches of pattern recognition the statistical approach has been most thoroughly studied and used in practice. More recently, the addition of artificial neural network techniques theory have been receiving important considerations...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial cyanobacterial strains were {{isolated}} from the Nishihara campus of the University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. The 13 sampling sites were distributed in a 200 m radius and appeared as dry, blackened stains. From these small areas, 143 cyanobacterial strains were established. The strains were divided into five morphotypes, including unicells, unicells with baeocytes, non-branching filaments, false-branching filaments, and heterocystous strains. From the strains, 105 partial 16 S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and could be classified into 30 generic types. Among them, 22 unique strains and over 1100 bps of data were selected for further phylogenetic analyses. These sequences were positioned into six main clades corresponding to cyanobacterial orders: Nostocales, Chroococidiopsidales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales, Pleurocapsales, and Synechococcales. Almost all sequences had no <b>identical</b> <b>matching</b> data in GenBank {{and many of them}} had no closely related data. These data suggest that the terrestrial cyanobacteria are very divese even within close sampling areas, such as within the campus of the University of the Ryukyus.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} cannabinoid from the plant Cannabis sativa. There is only equivocal evidence that THC has analgesic effects. We performed a phase 2 controlled trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of an oral tablet containing purified THC in patients with chronic abdominal pain. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with chronic abdominal pain for 3 months or more (numeric rating scale scores of 3 or more) after surgery or because of chronic pancreatitis {{were randomly assigned to}} groups given the THC tablet or <b>identical</b> <b>matching</b> placebos for 50 - 52 days. Subjects in the THC group were given the tablet first in a step-up phase (3 mg 3 times daily for 5 days and then 5 mg 3 times daily for 5 days), followed by a stable dose phase (8 mg 3 times daily until days 50 - 52). Preceding and during the entire study period, patients were asked to continue taking their medications (including analgesics) according to prescription. Patients reported any additional pain medications in a diary. Efficacy and safety assessments were conducted preceding medication intake (day 1), after 15 days, and at 50 - 52 days. Plasma samples were collected on study days 1, 15, and 50 - 52; mean plasma concentration curves of THC and 11 -OH-THC were plotted. The primary end point was pain relief, which was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of the mean pain (VAS mean scores) on the basis of information from patient diaries. Secondary end points included pain and quality of life (determined from patient questionnaires), pharmacokinetics, and safety. RESULTS: At days 50 - 52, VAS mean scores did not differ significantly between the THC and placebo groups (F 1, 46 = 0. 016; P =. 901). Between the start and end of the study, VAS mean scores decreased by 1. 6 points (40 %) in the THC group compared with 1. 9 points (37 %) in the placebo group. No differences were observed in secondary outcomes. Oral THC was generally well-absorbed. Seven patients in the THC group stopped taking the tablets because of adverse events, compared with 2 patients in the placebo group. All (possibly) related adverse events were mild or moderate. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 study, we found no difference between a THC tablet and a placebo tablet in reducing pain measures in patients with chronic abdominal pain. THC, administered 3 times daily, was safe and well-tolerated during a 50 -day to 52 -day treatment period. ClinicalTrials. gov number: NCT 01562483 and NCT 01551511...|$|E
40|$|Ten studies {{reported}} in this thesis outline {{the development of a}} behavioural test for assessing the role of verbal behaviour in identifying personal and social histories. The testing format was developed by employing the Stimulus Equivalence paradigm (Sidman, 1971) and extending upon the previous work of Watt, Keenan, Barnes and Cairns (1991). Chapter 1 presents a review of the behavioural literature concerned with stimulus equivalence and derived stimulus relations. Most importantly, a seminal study by Watt et al. (1991) is outlined. In that study, a simple stimulus equivalence paradigm was used {{to take advantage of the}} fact that people in Northern Ireland often respond to each other’s names as indicative of religious background. Specifically, the researchers attempted to teach subjects the necessary baseline conditional discriminations to form two equivalence classes that were incongruent with the subject’s social history. Watt et al. (1991) concluded subjects’ personal and social histories interfere with their ability to derive specific equivalence relations in the laboratory. The relevance of this paradigm to all of the experimental work {{reported in this}} thesis is outlined. Chapter 2 reports on two experiments (Experiments 1 & 2) that tested the applicability of the Watt et al. paradigm as a tool for assessing personal and social histories as discussed in Chapter 1. In Experiment 1, a novel Yes/No procedure was employed in a controlled experimental laboratory preparation to create and test for social histories. This novel YES/NO procedure required subjects to respond to two stimuli in the presence of the question “Do they go together” by clicking on either a Yes or No button on a computer screen. Experiment 2 involved an experiment that expanded upon this technique by applying this novel Yes/No adaptation of the Watt et al. paradigm in an effort to assess the social categorisation of real-world terms by men and women from the general population. Both studies demonstrated the applicability of the adapted Watt et al. paradigm in assessing both laboratory-controlled and real-world social and personal histories. In Chapter 3, Experiment 3 explored the possibility of assessing differences in social history when using a novel instruction-based relational test. The test measure was capable of identifying subjects’ laboratory created histories on the basis of response accuracy differentials across the test blocks in the absence of the equivalence training used in the Watt et al. Paradigm. That is, in place of equivalence training, subjects were presented with onscreen instructions informing them which stimuli to “put together” in the relevant phase of the test. Subjects were then presented with two test blocks, accompanied by different matching instructions. These blocks consisted of matching tasks involving the presentation of word pairs and in which responses to the Yes or No buttons were required. One set of rules was congruent with the subjects’ personal/social history and the other set was incongruent with the subjects’ personal/social history. This greatly modified Watt et al. procedure did not require equivalence training, but nevertheless successfully identified subjects’ social and personal histories. In Chapter 4, the relational test procedure (described in Chapter 3) was modified slightly and applied in a real-world setting to examine and identify the use of socially sensitive verbal relations within a series of different populations. This was explored across 2 experiments (Experiments 4 & 5). Experiment 4 demonstrated the utility of the current testing procedure in detecting cultural differences across populations with regard to the historical categorisation of socially sensitive stimuli relevant to the issue of homosexuality and homophobia. The test format was modified in that subjects no longer responded using the onscreen YES and NO keys, but by pressing either a Blue or Red button onscreen in place of YES and NO, respectively. In this experiment, homosexual males from the USA and Ireland completed the modified relational test procedure consisting of two test blocks. Each block consisted of <b>identical</b> <b>matching</b> tasks but was accompanied by a distinct set of instructions. One set of instructions was congruent with the subjects’ history (i. e., gay goes with good) while the other was incongruent (i. e., gay goes with bad). The test was successful in identifying the cultural background of subjects taking the test. A slight modification of the foregoing procedure in Experiment 5 gave rise to similar results with regard to female subjects’ categorisation of terms relating to children and sex. That is, when the relational test procedure was presented as before, but with subjects responding using keys on the keyboard, female subjects 2 ̆ 7 fluency in associating child and sex terms was lower than their fluency in relating adult and sexual terms. That is, when instructed matching was congruent with the female subjects’ personal and social histories (i. e. child goes with nonsexual) response accuracies were greater than when matching instructions were incongruent (i. e. child goes with sexual). In Chapter 5, the experimental focus moved towards the use of a single stimulus onscreen rather than stimulus pairs. This represented a radical departure from the procedure used in Chapters 2 - 4. Specifically, subjects were no longer required to explicitly match the stimuli onscreen in relation to each other. Instead, Experiment 6 sought to assess the rate of acquisition of common response functions to words considered compatible for a normal population compared to words considered incompatible for a normal population. The experiment identified gender differences in the rate of acquisition of common stimulus functions for members of distinct (e. g., child and sexual) and common (e. g., adult and sexual) verbal relations. In Chapter 6, a laboratory analogue of the new single stimulus test procedure was developed. This was developed in tandem with a behavioural analysis of the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) due to the topographical similarity of both measures. Specifically, Chapter 6 examined the IAT test format in terms of behavioural processes whilst also providing a laboratory analysis of the current test procedure using arbitrary laboratory created stimuli across a series of experiments (Experiments 7, 8, 9 & 10). Chapter 6 showed that a laboratory history of respondent conditioning and derived relational responding is sufficient in generating an IAT effect. In addition, this effect is malleable depending on the type of stimulus equivalence testing employed (i. e., symmetry and transitivity combined, transitivity alone, or no test). Chapter 7 provides a summary of the entire research program presented in the thesis, and reviews the development of a functionally-understood model of the IAT. Some important empirical and conceptual issues that arise from the various findings are also outlined. Finally, the relationship of the current research to work outside the field of behaviour analysis is considered...|$|E

However, these events occur {{too late in}} the MLC to permit prospective matching for cadaveric renal transplantation. Presentation of allogeneic cells to the T lymphocyte within the MLC results in the emergence of an insulin receptor pharmacokinetically similar to that on other tissues such as fat, liver, and muscle. Intrafamilial MLC were studied by simultaneous assessment of DNA synthesis and insulin receptor binding. In 68 studies from seven families that provide examples of two haplotype <b>identical</b> <b>matches,</b> haplo-identical matches and total haplo mismatches, the presence of an insulin receptor correlated in every case with a positive MLC as estimated by [3 H]thymidine incorporation. A quantitative relationship existed between the strength of the MLC and the amount of receptor binding. Based on analysis of cells from several families in which crossover events were known to have occurred, the appearance of an insulin receptor always corresponded with a mismatch at the portion of histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) chromosome bearing the D region. Finally, it was demonstrated in each of 30 cultures that insulin receptor emergence occurred significantly before detectable DNA synthesis, as early as 24 h after the initiation of the MLC, well within the time-constraint limitations for renal preservation.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from 19 electrode sites in eight participants. In all the frequency bands and electrode sites, results revealed that there was no significant differences in EEG cortical activity between the observation condition and the execution conditions. Comparison of the two stages of the movement (i. e., pre-movement and movement) in the observation and execution conditions showed, in most cases, that pre-movement ERD values were less than movement ERD values.
