5|$|Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) copes {{with her}} failed {{marriage}} to Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.). She tries to move on, but mementos {{of the past}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> her. Her best friend Will (Eric McCormack) tries to help her but to no avail. While at dinner with his boyfriend Vince (Bobby Cannavale), and Vince's superior officer, Grace calls him, displeasing Vince. Believing that Grace might be suicidal, Will leaves to attend to her. Vince shows up at Will and Grace's apartment to confront her, telling her that she is affecting his relationship with Will because she is too needy. This prompts Grace and Vince to bicker, with the two asking Will to choose between them. He cannot choose between them as Grace is his long-time friend, but he also cares for Vince. The episode concludes with him telling Vince {{that he wants to}} work things out, but before they can discuss it, Vince sees Grace's wedding album, resulting in him being more focused on the album than the relationship.|$|E

25|$|These {{differences}} {{are not merely}} external, but a core aspect of military life. Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers are afraid to upset the officers. The physical separation and differences between available activities make it very difficult. Most military brats {{on a personal level}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's pay grade or rank.|$|E

Arafat became the first representative of a non-governmental organization to address a plenary session of the UN General Assembly. In his United Nations address, Arafat condemned Zionism, but said, [...] "Today I have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter's gun. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> the olive branch fall from my hand." [...] He wore a holster throughout his speech, although it did not contain a gun. His speech increased international sympathy for the Palestinian cause.|$|E

500|$|An-Nasir Muhammad died in June 1341. His reign {{was marked}} by a {{centralization}} of autocratic power in the Mamluk Sultanate. Shortly before his death, an-Nasir Muhammad discussed his succession with his two senior emirs, Qawsun and Bashtak. The latter supported Ahmad's nomination, but Qawsun supported Ahmad's younger brother Abu Bakr. An-Nasir Muhammad also favored Abu Bakr and believed Ahmad was unfit to rule. He rejected Bashtak's suggestion, stating [...] "As for Ahmad, who is in al-Karak, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> him cross [...] Egypt; do not put him in charge of anything, because he would cause the ruin of the state!" [...] Following an-Nasir Muhammad's death, In May or June 1341, Abu Bakr was proclaimed sultan, but was virtually a ceremonial ruler, with Qawsun holding the reins of power as mudabbir al-dawla (organizer of the state), in effect the strongman of Egypt. He imprisoned Abu Bakr in the Upper Egyptian city of Qus where he was executed on trumped up charges of frivolity. Qawsun thereafter arranged for an-Nasir Muhammad's five-year-old son, al-Ashraf Kujuk, to be declared sultan, further consolidating Qawsun's power.|$|E
500|$|Nurmi {{felt that}} he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman, but his {{interest}} in running never died. He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in {{a benefit for the}} victims of the Greek Civil War. Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club. In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: [...] "The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'" [...] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something. Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala. He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.|$|E

500|$|With Karmal's {{ascension}} to power, Parchamites {{began to}} [...] "settle old scores". Revolutionary Troikas {{were created to}} arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin's guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and Karmal replied, [...] "As long as you keep my hands bound and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> me deal with the Khalq faction {{there will be no}} unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party..." [...] Amin's daughter, along with her baby, was imprisoned for twelve years, until Mohammad Najibullah, then leader of the PDPA, released her. When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only technocrats, opportunists and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the Ministry of Interior, but Parchamites were given control over KHAD and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal's three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the Ministry of Communications and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the PDPA Central Committee. Only one Khalqi, Saleh Mohammad Zeary, {{was a member of the}} PDPA Secretariat during Karmal's rule.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{women were}} thought to be able to {{eliminate}} the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at the center of her house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go out into the yard and shout: [...] "ORadomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn those white cattle back there, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> harm come to our vineyards, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> harm come to our fruitful fields." [...] In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them there was a woman that prevented it.|$|E
