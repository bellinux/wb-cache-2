Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we want to fly halfway around the world to do this?' But it was terrific, because we worked really hard.

Elliott described the album as a [...] "mythological cartoon about love written from some weird spaces", and explained it as [...] "sort of a mood swing into the world that was around us at the time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of dissolving into this drug culture. So the music became very ethereal, mystic, and mysterious". In contrast with the band's generally straightforward recordings for the Autumn label, Triangles lyrics are more abstract, containing Tolkienesque fantasy elements and dream-like characters, such as the gypsy in [...] "Only Dreaming Now", the [...] "Painter of Women", [...] "The Keeper of Time", and [...] "The Wolf of Velvet Fortune", {{as well as the}} destination of [...] "Magic Hollow".|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E

I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless.

500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of finding that because Carter always looks {{on the bright side}} and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E
500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one time we saw a glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh.
