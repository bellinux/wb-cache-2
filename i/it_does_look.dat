500|$|Populous: The Beginning was {{the first}} in the series {{developed}} with entirely 3D graphics. [...] The game was published more than four years after [...] with developers stating the delay was due to waiting for the hardware specifications to come along enough that they would allow them to do something very different and new. Producer Stuart Whyte said of the work, [...] "We're really proud of what we've done in software because <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> really nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Timothy {{takes us}} to the Westminster City Council Rubbish Dump, {{situated}} in Hyde Park, where Hercules Grytpype-Thynne and Count Jim Moriarty, more ragged than ever, are starving. [...] The Council has just dumped {{a huge amount of}} lagging, because [...] "it was in feet and inches, and we have gone metric". [...] Secombe, now in character as Neddie Seagoon, arrives [...] "driving an unlicensed Goon Show with CD plates on". [...] Gritpype's comment is [...] "Yes, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> a bit seedy, doesn't it." [...] The two villains then attempt their usual swindle of Neddie, in this case convincing him that his legs must be lagged to keep them warm for the coming winter, the payment being his [...] "war gratuity" [...] of one hundred pounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mike, to be sincere, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> {{a little}} {{suspicious}} when {{you not only}} went, off yourself, but you let the Indian go off with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must look}} {{out that we}} are not caught," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "How funny <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> when Haskers went over the dashboard!" [...] And he laughed merrily.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{a deal to}} feel; isn't there, George?--a deal to feel! <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> {{very pretty}} that day we opened it,--very pretty. The colours seem to have got dirty now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{has nothing}} to do with old Nathan's affair, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> as if the two burglaries were committed by the same person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you! O, thank you! <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> very nice," [...] said Fred, gazing {{on it with}} wistful eyes, [...] "but really I do {{not think}} I ought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> {{a little}} that way; but, you see, I've {{got a lot}} of {{business}} on hand, and I need to be braced up a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|In fact <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> just {{a little}} {{as if they were}} [...] "swelling" [...] considerably. Ben {{blackened}} Paul's, Johnny's, and his own boots until they would have answered for mirrors, and then he attended to his own toilet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't {{go so far}} as to {{deny that}} <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>look</b> like <b>it</b> as things stand at present," [...] said Dan. [...] "She was an able packet, and one way an' another I owe her a heap--her and dad." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> a lot, and Harris and I {{began to}} feel rather ashamed of it, though why we should be, I can’t see. No cab came by, but the street boys did, and got {{interested}} in the show, apparently, and stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{very good}} of you, doctor, but it really would not have mattered a bit for one night. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> snug and warm, with that great fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all. Well, yes, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> rather risky, [...] And kinder {{makes one}} queer And dizzy looking down. A drop of whiskey [...] Ain't {{a bad thing}} right here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, down it goes again then!" [...] she exclaimed.--"Yes, you are right, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> {{best that}} way. Is it not like silk? You shall feel {{it when you}} {{liberate}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And one {{day when}} we was in Outland, oo know--before we came to Fairyland me and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile. And he {{shortened}} it up for us. And <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> so funny! And it kept looking round, and saying 'wherever {{is the rest of}} me got to?' And then its eyes looked unhappy--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Ay, mayhap <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>look</b> {{a little}} wild or so,” {{continued}} the steward; “but to my judgment, squire, it’s the best image I’ve made, seeing it’s most {{like the man}} himself; well, that’s Natty Bumppo, who shot this here painter, that killed that there dog, who would have eaten or done worse to them here young ladies.” ...|$|R
60|$|But the spine. For that, {{the best}} way we can {{consider}} it is, with a crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now <b>it's</b> <b>done,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> much like Pompey's Pillar.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all! Well, yes, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> rather risky, [...] And kinder {{makes one}} queer [...] And dizzy looking down. A drop of whiskey [...] Ain't {{a bad thing}} right here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get away it is, sir. There {{is nothing}} very near ahead to stop us; though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> {{more toward the}} east cape as if the field was jammed in that quarter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> a goodish distance,' said Lance. 'And Robin, do you know, it {{all came}} of this fellow being too good a poet. He {{thought it was the}} Tiber, you know.' ...|$|E
500|$|A {{scene in}} the film portrays the violent {{destruction}} of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron {{said he had been}} [...] "surprised at how much <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like [...] ".|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>does</b> rather <b>look</b> {{as if in}} a {{republic}} where all are free and equal, prosperity and position constitute rank.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely--if you WILL have <b>it.</b> <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{like her}} leaving him?" [...] Mrs. Wix enquired. She brooded again; {{then she went}} on with more intensity: [...] "Do {{you want to know}} really and truly why? So that she may be his wretchedness and his punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Dick, now {{the machine}} is together, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> rather scary," [...] {{answered}} Tom Rover, slowly. [...] "I {{want to see that}} aviator try it out pretty well before I risk my neck going up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake, be careful, Laura!" [...] cried Robert. [...] "It had not {{struck me}} before, but really <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> rather like it. You {{know how you}} stand. Raffles Haw {{is not a man}} to play with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must admit}} <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> {{a little like}} rain," [...] said Laura, casting her eyes skyward. [...] "That's an awfully black cloud over yonder. O dear, rain would spoil it all! I do hope it holds off!" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was only}} a big dock: but you know the dragon-fly had never seen any but little water-trees; starwort, and milfoil, and water- crowfoot, and such like; so <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> very big to him. Besides, he was very short-sighted, as all dragon-flies are; and never could see a yard before his nose; {{any more than a}} great many other folks, who are not half as {{handsome}} as he.|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't do {{him much}} harm; and, after all, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not <b>look</b> as if Dick would marry Elsie, as we once thought was possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{of course}} it's very {{becoming}} and all that; but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> {{so out of}} character," [...] Mrs. Vervain said, leading {{the way to the}} breakfast- room. [...] "It's like seeing a military man in a civil coat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> pleasant, but I can't {{learn how}} it's done. I've tried, because one feels awkward in company {{not to do}} as {{everybody}} else is doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo, forgetting to play mentor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} it will be very silly--and I hope you won't think it pedantic in a girl, but really <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>look</b> so to me--what {{difference}} would there be between such a commission and the Star-Chamber judges of the Stuarts, Mr. Littlepage?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lister listened. The {{swelling}} note {{indicated that}} the train had left the cut, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not <b>look</b> as if the engineer was pulling up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I got up {{and looked}} round. I could not see for certain, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like a yacht, and I {{thought that it was}} {{about the size of the}} Osprey. Those two men were {{standing}} with their backs to us looking at it through their glasses, and Carthew happened to turn round and saw me standing up, and at once said: 'You must go below. I believe that is a pirate chasing us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the Lord {{have mercy}} on my soul!" [...] Calcutta, the darker portion of <b>it,</b> <b>does</b> not <b>look</b> an {{inviting}} place to dive into at night.|$|R
