5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E

Shell ovate, acute, subperforated (generally {{covered with a}} brown earthy coat); whorls rather rounded, mouth ovate, axis 3 lines; {{operculum}} horny and subspiral: variety, spire rather longer, whorls more rounded. This species is like Paludina nigra of Quoy and Gaimard, but the operculum is more spiral. Quoy described the operculum as concentric, but <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> subspiral. Paludina ventricosa of Quoy is evidently a Nematura.|$|E

The borough's low crime rate, good education results and large number of open spaces were all cited as its particularly attractive features, although being less commercial than the centres of Kingston or London, having a relative 'lack of entertainment facilities'.|$|E
25|$|The part of Sophia Petrillo was {{the first}} of the four roles to be cast. Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role of the feisty mother of {{character}} Dorothy Zbornak. This was due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her Off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of Torch Song Trilogy. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985. Getty <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> would be her last chance to find television or film work. She would return home to New York if she was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

In February 2017, the series' future was put in limbo, with the network's {{annoucement}} that it would convert to a true crime programming format, which was instituted in July 2017. When discussing the series' future, Frances Berwick, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Lifestyle Networks' president, revealed: [...] "Bad Girls Club, at this stage, I don't see it on Oxygen linear (referencing that it could air in a non-linear media form).

Sam Raimi and Oliver Stone {{were being}} {{considered}} as possible directors, though Stone {{signed on as}} executive producer/co-writer with a $1 million salary. On the storyline, Stone explained in December 1993, [...] "It has the discovery of cryogenically frozen Vedic Apes who hold the secret numeric codes to the Bible that foretold the end of civilizations. It deals with past versus the future. My concept is that there's a code inscribed in the Bible that predicts all historical events. The apes were there {{at the beginning and}} <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> all out." ...|$|E

The band got its recording deal {{as a favor}} for the artwork bassist Mike D'Antonio created for Ferret. The label's CEO, Carl Severson signed the band without a contract simply to get the album {{out to the public}} because he thought the album [...] "ruled", and stated [...] "I had a one-off deal and when I knew they wanted to go someplace bigger, I <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was in my best interest, as their friend, to make the best thing happen for them." [...] After the album was released, Severson showed it to Roadrunner Records A man, Mike Gitter.|$|E

Gary Moore published another article about Rosewood in the Miami Herald on March 7, 1993; he had {{to negotiate with the}} newspaper's editors for about a year to publish it. At first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place, and secondly, reporter Lori Rosza of the Miami Herald had reported on the first stage of what proved in December 1992 to be a deceptive claims case, with most of the survivors excluded.

500|$|The {{image was}} shot by {{photographer}} Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot ("we <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and {{you know what that}} means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good.

500|$|Maxwell, as a character, [...] "controls the action". He is the protagonist, and traps {{the viewer}} into the {{coach in the}} opening seconds of the episode by closing the curtains. This is a {{reversal}} of the way that, in the theatre, the opening of curtains brings the viewer into the story. As the translator, he acts as the only link between Jorg and the other characters; furthermore, as the episode does not have subtitles, he acts as the link between Jorg and Anglophone viewers. Revelations about the character are seeded in a different way to other characters. His profession and supply of medication bring to mind [...] "upper-class gentleman serial killers" [...] or [...] "cut-glass accented British actors brought in to play cold killers in Hollywood cinema". The revelation that Maxwell is a murderer is [...] "a satisfying payoff for those who've <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out", but in the final twist—Jorg's identity—control is taken from Maxwell and, therefore, the audience.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005; the crew filmed for ten {{hours a day}} for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated {{spending}} at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, [...] "I honestly don't know how we <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out, but we did". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.|$|E
500|$|Last Light {{is powered}} by 4A Games' own {{in-house}} engine, 4A Engine. Beynon claimed that with the engine {{it was the best}} looking game currently available on the market, especially for personal computers. The team also worked to improve the game's lighting and destruction system and introduced a larger variety of color palette. The game was originally set to be released for Nintendo's Wii U, and the title was included in the Wii U show-reel, though THQ has since stated that the game may not be released for that platform. Regarding the possibility of the game coming to the Wii U, 4A Games chief technical officer Oles Shishkovtsov said the Wii U has a [...] "horrible, slow CPU". His colleague, Huw Beynon, reiterated the sentiment, telling NowGamer that there would not be a Wii U version of Metro: Last Light, because the studio [...] "couldn't justify the effort required" [...] and they [...] "just <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> wasn't worth pursuing at this time". According to THQ, 4A experimented with the Wii U development kit, but later gave up this version of the game during its early stages of development.|$|E
