After exploring {{the origins of the}} First Amendment-based privilege, the Author argues that WikiLeaks {{would not be able to}} claim it. First, the website does not engage in investigative reporting. Second, it has not taken steps consistently to minimize harm. He also discusses congressional attempts to pass a federal shield law, paying special attention to H. R. 985 and S. 448, the two most recent shield bills. The Author argues that WikiLeaks was an ill fit for their definitions of 2 ̆ 2 covered person. 2 ̆ 2 For these reasons, the Author concludes that WikiLeaks would not qualify to claim a federal reporter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> in any form...|$|R

40|$|When a {{computer}} and {{a connection to the}} Internet allow almost anyone to claim to be a journalist, the question of who should be covered by media shield laws becomes especially difficult. Based on the premise {{that it is important to}} preserve the journalist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> and to accommodate the 2 ̆ 2 unmedia 2 ̆ 2 if that can be done without undermining journalism 2 ̆ 7 s values, this article suggests that the best way to limit the journalist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> is not to define 2 ̆ 2 who is a journalist? 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 what is news? 2 ̆ 2 Instead, the privilege should extend protection to anyone who is engaged in the work process of journalism. Drawing on the profession 2 ̆ 7 s standards, the article proposes that an individual is 2 ̆ 2 engaged in journalism 2 ̆ 2 when the writer is involved in a process that is intended to generate and disseminate truthful information to the public on a regular basis.

40|$|This article {{examines}} visual art {{in light of}} the letter and the spirit of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Copyright Clause and the Copyright Act of 1976 (“Act”) and concludes that artists should have the freedom to copy works, not only of popular culture, but of all kinds. In other words, people creating art should be permitted to copy anything and everything. This {{is not to suggest that}} copyright serves no purpose: destroying the copyright edifice merely to protect the ability of certain artists to create would be dangerous and foolhardy. Practical limitations on an artist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> to copy can be imposed to preserve copyright 2 ̆ 7 s incentives for creation. An artist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> to copy may at first seem extreme, but closer examination will reveal that both copyright theory and copyright owners can accommodate such copying. To test the proposed privilege, this Article will use a genre of art [...] appropriation art [...] that has gained some notoriety in the art and legal worlds because of its obvious and deliberate copying. Appropriation art will therefore serve as a paradigm; if the proposal can justify copying by an appropriation artist, then it will also justify less extreme copying. Let us begin, then, by examining two scenarios involving artistic appropriation as it is presently practiced...|$|R
