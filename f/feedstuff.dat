40|$|Continued {{growth and}} {{intensification}} of aquaculture production {{depends upon the}} development of sustainable protein sources to replace fish meal in aquafeeds. This document reviews various plant <b>feedstuffs,</b> which currently are or potentially may be incorporated into aquafeeds to support the sustainable production of various fish species in aquaculture. The plant <b>feedstuffs</b> considered include oilseeds, legumes and cereal grains, which traditionally {{have been used as}} protein or energy concentrates as well as novel products developed through various processing technologies. The nutritional composition of these various <b>feedstuffs</b> are considered along with the presence of any bioactive compounds that may positively or negatively affect the target organism. Lipid composition of these <b>feedstuffs</b> is not specifically considered although it is recognized that incorporating lipid supplements in aquafeeds to achieve proper fatty acid profiles to meet the metabolic requirements of fish and maximize human health benefits are important aspects. Specific strategies and techniques to optimize the nutritional composition of plant <b>feedstuffs</b> and limit potentially adverse effects of bioactive compounds are also described. Such information will provide a foundation for developing strategic research plans for increasing the use of plant <b>feedstuffs</b> in aquaculture to reduce dependence of animal <b>feedstuffs</b> and thereby enhance the sustainability of aquaculture...|$|R

40|$|Data on the {{proximate}} {{nutrient content}} of <b>feedstuffs,</b> digestibility and energy utilization {{available from the}} International <b>Feedstuffs</b> Institute (Utah State University) were used to develop mathematical models for estimating energy and protein utilization of five classes of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals. Classes of <b>feedstuffs</b> were subdivided into more related subclasses. Furthermore, data from all feeds were pooled together then subgrouped into more related subgroups {{in an attempt to}} gain high precision in prediction of digestible proximate nutrients and TDN from a single chemical entity by the use of simple regression models (Y = bo + b 1 x 1). Digestible percentages (Y) of crude protein, ether extract, crude fiber and nitrogen free extract were highly correlated with their proximate contents (Xs) of most classes, subclasses and subgroups of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals. However, the use of linear multiple regression equation resulted in more precision in estimating each digestible nutrient (Y) from proximate analysis (Xl; CP%, Xz; EE%, x 3; CF% and X 4; NFE%) of the different classes of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals. Prediction of digestible proximate nutrients made it possible to calculate Tn~ by the conventional equation: TDN; DCP% + DCF% + DNFE% + 2. 25 x DEE%. And to calculate digestible energy (DE) from the following equation : DE(Mcal/kg); 5. 72 (DCP%) + 9. 5 (DEE%) + 4. 79 (DCF%) + 4. 03 (NFE%) / 100 TDN, DE and ME (Ys) were highly correlated with the digestible proximate nutrients (X 1; DCP%, x 2; DEE%, X 3; DCF% and X 4 = DNFE%) and with proximate analysis (upon the use of multiple regression models). However, TDN, DE and ME (Ys) were not predictable with high precision from any one single chemical entity (Xs) in most cases of the different classes of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals. DE (Y) was highly correlated with TDN values (X), and ME (Y) was highly correlated with DE and TDN (Xs) values of t he different classes of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals. The inclusion of physical descriptions (qualitative factors) of <b>feedstuffs</b> along with chemical analysis (quantitative factors) gave promising results predicting TDN content of <b>feedstuffs.</b> MEn and NEP for poultry were highly correlated with proximate analysis of the different classes of <b>feedstuffs.</b> NEP was also estimated with high precision from MEn. However, both MEn and NEP were not highly associated with single chemical entities. The dissertation contains an extensive literature review on systems of evaluating nutritive value, and factors affecting digestibility of <b>feedstuffs.</b> This dissertation also contains numerous equations which predict each digestible nutrient from its proximate content and from proximate analysis; TDN, DE and ME from each proximate nutrient, digestible proximate nutrients and proximate analysis; DE and~~ from TDN; and ME from DE contents of different classes of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals. Moreover, there are complex equations to predict TDN from proximate analysis and their interactions and from proximate analysis plus physical descriptions of <b>feedstuffs</b> for various kinds of animals...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} nutritional quality of some conventional and non-conventional feed resources by using in vitro gas method. Samples of various <b>feedstuffs</b> were analyzed chemically, {{as well as by}} in vitro gas method. The <b>feedstuffs</b> having different digestibilities showed significant (P< 0. 05) differences in the rate and amount of gas production, metabolizable energy (ME) and digestibility of organic matter. Predicted metabolizable energy values were very low in <b>feedstuffs</b> having high fiber and low protein contents. These <b>feedstuffs</b> included various grasses, crop residues and wheal straw. Lowest ME value of 4. 7 MJ/kg of dry matter (DM) was found in wheat straw. Many of the roughages (Sorghum vulgare, Kochia indica, Leptochloa fusca) studied were found to be deficient in fermentable carbohydrates, resulting in low organic matter digestibility. Concentrate feed stuffs like cotton seed meal, sunflower meal, cotton seed cakes, rice polish, rapeseed meal and Zea mays (maize) grains had higher ME values (9. 27 – 12. 44 MJ/kg DM). The difference of ME of various <b>feedstuffs</b> reflects different contents of fermentable carbohydrates and available nitrogen in cereals and protein supplements. Among the non-conventional <b>feedstuffs,</b> Acacia ampliceps, Acacia nilotica, Sesbania aculeata, Leptochloa fusca and Prosopis juliflora were found potential fodders.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{important}} decisions facing cattle feeders is the choice of <b>feedstuffs</b> and rations. The selection of <b>feedstuffs</b> is not complex for Nebraska and other Corn-belt feeders as for feeders in those areas with a wider array of available <b>feedstuffs.</b> One management decision of universal importance to all cattle feeders, however, is the most efficient organization of <b>feedstuffs</b> into rations. Ration, as the term is used here, refers to the complete feed {{made available to the}} animal. The ration is composed of several <b>feedstuffs</b> or feed ingredients. Each ration is referred to with respect to its nutrient specifications, ingredient limitations, and usually its purpose such as growing, fattening, or starting beef animals on fattening programs. Many problem areas exist in beef ration formulation, both in the nutritional and economic aspects. Because I have attempted to combine as much knowledge as possible from both areas into a realistic research endeavor, the objectives of this study were narrowed to three: 1) To formulate beef fattening rations which are nutritionally feasible. 2) To vary ration restrictions within feasible parameters. 3) To determine the least-cost performance level of ration restrictions.
