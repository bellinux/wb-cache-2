40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of electricity from solar radiation is a direct process. Solar energy is not very dense, {{it is necessary to}} concentrate it to produce exploitable temperatures usable for the {{production of}} electricity. The radiation may concentrate on a point or on a line, where thermal energy is transferred to the heat transfer fluid. The intensity of concentration is defined by the concentration factor, the more this one is higher, the more reached temperature will be important. In this paper two optical technologies which showed promising results were compared, the first one is the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> and the second one is the parabolic trough. These two technologies are based on linear solar concentration. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} report the performance of these technologies by means of numerical analysis. A methodological analysis to design and evaluate the technical feasibility for the use of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> or parabolic trough in a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) system has been carried out. The influence of ambient conditions and the percent of different types of energy loss, etc., are analyzed. An application on a site, in the south of Algeria (Hassi Rmel), is done.

40|$|The Monte Carlo-type {{statistical}} {{ray-tracing method}} {{was used to}} investigate {{the performance of the}} line-focusing <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> solar concentrator. An optical model of the line-focusing <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> concentrator using the statistical ray-tracing approach was developed. Many rays of sunlight from the solar disk were selected at random and traced through the concentrator in this model. This optical model permits calculation of the local and geometric concentration ratios. The latter requires an energyloss analysis. Small sun-tracking errors of the diurnal or transverse type were included in the model. Based on the optical model and the Monte Carlo-type statistical ray-tracing method, a computer program was written implementing the model and computations using Pascal. To facilitate performance comparisons, a baseline concentrator design was adopted. To study the effects of imperfect tracking, performance data were generated for small tracking errors up to approximately two and one-half degrees. The selected mirror configuration permitted comparisons between the statistical approach and previous applications of the "extreme ray" analysis for an imperfectly tracking mirror concentrator. Simulation results demonstrated that the concentration characteristics are highly sensitive to the tracking error. The geometric concentration ratio dramatically decreases when the tracking error increases, which {{is the same as the}} "extreme ray" analysis. Results of some typical numerical calculations are presented graphically and discussed. Department of Physics and AstronomyThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

40|$|The solar {{concentration}} {{performance of}} a tracking, flat-base, line-focusing <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> was investigated in this study. The <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> consists of flat mirror strips situated on a base and oriented at appropriate angles to focus incident light to a desired line. Simple optical ray tracing and energy conservation were used to develop a mathematical model of the concentrator assuming small or zero diurnal tracking errors. The model analyzed the concentrator design and provided detailed expressions for the geometric evaluation of the concentrated sunlight rays in the focal plane above the mirror. The local concentration ratio and the geometric concentration ratio were introduced to describe the intensity profile in the focal plane and the average concentration of sunlight on a target absorber. Included in the model were losses of incident sunlight due to imperfect reflection, nonreflecting portions of the base, and blockage by adjacent mirror strips when imperfect tracking occurs. Based on the analytical model and using the Ada high level language, a computer program was written to simulate the concentrator. To facilitate performance comparisons, a baseline concentrator design was adopted. To {{study the effects of}} imperfect tracking, performance data were generated for small tracking errors up to approximately two and one-half degrees. The effects of design variations were studied by varying the concentrator focal length, strip width, and base width. Simulation results demonstrated that the concentration characteristics were highly sensitive to tracking error. Intensity profile shifts relative to the target caused the highest losses in intercepted sunlight. Design decisions were found to dramatically affect the concentration character- istics. For the baseline concentrator under perfect tracking conditions, an optimum focal length was identified. Except for the disadvantage of added costs, decreased strip widths was found to be a way to increase both the maximum and average concentration ratio for the absorber. Using smaller strip widths might, however, critically affect the energy intercepted by the target under imperfect tracking. Increasing the concentrator base width increased the total amount of power in the focal plane, with a higher maximum concentration ratio and additional tailing of the intensity profile.

40|$|AbstractSolar {{energy is}} the most abundant, widely {{distributed}} and clean renewable energy resource. Since the insolation intensity {{is only in the}} range of 0. 5 - 1. 0 kW/m 2, solar concentrators are required for attaining temperatures appropriate for medium and high temperature applications. The concentrated energy is transferred through an absorber to a thermal fluid such as air, water or other fluids for various uses. This paper describes design and development of a ‘Linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>Mirror</b> Solar Concentrator’ (LFMSC) using long thin strips of mirrors to focus sunlight on to a fixed receiver located at a common focal line. Our LFMSC system comprises a reflector (concentrator), receiver (target) and an innovative solar tracking mechanism. Reflectors are mirro strips, mounted on tubes which are fixed to a base frame. The tubes can be rotated to align the strips to focus solar radiation on the receiver (target). The latter comprises a coated tube carrying water and covered by a glass plate. This is mounted at an elevation of few meters above the horizontal, parallel to the plane of the mirrors. The reflector is oriented along north-south axis. The most difficult task is tracking. This is achieved by single axis tracking using a four bar link mechanism. Thus tracking has been made simple and easy to operate. The LFMSC setup is used for generating steam for a variety of applications...|$|E

Recent {{advances}} in MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology and micro-machining may change this. Specifically, {{the advent of}} steerable sub-millimeter sized mirror arrays could provide the breakthrough technology for producing very small-scale high-performance optical systems. For example, an array of steerable MEMS mirrors could be the building blocks for a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>mirror</b> of controllable focal length and direction of view. When coupled with a convex parabolic mirror the steerable array could realize a micro-scale pan, tilt and zoom system that provides full CCD sensor resolution over the desired field of view with no moving parts (other than MEMS elements). This LDRD provided the first steps towards {{the goal of a}} new class of small-scale high-performance optics based on MEMS technology. A large-scale, proof of concept system was built to demonstrate the effectiveness of an optical configuration applicable to producing a small-scale (< 1 cm) pan and tilt imaging system. This configuration consists of a color CCD imager with a narrow field of view lens, a steerable flat mirror, and a convex parabolic mirror. The steerable flat mirror directs the camera's narrow field of view to small areas of the convex mirror providing much higher pixel density in the region of interest than is possible with a full 360 deg. imaging system. Improved image correction (dewarping) software based on texture mapping images to geometric solids was developed. This approach takes advantage of modern graphics hardware and provides a great deal of flexibility for correcting images from various mirror shapes. An analytical evaluation of blur spot size and axi-symmetric reflector optimization were performed to address depth of focus issues that occurred in the proof of concept system. The resulting equations will provide the tools for developing future system designs...|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of Concentrating Solar Power Systems (CSP) systems is currently {{taking place at}} a much slower pace than photovoltaic (PV) power systems. This is {{mainly because of the}} higher present cost of the solar thermal power plants, but also for the time that is needed in order to build them. Though economic attractiveness of different Concentrating technologies varies, still PV power dominates the market. The price of CSP is expected to drop significantly in the near future and wide spread installation of them will follow. The main aim of this project is the creation of different relevant case studies on solar thermal power generation and a comparison betwwen them. The purpose of this detailed comparison is the techno-economic appraisal of a number of CSP systems and the understanding of their behaviour under various boundary conditions.

40|$|Photovoltaic {{technology}} {{in the field of}} renewable energy has reached a high commercial interest over the past decade. The traditional silicon photovoltaic systems that is currently the most widespread, mainly due to government subsidies, have a low energy production. The wide use of material and the low efficiency of the silicon modules required the research and development of photovoltaic systems more efficient. The most promising technology is the photovoltaic concentration that increases the efficiency of the modules by reducing the area of the PV cell. The concentration photovoltaic has had considerable technological progress related to the development of multi-junction PV cells with high efficiency. Another approach is the technology of photovoltaic concentration with the spectral separation, so using the interference filters the solar spectrum is splitted into different optical bands. In this research was designed and built a CPV prototype system with spectral separation. The interference filters such as anti-reflection and dichroic mirror are made up of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide. These oxides have been realized by means of physical vapor deposition reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The PVD technique allows to deposit thin films with a homogeneous process reproducible and reliable. In {{the first part of the}} work, the characterization of individual layers of oxide materials have allowed to extrapolate the optical constants. This is necessary for the design of the optical multilayer. The characterization has nvolved various analyzes such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the thickness and the roughness, compositional analysis Rutherforf backscattering spectrometry (RBS), and optical analysis UV-Vis-NIR. These analyzes were necesary to calibrate the deposition system in order to subsequently to realize the multilayer optics. The as deposited optical multilayers not confirm the optical design, and it was necessary to carry out an annealing at 350 °C. In the second part of the work, there were also micro structural characterizations for evaluating the phase variation of the titanium dioxide with the annealing treatment. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis has checked the absorption peak of the Ti-O-Ti of the crystalline phase. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis verified the phase variation of titanium dioxide from purely amorphous phase with a slight presence of rutile to the anatase phase. Through the optical analysis it was possible to extrapolate the new optical constants corresponding to the phase of anatase. In the third part of the work, the ray tracing design of optical splitting of the CPV prototype was carry out. The CPV system is designed by coupling a concentration <b>Fresnel</b> a dichroic <b>mirror.</b> The focus of the radiation on the PV cell, is simulated by two ideal detector. The optical optimization as function of the f-number of the lens has allowed to define the layout for the prototyping phase. A further optimization is to insert a secondary optics element (SOE) of homogenization. The secondary optics will also limits the optical losses due to a misalignment of the CPV prototype. In the last part of this thesis is devoted to the preparation and the characterization of the CPV prototype. Were performed measures of solar radiation, which combined with the characteristic I-V-P curves of the solar cells have enable to evaluate the efficiency of the prototype system. The efficiency of the spectral separation system was compared with concentration multi-junction PV cells. Daily measurement were performed to compare the spectral separation technology than to the multi-junction technology. The results show that the separation system maintains a more constant performance during the day. Finally, thermal measurements were conducted on the component of the CPV prototype separation system. The experimental results allows to guarantee that the spectral separation is also a selective filter of temperature. This allows the solar cells to maximize the photovoltaic conversion and to reduce the overheating. ...|$|R
