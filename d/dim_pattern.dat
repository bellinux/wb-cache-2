6000|$|On this day, my friends, {{was offered}} up upon the cross the Lamb of God,--slain in eternity and heaven before the {{foundation}} of the world, but slain in time and space upon this day. All the old sacrifices, the lambs which were daily offered up to God in the Jewish Temple, the lambs which Abel, and after him the patriarchs offered up, the Paschal Lamb slain at the Passover, our Eastertide, all these were but figures of Christ--tokens of the awful and yet loving law of God, that without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. But the blood of dumb animals could not take away sin. All mankind had sinned, and it was, therefore, necessary that all mankind should suffer. Therefore He suffered, the new Adam, the Man of all men, in whom all mankind were, as it were, collected into one and put on a new footing with God; that henceforward to be a man might mean to be a holy being, a forgiven being, a being joined to God, wearing the likeness of the Son of God--the human soul and body in which He offered up all human souls and bodies on the cross. For man was originally made in Christ's likeness; He was the Word of God who walked in the garden of Eden, who spoke to Adam with a human voice; He was the Lord who appeared to the patriarchs in a man's figure, and ate and drank in Abraham's tent, and spoke to him with a human voice; He was the God of Israel, whom the Jewish elders saw with their bodily eyes upon Mount Sinai, and under His feet a pavement as of a sapphire stone. From Him all man's powers came-- man's speech, man's understanding. All that is truly noble in man was a <b>dim</b> <b>pattern</b> of Him in whose likeness man was originally made. And when man had fallen and sinned, and Christ's image was fading more and more out of him, and the likeness of the brutes growing more and more in him year by year, then came Christ, the head and the original pattern of all men, to claim them for His own again, to do in their name what they could never do for themselves, to offer Himself up a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world: so that He is the real sacrifice, the real lamb; as St. John said when he pointed Him out to his disciples, [...] "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a new double-image gravitational lens, resulting from our search for lenses in the southern sky. Radio source PMN J 2004 [1349 is composed of two compact components separated by 1 A. 13 in VLA, MERLIN, and VLBA images. The components have a Ñux ratio of 1 : 1 at radio frequencies ranging from 5 to 22. 5 GHz. The I-band optical counterpart is also an equal double, with roughly the same separation and position angle as the radio double. Upon subtraction of the components from the I-band image, we identify a <b>dim</b> <b>pattern</b> of residuals as the lens galaxy. While the present observations are sufficient to establish that PMN J 2004 [1349 is a gravitational lens, additional information will be necessary (such as the redshifts of the galaxy and quasar and precise astrometry and photometry of the lens galaxy) before constructing detailed mass models...|$|E

40|$|Many animals use the sun's {{polarization}} {{pattern to}} orientate, but the dung beetle Scarabaeus zambesianus {{is the only}} animal so far known to orientate using the million times <b>dimmer</b> polarization <b>pattern</b> of the moonlit sky. We demonstrate the relative roles of {{the moon and the}} nocturnal polarized-light pattern for orientation. We find that artificially changing the position of the moon, or hiding the moon's disc from the beetle's field of view, generally did not influence its orientation performance. We thus conclude that the moon does not serve as the primary cue for orientation. The effective cue is the polarization pattern formed around the moon, which is more reliable for orientation. Polarization sensitivity ratios in two photoreceptors in the dorsal eye were found to be 7. 7 and 12. 9, similar to values recorded in diurnal navigators. These results agree with earlier results suggesting that the detection and analysis of polarized skylight is similar in diurnal and nocturnal insects...|$|R
40|$|Prominent in the sky, but {{not visible}} to humans, {{is a pattern}} of {{polarized}} skylight formed around both the Sun and the Moon. Dung beetles are, at present, the only animal group known to use the much <b>dimmer</b> polarization <b>pattern</b> formed around the Moon as a compass cue for maintaining travel direction. However, the Moon is not visible every night {{and the intensity of}} the celestial polarization pattern gradually declines as the Moon wanes. Therefore, for nocturnal orientation on all moonlit nights, the absolute sensitivity of the dung beetle's polarization detector may limit the precision of this behaviour. To test this, we studied the straight-line foraging behaviour of the nocturnal ball-rolling dung beetle Scarabaeus satyrus to establish when the Moon is too dim—and the polarization pattern too weak—to provide a reliable cue for orientation. Our results show that celestial orientation is as accurate during crescent Moon as it is during full Moon. Moreover, this orientation accuracy is equal to that measured for diurnal species that orient under the 100 million times brighter polarization pattern formed around the Sun. This indicates that, in nocturnal species, the sensitivity of the optical polarization compass can be greatly increased without any loss of precision...|$|R

40|$|A {{very large}} {{proportion}} of the world's animal species are active in dim light, either under the cover of night or {{in the depths of the}} sea. The worlds they see can be dim and extended, with light reaching the eyes from all directions at once, or they can be composed of bright point sources, like the multitudes of stars seen in a clear night sky or the rare sparks of bioluminescence that are visible in the deep sea. The eye designs of nocturnal and deep-sea animals have evolved in response to these two very different types of habitats, being optimised for maximum sensitivity to extended scenes, or to point sources, or to both. After describing the many visual adaptations that have evolved across the animal kingdom for maximising sensitivity to extended and point-source scenes, I then use case studies from the recent literature to show how these adaptations have endowed nocturnal animals with excellent vision. Nocturnal animals can see colour and negotiate dimly illuminated obstacles during flight. They can also navigate using learned terrestrial landmarks, the constellations of stars or the <b>dim</b> <b>pattern</b> of polarised light formed around the moon. The conclusion from these studies is clear: nocturnal habitats are just as rich in visual details as diurnal habitats are, and nocturnal animals have evolved visual systems capable of exploiting them. The same is certainly true of deep-sea animals, as future research will no doubt reveal...|$|E
60|$|At length, Merton, who {{had been}} {{coughing}} a great deal while dressing, came in assisted by his wife, but quite exhausted with the exertion of walking from one room to the other; and after shaking hands with their visitor he sunk into his easy-chair, not yet able to talk. She was greatly shocked at the change in him; the once fine, marble-like face was horribly wasted, so that the sharp unsightly bones {{looked as if they}} would cut their way through the deadly dry parchment-yellow skin that covered them; and the deep blue eyes now looked preternaturally large and bright--all the brighter for the dark purple stains beneath them. He was low indeed, nigh unto death perhaps; yet he did not appear cast down in the least, but even while he sat breathing laboriously, still unable to speak, the eyes had a pleased hopeful look as they rested on their visitor's face. A smile, too, hovered about {{the corners of his mouth}} as his glance wandered over her costume. For, in spite of feeling the heat a great deal, she looked cool in her light-hued summer dress, with its <b>dim</b> blue <b>pattern</b> on a cream-coloured ground. The loose fashion in which it was made, the tints, and light frosting of fine lace on neck and sleeves, harmonised well with the grey tender eyes, the pure delicate skin, and golden hair.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{classify}} the Formagraph tracings, milk samples from 149 individual Mediterranean buffaloes were tested. Milk samples were analysed for fat, total protein (TP), somatic cell counts (SCC), total aerobic mesophilic flora (TAMF), acidity degree (°SH), days in milk (DIM) and coagulation parameters (r, k 20, a 30). Milks were grouped into 7 types according to r + k 20 sum and different curd firmness. Milks with short time (type 1) of coagulation (60 mm (type 3), with slightly longer time of coagulation (12 - 20 min.) and a 30 60 mm (type 5), with longer time of coagulation (> 20 min.) and a 30 45 mm (type 7), correspond to 15 %, 32 %, 33 % and 20 % of clotted milks respectively. Milks from 12 % {{of the total}} samples did not coagulate in 30 mins. TP, SCC, °SH, and <b>DIM</b> affected lactodynamometric <b>patterns.</b> TAMF significantly affected r, k 20 and a 30, therefore the milk was further subdivided in milk with TAMF 106 UFC. Milk with high curd firmness and TAMF> 106 showed more DIM and acidity degree. In conclusion, {{it is possible that}} many milks can present different coagulations {{as a function of the}} hygienic condition of the milking operation...|$|R

40|$|Visible Light Communication {{has been}} {{intriguing}} both {{the industry and}} the academia for over a decade. However, {{most of the research}} efforts in this area only consider scenarios where the light emitted from the transmitters is constant. This is not true when Smart Lighting, a technology designed for more comfortable and energy efficient buildings by adjusting the illumination of fixtures based on ambient light availability, is involved. Under the smart lighting, the changes of fixtures’ illumination affect the communication links significantly. Therefore, new methods must be proposed for a revolutionary co-design of smart lighting and communication for the visible light networks. This project proposes SmartVLC, a system that can optimize the through- put (benefit communication) while maintaining the LEDs’ primary illumin- ation function (benefit smart lighting). A new modulation scheme Adaptive Multiple Pulse Position Modulation (AMPPM) is proposed to support fine- grained dimming levels and optimize the throughput under each <b>dimming</b> level via <b>pattern</b> multiplexing. An algorithm is also designed to adjust the LEDs’ dimming level smoothly. The proposed AMPPM and the LEDs’ il- lumination adaptation algorithm are implemented into a low-cost platform. The performance of SmartVLC is evaluated under both static and dynamic scenarios. The current version of SmartVLC supports a communication dis- tance of 3. 6 m and a throughput of 107 Kbps in an indoor environment. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, the performance gain of SmartVLC can reach up to 190 %.

40|$|Information on {{chromosomal}} aberrations in cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL), is scarce. In this study, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) {{was used}} to analyze chromosomal imbalances (CI) in 32 patients with CTCL. CI were detected in 21 patients (66 %). Euchromatic loss (dim) was localized most frequently (> 16 %) at the chromosomal regions 17 p (28 %), 13 q (25 %), 10 q (16 %), and 6 q (19 %), and gain of chromatin (enh) at 7 (25 %), 8 q (25 %), and 17 q (16 %). The <b>pattern</b> <b>dim</b> 6 q–enh 7 –enh 8 –dim 13 was the most frequent combination of CI. The number of aberrations per tumor sample varied between 0 and 19 and correlated with clinical tumor stages: from none in stage Ia to 8. 75 ± 1. 8 (mean±SEM) in stage IVa. CI occurred more frequently in aggressive subtypes (9. 33 ± 2. 16) than in indolent (2. 88 ± 0. 8) subtypes. A high number of CI (≥ 5) was associated with shorter survival. Gain of chromatin in 8 q and loss of 6 q and 13 q correlated with a significantly shorter survival, whereas the most frequently observed aberrations (loss in 17 p and gain in 7) did not influence the prognosis. In summary, CGH analysis revealed a characteristic pattern of recurring chromosomal gains and losses in CTCL. The association of the imbalances with the clinical course of the disease suggests that genes encoded at these loci may influence tumor development and progression...|$|R
40|$|To obtain further {{evidence}} for the functional specialization and task-dependent processing in the human visual system, we used positron emission tomography to compare regional cerebral blood flow in two direction discrimination tasks and four control tasks. The stimulus configuration, which was identical in all tasks, included the motion of a random dot <b>pattern,</b> <b>dimming</b> of a fixation point, and a tone burst. The discrimination tasks comprised the identification of motion direction and successive direction discrimination. The control tasks were motion detection, dimming detection, tone detection, and passive viewing. There was little difference in the activation patterns evoked by the three detection tasks except for decreased activity in the parietal cortex during the detection of a tone. Thus attention to a nonvisual stimulus modulated different visual cortical regions nonuniformly. Comparison of successive discrimination with motion detection yielded significant activation in the right fusiform gyrus, right lingual gyrus, right frontal operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right thalamus. The fusiform and opercular activation sites persisted even after subtracting direction identification from successive discrimination, indicating their involvement in temporal comparison. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments confirmed the weak nature of the activation of human MT/V 5 by successive direction discrimination but also indicated the involvement of an inferior satellite of human MT/V 5. The fMRI experiments moreover confirmed the involvement of human V 3 A, lingual, and parietal regions in successive discrimination. Our results provide {{further evidence}} for the functional specialization of the human visual system because the cortical regions involved in direction discrimination partially differ from those involved in orientation discrimination. They also support the principle of task-dependent visual processing and indicate that the right fusiform gyrus participates in temporal comparison, irrespective of the stimulus attribute. status: publishe...|$|R
