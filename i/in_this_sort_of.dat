25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing a spot, or blip on the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> display.|$|E

500|$|The {{morphology}} of ash {{particles from}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{is controlled by}} stresses within the chilled magma which result in fragmentation of the glass to form small blocky or pyramidal glass ash particles. Vesicle shape and density play only a minor role in the determination of grain shape in phreatomagmatic eruptions. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> eruption, the rising magma is quickly cooled on contact with ground or surface water. Stresses within the [...] "quenched" [...] magma cause fragmentation into five dominant pyroclast shape-types: (1) blocky and equant; (2) vesicular and irregular with smooth surfaces; (3) moss-like and convoluted; (4) spherical or drop-like; and (5) plate-like.|$|E
500|$|The bricks were {{probably}} {{made at the}} St Benet's Abbey in Norfolk, with the stone coming from chalk pits near Norwich's southern Conesford Gates. The brickwork, particularly on the stairwell, is particularly well executed, and archaeologist T. P. Smith considers the tower to feature some [...] "of the finest medieval brickwork" [...] in England. It is the earliest known use of brick in an external load-capacity in Norwich. The use of brick <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fortification was both prestigious and practical, as brick absorbed the impact of artillery fire better than stone. The river bends around about [...] {{from the bottom of}} the tower, and its base may have been underpinned with timber piles during its original construction.|$|E

500|$|In September 1943 Richard Shaver, an Amazing reader, {{began to}} {{correspond}} with Palmer, who soon asked him to write stories for the magazine. Shaver responded with a story called [...] "I Remember Lemuria", published in the March 1945 issue, which was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, dramatically boosted Amazings circulation, and Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery, as it was called. Amazing soon drew ridicule for these stories. A derisive article by William S. Baring-Gould in the September 1946 issue of Harper's prompted William Ziff to tell Palmer to {{limit the amount of}} Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the facts of the}} case proper, the Court first had to address the concerns raised by the District Court that prompted them to dismiss the Government's suit.

2500|$|Some kibbutzim {{have been}} criticized for [...] "abandoning" [...] socialist {{principles}} and turning to capitalist projects {{in order to make the}} kibbutz more self-sufficient economically. Kibbutz Shamir owns an optical products company that is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Numerous kibbutzim have moved away from farming and developed parts of their property for commercial and industrial purposes, building shopping malls and factories on kibbutz land that serve and employ non kibbutz members while the kibbutz retains a profit from land rentals or sales.

5000|$|The term [...] "impulse" [...] is {{also used}} to refer to a {{fast-acting}} force or impact.

He then {{relocated}} to New York City, where his art education continued briefly at the National Academy of Design. He soon changed schools again, to the Art Students League, which he attended from 1930 to 1934. He studied with Hans Hofmann and gained an appreciation for Synthetic Cubism and Neoplasticism. According to painter and printmaker George McNeil, Swinden [...] "could have influenced Hofmann... He was working with very, very simple planes, not <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Cubistic manner. Swinden was working synthetically at this time."
