The style of cooking is fairly simple, flavored much like other West Indian cuisine. Goat water stew, perhaps the country's most {{well-known}} dish, mixes goat, breadfruit, green <b>pawpaw</b> (<b>papaya),</b> and dumplings (also known as [...] "droppers") in a tomato-based stew. Another favorite dish is cook-up, or pelau, which combines chicken, pig tail, saltfish and vegetables with rice and pigeon peas. Conkies bear a large similarity to tamales, though instead of having filling rolled inside the dough, the cornmeal is mixed together with grated sweet potato, pumpkin, coconut, and a few other ingredients; after wrapping the dough in banana leaves, they're boiled rather than steamed. Sweets tend to be simply made, sometimes with nothing more than fruit, like tamarind or guava, and sugar.|$|R

The Quadriplegic Centre is a 100 -bed {{hospital}} for the specialist management of people with paralysis {{as a consequence of}} spinal cord injury or diseases of the spinal cord. Clinical staff at the Quadriplegic Centre became aware of the OPALOOl filtrate and cream, derived from <b>pawpaw</b> (<b>papaya)</b> and peach, and the apparent efficacy in healing various types of ulcers. Staff initiated a trial involving patients that had suffered Stage ÏI-IV pressure ulcers, including some of more than 5 weeks' duration that were difficult to heal. Daily treatment consisted of application of the filtrate to the ulcer and the cream to the surrounding skin with non-adherent dressing. Treatment appeared to be effective, and persistent large and deep ulcers were healed. There was improved mobility among patients, as well as less turning and bedside care. A retrospective cost analysis shows savings arose from reduced nursing care and fewer products being used for wound care. The preliminary data presented show some evidence for OPALOOl therapy reducing costs and improving outcomes; the situation where costs decrease and health outcomes improve is both unusual and highly desirable for healthcare decision makers. A randomised clinical trial is required to show that these observations are real effects from therapy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecology of}} the endemic Imperial-Pigeon {{occurring}} on Christmas Island, Ducula whartoni, is poorly known. Here, I report repeated episodes of consumption of leaves of the introduced <b>Pawpaw</b> Carica <b>papaya</b> in observations across the period July 2012 to June 2013. Folivory is unusual in the predominantly frugivorous Ducula fruit-pigeons. There may be three reasons for such regular folivory: (1) leaves were taken when fruit was unavailable or severely limited, (2) fruit was available but provided inadequate nutrition, or (3) fruit was available and adequately nutritious, but Pawpaw leaves were consumed because of their therapeutic value. This study did not provide sufficient critical evidence to test these alternatives...|$|R

The characterization of the <b>fresh</b> <b>pawpaw</b> and pineapple juice before blending showed that the juices have good quality. The high water content of the product may have affected the viscosity, vitamin C content and total soluble solid of the blended juice to be low. The effects of the process parameters on the quality showed that better quality of the blended juice can be obtained within the optimum temperature range of (50 - 70 °C) and enzyme concentration range (0. 12 - 0. 18 w/v).

40|$|<b>Papaya</b> (<b>pawpaw)</b> Carica <b>papaya</b> L. {{belongs to}} family Caricaceae. Papaya {{is a very}} good source of fruit sugar, vitamin A, B and C. This fruit is rich in {{minerals}} and salts and makes very good food. Fiji's climate is very suitable to grow papaya and Fijian grown papaya has a big export market. Main importing countries so far are New Zealand, Japan and Canada. Another potential country for exporting papaya from Fiji is Australia. However, strict quality control and high sanitary requirements must be met to export papaya to Australia. Papaya export has gone up in last few years but unfortunately there has been no export so far to Australia. Fruit's shape, size and smoothness are important determinant factors for export market. Misshapen fruits with bumps are not acceptable in overseas market. Similarly most importing countries prefer medium sized fruits. To get good quality papaya particularly fruits without bumps, it is necessary to apply Boron in soil. Results obtained in the present investigation showed that 5. 0 kg Boron (applied as borax pentahydrate) per hectare was very effective in reducing bumpiness to a very minimum thus improving the quality of fruits. Boron as such showed no effect on papaya yield per plant. Three cultivars tested for average fruit weight showed acceptable fruit weight for local and export market. However, Solo Sunrise was identified as the highest average fruit yielding cultivar (tons/hectare). Improvement in quality of papaya will open up new markets for export...|$|R

Pawpaw leaves contain {{a broad spectrum of}} phytochemicals such as enzyme (papain), alkaloids, and phenolics (Maisarah, Asmah, and Fauziah, 2014) and the anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, free radical scavenging, and anti-fungal activities of pawpaw had been reported (Ayoola and Adeyeye, 2010; Lim, 2012). Pawpaw has been identified as a natural antioxidant (Martial-Didier, Hubert, Parfait, and Kablan, 2017), and pawpaw leaves have been tested and found to contain essential ingredients capable of enhancing feed intake, feed utilization and suppression of pathogens’ growth (Akanmu and Adeyemo, 2012). Therefore, pawpaw leaf meal inclusion in rabbits’ diets could be of health benefits against oxidative stress and several diseases. Feed enzymes change the nutritional profile of feed ingredients; improve the digestibility of diets, increase the performance of the animals (Bedford and Gary, 2010; Bolis, Castrvilli, Rigoni, Tedesco, and Luzi, 1996; Fernandez, Merino, and Carabano, 1996), remove anti-nutritional factors effect and improve nutrient availability (Kiarie, Romero, and Nyachoti, 2013).

40|$|Fermentation is a {{biological}} method of preparing and preserving food which {{makes use of}} the bacteria and yeasts that are naturally present on fresh produce. It {{is one way of}} using up a seasonal glut in production and of conserving vegetable waste for animal feed. The process is simple. The vegetables to be fermented are sorted, washed, and either left whole or chopped up. They must not be treated with any kind of disinfectant. They are then immersed in brine or dry-salted under shade in the open air. The container can be quite rudimentary, so long as it can be hermetically sealed. Fermentation is spontaneous at ambient temperature, due to the lactic bacteria that are naturally present on fruit and vegetables, and provided that the concentration of sodium chloride is correct. This form of processing can be used for a variety of tropical fruits and vegetables. Lactic fermentation provides a new method of treating okra (Hibiscus esculentus) which results in a product similar to gherkins. Fermented <b>pawpaw</b> (Carica <b>papaya)</b> is similar to sauerkraut. It can be kept in brine for several months, and not only is it delicious but it also retains its vitamins and other nutrients. Mangoes that have been fermented can be used in chutneys, juices, syrups or jellies. The widespread use of this process in Trinidad has resulted in a 50 % reduction in the amount of fruit wasted when there is a seasonal glut. Guadeloupe Agricole Caraïbes Communication BP 2202, 97196 Jarry Cedex Bale-Mahaut, GUADELOUPEFermentation is {{a biological}} method of preparing and preserving food which makes use of the bacteria and yeasts that are naturally present on fresh produce.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the ability of using <b>pawpaw</b> (Carica <b>papaya)</b> seeds as a natural {{reproduction}} inhibitor for tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) culture to control its breeding. Biochemical, physiological and histopathological effects of pawpaw seeds on male tilapia fish were also determined. Mature male tilapia were stocked for 4 weeks and treated with low dose (3 g/kg/day) and high dose (6 g/kg/day) of ground dried pawpaw seeds mixed with their feed. The obtained {{results showed that the}} pawpaw seeds induced permanent sterility in the high dose treated fish while the low dose treatment showed reversible results. The results also demonstrated that fish treated with high dose of pawpaw exhibited higher biochemical and physiological effects as: low meat quality, a progressive fall in erythrocyte (RBCs) count, hemoglobin (Hb) content and haematocrit values. Also the high dose revealed {{a significant increase in the}} leukocytes (WBCs) count, serum glucose, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and uric acid levels. Moreover, serum total lipids revealed a significant decrease compared to control group. On the other hand, the low dose treatment revealed lower biochemical and physiological changes. Histological sections of testis showed disintegration of sperm cells and focal necrosis of seminefrous tubules in the high dose treated fish, hepato-pancreas and posterior kidney tissues also showed severe changes in high dose treated fish. Milder degenerative changes in some necrotic foci and slight changes in hepato-pancreas and posterior kidney were observed in the low dose treated fish. The study concluded that pawpaw seeds which are cheap and easy to obtain, can be incorporated into fish feeds with adjusted amount and be used to control breeding of tilapia fish in growing ponds instead of unfavorable and expensive hormonal use...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} total phenols, flavonoids and vitamins composition in {{a selection of}} fruits; {orange (Citrus sinensis), red apple (Mallus pumila), carrot (Daucus carota), pear (Pyrus calleryana), golden apple (Mallus pumila), <b>pawpaw</b> (Carica <b>papaya),</b> pineapple (Ananas comosus) and banana (Musa acuminate) } consumed in Alice region of South Africa. The antioxidative capacity of these fruits were also determined using ferric reducing power, Lipid Oxidation (LO), 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2 '-azino-bis- 3 ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic-acid (ABTS), Nitric Oxide (NO) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals. The contents of vitamin B 2, B 3 and vitamin C were also noted using standard methods. A significant variation in the phenols, flavonoids and vitamins contents across the fruit samples was observed. All the fruits tested besides pineapple showed a good reducing antioxidant power in a concentration dependent manner. The extracts of pawpaw, orange, banana and red apple relatively had higher antioxidant potential against DPPH and ABTS radicals among others. The fruits samples demonstrated considerable antioxidant potential against OH* and LO with IC 50 values range from 0. 511 - 1. 067 mg mL - 1 and 0. 53 - 0. 818 mg mL - 1, respectively. Some of the fruit samples depicted reasonable antiradical potential against NO* with IC 50 range from 1. 035 - 1. 513 mg mL - 1. The fruits extract contained relatively higher concentration of vitamin C, vitamin B 2 and vitamin B 3 whereas pineapple and red apple extracts had lower content of vitamin B 2. Unfortunately, both vitamins (B 2 and B 3) were not found in banana. The result of antioxidant activities of these fruits provide evidences to support consumption practice of fruits varieties {{in the region to}} compensate nutrient deficiency and therefore could be a useful source to prevent diseases related to oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} smoking of dried leaves of Carica <b>papaya</b> (<b>pawpaw)</b> based on ethnopharmacological information which indicated that smoking of papaya leaves could influence motor performance and learning. Methods: Twenty-four rats {{were used for the}} study, and were grouped into four groups. Groups 1 served as the control (not exposed to papaya leaves smoke), while Groups 2, 3 and 4 were exposed to smoke from 6. 25 g, 12. 50 g and 18. 75 g of dry pawpaw leaves respectively in a smoking chamber twice daily for 21 d with each exposure lasting for 3 min. Lastly, hippocampus was harvested in each group for histological study. Results: The results showed that there were significant (P< 0. 05) increases in mean of recall latencies of long-term spatial memory in the animal administered the high dose while the other groups had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower frequencies. Histological investigation showed signs of mild neural degeneration in high dose group and hypochromic appearance of the Nissl substance in all treated groups. Conclusions: In conclusion, the findings from this study has demonstrated that smoking of papaya leaves has the ability to maintain an intact long-term spatial memory at all doses but retrieving such memory is faster with the low and medium dosages...|$|R
