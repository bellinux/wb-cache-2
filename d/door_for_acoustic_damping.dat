40|$|The {{mechanism}} of separation during forming of steel/adhesive/steel laminated sheet used <b>for</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> {{depended on the}} ruling stresses and proximity of free edges. When bending occurred near a free edge, failure by shear at the interface was favoured. When bending, whether in deep drawing or by point loading, occurred remote from free ends and the resulting shear restraint in the adhesive was large, failure tended to occur by tensile separation occasioned by buckling of one sheet or {{by a combination of}} tension and shear. Tensile failure of the adhesive occurred by a void-growth mechanism reminiscent of that by which ductile failure occurs in metals. The stress required for delamination was decreased by prior plastic deformation of the adhesive in a manner which was virtually independent of strain history. © 1990...|$|R
40|$|Steel sheets bonded with a {{thin layer}} of a {{polymeric}} adhesive are used for their sound-deadening effect in applications such as machine enclosures and automobile bulk-heads. Unlike sandwich materials designed primarily for high rigidity, they are formed by conventional methods and the effect of the relative inability of the adhesive to transmit shear on formability of the sheet and conformity to the tool profile is important. The adhesive in sheet steel/adhesive/steel laminate used <b>for</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> displays viscoelasticity only at small strain, and strain hardening is associated with subsequent viscous flow. High forming speed is favourable to the forming of steel sheet laminate bonded with a viscoplastic polymeric adhesive because it increases the ability of the adhesive to transmit shear forces, which in turn increases the transverse stiffness of sheet laminates, although it increases springback (decreases the shape fixability of the laminate). At elevated temperature, the softening of the steel sheets {{as well as that of}} the adhesive is significant, decreasing the rigidity but improving the shape fixability of the laminate. © 1990...|$|R

Hydrophone records give the frequency, pressure amplitude, and decay characteristics of the sound produced by a single bubble.

Experiments were performed in a mixture of helium and argon, {{with a small amount of}} NO 2 (100 ppm level) added to generate sufficient signal levels through thermalization. Measurements were made as a function of both composition and pressure. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> rates were determined through model fits to the acquired signals. The results were compared with theoretical calculations using both classical <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> rates and a more comprehensive model that includes the additional diffusive mechanisms associated with binary mixtures of gases with widely different molecular weights.

40|$|Helmholtz {{resonators}} (HRs) {{are commonly}} used to damp thermoacous- tic oscillations in aero-engine and gas turbine combustors. In practice the HR is often maintained at a cooler temperature than the combustor, but this tends to be neglected when modelling. In this work, we derive an analytical model <b>for</b> both the <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> and {{the effect on the}} com- bustor thermoacoustics of HRs whose volume is at a different temperature to the combustor. The energy conservation equation based on stagnation enthalpy, together with the mass and momentum conservation equations, is incorporated into a linear HR sound absorption model.

The micro–scale part of the model describes the propagation of <b>damped</b> <b>acoustic</b> waves.

The stability of the {{amorphous state}} in relation with the local molecular mobility is important from both fundamental and practical points of view. The acoustic properties of amorphous progesterone, one of the representative steroid hormones, were investigated by using a Brillouin inelastic light scattering technique. The Brillouin spectrum of the longitudinal acoustic mode exhibited distinct changes at the glass transition and the cold-crystallization temperatures. The acoustic dispersions of the longitudinal sound velocity and the acoustic absorption coefficient were attributed to the fast and possibly the secondary relaxation processes in the glassy and supercooled liquid states, while the structural relaxation process was considered as the dominant origin <b>for</b> the significant <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> observed even in the liquid phase.

40|$|Combustion instabilities {{are caused}} by a {{coupling}} between acoustic waves and unsteady heat release. To suppress combustion instabilities, perforated liners {{can be used as}} acoustic dampers to dissipate acoustic waves. One drawback of them is that they tend to be effective only in certain frequency ranges and cannot respond to changes in operating conditions. In order to maintain high damping {{in the presence of a}} varying instability frequency, the tuning of perforated liners was experimentally investigated in this work. Both a combustor length parameter and the bias flow rate (the mean flow through the perforated holes) were varied simultaneously using a multiple-parameter tuning scheme. This involves developing two algorithms; one <b>for</b> characterizing the <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> of the liners in real-time, and another for determining the optimum actuation signals to vary the bias flow rate and combustor length.

40|$|The sound {{radiation}} properties of real normal modes {{are often used}} to characterise acoustic sources such as vibrating plates. The assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping is usually made and in consequence the eigenmodes are real. With {{the increasing use of}} high-performance composite structures and the demanding requirements <b>for</b> <b>acoustic</b> comfort, <b>damping</b> treatments such as constrained layer damping or embedded elastomer layers may be distributed locally at some critical locations of the vibrating structure. This violates the assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping and results in complex mode shapes. In this case, dynamics of the vibrating systems within the resonances is no longer dominated by pure standing waves, but also by a superposition with travelling waves. This paper presents the results of a numerical study on {{sound radiation}} properties of this phenom-enon, generally known as complex modes of vibration. The finite element model of an inhomoge-neously damped plate is used to generate and investigate complex vibration patterns. The level of modal complexity of the generated complex modes is characterized by the modal collinearity index and the spatial distribution of the standing wave ratio. The fluid structure interaction is implemented by a elemental radiator approach and used <b>for</b> the <b>acoustic</b> characterisation of vibration patterns in terms of far-field radiation efficiencies and spatial distributions of sound intensity.

40|$|The {{optimized}} {{design of}} bias flow liner {{is a key}} element for the development of low emission combustion systems in modern gas turbines and aero-engines. The research of bias flow liners has a fairly long history concerning both the parameter dependencies as well as the methods to model the acoustic behaviour of bias flow liners under the variety of different bias and grazing flow conditions. In order to establish an overview over the state of the art, this paper provides a comprehensive review about the published research on bias flow liners and modelling approaches with an extensive study of the most relevant parameters determining the acoustic behaviour of these liners. The paper starts with a historical description of available investigations aiming on the characterization of the bias flow absorption principle. This chronological compendium is extended by the recent and ongoing developments in this field. In a next step the fundamental acoustic property of bias flow liner in terms of the wall impedance is introduced and the different derivations and formulations of this impedance yielding the different published model descriptions are explained and compared. Finally, a parametric study reveals the most relevant parameters <b>for</b> the <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> behaviour of bias flow liners and how this is reflected by the various model representations. Although the general trend of the investigated acoustic behaviour is captured by the different models fairly well for a certain range of parameters, in the transition region between the resonance dominated and the purely bias flow related regime all models lack the correct damping prediction. This seems to be connected to the proper implementation of the reactance as a function of bias flow Mach number...|$|R

40|$|In porous layers {{saturated}} by air, {{the vibrations}} {{of the frame}} induced by an acoustic field in air can often be neglected, due to the large density of the frame. To a good approximation the frame can be considered motionless. The air inside the layer can be replaced by an equivalent fluid in which acoustic waves propagate more slowly than in free air. Similarly, electromagnetic waves propagate more slowly in dielectrics than in vacuum. The close analogy which exists between TM electromagnetic surface waves above grounded dielectrics and acoustic surface waves above a porous layer on a rigid impervious backing is displayed in this work. The velocity of air inside the layer close to the backing is parallel to this impervious and motionless surface, and the electric field close to the perfectly conducting backing is perpendicular to the plane. The correspondence relates perpendicular components of acoustic velocity and electric field. The losses in the equivalent fluid are neglected in a first approach to adapt the description of electromagnetic surface waves <b>for</b> <b>acoustics.</b> Subsequently the <b>damping</b> is taken into account.

The singing mitigation was attributed to filling up of the corrugations, interference with the boundary layer or due to the increased <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping.</b> To evaluate {{the influence of the}} presence of liquids on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping,</b> this damping was measured in a smooth and a corrugated tube (internal diameter 49 mm). The damping was measured using an active source (loudspeaker) and measuring amplitude of sound waves {{on both sides of the}} pipe. This was done at different gas velocities (U = 0, 15, 30 m/s) and different liquid injection rates (0, 150, 250 350 ml/min) for a frequency range between 0 - 2200 Hz. The smooth pipe results compared well with literature models such as the Kirchhoff model. In the presence of liquid, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>damping</b> increased linearly with the liquid rate. This increase was higher than expected based on the assumptions of mist flow or overall pressure drop. In case of the corrugated tube, the measured damping is dominated by a large fluctuation due to the source behavior (negative damping) at flowing conditions.
