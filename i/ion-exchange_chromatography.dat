5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography,</b> with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column.

40|$|Peroxidase was {{prepared}} from extracts of barley leaves and separated into seven components, different in pi. The purification procedure comprised two parts. The first part {{was based on}} the fact that all the components had practically the same molecular weights. It consisted of fractionations with acetone and ammonium sulfate, <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatographies</b> on CM-cellulose and DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B, and molecular-sieve chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 44; the components were all purified together to near homogeneity on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the procedure resulted in 1, 200 -fold puri-fication with a yield of 39 %. The <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatographies</b> were carried out under conditions such that the components would not be adsorbed.

25|$|The water {{coming out}} of the column is {{relatively}} rich in sodium ions and poor in calcium and magnesium which are retained on the column. The column is regenerated by passing a strong solution of sodium chloride through it, so that the resin–sodium complex is again formed on the column. <b>Ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> utilizes a resin such as chelex 100 in which iminodiacetate residues, attached to a polymer backbone, form chelate complexes of differing strengths with different metal ions, allowing the ions such as Cu2+ and Ni2+ to be separated chromatographically.|$|E
25|$|In <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> (IC), {{retention}} {{is based}} on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Solute ions of the same charge as the charged sites on the column are excluded from binding, while solute ions of the opposite charge of the charged sites of the column are retained on the column. Solute ions that are retained on the column can be eluted from the column by changing the solvent conditions (e.g. increasing the ion effect of the solvent system by increasing the salt concentration of the solution, increasing the column temperature, changing the pH of the solvent, etc...).|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> is given by the NTRC using {{sulfonated}} polystyrene as a matrix, adding the amino acids in acid solution and passing a buffer of steadily increasing pH through the column. Amino acids are eluted when the pH reaches their respective isoelectric points. Once the amino acids have been separated, their respective quantities are determined by adding a reagent that will form a coloured derivative. If the amounts of amino acids are in excess of 10 nmol, ninhydrin {{can be used for}} this; it gives a yellow colour when reacted with proline, and a vivid purple with other amino acids. The concentration of amino acid is proportional to the absorbance of the resulting solution. With very small quantities, down to 10 pmol, fluorescent derivatives can be formed using reagents such as ortho-phthaldehyde (OPA) or fluorescamine.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarity}} in ionic radius between adjacent lanthanide elements {{makes it difficult}} to separate them from each other in naturally occurring ores and other mixtures. Historically, the very laborious processes of cascading and fractional crystallization were used. Because the lanthanide ions have slightly different radii, the lattice energy of their salts and hydration energies of the ions will be slightly different, leading to a small difference in solubility. Salts of the formula Ln(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O can be used. Industrially, the elements are separated from each other by solvent extraction. Typically an aqueous solution of nitrates is extracted into kerosene containing tri-n-butylphosphate. The strength of the complexes formed increases as the ionic radius decreases, so solubility in the organic phase increases. Complete separation can be achieved continuously by use of countercurrent exchange methods. The elements can also be separated by <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography,</b> making use {{of the fact that the}} stability constant for formation of EDTA complexes increases for log K ≈ 15.5 for − to log K ≈ 19.8 for −.|$|E
500|$|Praseodymium {{may then}} be {{separated}} from the other lanthanides via <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography,</b> or by using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate where the solubility of Ln3+ increases as the atomic number increases. If <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> is used, the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation-exchange resin and Cu2+ or Zn2+ or Fe3+ is loaded into the other. An aqueous solution of a complexing agent, known as the eluant (usually triammonium edtate), is passed through the columns, and Ln3+ is displaced from the first column and redeposited in a compact band {{at the top of the}} column before being re-displaced by [...] The Gibbs free energy of formation for Ln(edta·H) complexes increases along the lanthanides by about one quarter from Ce3+ to Lu3+, so that the Ln3+ cations descend the development column in a band and are fractionated repeatedly, eluting from heaviest to lightest. They are then precipitated as their insoluble oxalates, burned to form the oxides, and then reduced to the metals.|$|E

2500|$|EDTA {{was used}} in {{separation}} of the lanthanide metals by <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>chromatography.</b> [...] Perfected by F.H. Spedding et al. in 1954, the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide EDTA complexes with atomic number. Using sulfonated polystyrene beads and copper(II) as a retaining ion, EDTA causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanide. The lanthanides elute in order of decreasing atomic number. Due to the expense of this method, relative to counter-current solvent extraction, ion-exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanide (typically greater than 4N, 99.99%).|$|E
2500|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile.

Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. [...] In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C18) to the surface of [...] irregularly or spherically shaped 5 μm diameter silica particles.|$|E
