5|$|On {{a sticky}} wicket, Toshack {{initially}} struggled, bowling his characteristic leg stump line. England struggled to 117 {{runs for the}} loss of five wickets (5/117) {{at the end of the}} fourth day despite many interruptions caused by rain. Norman Yardley and captain Wally Hammond had defied the Australian bowlers since coming together at 5/66. On the fifth and final morning, captain Don Bradman advised him to pitch straighter and at a slower pace. Before play began Bradman took him down the pitch and showed him <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wanted him to bowl and even make him bowl a practice over alongside to make sure he got it right. Having started the day wicketless, Toshack dismissed Yardley and Hammond in the space of 13 runs to break the English resistance and finished with an economical 3/17 from 17 overs as England were bowled out for 141. Bradman enforced the follow-on, and with Lindwall indisposed, Toshack took the new ball with Miller. He continued where he finished in the first innings, taking four of the first six wickets (Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Hammond and Yardley) as the English top order were reduced to 6/65. He ended the innings with 6/82 as England were bowled out twice in a day to lose by an innings and 332 runs. The remaining four Tests were less successful: only in one innings did he take more than one wicket. In the Second Test at Sydney the pitch favoured spin bowling and Toshack only bowled 13 overs without taking a wicket as Australia claimed another innings victory. He took match figures of 2/127 on a flat pitch in the Third Test in Melbourne, removing Len Hutton and Compton. During the match, Toshack came in to bat in the second innings with Australia nine wickets down. He defended stubbornly and ended unbeaten on two as his partner Lindwall went from 81 to 100 to score the fastest Test century by an Australian, in 88 balls. Toshack was more productive in the drawn Fourth Test in Adelaide, where he took match figures of 5/135 from 66 eight ball overs in extreme heat, including the wicket of Hammond twice, Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior. Ahead of the final Test, Toshack removed Compton, Edrich and Godfrey Evans in a drawn match for Victoria against the tourists. He took only one wicket in the Fifth Test as Australia sealed the series 3–0 with a five-wicket win. Toshack finished the series with 17 wickets at a bowling average of 25.71. His first-class season was not as productive as in his debut year; he took 33 wickets at an average of 30.93 in eleven matches, making him the sixth highest wicket-taker for the season. Toshack had a particularly unsuccessful time in the two Sheffield Shield matches against arch-rivals Victoria, which were lost by heavy margins of an innings and 114 runs, and 288 runs respectively. In the first match he took 0/133 after Australian team-mate Miller hit three sixes from his opening over. In the second match he took a total of 3/144. Victoria went on to win the title.|$|E

January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is no doubt that he knew <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641.

500|$|While {{the first}} book was being released, Tripathi started work on {{the second part of}} the trilogy, then titled The Naga Secret. Tripathi wanted to start the story from <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> ended in {{the first book}}, with Sati's fate being revealed. He also wanted to expand the {{geography}} of the story, allowing the characters to travel far East of India and also far South to the land of the Nagas, an ancient empire that existed more than five thousand years ago and was filled with eternal wars and the legend of a blue-throated god who would save the world. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror in July 2011, he clarified that it was difficult for him to do research about the geographical situations of India in 4000 BC in just one year, so he relied on his own knowledge and that of his relatives. [...] "I was an atheist till eight years ago, but I have always been surrounded by relatives with immense faith, so scriptures are something I have inadvertently grown up with and learned", he added. The mythological and the technical aspects included in the story also came from Tripathi's habit of reading storybooks on history and ancient technology; he was helped by his father, who is a scientist. Tripathi quit his job as a banker while writing the book, dedicating his whole time to the book.|$|E

5000|$|Lukewarm reviews {{praised the}} {{ambition}} but questioned the execution {{and integrity of}} the film, with Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian commenting, [...] "It's a poignant story of sundered love, earnest and intense, without being exactly tragic, and although writer-director David Lowery interestingly refuses certain romantic cliches, you wonder if <b>he</b> knows <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he's</b> going with the narrative." [...] The review in LA Times was particularly critical of the narrative, stating that [...] "eventhough Lowery is skillful with dialogue, there are ways he ties the events together that are knotty. The first is the most problematic. Though a natural fall guy is right at their feet, felled by the cops and long past complaining about issues like loyalty and betrayal, Bob grabs the gun that shot the sheriff. Lowery is intent that the couple will grapple {{with the idea of}} responsibility, whatever frustrations with logic that might pose for the rest of us." [...] A.A Dowd of the A. V. Club gave the film a C+, criticizing Lowery for being too eager to emulate Malick, maintaining that [...] "upstart David Lowery mimics the mythic methodology of his revered elder, drowning the sparse tale of an on-the-run convict and his lonely baby’s mama in lots of dreamy, magic-hour atmosphere." ...|$|R

An intense firefight ensued, and the Italians were driven back. Several paratroopers were wounded before Gavin and his men were able to gradually disengage.

I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long.

2500|$|In Don Bradman's {{time as an}} Australian batsmen {{before the}} war England won 13 Ashes Tests to Australia's 10, some of them by huge margins. He made his debut in the First Test of 1928–29, making 18 and 1 as Australia were beaten by a record 675 runs. In their last Test before the war England had made 903/7 – Wally Hammond waiting the Don was unfit to bat before he {{declared}} – and Australia lost by an innings and 579 runs, another record. Bradman was not the man to forget such things and now he had the better team {{he was determined to}} repay the favour. The First Test of 1946–47 saw Australia win their largest victory over England by an innings and 332 runs, {{the first time that a}} Test team had lost and won successive Tests by an innings, albeit with a ten-year gap due to the war. As a captain Bradman had few rivals, tough, shrewd and rarely missing a trick. He liked to play aggressive cricket, racking up huge scores with his batting then bowling the opposition out. While fielding Bradman carefully watched batsmen play, and if he saw a weakness he would call over the bowlers to tell them and reset his field accordingly. In the First Test at Brisbane he even took Ernie Toshack down the pitch, showed him <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wanted him to bowl and make him bowl a practice over alongside the pitch before play, after which the left-armer took 9 of the 15 English wickets to fall that day. He was often criticised for being distant and removed from his team and too conscious of his superiority, [...] "a star with ten extras". However, he built the 1946–47 team from scratch, gave them encouragement, and made them Bradman-minded; [...] "When you get in front, nail 'em into the ground. When you get 'em down, never let up." [...] By 1948 he had moulded them into one of the great teams in cricket history, nicknamed The Invincables as they won the 1948 Ashes series 4–0 and were undefeated on tour. He retired at the end of the 1948–49 season and is the only Australian to be knighted for his services to cricket.|$|E

2500|$|Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook {{went out}} to bat with thunder {{in the air and}} Hutton never settled down to the short-pitched bowling of Lindwall and Miller and was bowled for 7 in “a real shock attack…Miller’s success was gained by one ball of {{perfection}} mixed with many of faulty direction which had England’s record holder twisting and turning in a most unbatsmanlike fashion”. Soon after Bill Edrich came out play was stopped for bad light as a thunderstorm broke over the ground. Play resumed only 10 minutes late the next day, but [...] "England were twice caught on sticky wickets. They stood no chance. On a typical Brisbane sticky the good length ball and the half-volley became almost unplayable. Sometimes it rose chest high. At others it skidded along the ground." [...] In their [...] "opening blitz" [...] Keith Miller dug the ball in short and [...] "nearly every ball from Lindwall rose head high". “Edrich batted for 105 minutes. He suffered more than 40 body blows with a nonchalant contempt for danger and seemed content to be battered black and blue rather than lose his wicket. It was grim concentration and unflinching courage of the type rarely seen in Australia, and he was undaunted even after a terrific sickener under the ribs from Miller". [...] He was out for 16, but Alan Kippax said it was [...] "one of the best knocks he had ever witnessed" [...] and worthy of a century. Wally Hammond had made his finest innings just such a wicket at Melbourne in 1936-37 while making 32 and here made the same number of runs, which Arthur Morris called it [...] "the most thorough batting lesson he had ever received" [...] Ray Lindwall wrote that Hammond and Edrich [...] "were hit on the body repeatedly. Their concentration never faltered and their skill never waned...This was vintage batting of a kind that probably no Australian could produce". Miller used a limited leg-trap and an English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline, to the anger of Vic Richardson, Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing. Miller slowed his pace as the ball leapt so much that it could hit the batsman, but not get them out and dismissed all five batsman that day, his 7/60 in the innings remaining his best return for Australia {{for the rest of his}} career. Only three hours play were allowed that day and just after Hammond and Yardley walked off after appealing for light a second thunderstorm hit Brisbane. [...] "Those who huddled in the pavilion...will never forget (as will the residents of Brisbane, who lost thousands of planes of glass) the darkness that came over the ground and the roar of the storm coming in the distance. This was the day when jagged pieces of hail, as big as cricket balls, plummeted on the ground, and the covers and the stumps went swirling away in the flood". In 30 minutes the ground was a lake with the water almost reaching the height of the picket fence on the boundary. At any other venue the game would have ended, but the drought-stricken ground soaked up most of the water overnight, the Queensland sun soon dried out the ground and play began on time at noon, much to the surprise to some pressmen and players who arrived late. Ernie Toshack's left-arm medium pace should have won him a hatful of wickets the previous day, but he could not bowl as Bradman suggested. So, before play began Bradman took him down the pitch and showed him <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wanted him to bowl and even make him bowl a practice over alongside to make sure he got it right. Resuming on 117/5 Hammond and Yardley were both out to Toshack (3/17), the Yorkshire vice-captain after a gritty innings of 29 over two hours, and Miller wrapped up the tail to have England out for 141.|$|E
