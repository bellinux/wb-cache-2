25|$|One of the APL {{ships in}} World War II still survives. SS Lane Victory <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Victory</b> ship which is {{preserved}} {{as a museum}} ship in the San Pedro area of Los Angeles, California. As a rare surviving Victory ship, she is a US National Historic Landmark. The Lane Victory was built by the California Shipbuilding Corporation in Los Angeles, California and launched on 31 May 1945.|$|E
25|$|The SS Red Oak Victory <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Victory</b> ship {{preserved}} as {{a museum}} ship. It was one of 414 Victories built during World War II (constructed at the Richmond Shipyards), but {{one of only a}} few of these ships to be transferred from the Merchant Marine to the U.S. Navy. The vessel issued cargo and munitions to various ships in the fleet throughout 1945. During a hazardous tour of duty in the Pacific, SS Red Oak Victory handled many tons of ammunition, supplying the fleet without a single casualty.|$|E
25|$|Any prey {{that has}} the ability to jump or fly away will always be more {{effective}} in escaping than non-flying insects like the termites. However, many times those that do escape will still lose a leg or other appendage in the process, like 60% of the grasshoppers in this experiment. Because the prey is so much larger than the ants, even just getting this one appendage as a food source <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory.</b> For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{circumstances of}} this Nike's creation are not clearly known. Either {{she served as}} an acroterion or she must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> monument. Although no Parian victory {{is known to have}} occurred around 470/60 BC, {{the fact that it is}} carved all the way round makes it more likely that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> monument.|$|R
500|$|The Cubs Win Flag <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> {{flag that}} is flown at Wrigley Field after every Chicago Cubs home win. The flag is {{variously}} {{referred to by}} approximately a dozen names, combining: [...] either Cubs or Chicago Cubs; Win, W, White, White W, or W Win; and flag, banner or banner flag. Other common names for the symbol include Chicago Cubs W Win Flag and Chicago Cubs Win Banner Flag. [...] It has become an important symbol for fans and days when the win flag is flown are known as [...] "White Flag Days". The tradition of flying a win or loss flag over the stadium began soon after {{the construction of the}} scoreboard in 1937.|$|E
500|$|In December 2015, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals {{struck down}} the {{disparagement}} prohibition in the trademark law in a case (Matal v. Tam) involving a denial of trademark registration to the Asian-American band The Slants. The majority opinion stated, in part, that [...] "hatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here, or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find speech likely to offend others." [...] On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously {{ruled in favor of}} Tam, stating [...] "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech." [...] On June 29, 2017, both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department withdrew from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot. While team owner Daniel Snyder expresses the opinion that the court decision <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> for the team, the Executive Director of the NCAI asserts that the name remains a slur, and the decision that grants it First Amendment protection does not alter any of the arguments against its continued use.|$|E
500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory.</b> I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

2500|$|A Pyrrhic victory ( [...] ) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> that inflicts such {{a devastating}} {{toll on the}} victor that it is {{tantamount}} to defeat.

WSPA UK's director Suzi Morris said: [...] "This is fantastic news and greatly welcomed.

In a statement, Ayyadurai said that [...] "history will reflect that this settlement <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> for truth". Biddle denounced the settlement and said he fully stood by his reporting. Denton wrote that [...] "we expected to prevail" [...] in the Ayyadurai and Terrill lawsuits, [...] "but all-out legal war with" [...] billionaire Peter Thiel, who financially backed Harder, was untenable in terms of cost, time and human toll.|$|E

However, speaking on Israeli army radio, Justice Minister Haim Ramon - a close confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert - said [...] "everyone understands that a victory for Hezbollah <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> for world terror." [...] He said that in order to prevent casualties amongst Israeli soldiers battling Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah positions should be targeted by the Israeli air force before ground troops move in. [...] "All those now in south Lebanon are terrorists who are related in some way to Hezbollah," [...] Mr Ramon said. Mr Ramon's call for the use of greater firepower came as the Israeli cabinet was set to decide whether to broaden its military offensive.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{script was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in March 2008, leading to a review by Ain't It Cool News which called it [...] " [...] just a good adaptation of a difficult book [...] a genre-defining piece of work that could well see us all arguing {{about whether or not}} a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material". The review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men, following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are [...] "starting to wonder if survival <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> of any kind." [...] Straczynski had hoped that the film would begin production by the start of 2009. In March 2009, Forster said that the script was still in development and he was not sure if World War Z would be his next film. Later in March, rumors surfaced that production offices were set up and the film was in early pre-production. In June 2009, Marc Forster told an interviewer that the film would be delayed, stating that the film's script still needs a lot of development and is [...] "still far from realization".|$|E
2500|$|Such was the {{expectation}} that Labor would lose, many senior Labor figures openly told Keating that {{his job was to}} save as many seats as possible, so that their time in opposition would be short. Despite the overwhelming predictions that Labor would lose, Keating succeeded in winning over the electorate with a strong campaign opposing 'Fightback!' and a focus on creating jobs to reduce unemployment. In particular, Keating focused a great deal of his campaign on attacking the proposed goods and services tax, arguing that it would make unemployment worse and would prove [...] "a dead weight" [...] on the economy. He was helped in this by his opponent, John Hewson, struggling {{towards the end of the}} campaign to explain exactly which products would have the GST levied on them, and which would not. Having begun the campaign an average of ten points behind the Liberal/National Coalition, Keating led Labor to an unexpected and record-breaking fifth consecutive election victory on 13 March 1993. The speech Keating delivered at the victory celebration has been described as one of the great Labor speeches. Opening with [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> for the true believers", the speech has been described as providing a source of inspiration for the party faithful, but also criticised as helping to create a perception that Keating's Labor government was not a government for all Australians.|$|E
