25|$|Although the Judiciary Act of 1789 gave courts {{the power}} to issue writs, the writ of coram nobis {{developed}} slowly. The writ was acknowledged as early as 1834 by the United States Supreme Court when it recognized that its counterpart, the writ of coram vobis, might be available in state courts to challenge an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Despite this early acknowledgment, the writ of coram nobis, at least federally, was a rather archaic vehicle for relief. In 1881, the United States Supreme Court recognized {{the availability of the}} writ as common-law writ but acknowledged it was not utilized by the courts and even questioned its availability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{courts have}} {{established}} that the writ of coram nobis is of very limited scope. [...] It is a discretionary writ which is addressed to the trial court. [...] The purpose of the writ {{is to give the}} trial court an opportunity to correct its own record of an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> not appearing on the record and which error would not have been committed by the court if the matter had been {{brought to the attention of}} the trial court.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{the law has}} {{developed}} {{to a point where}} [...] "it is now possible to say that material <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> leading to unfairness constitutes a discrete ground for judicial review". In E v.

[...] To succeed in such a challenge, four essential requirements must be met: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{constitute}} {{grounds for the}} issuance of a writ of coram nobis there must be shown {{the existence of an}} <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> which was unknown at the time of trial and which is of such a nature that knowledge of its existence at the time of trial would have prevented the entry of judgment. [...] The writ does not lie to correct errors of law and of fact appearing on the record since such errors are traditionally corrected by appeals and writs of error. [...] Where the writ of habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not be granted.|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{criticism}} of the E v. Home Secretary approach is that [...] "it might undermine the important principle of finality". Moreover, the fear of opening the floodgates of litigation could be another pressing concern. These worries were expressed by the UK courts in Shaheen v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005) and in MT (Algeria) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2007). In MT (Algeria), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{went so far as}} to warn against embracing this ground of review as it might have the effect of [...] "turn what is a simple <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> into an error of law by asserting some new fact which is itself contentious".|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{judicial}} review of administrative action is limited to cases involving errors of law and not errors of fact. The courts are primarily concerned with the legality of decisions, and not with their merits. The first {{reason for this is}} based on the doctrine of separation of powers, the courts are in no position to decide on a fact when the power to do so has been assigned to another body. This was articulated in Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), where Lord Brightman stated that [...] "it is the duty of the court to leave the decision of that fact to the public body to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision-making power save in a case where {{it is obvious that the}} public body, consciously or unconsciously, are acting perversely". The second reason is that the courts may not have the necessary expertise to assess the factual situation. Hence, the courts consider it best to leave any interpretation of facts up to those assigned by Parliament to do so. However, the court reviews an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> when there is an error as to a jurisdictional or precedent fact, the court has taken into account irrelevant considerations or a decision has been based on no evidence or an error of material fact.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> committed by public authorities differently from <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law. While <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> are alleged.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the writ of coram nobis at common law was to correct <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{on the part of}} the trial court, not attributable to the negligence of the defendant, when the <b>errors</b> alleged were <b>of</b> the most fundamental character; that is, such as rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid. [...] The writ of provides a petitioner the opportunity to correct <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> not apparent on the face of the record and unknown to the trial court. [...] In reviewing a petition for such a writ, there is a presumption that the proceeding in question was without error, and the petitioner bears the burden of showing otherwise.|$|R
2500|$|A writ denied {{in a lower}} {{state court}} may be appealed. [...] A writ of coram nobis remains a civil action in Maryland, {{independent}} of the underlying action from which it arose. [...] As a coram nobis case is an independent civil action, an appeal from a final judgment in such an action is authorized by the broad language of the general appeals statute, Code § 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. [...] An appeal under the general appeals statutes would lie from a final trial court judgment in a coram nobis proceeding. [...] Although the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes appeals in coram nobis cases brought by an incarcerated person [...] "challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of imprisonment," [...] neither the Post Conviction Procedure Act nor any other statute which has been called to our attention restricts the right of appeal for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence {{of his or her}} conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds. Such person should be able to file a motion for coram nobis relief regardless of whether the alleged infirmity in the conviction is considered an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> or an error of law.|$|E

60|$|It {{may be said}} in objection, {{that the}} error in these cases was in the minor premise, not the major; an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> not of principle; {{that it did not}} consist in supposing that what is inconceivable can not be true, but in supposing {{antipodes}} to be inconceivable, when present experience proves that they can be conceived. Even if this objection were allowed, and the proposition that what is inconceivable can not be true were suffered to remain unquestioned as a speculative truth, it would be a truth on which no practical consequence could ever be founded, since, on this showing, it is impossible to affirm of any proposition, not being a contradiction in terms, that it is inconceivable. Antipodes were really, not fictitiously, inconceivable to our ancestors: they are indeed conceivable to us; and as the limits of our power of conception have been so largely extended, by the extension of our experience and the more varied exercise of our imagination, so may posterity find many combinations perfectly conceivable to them which are inconceivable to us. But, as beings of limited experience, we must always and necessarily have limited conceptive powers; while it does not by any means follow that the same limitation obtains in the possibilities of Nature, nor even in her actual manifestations.|$|E
