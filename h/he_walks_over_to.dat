50|$|Some {{time later}} in the bar he used to frequent, Miley walks up to {{a man at the}} bar and offers him a box of matches, the same as he was offered, with the Hellgramite Method ad on it.

50|$|Bosko becomes {{soaked in}} booze and inebriated. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the pigs and they sing Sweet Adeline together, barbershop style. The father pig {{launches}} into One Little Drink again, {{but the effort}} causes him to belch up a corn cob. Looking embarrassed, he uses his belly button like a knob {{to open the door}} to his stomach and puts the cob back inside.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{where the}} mate stood, {{close to the}} wheelhouse, giving {{directions}} to the pilot of the Rainbow.|$|R

5000|$|The {{very first}} {{commercial}} {{set the tone}} of the advertising campaign. Mr. Whipple is seen looking {{around the corner of the}} super market(either he is at the checkout or stocking shelves) at a female customer, commenting that first she's squeezing the tomatoes, then she's squeezing the melons, and then (in a classic comic [...] "triple") when she gets to the Charmin, that's the last straw, and <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her and utters his famous plea [...] "Please don't squeeze the Charmin!" [...] for the first time.|$|E

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the stall}} and buys a cupcake, unaware that a giant Chieftain tank has just {{appeared}} on the car park and that the crushing sound he hears is his own car being crushed. After the tank leaves, Bean turns around, does a double take, drops his cake on the ground, {{and walks over to}} his Mini slowly with a sad look on his face.

60|$|I didn't like this, and I don't think Rectus did, either. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{one of the}} windows, {{and looked}} out into the street.|$|R

50|$|Good and Beauty {{approach}} {{each other}} with daggers and soon run into each other. They get tangled up, and soon start to resemble a bull. Up above, tangled in the Caduceus, Truth is angry at them. He puts on a labcoat, and the Caduceus transforms into a chemistry coil. Good and Beauty soon appear to transform into a machine, tank treads, nuts and rivets appearing across their bodies, much to Truth's dismay. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a chalkboard and begins to write formulas on it. As he does, it grows and grows, and eventually takes on {{the shape of a}} giant nuclear bomb, 100 times his size, pointed down at them. He doesn't notice it initially until it begins to tick. The ticking builds and builds as the three look on, terrified. It soon explodes, and the three men change back. Horrified by this vision, they immediately leave the island.|$|E
50|$|This episode {{looks at}} the {{different}} stages of death. Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. House compares these steps to the woman that Cameron is treating. He urges Cameron to tell her patient that she is dying. This can also {{be compared to the}} relationship House has with Stacy. At first they refused to work with each other.

In the end we find House contemplating. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his board and erases the 5 steps of death, He stops at depression and thinks again.

6000|$|Hutchinson {{laughed as}} he got up on his feet. It was a nervous, {{apprehensive}} laugh. It was a case where it was more awkward to win than lose. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his partner, who whirled upon him fiercely:- ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{opens to}} an old house on a barren hill; within sits the Mad Musician at his piano, playing Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2. A tree branch climbs through the window, and, at the Musician's magical behest, plays the keys. But the branch's playing of [...] "Shake your Powder Puff" [...] visibly disappoints the Musician, who then plays some more, disappoints himself, and cries out for inspiration, {{laughing}} madly: <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a table, taps {{the bottom of a}} bottle, and out pops a frog, which the Musician bewitches, as the branch before, into playing. But the frog disappoints his master with a rendition of [...] "Amaryllis", and so happily leaps off of the keys and away into a picture of a pond. The Musician makes a portrait of a man in uniform to play a violin, which the painted figure breaks, to the Mad Musician's further aggravation. The cackling madman stalks about in contemplation.|$|E
5000|$|Next he {{performed}} [...] "My Way" [...] {{dressed in the}} attire from his video doing similar routines after the song begun a dance break where Usher and his dancer began breakdancing. He changed wardrobe and appears on the small stage wearing a black dress shirt, black fedora a and white studded pants singing [...] "Follow Me". This leads [...] "That's What It's Made For", before he goes into his next song he shows gratitude to his audience. He begins singing excerpts from [...] "Superstar" [...] {{with the help of}} his background singers while on top of the small stage. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the circular staircase where his mic stand is and he begins singing [...] "Nice & Slow". The mini platform lifts him in the sky as he begins to sing [...] "U Got it Bad". Next he introduces his eight dancers into him singing [...] "U Don't Have to Call".|$|E
5000|$|Following a chase {{scene in}} the Métro by several {{disguised}} cops and a goodbye visit to Jane, he drives to Rey's home, {{which turns out to}} be the same house in which the piano player lives. Costello kills Rey and drives to the nightclub. This time he makes no attempt to conceal his presence. He even checks his hat but does not accept the hat-check ticket. Having put on his white gloves in full view of everyone, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the stage where Valérie advises him to leave. When he pulls out his gun and points it at her, she quietly asks [...] "Why, Jef?" [...] and he replies, [...] "I was paid to." [...] After a moment of tension, the audience hears gunshots, but not from his gun. Costello falls to the ground and dies. A junior police officer tells Valérie she is lucky the police were there because otherwise Costello would have killed her.

60|$|During the {{remainder}} of the day Vane was busy on board the sloop, but in the evening <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Horsfield's house with Mrs. Nairn and found Jessy and her brother at home. Horsfield presently took Vane to his smoking-room.|$|R
60|$|Joe was not quick-witted, but on {{the battlefields}} of France he had learned prompt {{obedience}} to orders. Josie, as a government agent, was now his commander, so he merely nodded <b>to</b> her as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> unlock the outer door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect {{all that}} we want is right here," [...] he said. And {{at the sight of}} the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled. Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.|$|R
5000|$|The {{common theme}} was {{of an average}} man (played by Michael Palin in the {{original}} television version, but in later live versions by Eric Idle) who expresses dissatisfaction with his current job (as a barber, weatherman, pet shop owner, etc.) and then announces, [...] "I didn't want to be given profession. I wanted to be... a lumberjack!" [...] He proceeds {{to talk about the}} life of a lumberjack ("Leaping from tree to tree"), and lists various trees (e.g. larch, fir, Scots pine, and others that don't actually exist). Ripping off his coat to reveal a red flannel shirt, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a stage with a coniferous forest backdrop, and he begins to sing about the wonders of being a lumberjack in British Columbia. Then, he is unexpectedly backed up by a small choir of male singers, all dressed as Canadian Mounties (several were regular Python performers, while the rest were generally members of an actual singing troupe, such as the Fred Tomlinson Singers in the TV version).|$|E
5000|$|Next, Porky {{is lying}} in a {{hospital}} bed with a thermometer sticking out of his mouth (which later {{turns out to be a}} lollipop) as Daffy is examining him. Daffy is listening to Porky's heartbeat with a giant ragged stethoscope. After Daffy pulls the [...] "thermometer" [...] out of Porky's mouth, Porky tries to tell him that he's not sick and that he feels fine, but Daffy ignores him and thrusts the lollipop back into his mouth. He then states that he must hold a consultation in order to decide what to do about Porky. He then knocks himself on the head with a mallet and two ghostly images of himself appear. They begin to discuss what should be done about Porky when they all agree that an operation is in order. Daffy reaches into his medical bag and pulls out a big saw. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Porky, pulls the covers down, lifts his gown and attempts to cut him open. As soon as Porky sees what Daffy's intentions are, he panics and yells, [...] "Hey! W-W-What's the big idea?" ...|$|E
50|$|Ray is forcefully told by {{the gang}} to give the police a false lead on the radio to throw them off. Inadvertently, he tips off his wife {{that he may be}} in danger by saying to tell his wife the newborn kid can be named Dexter, which his wife finds {{suspicious}} due to his previous statements that he'd name the newborn Dexter only if he'd had a gun to his head. Kluger tells Lefty and Nick to force Williams to call off the search for him, but Williams and MacDonald subdue and tie up the henchmen. They call out to Kluger to come to them, awaiting to try and shoot him, but in the ensuing gunfight, Kluger shoots Ray in the knee. Williams decides to climb up the wall and hang over the door, as MacDonald tries to bait Kluger to come to them. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the door, Ray jumps up and lands on Kluger, but Kluger overpowers him and hits him with a chair. Kluger goes outside to see that a plane with Tony is nearby, waving to him to land. However, as he comes back inside, he sees that Carol has a gun. Telling her to drop the gun, he yells at her to not shoot, but Carol shoots him twice, killing him. Ray gets up and thanks her, while saying that he will deal with Tony.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} suggestion. What a funny formal little note we should think it now! It was not funny to Stephen--then. He read it, and {{he read it}} again, and finally <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the window, still holding it in his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the window. 'I {{must give}} her time!' he thought; then seized by unreasoning terror at this silence, spun round, and caught {{her by the}} arms. Rozsi held back from him, swayed forward and buried her face on his breast....|$|R
60|$|Alured {{was well}} again, but inert and crushed, and heartless about doing anything, except that <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Spinney Lawn, and brought home Trevor's dog, {{to which he}} gave himself up all day, and insisted on having it in his room at night.|$|R
