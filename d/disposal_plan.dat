The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed €1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for €1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for €1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market {{with some of them}} being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for €6 billion.

The report specifically accused GSA of not moving to redevelop the property during a real estate boom in 2006.

With pressure building on the White House to deal with billions {{of dollars worth of}} excess or underutilized federal property, the Barack Obama administration said it would take action to more quickly dispose of property like the Old Post Office. Rather than sell property at fire sale prices, the administration created a new independent advisory panel to help create a <b>disposal</b> <b>plan</b> for each individual building. D.C. area lawmakers pressed the advisory panel to act immediately on the Old Post Office. Douglas Firstenberg, a principal with StonebridgeCarras, a real estate property management firm that helped the federal government lease buildings, said that historic preservation restrictions and the large number of existing tenants made redevelopment difficult.|$|E

50|$|On January 22, 2016 the Obama {{administration}} announced {{new regulations}} for emissions from {{oil and gas}} on federal lands to be regulated by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to decrease impacts made on global warming and climate change. This {{became known as the}} “BLM fracking rule”, and would take effect on March 31 extending into Federal, Indian, and Public lands. This rule would apply to more than 750 million areas of Federal and Indian lands and regulated chemical disclosure, well integrity, and flowback water management. This rule would require companies to identify the chemicals being used in hydraulic fracturing and their purpose. This requirement would only extend to chemicals used after, not before, fracking to protect company chemical mix recipes. But, not knowing the chemicals beforehand eliminates the government's ability to test the water for a baseline reading to know if the process is contaminating water sources or not. Well integrity is vital to ensure that oil, gas, and other fracking chemicals are not being leached into direct drinking water sources. The rule would require operators to submit a cement bond log to ensure that drinking water has been properly isolated from the water that will be used. Finally, the BLM requires companies to provide their estimated waste water totals along with a <b>disposal</b> <b>plan.</b> The fracking rule was met with critiques for not requiring more transparency from corporations on chemicals being used before drilling into wells.|$|E
