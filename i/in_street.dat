5000|$|During the Georgian era more {{sections}} of the Rows were blocked, especially by commercial development {{on the north side}} of Watergate <b>Street.</b> <b>In</b> 1808 Thomas Harrison designed the Commercial Coffee Room <b>in</b> Northgate <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> neoclassical style, with an arcade at the ground-floor level, rather than continuing the Row on the first floor. In 1859-60 Chester Bank was built <b>in</b> Eastgate <b>Street,</b> again obliterating its part of the Row. [...] However other architects continued the tradition of maintaining the Rows in their designs; examples include the Georgian Booth Mansion of 1700 <b>in</b> Watergate <b>Street,</b> T. M.

"On 21st May 1738, William Berners let for ninety-nine {{years to}} Thomas Huddle the whole {{frontage}} of 655 feet to Oxford Street and 100 feet in depth (with {{the exception of}} width required for two proposed new streets - {{which would be the}} present Berners and Newman Streets and a widening of Wells Lane) at a total rent of 4s. per foot per annum. Huddle was to pull down all old buildings and to erect new ones, and Berners was to construct a sewer from Wells Lane to Rathbone Place. Huddle began to build the houses <b>in</b> Oxford <b>Street</b> at once, and apportioned there rents, the first lease for ninety-nine years being granted in 1739. The total annual rent received by the estate for the Oxford Street houses was ¬£135 8s. until the last of the old leases fell in 1838. The sewer referred to still runs under some of the houses <b>in</b> Berners <b>Street</b> and Wells Street, but it is now disused. Between 1750 and 1763 the existing streets on the Estate were laid out: the first lease granted <b>in</b> Newman <b>Street</b> is dated 1750, <b>in</b> Charles <b>Street,</b> now called Mortimer <b>Street,</b> <b>in</b> 1759, <b>in</b> Castle <b>Street</b> and Wells <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> 1760, <b>in</b> Berners <b>Street</b> <b>in</b> 1763, and <b>in</b> Suffolk <b>Street,</b> now called Nassau <b>Street,</b> <b>in</b> 1764. Building must have gone on rapidly, for in 1773 there were existing sixty completed houses <b>in</b> Berners <b>Street,</b> twenty-three <b>in</b> Castle <b>Street,</b> thirty-five <b>in</b> Mortimer <b>Street,</b> exclusive of the Middlesex Hospital, ninety <b>in</b> Newman <b>Street,</b> and twenty-three <b>in</b> Nassau <b>Street.</b> Many of the houses show strongly the influence of the Brothers Adam, and some ceilings, which are very beautiful, were almost certainly from their original designs. A lease for 999 years was granted to the Middlesex Hospital in 1754" ...|$|R
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered <b>in</b> <b>street</b> names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north‚Äìsouth. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E
