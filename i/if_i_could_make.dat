500|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> a Living was {{the title}} of Walker's second album, {{released}} in 1994. It produced two more No. 1 singles in the title track (co-written by Alan Jackson, Keith Stegall, and Roger Murrah) and 1995's [...] "This Woman and This Man". The latter song spent two weeks at No. 1, becoming his first multi-week No. 1 hit. Then came the number 16 [...] "My Heart Will Never Know". <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> a Living went platinum in May 1995, reaching number 2 on the country albums chart. Gordon Ely of the Richmond Times-Dispatch gave a favorable review, saying that [...] "Walker has broken loose from Nashville's most recent crop of carefully crafted cowboys." [...] Walker also began touring in 1995 as a headlining act, {{in support of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Following {{publication}} of William Wharton's 1978 novel Birdy, Alan Parker received galley proofs {{of the book}} from his agent, who advised him that the novel {{was going to be}} optioned. Upon reading the novel, Parker discussed it with his colleague, producer Alan Marshall, before turning down the opportunity to direct a film adaptation. Parker explained, [...] "So much of the story happened inside the boy's head, and the poetry of the book was literary. To make it cinematic - I didn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the jump." [...] In September 1979, Orion Pictures optioned the novel for $150,000.|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

500|$|... "Hang with Me" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Klas Åhlund, and was originally recorded by Åhlund's then-wife, Paola Bruna, for her debut studio album Stockcity Girl (2002). Åhlund played {{some of his}} old songs for Robyn, and re-wrote [...] "Hang with Me" [...] for her. Originally, the song {{did not have a}} chorus and Robyn noted that Bruna's version [...] "sounded very different" [...] from her own. Robyn's version {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the Body Talk series, but she decided to save it for a later release to give it a chance of becoming a single. In an interview with Gary Graff of The Macomb Daily, she spoke of covering Bruna's song and altering the lyrics, [...] "It didn’t have a chorus when we started working on it. It had a shorter verse and it was a ballad, so I decided <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> Klas [...] turn it into a more uptempo and bring the BPM up, it could work. So we started there and he kept writing the song while we were recording, and it came out great." [...] Robyn felt that she could be [...] "seductive and sweet in a [...] uncompromising way" [...] on the song.|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You ask me idle questions," [...] she sighed. [...] "We have gone, perhaps, {{a little}} further than I intended. I came to plead with you for all our sakes, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> to <b>make</b> things more {{comfortable}} by remaining here instead of insisting upon your claim to the Tower." ...|$|R

I hope these will be attended to; I do not wish to have to speak of it again.|$|R
