5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride.|$|E

In 2009, following those Games, he shifted his role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sport.

Del Potro went <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sony Ericsson Open, reaching the fourth round, after he defeated three top-50 players: Jonas Björkman, Marcos Baghdatis, and Mikhail Youzhny, before falling to Rafael Nadal in two sets. In May, he lost in the first round of the French Open to eventual champion Nadal.|$|E
5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune.

Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E

5|$|The 1896 Democratic {{convention}} {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896. Much activity took place {{in advance of the}} formal opening as the silver and (vastly outnumbered) gold forces prepared their strategies. Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National Bimetallic Committee, the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland. Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership, but Cleveland, trusting few in his party, did not involve himself <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gold efforts, but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{beliefs and}} uses for slow lorises vary, and many {{practices}} {{appear to have}} deep roots going back at least 300years.

More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E

5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with a}} theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years ahead.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its highest {{position}} on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been back in the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E
