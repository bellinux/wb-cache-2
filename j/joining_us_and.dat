500|$|Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having {{first met}} at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> I don’t know why. Maybe {{there was a little}} spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half of}} 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E
6000|$|The large {{noiseless}} Jacobus advanced {{into the}} room. His quietness, in the circumstances, amounted to cordiality. He {{had put on}} his jacket before <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> {{he sat down in}} the chair vacated by the steamer-man, who nodded again to me and went out with a short, jarring laugh. A profound silence reigned. With his drowsy stare Jacobus seemed to be slumbering open-eyed. Yet, somehow, I was aware of being profoundly scrutinised by those heavy eyes. In the enormous cavern of the store somebody began to nail down a case, expertly: tap-tap [...] . tap-tap-tap.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are welcome, sir," [...] said Sir Henry Lee, whose {{feelings}} of hospitality, {{and of the}} fraternal reception due to a royalist sufferer, induced him to tolerate this intrusion more than {{he might have done}} otherwise.

60|$|Hereupon I hastened {{back to the}} Captain {{with the}} like Speed, and told him the Discovery I had made; who {{nevertheless}} kept on his March, and {{it was with a}} good deal of Difficulty, that I at last prevail'd on him to halt, till our Rear Guard of twenty Men had got up to us. But those <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> a new Troop of Spanish Dragoons, who had march'd towards us that Morning, appearing in Sight; our Captain, as if he was afraid of their rivalling him in his Glory, at the very turn of the Hill, rode in a full Gallop, with Sword in Hand, up to the Enemy.

6000|$|Mrs. Elmore {{remained}} speechless {{for some}} moments. Then {{she drew a}} long breath, and said firmly: [...] "If you won't interrupt me with gratuitous insults, Owen, I will {{tell you all about}} it, and then perhaps you will be ready to do me justice. I ask nothing more." [...] She waited for his contrition, but proceeded without it, in a somewhat meeker strain: [...] "Lily couldn't get her things at Pazienti's, and we {{had to go to the}} Merceria for them. Then of course the nearest way home was through St. Mark's Square. I made Lily go on the Florian side, so as to avoid the officers who were sitting at the Quadri, and we had got through the square and past San Moïsè, as far as the Stadt Gratz. I had never thought of how the officers frequented the Stadt Gratz, but there we met a most magnificent creature, and I had just said, 'What a splendid officer!' when she gave a sort of stop and he gave a sort of stop, and bowed very low, and she whispered, 'It's my officer.' I didn't dream of his <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> I don't think he did, at first; but after he took a second look at Lily, it really seemed as if he couldn't help it. He asked if he might join us, and I didn't say anything." ...|$|E

"If the ACC {{continues}} to struggle, and Florida State {{goes off to}} the SEC or something like that, and Clemson moves in a different direction, {{all of a sudden}} Virginia, Duke , and North Carolina — which are all very similar institutions to the Big Ten, there is a real possibility that we may end up having that kind of T which goes south.

5000|$|Josh Deu and Win Butler, {{began to}} work on both visual and musical collaborations. Positive {{feedback}} subsequently led to formation of Arcade Fire, with Deu and Butler initially sneaking into a practise space at McGill University to write and rehearse. Whilst practicing there, they met music student Régine Chassagne, whom Butler had previously seen performing weeks before. Deu noted, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar.

5000|$|The party's {{name was}} [...] "debated and {{discussed}} at two public meetings". Toksvig was {{asked why the}} party is called the Women's Equality Party, rather than just the Equality Party, she answered, [...] "Because {{there is a huge}} issue, women are certainly not equal.... It's time that women, finally, after all these years, what is it, almost a hundred years since we finally got the vote, it's time we stepped up and took our equal place in society." [...] She also stated the party's motto [...] "Equality is better for everybody." [...] Mayer has also stated, [...] "I’m very happy with the name: all genders are <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>and</b> I hope they continue to.
