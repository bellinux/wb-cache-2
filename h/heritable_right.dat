50|$|The Bagratuni family became princes in the 4th century. Their <b>heritable</b> <b>rights</b> {{were given}} {{to them by the}} Arshakuni Dynasty, the kings of Armenia (52-428).

50|$|Human lease peasants (mi-bo) did {{not have}} <b>heritable</b> <b>rights</b> to land. They were still obligated to their 'owning' estate under their status as mi-ser. In {{contrast}} with the taxpayer families and householders, they had the freedom to go wherever they wanted and could engage in trade or crafts. When farming, they might lease land from taxpayer families and as payment take on work for those families. Like the householders the landless peasants also used resources in their own individual capacity which were non-heritable.|$|R
5000|$|Godred's {{power base}} {{may have been}} located in the Hebrides, the {{northern}} reaches of the realm. After his takeover of Mann, a conquest that culminated in the Battle of Sky Hill, the chronicle claims that Godred offered his followers the choice of either plundering the island or of settling upon it. Only {{a few of his}} Islesmen are stated to have remained with him on Mann. According to the chronicle, Godred granted the incomers lands in the south of the island, and allowed the natives lands in the north, on the condition that they give up all <b>heritable</b> <b>rights</b> to this territory. It was through this act, alleges the chronicle, that Godred's later successors owned the entirety of the island. This portrayal of Godred's takeover - in which a conqueror establishes his dynasty's dominance over the traditional rights of a native landholding populace - parallels the traditional mediaeval accounts of Haraldr hárfagri (died c.932), a king traditionally said to have deprived Norwegian landholders their <b>heritable</b> [...] <b>rights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Athens the engyesis, or betrothal, {{was in fact}} {{indispensable}} to the complete validity of a marriage contract. It {{was made by the}} natural or legal guardian (kyrios) of the bride elect, and attended by the relatives of both parties as witnesses. The law of Athens ordained that all children born from a marriage legally contracted in this respect should be legal gnesioi, and consequently, if sons, isomoiroi, entitled to inherit equally or in gavel-kind. It would seem, therefore, that the issue of a marriage without espousals would lose their <b>heritable</b> <b>rights,</b> which depended on their being born ex astes kai engyetes gynaikos: i.e. from a citizen and a legally betrothed wife. The wife's dowry was also settled at the espousals.|$|R
5000|$|Margaret married twice, {{but had no}} {{issue and}} the barony again reverted to the Eglinton branch. Graysteel was the {{appellation}} given to Sir Henry Montgomerie of Giffen (due to his dexterity with the sword) who inherited, however he had no issue and once again the barony reverted, as his wife sold the barony of Giffen to her father-in-law for an annuity of 2,500 merks. Henry {{had been born in}} 1614 and Anne of Denmark, James VI's Queen, stood as his godmother. The direct Montgomerie line ended with the 5th. Earl who had married his , Margaret, eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Montgomerie of Giffen and Master of Eglinton. Their marriage was so unsuccessful that the Earl took the drastic step of revoking her <b>heritable</b> <b>rights</b> as gained through their marriage. and Alexander Seton of Foulstruther, also called 'Grey steel,' took the Montgomerie name upon becoming the 6th Earl of Eglintoun in 1612 ...|$|R
50|$|Article XX of the Union with England Act, 1707, had {{recognized}} these jurisdictions and other <b>heritable</b> offices as <b>rights</b> of property which continued {{in spite of}} the union, and so on abolition compensation was paid to the deprived heritors.|$|R

In 1991, the west of Lake Starnberg in the districts and Söcking Maising located {{operating}} surfaces of the so-called [...] "Schmalzhof" [...] were acquired (36.4 hectares), which have since been rented from Good Buchhof. In the years 1994 to 1998 extensive building renovation measures were carried out.

50|$|Patronage was a {{much less}} disputed issue in the Anglican Church, and the dispossessed Scottish lay patrons were able to persuade the united, and mainly Anglican, Parliament of Great Britain that they had {{unjustly}} lost a purely civil right. Their case may have been strengthened {{by the fact that}} Article 20 of the Treaty of Union had preserved all <b>heritable</b> <b>rights</b> and jurisdictions of pre-Union Scotland. It also helped that the British Government distrusted popular participation in matters of importance, as the selection of parish ministers certainly was. Consequently, the Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711 was passed, restoring to their original owners the right to present suitably qualified candidates to Presbyteries {{in the event of a}} vacancy. Only those Patron's who had renounced their claim in writing in return for compensation were excluded from this, of which there were only three in 1711, Cadder, Old and New Monklands. The effect was the restoration of the situation as it was in 1592. Patrons were required to swear allegiance to the Hanoverian kings, and abjure the claims of the Stuart Pretenders; a patron who refused was to appoint commissioners to exercise the patronage on his behalf. Patrons did not need to be members of the Church of Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Article XX of the Union with England Act, 1707, had {{recognized}} these jurisdictions and other <b>heritable</b> offices as <b>rights</b> of property which continued {{in spite of}} the union, and so on abolition compensation was paid to the deprived heritors. There was opposition to the passage of the Act from the Duke of Argyll who argued that having multiple judicial jurisdictions ensured the liberty of the people of Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|A fief ( [...] ; feudum) was {{the central}} element of feudalism and {{consisted}} of <b>heritable</b> property or <b>rights</b> granted by an overlord to a vassal who held it in fealty (or [...] "in fee") {{in return for a}} form of feudal allegiance and service, usually given by the personal ceremonies of homage and fealty. The fees were often lands or revenue-producing real property held in feudal land tenure: these are typically known as fiefs or fiefdoms. However, not only land but anything of value could be held in fee, including governmental office, rights of exploitation such as hunting or fishing, monopolies in trade, and tax farms.|$|R
40|$|Germany's {{urban land}} policy (kommunale Bodenpolitik) {{attracted}} the attention of foreign countries. There were also many contemporary publications about this policy in Germany because it was a precondition for city planning, which included housing and transportation policies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify Frankfurt am Main’s land policy at the turn of the twentieth century, especially under Franz Adickes'era. Adickes, the third senior mayor (1891 - 1912), carried out urban land policy as a consciously planned intervention in the land market. His land policy had two additional objectives: The first was securing land for administrative buildings and public facilities. The second was the facilitation of city extension and the preparation for future incorporation. Frankfurt's municipal land increased from 4, 229. 17 ha in 1900 to 6, 370. 19 ha in 1913. Land purchased by the city consisted of 11, 649 estates during the period 1895 - 1915. Conversely, land sold during the same period consisted of only 2, 465 estates because it was difficult to set land prices. As a result, the Erbbaurecht (<b>Heritable</b> Building <b>Right)</b> was utilized as a substitute measure for land sales. Though Frankfurt's urban land policy produced good results, it was forced to change owing to 'the predominance of purchasing policy'and increasing debt. Thus, the state government also became involved with the land and housing policies. The land policy shifted from the stage of 'social city'to that of 'social state'after World War I...|$|R
