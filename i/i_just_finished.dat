5000|$|Rose is {{the fool}} of the group, {{and has been}} {{the center of a}} few running gags. The most common running gag {{involves}} her asking a stupid question, after which the other women would usually look at her oddly, and then say something sarcastic. Another running gag involves Dorothy or Blanche hitting Rose with a newspaper after enduring one of her annoying St. Olaf stories. Rose herself behaves uncharacteristically sarcastic in a few instances. In one episode in which the ladies' roof was leaking, Rose exits her room carrying two buckets of water; Dorothy asks if the ceiling in her room is leaking too, and Rose replies, [...] "No, Dorothy, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> milking the cow I keep in my closet!" [...] She then says, [...] "Gee, with only three hours of sleep I can be as bitchy as you!". On another episode, Rose says her sister Holly is a flautist. Dorothy asks Rose if Holly plays a flute, and Rose sarcastically replies, [...] "No, Dorothy, she plays a 'flaut'. It's a big instrument that looks like a tuba, and has hair at the bottom of it. Of course she plays a flute!". In one episode where Dorothy and Blanche had gotten into an argument, neither of them cares that the dog that Rose takes in off the street is sick and needs immediate veterinary care; after their argument, both Dorothy and Blanche leave the kitchen. Rose then imitates the dog as if he were speaking to her: [...] "Don't explain, Rose. I used to live with a couple of bitches myself." ...|$|E

Moving from laissez-faire and pro-slavery sympathies in the 1820 s, northerners ultimately could no longer tolerate the moral and political oxymoron of a democracy that enslaved a third of its populace.

40|$|Enhancing women’s {{participation}} in development requires an ‘Enabling Environment”. What does an enabling environment look like? An enabling environment would presumably be favorable towards women’s empowerment {{and it would}} need to be described and assessed at global, national and local levels. The actions and change strategies to create such an environment would be undertaken by international organizations, Governments, and civil society actors. At the global level, an enabling environment has been created under the UN aegis, where women’s networks have learned about lobbying and advocacy, come together to debate and promote their views, to negotiate with Government representatives and hold them accountable for global conventions and resolutions (Kardam, 2004). In many countries, women’s movements have also successfully pressured Governments from below to change legal institutions, laws and policies. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> a study on how women’s networks and movements in Turkey are doing precisely that (Kardam, 2005).

40|$|<b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> {{reading about}} how humans managed to survive, just barely, a robot {{revolution}} [1]. A {{quick and easy}} read, it was just what I needed after immersing myself in file systems and the cloud. And fortunately, after a grim beginning, the book focuses more on the puny humans ’ successes than on their failures. We already {{live in a world}} where robots are becoming more common. Some exam-ples, such as factory robots, are obvious. But others, such as Google’s self-driving Prius [2], don’t look at all like robots. But then, neither do factory robots look at all like Robbie the Robot, nor do the robots that help to care for old folks that are gain-ing acceptance in Japan. Thinking about robots, not the virus-infected bloodthirsty type, got me to thinking about automation and autonomous systems. For several years, autonomic systems were the rage in some parts of the sysadmin world, while being anathema in others. Many sysadmins felt that bringing autonomy into their networks would make the sysadmin redundant. That won’t happen, any more than the fifth-generation pro-gramming languages [3] managed to do away with programmers back in the 1980 s...|$|E

After all, I wrote the poem, “Tell Your Story, ” in the early 1990 s and this book is all about telling—and making sense of—stories. What is “autoethnography”? “Simply, autoethnography {{is a kind of}} self-writing—by which I mean not simply a writing about the self, but a writing of the self—a making and performing of me-in-culture ” (p. 16). There are pages more of explanation of what autoethnography is, far too many to summarize here. It is described as political, radical, subversive, strategic, autobiographic, cultural, identity focused, among other perspectives. In this work, it might be considered a way to look at, reflect on, analyze in a multitude of ways (for examples: poetry; seemingly stream-of-consciousness writing; familial deconstruction; and imagined panel) how teaching and learning are impacted, de-and re-constructed by life stories, and how they fit into challenging—and changing—ways we teach and learn. The book is divided into four sections, with the first and last ones containing four chapters by editor Phil Smith explaining why autoethnography (Ch. 1) and how to use it and how the chapters contained in this book move forward to change the paradigm of teaching an...|$|E

I bet I'm a better surgeon than you. How many of your patients died within 3 months of surgery? Only 10 of my patients died. ” − First surgeon smugly responds, “Only 5 of mine died, so I must be the better surgeon. ” − Second surgeon says, “My patients were probably older and had a higher risk than your patients. ” Comparing apples to oranges? There may be important differences in patient characteristics between treatment groups. Want to show difference in outcome is attributable to difference in treatment (or patient condition) and not due to comparing apples to oranges. Nonrandomized comparisons give rise to apples-and-oranges scepticism. Sometimes it is infeasible or unethical to assign patients to different treatments. Purpose of Propensity Scores Can produce apples-to-apples comparison under some nonrandomized conditions. Provides a way to summarize covariate information about treatment selection into a scalar value. Can be used to adjust for differences via study design (matching) or during estimation of treatment effect (stratification/regression).

40|$|Genesis. I {{have always}} been {{interested}} in waiting lines because waiting in line for me is like hell on earth. I take great pains to avoid waiting lines. My academic interest in queues, however, started when I tried to simulate waiting lines in a closed system such as a ski resort. Little did I know that I was trespassing on hostile territories. It turned out that queuing theory is a very well developed field with voluminous literature. It is hopeless to go through all the literature just to find out what has not been covered yet. All was not lost. A casual reading of the voluminous literature on queuing theory taught me that a queue must be present even in a steady-state service process. I then inferred that the greater the flow capacity (number of customers served per unit time), the longer must be the steady-state queue if the service process is not to be interrupted. And the minimum steady-state queue should not be regarded as a waiting line at all. Hence the title of this paper. I also noticed that Naor’s seminal paper that started the whole literature on regulating queue length with prices was based on a single-step service process. And this assumption was followed by almost all later contributors. Since <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> a simulation on Goldratt’s scout hike, I knew well that the most binding bottleneck in a multiple-link process does not alway...|$|E

Gee whiz, I can’t {{understand}} it—I took physics, geometry, 2 ̆ 6 trig in school, and all practical theories say that a minute is a minute, an hour an hour, a week a week, but why are they so different on Saturdays and Sundays? Maybe you {{have something to do with}} it. I guess you’re that certain little corollary that is the exception to every rule. Ah yes, my little corollary;—romantic ain’t it? Gosh I love you. There goes that song, “It could happen to you,” sounds like Gravel Gertie singing it, but it’s still nice. I don’t know why it reminds me of you, we must have heard it somewhere. It was that weekend we went to the Rodeo, the 21 st the night you told me you loved me. I was riding back to the Field in a taxi when I heard it, and immediately I thought of you, (for a change). Speaking of that, we were having a squadron meeting today at the flight line, and there was I, listening to the major’s every word, gapin’ out the window like a lovesick dove. Noticing how engrossed I was (in you) he gently asks me what the hell am I thinking about. “The weather, sir. ” “Oh the weather, well Mr. Clark, maybe you can tell me what the visibility is. ” “Visibility? Oh the visibility—about six miles. ” (Hmm, that name again) How was I supposed to know there was a fog outside, I thought it was me, I’m in a fog all the time lately. Very embarassing [sic].
