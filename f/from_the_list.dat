5|$|He {{was moved}} to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be {{transferred}} to Constantinople in order to offer his services to the Sultan. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eugénie, about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Désirée. On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the Vendée campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties {{occurred and}} 1,500people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; {{the same area}} was affected with more precipitation {{a few days later}} by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the damage caused by the storm, the name Klaus was retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the dietary}} {{guidelines}} for daily chromium intake were lowered in 2001 from 50–200 µg {{for an adult}} to 35µg (adult male) and to 25µg (adult female). In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority published a report stating that the intake of chromium(III) has no beneficial effect on healthy people, thus the Panel removed chromium <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of nutrients and essential elements.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> in 1987. American alligators are now harvested for their skins and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a painting by American artist Bob Gill in which, as in Massot's film, two contrasting worlds are separated by a wall, with only a small gap allowing visual access between them. Harrison omitted his name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of performing musicians, leading to an assumption that he had merely produced and arranged the music. The 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music recognises his contributions on keyboards and guitar. The album was first remastered for CD release in 1992, for which former Apple executive Derek Taylor supplied a liner-note essay.|$|E

It was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>List</b> of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.|$|E
