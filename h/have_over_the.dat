5|$|The {{song thrush}} is {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, <b>have,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past 130years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|After the 2000 acquisition, Renault renamed Samsung Motors as Renault Samsung Motors (RSM). That year, the company's sales {{began to}} improve. Journalists {{attribute}} {{this to the}} success of the first car manufactured at Busan in taxi fleets (the SM5), which led to increased confidence of the model within the rest of their customer base. During the following years, the company introduced a new vehicle range, including the SM3 in 2002, the SM7 in 2004 and the crossover QM5 in 2007. Over time, RSM changed its products from a Nissan-based architecture to a Renault-based one. As part of the Renault group, Renault Samsung basically became an export-oriented manufacturer. Despite not being exported under their own brand, Renault Samsung-manufactured vehicles <b>have</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> time been rebadged as Renault or Nissan, and sold in markets such as Europe (QM5 and SM5), Russia, Ukraine, Mexico, Egypt, Central and South America, the Middle East (SM3 and SM5), China (SM7), Australia (QM5), or the United States and Canada (the Rogue).|$|E

As humans preferably settle in these fertile and easily accessible central lowlands, major transformations and widespread cultivation through wet-rice agriculture <b>have</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries shaped the landscape into distinctive regional cultivated lands. Domestic plants, such as sugar palms, Coconut trees and banana groves almost exclusively skirt extensive rice paddies, as natural vegetation is confined to elevated lands and near waterways. The Mekong traverses the north to south-east portions of the country, where the low-lying plains extend into Vietnam and reach the South China Sea at the Mekong Delta region.|$|E

In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime.
