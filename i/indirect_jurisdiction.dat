500|$|Listing in the National Register {{does not}} {{restrict}} private property owners {{from the use}} of their property. Some states and municipalities, however, may have laws that become effective when a property is listed in the National Register. If federal money or a federal permitting process is involved, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is invoked. Section 106 requires the federal agency involved to assess the effect of its actions on historic resources. Statutorily, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) has the most significant role by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The section requires that the director of any federal agency with direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of a project that may affect a property listed or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, must first report to the Advisory Council. The director of said agency is required to [...] "take into account the effect of the undertaking" [...] on the National Register property, as well as to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment.|$|E
50|$|With Pomerania and the March of Brandenburg having {{ceased to}} be parts of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, but become provinces of Prussia, the latter agreed with the Holy See to place the Prussian part of the Nordic Missions under the jurisdictions of {{neighbouring}} Prussian dioceses as of 16 August 1821. Thus the Prince-Bishop of Breslau took direct responsibility for the now Prussian-held part of Meissen's former diocesan areas in then Brandenburgian Lower Lusatia and then Silesian (eastern) Upper Lusatia. Breslau wielded its <b>indirect</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{in the remainder of}} Brandenburg (including Berlin) and most of Pomerania (except of Lauenburg and Bütow Land) by its new Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania (staffed in 1824). The diocesan areas of the defunct bishoprics in Prussian Saxony came {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Diocese of Paderborn, as was the case with the diocesan area of defunct Minden in Prussian Westphalia.|$|E
40|$|The law of {{jurisdiction}} {{and of the}} recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is confused. So is the debate about it. Basic concepts, even that {{of jurisdiction}}, have ambiguous meaning. Misunderstandings, most prominent in the failure to conclude a worldwide judgments convention at the Hague, are the consequence. This article tries to bring conceptual clarity to the field through an analysis of concepts and relations. The article first shows that jurisdiction as a requirement for the rendering of a decision (direct jurisdiction) and jurisdiction as a requirement for the decision 2 ̆ 7 s enforceability elsewhere (<b>indirect</b> <b>jurisdiction),</b> are logically independent from each other. It goes on {{to show that the}} three possible values of deontic logic - obligatory, optional, and impermissible conduct - are reflected in three possible statuses that jurisdictional bases can have: such bases may be required, excluded, or permitted. A combination of both distinctions leads to nine different possible combinations of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The article analyzes each of these nine in detail. Such an analysis is crucial for the drafting of judgment conventions. Traditionally, a distinction existed between so-called single conventions that regulate only enforcement of foreign judgments, and double conventions that regulate also direct jurisdiction. Arthur von Mehren, for whose memorial volume this article is written, developed a third category, the so-called mixed convention. Although it represented a considerable improvement, the exact structure of mixed convention never became fully clear. This article proposes a new typology that is both richer and more exact. Although the article draws on rich comparative material from existing conventions, and although it emphasizes repeatedly the normative implications both of different values for jurisdictional bases and of different types of conventions, the article 2 ̆ 7 s prime aim is analytical, not normative. However, far from being a mere formalist exercise, such an analysis lays the indispensable prerequisites for a proper normative analysis. The definition of clear concepts does not guarantee proper policy debates, but without clear concepts policy debate is impossible. In this sense, the paper hopes to help provide new foundations for such debates...|$|E
50|$|In 1657, Armenians in Transylvania who {{belonged to}} the Armenian Apostolic Church and were led by Bishop Oxendius Vărzărescu, placed {{themselves}} under <b>indirect</b> Roman Catholic <b>jurisdiction,</b> {{as part of the}} Armenian Catholic Church. Many of them settled in and around Gherla (Armenopolis or Szamosújvár).|$|R
40|$|This report {{estimates}} {{the total cost}} of workplace injury and illness to the Australian economy. Work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths impose costs on employers, workers and the community. These include both direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs include items such as workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation premiums paid by employers or payments to injured or incapacitated workers from workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation <b>jurisdictions.</b> <b>Indirect</b> costs include items such as lost productivity, loss of current and future earnings, lost potential output and the cost of providing social welfare programs for injured or incapacitated workers. The level of costs borne by each economic agent varies with the severity of the injury or disease. While measures of direct costs are understood and reasonably simple to measure, these costs cover only a fraction of {{the total cost of}} work-related injury and disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{recasting}} of the Brussels I regulation {{has been}} {{announced by the}} European Commission in December 2010. The author argues that its impact will be felt in third countries, too. If the Commission proposal is adopted, defendants domiciled in non-EU countries will be amenable to suit in the courts of the Union in civil and commercial matters under the heads of special jurisdiction defined in the EU Regulation. National rules of jurisdiction will no more be applicable. Two new heads of general jurisdiction applicable in case there is no jurisdiction under the Regulation (i. e. when the defendant is domiciled outside the EU {{and there is no}} ground of special jurisdiction for EU courts) will be the forum of property and the forum necessitates. A court within the EU will have discretion to stay the proceedings in case of lis pendens before the court of a third country. Judgments from third countries will continue to be recognized pursuant to national rules, including the national rules on <b>indirect</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Finally, forum selection clauses in favor of third country courts will most likely be unenforceable in the EU unless the court within the EU would anyway lack jurisdiction (even without the forum selection clause). These rules are only a proposal and they may still be changed. The Commission could make a significant improvement by small interventions in the proposed text, e. g. by giving the rules on exclusive jurisdiction reflexive effect and introducing a specific provision affording effect to prorogation clauses in favor of third country courts...|$|E
