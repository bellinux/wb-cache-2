50|$|The liquid {{junction}} potential {{interferes with}} the exact measurement of the electromotive force of a chemical cell, so its effect should be minimized {{as much as possible}} for accurate measurement. The most common method of eliminating the liquid junction potential is to place a salt bridge consisting of a saturated solution of potassium chloride (KCl) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) with lithium acetate (CH3COOLi) between the two solutions constituting the junction. When such a bridge is used, the ions in the bridge are present <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>excess</b> at the junction and they carry almost the whole of the current across the boundary.

Treatment of the Fmoc-protected amino acid, {{abbreviated}} by [...] "R," [...] with piperidine, {{resulting in}} proton abstraction from the methine {{group of the}} fluorenyl ring system, which results in cleavage of that ring system as dibenzofulvene, and release of the amino acid as a carbamate, which decomposes to carbon dioxide (CO2) and the amino acid moiety with free amine group. The gentleness of the deprotection is believed to lie in the acidity of the fluorenyl proton, resulting from stabilization of the resulting aromatic anion.

5000|$|Matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (MALDESI) is an ambient ionization technique {{which combines}} {{the benefits of}} electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).

The term ‘matrix’ refers to any molecule that is present <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>excess</b> and absorbs {{the energy of the}} laser, facilitating desorption of analyte molecules. The original MALDESI design was implemented using organic matrices, similar to those used in MALDI, along with a UV laser.

50|$|Ketonic {{decarboxylation}} (also {{known as}} ketonization) {{is a type}} of organic reaction and a decarboxylation converting two equivalents of a carboxylic acid to a symmetric ketone by the application of heat with expulsion of one equivalent of water and one equivalent of carbon dioxide. Bases promote this reaction. The reaction mechanism likely involves nucleophilic attack of the alpha-carbon of one acid group on the other acid group's carbonyl, possibly as a concerted reaction with the decarboxylation. The initial formation of an intermediate carbanion with decarboxylation from one acid group prior to the nucleophilic attack has been proposed, but is unlikely since the byproduct resulting from the carbanion's protonation by the acid has never been reported. This reaction is different from oxidative decarboxylation, which proceeds through a radical mechanism and is characterised by a different product distribution in isotopic labeling experiments with two different carboxylic acids. With two different carboxylic acids, the reaction behaves poorly because of poor selectivity except when one of the acids (for example, a small, volatile one) is used <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>excess.</b>|$|E
