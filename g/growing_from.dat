As a result of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland exceeded CHF 1billion in assets and moved its operations to Zurich.

5|$|The Dominion of Canada {{was formed}} on July 1, 1867, when the British colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia were merged {{to form a}} single Dominion within the British Empire. Canada {{continued}} to expand across North America as other British colonies and territories joined with or were ceded to Canada, eventually <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> four provinces to ten provinces and three territories.

5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).|$|E

5|$|After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi {{began an}} ambitious {{expansion}} program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which {{were led by}} a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful—in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 {{by the end of}} 1957.|$|E

5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure video {{game for the}} PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 home video game consoles, created by French game developer Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released in October 2013. The game features Jodie Holmes, one of two player characters. The other is an incorporeal entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actress Ellen Page, possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. Willem Dafoe co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure.

5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E

Chicago became the railroad hub for the American West and the primary trading city for the emerging territories, famous for its commercial culture. It saw itself as different from the cities on the east coast and was immensely proud of its status as a growing, vibrant center.|$|E

5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> the eggs deposited within.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found only on coastal sand dunes near Olbia, in Sardinia, where it was {{observed}} growing {{at the base of}} Juncus maritimus (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe. Mushrooms were seen <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> both the sandy soil and decaying plants; however, as a saprotrophic feeder, {{it is possible that the}} species would be able to grow on other substrates. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> the top of the tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
