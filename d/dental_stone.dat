PurposeThis study investigated the effects of using a high-expansion <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> as an investing material on changes in the OVD of complete dentures. Material and methodsTwenty sets of simulated upper and lower dentures were processed by the compression molding technique. Specimens were equally divided into 2 groups. In the <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> type III (DST III) group, the lower, middle, and upper parts of a flask were filled with DST III. In the <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> type V (DST V) group, the procedure was the same as in the DST III group, except that the middle layer was made of high-expansion DST V. Changes in the OVD were measured before and after denture processing. Collected data were analyzed with t-test statistics. Differences were considered statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. ResultsBoth groups showed a small increase in the OVD as a result of processing, but the OVD increase was significantly less in the DST V group compared to the DST III group.

Aim: The aim {{was to investigate the}} dimensional accuracy of silica filled polyurethane resin die material by evaluating the marginal fit and adaptation of indirect gold castings. Settings and Design: Experimental, in vitro study. Materials and Methods: Totally 40 copper plated replicas of a nickel chrome master die analogous to a veneer gold crown preparation were made and impressions recorded using polyvinylsiloxane material. Twenty impressions were poured in type IV <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> (control group (Vel-mix, Kerr, UK) and the remaining (n = 20) in silica filled polyurethane die material (test group) (Alpha Die MF, CA, USA). Gold castings were fabricated for each die using standardized techniques. The castings were seated on their respective copper plated dies, embedded in resin and sectioned. The specimens were analyzed by measuring marginal opening and the area beneath the casting at a × 63 magnification and using image analysis software. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed using a Student′s t-test. Results: No significant difference was observed between the experimental groups (P > 0. 05). The mean marginal opening for type IV, <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> and polyurethane resin, was 57 ± 22. 6 μm and 63. 47 ± 27. 1 μm, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: Nanobacteria {{have been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of pathogenic calcifications e. g. kidney stones, arterial plaque, calcified cardiac valves, <b>dental</b> pulp <b>stone,</b> etc. It has been hypothesized that nanobacteria may be present in dental calculus which has a similar mineralization formation process and that nanobacteria may play an efficient role in the calcification of dental calculus. Recently nanobacteria were found in gingival crevicular fluid samples from two subjects with chronic periodontitis. The hypothesis: An anti-nanobacterial mouthwash or tooth paste containing bisphosphonates specifically etidronate and clodronate (1 mg/ml), gallium nitrate 14 % (3. 4 % w/w gallium at 99. 995 % purity) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 %) with neutral pH (7. 0) will may be effective for prevention of calculus formation and consequently prevention of periodontal diseases. Despite of excellent anti-nanobacterial activity of tetracycline, it is removed from the formulation. It has a wide spectrum of anti-bactericidal activity and may affect normal oral flora and cause supra-infection.

According to the data available (Poloni and Ward 2014), the unwanted depositions could consist of many substances and all of them always lead to various diseases. Regarding the unwanted depositions of CaPO 4, they are found in soft tissue calcification (in damaged joints, blood vessels, dysfunctional areas in the brain, diseased organs, scleroderma, prostate stones) (Reid and Andersen 1993; Scotchford and Ali 1995; P’ng et al. 2008; Brancaccio and Cozzolino 2005; Goff and Reichard 2006; Bittmann et al. 2003; Molloy and McCarthy 2006; Giachelli 2004; Kazama et al. 2007), kidney (Giannossi and Summa 2012; Mukherjee 2014) and urinary (Zhu et al. 2014; Huo et al. 2015; Selvaraju et al. 2015) <b>stones,</b> <b>dental</b> pulp <b>stones</b> and <b>dental</b> calculus (Kakei et al. 2009; Kodaka et al. 1988, 1998; Çiftçioglu et al. 1998; Hayashizaki et al. 2008), salivary stones (Zelentsov et al. 2001; Luers et al. 2014), gall stones (Qiao et al. 2013; Hussain and Al-Jashamy 2013), pineal gland calcifications (Güney et al. 2013), atherosclerotic arteries and veins (Ortlepp et al. 2004; Tomazic 2001; Marra et al. 2006; Kurabayashi 2013), coronary calcification (Fitzpatrick et al. 2003; Matsui et al. 2015), damaged cardiac valves (Suvorova and Buffat 2005), calcification on artificial heart valves (Giachelli 2001; Pettenazzo et al. 2001; Schoen and Levy 2005; Delogne et al. 2007), carpal tunnel (Sensui et al. 2003; Namba et al. 2008) and tumoral (Namba et al. 2008; Carlson et al. 2007; Sprecher 2010; Slavin et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2013; Burns et al. 2013) calcifications, cataracts (Kim and Choi 2007; Koinzer et al. 2009), malacoplakia (Ho 1989), calcified menisci (Katsamenis et al. 2012; Dessombz et al. 2013), dermatomyositis (Stock et al. 2004; Pachman and Boskey 2006) and still other places (Daculsi et al. 1997; Bazin et al. 2014 b). In addition, there is a metastatic calcification of non-osseous viable tissue occurring throughout the body (Hale 2003; Alkan et al. 2009), but it primarily affects the interstitial tissue of the blood vessels, kidney, lungs and gastric mucosa. A metastatic calcification is defined as a deposition of CaPO 4 in previously normal tissue due to an abnormal biochemistry with disturbances in the calcium or phosphorus metabolism (Grech et al. 1998). Common causes of the metastatic calcification include hyperparathyroidism, chronic renal disease, massive bone destruction in widespread bone metastases and increased intestinal calcium absorption. One author has mentioned on “apatite diseases” which are characterized by the appearance of needle-like crystals comparable to those of bone apatite in the fibrous connective tissue (Mohr 2003). All these cases are examples of a calcinosis (Sprecher 2010; Slavin et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2013; Burns et al. 2013), which might be described as a formation of undesired CaPO 4 deposits in any soft tissue. In dentistry, a calculus or a tartar refers to a hardened plaque on the teeth, formed by the presence of saliva, debris and minerals (White 1997). Its rough surface provides the ideal medium for bacterial growth, threatening the health of the gums and absorbing unaesthetic stains far more easily than natural teeth (LeGeros 1991).|$|R

After the stone had hardened completely, the spacers were removed and more stone was inserted in the spaces created. Six strain-gauges (Excel Ltd.), positioned in a cast bar, which was dimensionally accurate (perfect fit) to the master model, recorded the microstrains generated by each specimen. Data were analyzed statistically by the variance analysis (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (Î±= 5 %). RESULTS: The microstrain values (µepsilon) were (mean±SD) : GA: 263. 7 ± 109. 07 µepsilon, and GB: 193. 73 ± 78. 83 µepsilon. CONCLUSION: There was no statistical difference between the two methods studied...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Dental {{practice}} {{contains the}} use of instruments and multiuse items that should be sterilized or disinfected properly. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the effect of microwave irradiation on <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> cast disinfection in moist and dry condition. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, 76 stone casts were prepared by a sterile method. The casts were contaminated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) as well as Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Half the samples were dried for two hours and the other half was studied while still moist. The samples were irradiated by a household microwave at 600 W for 3, 5 and 7 minutes. The microorganisms on the samples were extracted by immersion in tryptic soy broth and. 001 ml of that was cultured in nutrient agar media, incubated overnight and counted and recorded as colony forming unit per milliliter (CFU/mL). Results: The findings showed that microorganisms reduced to 4. 87 logarithm of CFU/mL value on dental cast within seven minutes in comparison with positive control. Although microbial count reduction was observed as a result of exposure time increase, comparison between moist and dried samples showed no significant difference. Conclusions: Seven-minute microwave irradiation at 600 W can effectively reduce the microbial load of <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> casts. Wetting the casts does not seem to alter the efficacy of irradiation.   Keywords: Microwave Disinfection; <b>Dental</b> <b>Stone</b> Casts; Irradiation Time...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>stone</b> type IV is gypsum {{product with}} high {{strength}} whish usually {{used to make}} die in dentistry. For making die, we have to manipulated gypsum to get high strength gypsum model with control mixing time of the gypsum product. Purpose {{of this research is}} to know influence of mixing time with mechanic methode to setting time of <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> type IV. In this research we make 4 varians mixing time, there are 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds and 120 seconds. We can measuring setting time of gypsum with vicat apparatus. Mixing time with a short time will impact to longer setting time, and longer mixing time will impact to shorter setting time. From Pearson Product Moment analysis showed that correlation between mixing varians 30 seconds and 60 seconds is - 0, 904 which mean have a strong correlation and negative P= 0, 00. Because P< 0, 05 the conclusion is there is significcant correlation between this 2 variables...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the dimensional accuracy of different materials used in the confection of dies. Two stainless steel standard models were confected. One of the models, which was 2 mm larger than the other model, was used to provide a uniform relief for the two-step putty-wash impression technique. Thirty impressions were obtained using a polyvinyl siloxane impression material and randomly divided into three groups (n = 10) according to the type of casting material: type IV <b>dental</b> <b>stone,</b> commercially available epoxy resin (Tri-Epoxy), and industrial epoxy resin (Sikadur). After the setting/polymerization of the casting material, the dimensional stability was measured in terms of the height, diameter of the base and diameter of the top from the obtained dies and from the standard metal model using a profile projector. Results were analyzed by ANOVA and Dunnet test (&# 945; = 0. 05). In the height values, no significant difference was observed between the groups, except for Sikadur casts, which showed lower mean values. The Tri-Epoxi group showed statistically lower mean base diameter values, compared with the other groups, and both epoxy resin groups showed statistically lower mean top diameter values, compared with that for the type IV <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> group. We concluded that type IV gypsum and the commercially available epoxy resin showed similar behavior in most areas. The industrial epoxy resin did not show the same characteristics, although the diameter of the base obtained with it was similar to that obtained with type IV <b>dental</b> <b>stone...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if equilibration of <b>dental</b> <b>stone</b> casts mounted in maximum intercuspation can improve occlusal harmony of a cast gold restoration. A dentoform mounted on an articulator with crown preparation on tooth # 19 served as the simulated patient. <b>Dental</b> <b>stone</b> cast replicas were hand articulated in maximum intercuspation, mounted, and allocated for either equilibration or no equilibration. A crown was fabricated and adjusted on each cast set and returned to the dentoform. Vinylpolysiloxane interocclusal records were made and scanned for optical density with contact areas quantified as actual contact and near contact. Non-parametric tests were used to compare near and actual contact areas. Results of this study showed crowns fabricated from non-equilibrated casts had less near and actual occlusal contact than crowns from equilibrated casts (p< 0. 001). Crowns fabricated from equilibrated casts were nearer to that of the simulated patient. It is concluded from this study that cast equilibration improves occlusal harmony of an indirect restoration fabricated on casts mounted in maximum intercuspation...|$|E
