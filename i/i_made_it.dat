25|$|The Bulgarian state {{existed before}} the {{formation}} of the Bulgarian people. Prior to the establishment of the Bulgarian state the Slavs had mingled with the native Thracian population. The population and the density of the settlements increased after 681 and the differences between the individual Slavic tribes gradually disappeared as communications became regular between the regions of the country. By {{the second half of the}} 9th century, Bulgars and Slavs had lived together for almost two centuries and the more numerous Slavs were on the way to assimilate the Bulgars. Many Bulgars had already started to use the Slavic Old Bulgarian language while the Turkic Bulgar language gradually died out leaving only certain words and terms. The Christianization of Bulgaria and the establishment of Old Bulgarian as a language of the state and the Church under BorisI further accelerated that process and were the main means to bind together Bulgars and Slavs and to make the Slavs of Macedonia and the other reaches of the country into Bulgarians. The new religion dealt a crushing blow on the privileges of the old Bulgar aristocracy and furthermore by that time many Bulgars were presumably speaking Slavic. Boris <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a national policy to use the doctrine of Christianity, that had neither Slavic or Bulgar origin, to bind them together in a single culture. As a result, by the end of the 9th century the Bulgarians had become a single Slavic nationality with ethnic awareness that was to survive in triumph and tragedy to present.|$|E

She continues to express her gratitude with the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that never left me when everyone else just didn't care, you're the only one that really loved me. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> through the storm."

For example, in 2008 Fabio Capello appointed four Italians (Franco Baldini as general manager, Italo Galbiati as assistant coach, Franco Tancredi as goalkeeping coach and Massimo Neri as fitness coach); he then appointed Englishman Stuart Pearce, the England Under 21s coach, as an England coach, with Capello stating [...] "From the start <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear that I wanted an English coach {{as part of my}} coaching team." ...|$|E

500|$|I love New York. But if I'm there, I {{want to go}} out, friends come to the studio, {{the phone}} rings constantly.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the single}} opens with lyrics {{referencing}} locations in New York, it name-checks notable neighborhoods and captures the city's essence; from attending Knicks basketball games to its famous residents. Drug dealing references, [...] "N-words", and profanity are also present throughout the song. Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star {{commented on the}} track's lyrics [...] "I'm the new Sinatra/And since <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> here/I can make it anywhere/Yeah they love me everywhere" [...] remarking [...] "who can argue?"

500|$|Cameron {{explained}} forfeiting {{his share}} as complex. [...] "...the short version {{is that the}} film cost proportionally much more than [...] and True Lies. Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more," [...] he said. [...] "As the producer and director, I {{take responsibility for the}} studio that's writing the checks, so <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did." ...|$|E

500|$|As filming continued, Disney and Max Allan Collins {{conflicted}} {{over the}} novelization. The studio rejected his manuscript: [...] "I wound up doing an eleventh hour rewrite {{that was more}} faithful to the screenplay, even while <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> much more consistent with the strip," [...] Collins continued, [...] "and fixed as many plot holes as I could." [...] Disney did not like this version either, but accepted based on Beatty's insistence to incorporate some of Collins' writing into the shooting script, which solved the plot hole concerns. Through post-production dubbing, some of Collins' dialogue was also incorporated into the film. Principal photography for Dick Tracy ended in May 1989.|$|E

[...] "I will say that I was proud of the material, but maybe it's not the best version of Diamond Rio," [...] Olander told the publication. [...] "We were kind of in a no-man's land. We didn't fit in with country radio and we didn't fit with Christian radio. It was something that wasn't fully realized." [...] The band began releasing records independently, starting with a live album in 2014 and following in 2015 with the studio album <b>I</b> <b>Made</b> <b>It.</b>|$|E

On December 31, 1997, about 100 guests attended their wedding at The Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland.

500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit.

500|$|At Oxford, Tarwater {{found a new}} {{perspective}} on life: [...] "I {{used to be in the}} sport for Davis Tarwater. [...] Going to Oxford and seeing the selflessness and ambition of the students transitioned me to being in the sport as a mechanism to do good." [...] The Oxford swim team encouraged him to join its ranks, and he subsequently earned most valuable player honors and a Blue jacket, the British equivalent of a varsity letter. On his newfound perspective, Tarwater said, [...] "Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that's ever happened in my whole life... I would not have gone to Oxford; I would not have invested in my own personhood... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift... <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a misery. [...] It doesn't have to be a misery." [...] He graduated from Oxford in 2010 with a master's degree in Latin American studies. He described the year at Oxford as the best time of his life.|$|E

500|$|For {{the second}} European leg of Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2009, the {{performance}} of [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was removed from the}} setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen". This performance was included on the show's fourth and final Rave segment, where it was set between the performances of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrops used for this performance featured outtakes from the song's original music video directed by Chris Cunningham. Madonna sampled DJ Calvin Harris' 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone" [...] into the performance. Harris praised the version saying, [...] "I never imagined when <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> in my little purple room in Glasgow in my flat that it would reach far and wide as it has– it's always a privilege." [...] Six years later, on October 1, 2015, Madonna performed an acoustic version of [...] "Frozen" [...] on the Detroit stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. Four days later, she repeated the performance on the San Jose stop.|$|E
500|$|Come on Pilgrim was {{followed}} by the band's first full-length album, Surfer Rosa. The album was recorded by Steve Albini (who was hired by Watts-Russell on the advice of a 4AD colleague), completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988. Surfer Rosa gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both Melody Maker and Sounds gave Surfer Rosa their [...] "Album of the Year" [...] award. American critical response was also positive yet more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the band's career. The album was eventually certified Gold in the U.S. in 2005. After the album was released, the band arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European [...] "Sex and Death" [...] tour—beginning at the Mean Fiddler in London. The tour also took them to the Netherlands, where the Pixies had already received enough media attention to be headlining the tour. Francis later recalled: [...] "The first place <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> with the Pixies was in Holland." [...] The tour became notable for the band's in-jokes, such as playing their entire set list in alphabetical order.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Gulf News, Vikram spoke of the challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing the same costumes. He said, [...] "I love such challenges. [...] Although the costume defined {{each of the three}} characters in Anniyan, there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> dramatic to bring out each character." [...] He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, [...] "I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man who can get that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation." [...] Vikram confessed that he had a tough time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.|$|E

500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|Jesus College {{was founded}} on 27 June 1571, when Elizabeth I issued a royal charter. It was the first Protestant college to be founded at the university, {{and it is the}} only Oxford college to date from Elizabeth's reign. It was the first new Oxford college since 1555, in the reign of Queen Mary, when Trinity College and St John's College were founded as Roman Catholic colleges. The {{foundation}} charter named a principal (David Lewis), eight fellows, eight scholars, and eight commissioners to draw up the statutes for the college. The commissioners included Hugh Price, who had petitioned the queen to found a college at Oxford [...] "that he might bestow his estate of the maintenance of certain scholars of Wales to be trained up in good letters." [...] The college was originally intended primarily for the education of clergy. The particular intention was to satisfy a need for dedicated, learned clergy to promote the Elizabethan Religious Settlement in the parishes of England, Ireland and Wales. The college has since broadened the range of subjects offered, beginning with the inclusion of medicine and law, and now offers almost the full range of subjects taught at the university.

[...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
