40|$|To many, {{sustainability}} {{is nothing}} more than another legally ineffectual buzz word manufactured by the modern environmental movement. However, such a narrow view of the concept ignores a tremendous amount of historical precedent and jurisprudence underlying it. Specifically, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in Anglo-American property law has long been a vehicle for those with an interest in the future to restrict resource-depleting activities in the present, rendering it the manifestation of sustainability as a concrete legal obligation. It is through this doctrine, then, that the rich concept of sustainability as it applies to climate change policymaking can be best understood. The early history and development of the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in England and the United States, as well as the philosophical discourse surrounding equitable obligations to future generations, help to provide much-needed non-partisan legal and moral grounding for environmental policymaking. Specifically, the traditional American and English iterations of the waste doctrine provide a natural and tested tool for fashioning sustainability rules on a local scale. The age-old question of what precisely must be left to remaindermen is directly analogous to the modern questions concerning sustainable development and depletion of non-renewable resources. For this reason, the tests and rules applied in the courts of the early United States and England have a particularly useful and novel application to the modern policy discussion. Yet, an even deeper level of analytical significance exists because the choice between the extreme American and English versions of the waste doctrine maps onto the debate between the concepts of weak and strong sustainability. Through examination of the early cases and resultant rules in these two common law jurisdictions, this work provides a policy analysis tool and a recommended general course of action for environmental policymakers...|$|E
40|$|Lucrative pay to {{corporate}} managers remains controversial yet continues to evade judicial scrutiny for legitimacy. Although many arrangements likely would pass the most rigorous scrutiny, it seems equally clear that some would not. Some agreements {{are not the}} product of arm’s-length bargaining, can rivet managers on short-term stock prices at the destruction of long-term business value, and can misalign manager-shareholder interests. Yet even such objectionable arrangements are immune from serious legal oversight. In theory, they are open to judicial review under corporate law, but shareholders challenging pay contracts face formidable procedural hurdles in derivative litigation and substantive obstacles from corporation law’s business judgment rule and the anemic <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> A new legal theory {{would be useful to}} check board excesses in the population of clearly objectionable cases. This Article explains why and how traditional contract law’s theory of unconscionability should be used to create a modicum of judicial scrutiny to strike obnoxious pay contracts and preserve legitimate ones. Under this proposal, pay contracts that are the product of managerial domination of the process and formed on terms massively favoring the executive will be stricken. This will follow direct shareholder lawsuits in state courts where the contract is made or performed and applying that state’s contract law. This new legal theory circumvents today’s dead-end route, where pay contracts are always upheld in derivative shareholder lawsuits applying corporate law that sets no meaningful limits on executive pay. This proposal creates new but modest pressure from sister states on Delaware to take greater responsibility for the effects its production of corporate law has nationally. For those outraged by lopsided corporate executive compensation, this Article offers an appealing new legal theory of contractual unconscionability to police them. Those who see no or few problems with contemporary pay arrangements, or who are outraged by federal regulatory schemes like the Dodd-Frank Act, will welcome how this proposal is narrowly tailored using common law to address the most obnoxious cases...|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of {{contractual}} remedies, there are two axioms upon which legal scholars and jurists have come to rely, to wit, the court will not make for the parties a better contract than they made for themselves, and the goal of awarding contract damages {{is to put the}} aggrieved party in as good of a position as he would have enjoyed upon full performance. These two basic principles were etched into contract jurisprudence with the tools of justice and retribution in order to assure that contracting parties remain in complete control of their relations and that judicial involvement in contractual disputes is limited to fulfilling the intent of the parties. Thus, whenever a doctrine appears to run afoul of the underpinnings of contractual intent, {{it stands to reason that}} its veracity is called into question. This Article calls into question one such <b>doctrine,</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>waste.</b> As applied in the context of contractual rights and remedies, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>waste</b> exemplifies the difficulties of utilizing a robust but misunderstood theoretical construct. While such a doctrine is best understood from an economic perspective, such a perspective has been virtually ignored in the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudential application in contract law. Theoretical ignorance and a cavalier application <b>of</b> the economic <b>waste</b> <b>doctrine</b> is particularly problematic when it leads to confounding and incoherent remedial outcomes that defy the primary goal of contract damages—that is, to award the nonbreaching party his expectation interests...|$|R

40|$|In the {{traditional}} account, American courts transformed {{the law of}} waste, radically diverging from the British courts {{around the time of}} the American Revolution. Some of the most influential theorists of American legal history have used this account as evidence that American law is driven by economics. Due to its adoption by influential scholars, this traditional account of waste law has shaped not only our understanding of property law, but also how we view the process of transforming law. That traditional account, however, came not from a history of the doctrine, but from an elaboration of the benefits of the modern rule in comparison with the Drawbacks of the earlier, common law rule. A full history, reaching back to the common law doctrine has not been written until now. This Article provides a legal history of the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> exploring the original common law doctrine prior to the nineteenth century transformation, and demonstrating the multiple flaws of {{the traditional}} account. This Article demonstrates that there is little support for the traditional story of a radical and American break motivated by land development. A full account demonstrates that the charge was not radical, but rather consistent with centuries of British law. The shift also was not particularly American, but rather roughly contemporaneous with and parallel to a British shift. Most importantly, courts in both countries shifted doctrines to address a change in the technology of surveying and title recordation, rather than in response to economic forces. This new history of waste law also offers a critique of theories of the transformation of law, along with the current methods in legal history that privilege social factors and economic circumstances and largely abandon the traditional legal history methods of tracing the evolution of doctrine. Abandoning doctrine and privileging social factors has detracted from accurately understanding both legal transformation and the role of law - and particularly property law - in American society, suggesting that law is much more flexible and responsive to social change than it necessarily is in everyday politics...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} some of {{the multitude}} of legal devices used to control undesirable vegeta-tion, including both common law and statutory remedies. During {{the course of this}} discussion many of the land use problems caused by vegeta-tion are enumerated. Vegetation is ubiquitous; only in the most extreme environments is it lack-ing. The problems it can cause to land-owners are almost as varied as the number of plant species, and vary greatly with land use. Due to the breadth of this topic, certain areas will not be discussed because they have been thoroughly covered elsewhere. Some of these in-clude: the cultivation of controlled substances (1), problems concerning attractive nuisances (2) and interference with solar rights (3). Common Law Doctrines Common law doctrines associated with vegeta-tion control are at least as broad in their applica-bility as statutory remedies based on the police power, but are less commonly applied. The com-mon law doctrines which do have some applica-bility to cases regarding vegetation are waste law, nuisance law, and trespass law. Of these, waste law is the most limited in scope. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> allows the owner of the title of real property to have a cause of action re-questing damages and abrogation of tenancy in cases where the present possessor of that pro-perty allows it to become physically damaged (4). In England, waste doctrine developed prior to 1200 to protect title owners from the actions of tenants of estates created by the court and has been broadened over time to include other rela-tionships between title owner and possessor (5). Damages {{are most likely to be}} granted in cases of active waste, where a possessor or lessee ac-tively destroys the property of the title owner. In cases involving agricultural lands, the opinion of Hutton v. Warren 1 M&W 466 noted that active waste might be construed more broadly if there existed an implied contract from the custom of the country with regard to cultivated land being left to disrepair. There are a few United States cases which show that some states hold this custom, explicitly described in Anderson v. Hannon 24 P 228 (1890). One of the first is Clemence v. Steere...|$|E
40|$|Professor Purdy {{takes an}} early American {{change in the}} common-law <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> - {{governing}} relations between tenants and reversioners (sometimes landlords, sometimes heirs of deceased owners) - as an occasion to compare two modes of explaining doctrinal change: one exclusively economic, the other embracing political and ideological {{as well as economic}} explanations of individual and institutional behavior. Professor Purdy concludes that the fullest and most convincing interpretation of waste doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s transformation from English to American common law emerges from a pluralist account. He insists, however, that economic explanation not only has a central place in doctrinal interpretation, but is enriched even on its own terms by the addition of plural elements. Early American courts moved the law governing tenants 2 ̆ 7 use of land from a bright-line rule to a fuzzy standard. Courts styled the change an effort to rationalize the law in light of the very different proportions of land, labor, and capital present in North America as against those prevailing in England. Curiously, however, basic economic analysis of the American doctrine suggests it was not a clear improvement as an efficiency-enhancing device. The doctrine emerged, moreover, in the context of quasi-feudal landlord-tenant relations in the manorial estates of the Hudson Valley, which were in many respects the bete noir of the broadly republican ethos then prevalent in American law and politics. By examining the context of the seminal case and the thought of one its deciding judges - New York 2 ̆ 7 s Chancellor James Kent - on the relationship of property law to republican society, Professor Purdy shows how the change would have seemed attractive {{from the point of view}} of creating a formally egalitarian free-market society. This interpretation is not so much at odds with a conventional economic explanation as it is illuminating of what market economics meant in early eighteenth-century America. The free market described a set of social relationships, regarded as the antithesis of feudal hierarchy, which legislators and jurists did not assume as given, but set about deliberately to create, always in the shadow of the feudal counterpoint...|$|E

Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin.

The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life.
