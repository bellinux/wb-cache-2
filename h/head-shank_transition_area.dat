40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether patterns of avian species turnover reflect either biome or climate transitions at a regional scale, and whether anthropogenic landscape transformation affects those patterns. Location: South Africa and Lesotho. Methods: Biome and land transformation data {{were used to}} identify sets of <b>transition</b> <b>areas,</b> and avian species occurrence data were used to measure species turnover rates (β-diversity). Spatial congruence between <b>areas</b> of biome <b>transition,</b> <b>areas</b> of high vegetation heterogeneity, high climatic heterogeneity, and high β-diversity was assessed using random draw techniques. Spatial overlap in anthropogenically transformed areas, areas of high climatic heterogeneity and high β-diversity areas was also assessed. Results: Biome <b>transition</b> <b>areas</b> had greater vegetation heterogeneity, climatic heterogeneity, and β-diversity than expected by chance. For the land transformation <b>transition</b> <b>areas,</b> this was only true for land transformation heterogeneity values and {{for one of the}} β-diversity measures. Avian presence/ absence data clearly separated the biome types but not the land transformation types. Main conclusions: Biome edges have elevated climatic and vegetation heterogeneity. More importantly, elevated β-diversity in the avifauna is clearly reflected in the heterogeneous biome <b>transition</b> <b>areas.</b> Thus, there is spatial congruence in biome <b>transition</b> <b>areas</b> (identified on vegetation and climatic grounds) and avian turnover patterns. However, there is no congruence between avian turnover and land transformation <b>transition</b> <b>areas.</b> This suggests that biogeographical patterns can be recovered using modern data despite landscape transformation.

Each lizard was then {{randomly assigned to one of}} three treatments: (1) bilateral striato-amygdaloid <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> lesions, (2) bilateral dorsal cortex lesions or (3) untreated controls. Three days after trial 1, each lizard was subjected to a second trial and the tonic immobility duration recorded. The mean tonic immobility duration in lizards with striato-amygdaloid <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> lesions was significantly shorter (80. 5 %; p < 0. 0033) in trial 2 than in trial 1. There were no inter-trial differences within dorsal cortex-lesioned lizards or untreated controls. There was a significant treatment effect on tonic immobility duration in trial 2 (p < 0. 0001). The mean tonic immobility duration of lizards with striato-amygdaloid <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> lesions was significantly shorter than that of dorsal cortex-lesioned lizards (72. 2 %; p < 0. 01) or untreated controls (78. 2 %; p < 0. 01).

Tonic immobility is considered to be an anti-predator behaviour that reflects the underlying state of fear. Therefore, the reduced tonic immobility duration in lizards with striato-amygdaloid <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> lesions reflects a reduction of fear.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study {{addresses}} mechanisms {{driving the}} formation of ascending aortic aneurysms by comparing the maximal dilatation <b>area</b> with the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> immediately adjacent to the normal aortic tissue left in place during surgical repair. METHODS: Aortic wall specimens {{were taken from the}} maximal dilatation <b>area</b> and <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> in 10 patients undergoing surgery for ascending aortic aneurysms and fixed for histology and immunohistochemistry for vascular smooth muscle cells (alpha-actin), endothelial cells (CD 31), and macrophages (CD 68). Tissue concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase- 2, and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results are expressed as medians with their 25 th and 75 th centiles. RESULTS: Vascular smooth muscle cells were significantly more abundant in the maximal dilatation area than in the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> (20. 3 [14. 8 - 24. 4]/ 10 (- 2) mm 2 vs 8. 0 [6. 4 - 9. 3]/ 10 (- 2) mm 2, respectively, P =. 002). In the maximal dilatation area, vascular smooth muscle cells had lost their typical lamellar organization, whereas it was preserved in the <b>transition</b> <b>area.</b> Microvessels were significantly more abundant in the media of <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> than in the maximal dilatation area (7. 5 [2. 9 - 10. 1]/mm 2 vs 1. 75 [1. 5 - 2. 0]/mm 2, respectively, P =. 008) and were associated with an inflammatory cell infiltration that predominated in their immediate vicinity.

30|$|<b>Transition</b> <b>areas</b> between {{different}} vegetation types, for example between savanna and forest, are usually characterised by a gradual shift in environmental conditions and species composition (Furley et al. [1992]). In some areas, however, abrupt changes in soil {{and other environmental}} characteristics {{may result in a}} sharp edge between the different vegetation types (Ruggiero et al. [2002], Durigan and Ratter [2006]). In either case, both savanna and forest patches influence the <b>transition</b> <b>area,</b> and the influence is stronger closer to each patch (Cadenasso et al. [2003]). This is likely to result in a spatial gradient in species composition during the recolonisation of a <b>transition</b> <b>area,</b> as the occurrence and density of different species will vary with the distance from the source of diaspores (Wolters et al. [2005]). The environmental conditions found in the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> also affect the resulting species composition, as species originating from different environments are adapted to different environmental constraints. For example, savanna species are adapted to decreased soil fertility and water availability (Ruggiero et al. [2002]) and to regular fires (Moreira [2000]; Miranda et al. [2002]), factors that may lead to the local extinction of forest species.|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{functions}} {{in a competitive}} atmosphere. Government programs have not removed, though they have altered, competition in agriculture. Neighbor competes against neighbor, area against area, region against region, and country against country in the markets for agricultural commodities, and in pursuit of socio-economic objectives. Competition in agriculture is evidenced by declining agricultural population and shifts in production between farmers {{in the same area}} and in different areas. New techniques of production and specialization of production {{are becoming more and more}} common as tools of competition. It behooves individual farmers to examine their particular situation in relation to their neighbors, immediate and more distant, rural and urban, and thereby to ascertain their potential comparative advantage. For the agricultural economics researcher this environment opens a constantly new field in which to contribute. It is new in the sense of urgency, applicable technology, and prevailing socio-economic factors. It is in this spirit that this study was approached. It is hoped that this study will contribute knowledge of the agricultural potential of the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> and thereby assist in answering broader issues in its future. <b>Transition</b> <b>area</b> agriculture is characterized by low farm incomes, highly variable farm incomes, and severe soil erosion. As originally settled, the farm units in the area were of a size adapted to subhumid Corn Belt agriculture. The relatively low and highly variable rainfall of the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> in Central Nebraska precipitated ensuing readjustments of farm organization. The desire to readjust agriculture to prevailing conditions is not unique to the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> of Central Nebraska. Similar needs exist in varying degrees in other parts of the dry subhumid climate area of the United States. Thus, the particular area under consideration for this study, like the general area, is referred to as a <b>transition</b> <b>area,</b> an <b>area</b> of <b>transition</b> from Corn Belt climate to Great Plains climate. Focus of this study is not necessarily limited to the easement of socioeconomic conditions in periods of below normal rainfall. Rather, it seeks to gain long-term perspective of what agricultural production responses may reasonably be expected in the <b>transition</b> <b>area</b> consistent with the practical application of existent technology.
