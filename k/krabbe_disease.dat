The typical intracranial findings of T 2 hyperintensity without contrast enhancement were present within the periventricular white matter, but there was no area of abnormal signal intensity or enhancement within the sub-stance of the spinal cord.

40|$|Globoid cell leukodystrophy, or <b>Krabbe’s</b> <b>disease,</b> is {{a severe}} {{disorder}} {{of the central}} and peripheral nervous system caused {{by the absence of}} galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Herein, we describe the clinical, neuropathological, histochemical, and immunohistological features observed in rhesus macaques affected with <b>Krabbe’s</b> <b>disease.</b> Clinical signs included pronounced muscle tremors of head and limbs, difficulty ambulating, ataxia, hypermetria, proprioceptive deficits, and respiratory abnormalities. Histopathologically, all animals presented with evidence of demyelination in the peripheral and central nervous systems and accumulation of mononuclear and multinuclear globoid cells in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter associated with severe gliosis. Using immunohistochemistry and multi-label confocal microscopy, it was determined that globoid cells were CD 68 +, HAM 56 +, LN 5 +, CD 163 +, IBA- 1 +, and Glut- 5 +, suggesting that both peripheral blood-derived monocytes/macrophages and resident parenchymal microglia gave rise to globoid cells. Interestingly, many of the globoid cells and parenchymal microglia with a more ameboid morphology expressed HLA-DR, indicating immune activation. Increased expression of iNOS, TNF-α, and IL- 1 β were observed in the affected white matter, colocalizing with globoid cells, activated microglia, and astrocytes. Cytokine mRNA levels revealed markedly increased gene expression of CCL 2 in the brain of affected macaques. CCL 2 -expressing cells were detected throughout the affected white matter, colocalizing with GFAP+ cells and astrocytes.

40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} (<b>Krabbe’s</b> <b>disease)</b> {{is one of}} {{the classic}} genetic leukodystrophies first described by Krabbe in 1916. 1 It is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. Typically, it is an early-onset, rapidly progressive, and invari-ably fatal disease of infants characterized by nearly exclu-sive manifestations of white-matter involvement. However, patients with more slowly progressive juvenile and adult forms are being uncovered with increasing frequency. Rapid and complete loss of myelin and the oligodendrocytes, reac-tive astrocytic gliosis, and infiltration of the unique “globoid cells ” are the pathologic hallmarks of the disease. 2 In 1970, genetic deficiency of galactosylceramidase was identified as the underlying cause of human and canine globoid cell leukodystrophy. 3, 4 It was also demonstrated early that there was no overt accumulation of galactosylceramide in the brain of patients with <b>Krabbe’s</b> <b>disease,</b> 5 in contrast to an equivalent disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, in which abnormal sulfatide accumulation had been well established since the first report by Jatzkewitz. 6 There were other obser-vations in globoid cell leukodystrophy that provided a puz-zling contrast in regard to those with metachromatic leukodystrophy, even though the two diseases are meta-bolically closely related.

40|$|The twitcher mouse is {{an animal}} model of galactosylceramidase deficiency, {{comparable}} to <b>Krabbe's</b> <b>disease,</b> a lysosomal storage disease in humans. As in most lysosomal storage diseases, neurological deterioration is a prominent {{feature of the}} disease in these mice. Transplantation of enzymatically normal congenic bone marrow was earlier found to result in prolonged survival and increased levels of galactosylceramidase in the visceral organs of twitcher mice. It is now reported that bone marrow transplantation results in increased galactosylceramidase levels in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Concomitantly, the levels of psychosine, a highly toxic lipid that progressively accumulates in the CNS of untreated twitcher mice, stabilized at much lower levels in the CNS of treated twitcher mice. Histologically, a gradual disappearance of globoid cells, the histological hallmark of <b>Krabbe's</b> <b>disease,</b> and the appearance of foamy macrophages capable of metabolizing the storage product were seen in the CNS. By immunohistochemical labeling it was demonstrated that these foamy macrophages were of donor origin.

40|$|Abstract Background Twitcher mouse (twi/twi) is an {{authentic}} murine model of <b>Krabbe's</b> <b>disease.</b> Accumulation of psychosine, resulting in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes and subsequent demyelination, is a cardinal event to {{the pathogenesis of}} this disease. Moreover, recruitment of inflammatory cells {{plays a significant role}} in the pathological process in the twi/twi central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we investigated the 1) the relationship between tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), pro-inflammatory cytokine, and the progression of this disease and 2) effect of the anti-inflammatory therapy by ibudilast, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Methods We quantified the expression level of TNFα and TNF-receptor mRNA in twi/twi using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The relationship between TNFα expression, apoptosis of oligodendrocytes and demyelination was studied with immunohistochemistry and TUNEL method. We then treated twi/twi with a daily intraperitoneal injection of ibudilast (10 mg/kg), which suppress TNFα production in the brain. Results We found that TNFα-immunoreactive microglia/macrophages appeared in the twi/twi brain and that the mRNA levels of TNFα and TNF-receptor 1 was increased with the progression of demyelination. The distribution profile of TNFα-immunoreactive microglia/macrophages overlapped that of TUNEL-positive oligodendrocytes in the twi/twi brain. When twi/twi was treated with ibudilast from PND 30, the number of oligodendrocytes undergoing apoptosis was markedly reduced and demyelination was milder. Obvious improvement of clinical symptom was noted in two of five. The failure of constant clinical improvement by ibudilast may result from hepatotoxicity and/or the inhibition of proliferation of NG 2 -positive oligodendrocyte precursors. Conclusion We conclude that anti-inflammatory therapy by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor can be considered as a novel alternative therapy for <b>Krabbe's</b> <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|R
