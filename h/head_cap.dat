5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale <b>head</b> <b>cap.</b> The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E

The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag and a <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> were recovered beside the body.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{simulate}} cerebral {{temperature behaviour}} with hypothermia treatment applying different cooling devices {{and to find}} the optimal brain temperature monitoring. Methods: Models based on hourly temperature values recorded in patients with severe aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, taking MRI data, thermal conductive properties, metabolism and blood flow into account were applied to different scenarios of hypothermia. Results: Systemic hypothermia by endovascular cooling leads to an uniform temperature decrease within the brain tissue. Cooling with <b>head</b> <b>caps</b> lead to 33 ◦C only in the superficial brain while the deep brain remains higher than 36 ◦C. Cooling with neckbands lead to 35. 8 ◦C for dry and 32. 8 ◦C for wet skin in the deep brain. Conclusions: With <b>head</b> <b>caps</b> temperatures below 36 ◦C cannot be reached in the deep brain tissue, whereas neckbands, covering the carotid triangles, may lead to hypothermic temperatures in the deep brain tissue. Temperature sensors have to be applied at least 2 cm below the cortical surface to give values representative for deep brain tissue...|$|R

50|$|This metal device {{featured}} a plate that sat below the victim's jaw, which was {{connected by a}} frame to the <b>head</b> <b>cap.</b> As the torturer slowly twisted the handle, {{the gap between the}} <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> and plate decreased, crushing the skull, including the teeth, mandible and facial bones, and ultimately inducing death. Even if the torturer stopped before death, permanent damage to the facial muscles and structure would have occurred. The victim's head would slowly be crushed, killing the victim, but not before the victim's jaw had been crushed, and their eyes may have possibly extruded from their sockets. To aggravate the pain, the torture master would sometimes amuse himself by tapping on the metal cap with a small hammer. The head crusher was used to extract information from criminals. It would scare them to the point of giving up knowledge that was crucial to solving serious criminal cases.|$|E
