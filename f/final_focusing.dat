40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{order to}} achieve {{luminosity}} {{in the range of}} 10 34 cm - 2 sec - 1, a TeV-scale linear collider will need {{to reduce the size of}} electron and positron bunches at collision to sizes on the order of several nanometers. This vertical size mandates a demagnification from the linac to the IP of a factor of 400. Such a severe demagnification places unprecedented tolerances on many optical aberrations of the <b>final</b> <b>focus</b> system, most of which cannot be met ab initio, but only as a result of beam-based tuning of the <b>final</b> <b>focus.</b> Any linear collider must have an algorithm and diagnostics which will allow such tuning to converge in a finite time.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Final</b> <b>focusing</b> of ion {{beams and}} their {{propagation}} in a reactor chamber are crucial for heavy ion beam driven fusion power production. The concept and technical realization of these operations have strong impacts {{both on the}} design of the accelerator and the layout of the reactor chamber. Most studies today are based on ballistic focusing by magnetic quadrupole lenses. This concept suffers from the sensitivity of the final focus to the current and shape of the beam pulse that is delivered by the driving accelerator. To reduce space charge blow-up of the driver beam in the final focus region the total beam current has to be divided into several beams, each with an individual <b>final</b> <b>focusing</b> system and a separate beam port in the reactor chamber. An alternative solution is to strip the ions to a high charge state and to space charge and current neutralize the beam completely.
