5|$|The Supreme Council met at 10:30. Suzuki, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> from {{a meeting}} with the Emperor, said it was {{impossible}} to continue the war. Tōgō Shigenori said that they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but they needed a guarantee of the Emperor's position. Navy Minister Yonai said that they had to make some diplomatic proposal—they could no longer afford to wait for better circumstances.|$|E
5|$|For the 1913 season Oliver was {{appointed}} vice captain of Port Adelaide alongside new club captain John Londrigan who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> from the Adelaide University Football Club after that clubs {{failed attempt to}} gain entry into the SAFL. During August Harold Oliver married Blanche Downer from Lyrup. Port Adelaide won the 1913 SAFL premiership by defeating North Adelaide in the 1913 SAFL Grand Final in front of 22,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval. Oliver and Port Adelaide {{went on to win}} the 1913 Championship of Australia by defeating VFL premier Fitzroy.|$|E
5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing an}} {{exhibition}} match, Murray started the French Open with three tough wins, before losing in straight sets to Tomáš Berdych {{in the fourth}} round. In London, Murray progressed to the third round, where he faced Mardy Fish. At 3–3 in the final set with momentum going Murray's way (he <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> back from 3–0 down), the match was called off for bad light, leaving Murray fuming. Coming back the next day, Murray was edged out by the eventual finalist in a tie-breaker for his second defeat by him in the year. At Wimbledon, Murray progressed to the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets. On 27 July 2010, Murray and his coach Maclagan split, and Murray replaced him with Àlex Corretja.|$|E

It was bought used by Widerøe in 1985 and registered as LN-WFN on 8 November 1985. Its {{certificate of airworthiness}} was last renewed on 4 November 1987 and was valid until 30 November 1988.

5|$|When {{the shuffle}} format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E

25|$|The {{objectives}} of the Alsos Mission were {{to determine if the}} Germans had an atomic bomb program and to exploit German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, materiel resources, and scientific personnel {{for the benefit of the}} US.

25|$|As {{the second}} Confederate return line collapsed, Ayres and Sheridan came forward.

25|$|In 1799, after {{a series}} of naval battles with the French (known as the Quasi-War), {{full-scale}} war seemed inevitable. In this crisis, Adams broke with his party and sent three new commissioners to France. Napoleon, who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> to power, received them cordially, and the danger of conflict subsided with the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which formally released the United States from its 1778 wartime alliance with France. However, reflecting American weakness, France refused to pay $20 million in compensation for American ships seized by the French navy.|$|E
25|$|My friend Clinch Smith {{made the}} {{proposition}} that we should leave and go toward the stern. But there arose before us from the decks below a mass of humanity several lines deep converging on the Boat Deck facing us and completely blocking our passage to the stern. There were women in the crowd {{as well as men}} and these seemed to be steerage passengers who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> up from the decks below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.|$|E
25|$|Gordon Muchall's maiden List A century, an unbeaten 101 off 107 balls, boosted Durham Dynamos {{to their}} third {{straight}} one-day victory and promotion from Division Two. It was Yorkshire Phoenix who batted first, however, and fifties from Michael Lumb and Anthony McGrath - who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> off making 238 {{runs in a}} Championship game with Worcestershire - gave them a total of 237 for 6 in 45 overs, despite Callum Thorp bowling his seven overs for 22 runs. Yorkshire got a wicket in the first half-hour, having Gavin Hamilton caught for 5, but without Tim Bresnan and Deon Kruis, Yorkshire struggled to take wickets, and Durham won with ten balls to spare.|$|E
