One mutant (CBM 1) contained an additional active site, by deleting Val- 28 and converting Leu- 29, Gly- 30, Ala- 31 and Glu- 32 to Asp, Ala, Asp and Gly, respectively, in the normally inactive trigger site 1 in the N-terminus. In another mutant (CBM 2 A), the normally active site 2 was inactivated by conversion of Asp- 65 to Ala. The fibers {{were found to}} be down-regulated with recombinant cardiac troponin C (CTnC 3), as with tissue-cardiac-troponin-C. With mutants, in one case (CBM 1) the regulation was unmodified despite Ca 2 + coordination by all sites.

40|$|The ratite moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) were a speciose {{group of}} massive graviportal avian herbivores that {{dominated}} the New Zealand (NZ) ecosystem until their extinction � 600 years ago. The phylogeny and evolutionary history of this morphologically diverse order has remained controversial since their initial description in 1839. We synthesize mitochondrial phylogenetic information from 263 subfossil moa specimens from across NZ with morphological, ecological, and new geological data to create the first comprehensive phylogeny, taxonomy, and evolutionary timeframe {{for all of the}} species of an extinct order. We also present an important new geological/paleogeographical model of late Cenozoic NZ, which suggests that terrestrial biota on the North and South Island landmasses were isolated {{for most of the past}} 20 – 30 Ma. The data reveal that the patterns of genetic diversity within and between differentmoaclades reflect a complex history following a major marine transgression in the Oligocene, affected by marine barriers, tectonic activity, and glacial cycles. Surprisingly, the remarkable morphological radiation of moa appears to have occurred much more recently than previous early Miocene (ca. 15 Ma) estimates, and was coincident with the accelerated uplift of the Southern Alps <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 5 – 8. 5 Ma.

Both conformers possess similar bond distances, but differ in up 12 ° in some dihedrals. Conformer I geometry presents the larger distortion from the regular 1, 3 -dithiane mainly due to difference between angles &# 954; 1 and &# 954; 2 (ca. 14 °). In conformer II this difference is <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 3 °.

40|$|Limonium barceloi (Plumbaginaceae) is {{a narrow}} endemic {{seasonal}} halophytic plant, uniquely {{found in a}} highly degraded urban wetland in the Bay of Palma Mallorca, located in the northwest Mediterranean. It was awarded critically endangered status in 2004 and {{is the subject of}} a recovery plan administered by local government. Despite this, the last ten years have seen a dramatic decline in the population from ca. 3, 000 individuals to <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 300; reasons for this decline are principally anthropogenic disturbance. Here we present the results of an investigation into some aspects of the reproductive biology of this species in the last remaining in situ population, in order to gain insight into its limited distribution and abundance, and to guide further development of management strategies. Findings indicate that although it provides important floral resources to a number of insect visitors, the plant is an autonomous apomictic that may also be functioning as an obligate asexual reproducer, and low genetic variation is suspected. Germinability is observed to be at ca. 70 % and was positively correlated with maternal plant size characteristics. Two seed predators, the moth Goniodoma limoniella (Coleophoridae) and the ant Messor bouvieri (Myrmicinae), were discovered affecting both pre- and post-dispersal seeds.

40|$|The Lesina Marina village (Apulia, {{southern}} Italy) lies on {{an exotic}} rocky body basically composed of Triassic gypsum surrounded and covered by thin Quaternary sandy deposits. During {{the last two}} decades instability phenomena connected to gypsum dissolution and cover suffusion sinkholes occurred mainly along the Acquarotta canal and in the urbanized area. In this study, electrical resistivity tomographies, field and petrographic observations have been carried out <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 300 m to the South of the residential area. The East-West striking geoelectrical profile has a length of 1900 m, intercepts two boreholes and crosscuts the Acquarotta canal. Close to the boreholes, higher resolution geoelectrical profiles, both perpendicular and parallel to the former, were performed. The two boreholes highlight the presence, from the top to the bottom, of Quaternary sandy deposits, coarse grained gypsum and layered finer grained gypsum. In correspondence, electrical resistivities are very low for the wet sandy deposits (up to 5 Ω·m), increase for coarse grained gypsum (20 - 120 Ω·m) and reach the maximum values for the layered finer grained gypsum (greater than 300 Ω·m). The relationship between the electrical resistivity and the lithological composition of the studied rocks is strongly controlled by their fracturing and water saturation degree. Thus considering, the main geological features here recovered are the impermeable bedrock and the above rocky body involved by mineral transformations and karstification phenomena. Additionally, the anhydrite/gypsum transformation and the gypsum dissolution are related to the groundwater circulation and localized within massive coarse grained gypsum rocks. Therefore, the hazard related to karst processes involves both an area and a depth greater than those considered up to now...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a comprehensive account (based on whole mount preparations, serial sections, and Scanning electron microscopy) of the cephalic structure of an adult exemplar of the family, to supplement the sparse available information. Notable plesiomorphies include the retention of frontal retractors of the narrow labrum, a high supraocular index linked to strong development of cranio-mandibular ad- and abductors, and perhaps the unusually short but still coilable (<b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 1. 5 turns) galeal "tongue. " Notable specializations (probably mostly family autapomorphies) include a complement of large sensilla placodea on the male antennae, an apical attachment of the long dorsal tentorial arm to the cranium, an extreme reduction of the single-segmented labial palps, a particularly strong subgenal bridge and a surface structure of near-parallel ridges on the ommatidial corneae. The presence of sizable saccular mandibular (type 1) glands opening into the adductor apodeme is unexpected, no counterparts being known from neighboring taxa. The same is true for ventral salivarium dilator muscles originating on the prelabium; and tentatively suggested to be homologues of the extrinsic palp flexors (the insertion shift being related to loss of original function due to palp reduction), rather than to the ventral salivarium muscles of more basal insects. A complete "deutocerebral loop"' may or may not be developed, as is true for a mutual appression of the optic lobe and circumoesophageal connective/suboesophageal ganglion, enclosing the anterior tentorial arm between them; a suboesophageal innervation of the retrocerebral complex was not observed. No characters bearing on the monophyly of the Coelolepida were identified.

30|$|The low pH {{environment}} in the lysosome lumen makes it challenging to measure and monitor [Ca 2 +]LY accurately. Thus, {{there has been a}} need for an assay that can detect Ca 2 + release and refilling without interfering with lysosomal pH. To monitor lysosomal Ca 2 + release, Shen et al. (Shen et al., 2012) fused a GECI (i.e., GCaMP) to the cytosolic N-terminus of TRPML 1. Using this lysosome-targeted GECI, Garrity et al. (Garrity et al., 2016) developed a robust lysosomal Ca 2 + refilling assay, in which consecutive applications of ML-SAs trigger consecutive bouts of Ca 2 + release at 5 -min intervals. The initial application of ML-SA depletes lysosomal Ca 2 + stores, such that the response to the second application depends on lysosomal Ca 2 + refilling during the 5 -min interval (Garrity et al., 2016). To {{rule out the possibility that}} the GECI also detects ML-SA 1 -induced Ca 2 + responses from organelles other than endolysosomes, control experiments were performed in which lysosomal Ca 2 + stores were depleted with GPN. Importantly, a TRPML 1 agonist, whose specificity was confirmed with mouse knockouts, was shown to be cell permeable with reversible effects (Shen et al., 2012; Garrity et al., 2016). In addition, the specificity of ML-SAs ensures that one is observing real changes in lysosomal Ca 2 +, as opposed to pH changes associated with other Ca 2 +-mobilizing reagents acting on lysosomes (Garrity et al., 2016). Indeed, ML-SA 1 -induced responses were completely abolished by BAPTA-AM treatment, consistent with Ca 2 +-specificity of the signal (Garrity et al., 2016). In contrast, GPN- or Baf-A 1 -induced presumed-to-be-Ca 2 +-specific responses persisted in the presence of BAPTA-AM (Garrity et al., 2016). Therefore, these results suggest that although GPN mobilizes more than <b>just</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +, it is a very specific lysosome-disrupting agent. Hence, it can be used as a powerful tool to confirm the lysosome-specificity of other Ca 2 +-mobilizing reagents, such as ML-SA 1.|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) {{is characterized}} by dyslipidemia, central obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia. However, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) {{may or may not}} be present in metabolic syndrome. MS and T 2 DM are considered important cardiovascular risk factors, but the role of hyperglycemia in coronary disease is still contested in the literature. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on the severity of coronary disease in MS patients, with or without T 2 DM, submitted to coronary angiography (CA) and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS). This is a cross sectional, observational study with 100 MS patients (50 % with T 2 DM), 60 % male. All of the patients had been referred for CA procedures. The obstruction was considered severe when stenosis was greater than 70 % and moderate if it was between 50 - 69 %. Patients detected with a moderate obstruction by CA were indicated to IVUS. A minimal luminal area of less than 4 mm 2 detected by IVUS was also considered severe. IDF criteria were used to define Metabolic Syndrome and T 2 DM diagnosis was defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. Student's t-test and Pearson Chi-square were used for statistical analysis, considering p < 0. 05 statistically significant. The majority of T 2 DM patients presented severe arterial lesions (74 % vs 22 %, p< 0. 001). Using CA procedure, 12 % of T 2 DM had moderate obstructions, compared to 38 % of the non-diabetic group (p< 0. 05). 8 % of patients with moderate lesions by CA were diagnosed with a luminal area less than 4 mm 2 using IVUS. This luminal area was significantly smaller in the T 2 DM group than in the control group (3. 8 mm 2 ± 2. 42. vs 4. 6 mm 2 ± 2. 58, p = 0. 03). Patients with MS and T 2 DM submitted to angiography and IVUS, had more severe coronary lesions compared to MS patients without diabetes. This finding suggests that beyond insulin resistance that is present in MS, hyperglycemia may also play a role in the development of atherosclerotic disease. IVUS was useful for diagnosing 8 % of severe cases initially considered to be moderate obstructions when using <b>just</b> <b>CA</b> in this scenario...|$|E
40|$|Helium is an {{invaluable}} element {{as it is}} widely used in industry such as cryo-genics and welding due to its unique properties. However, helium shortage is expected in near future because of increasing demand and the anxiety of sup-ply. Consequently, helium production has {{attracted the attention of}} industry. The main source of He is natural gas and extracting it from LNG end-flash is considered as the most promising way of producing crude helium. Thus, many process suppliers have proposed process configurations for this and there are mainly three types of helium extraction process, flashing-based, distillation-based and the integration of flashing and distillation. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to conduct a comparative evaluation of the proposed helium extraction processes for LNG plants and give a guideline for a proper selection. This evaluation was performed by simulating each process through Aspen HYSYS. The simulation result was then analysed, focusing on various criteria. The result indicates that all the helium extraction process studied could ex-tract most of helium contained in feed gas except the Technip Distillation process. Regarding LNG production, the integration of the Re-boiled Distilla-tion and a LNG process gives the lowest LNG production specific power. In terms of fuel gas, only the APCI Distillation process could generate fuel gas having less than 40 mole% N 2, which is upper limit for industrial gas turbines, even with He and thus N 2 rich feed gas. Between others, only the Technip Distillation and the ExxonMobil Integration process could produce liquid N 2 and the amount was enough to be used for further processing of crude helium. Concerning freezing of impurities such as CO 2, the ExxonMobil Integration process displayed an excellent performance, recording the warmest working temperature. When considering complexity, the APCI Distillation process was the simplest one, while the two integration-based processes from Linde and ExxonMobil required a lot of equipment. Finally, economic evaluation showed that all the integrations of each the helium extraction process studied and a LNG plant create more economic value than a LNG plant alone. Nevertheless, the difference was <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 1 % with current helium price. The selection of the most suitable helium extraction process for a LNG plant completely depends on the situation as each process possesses its own charac-teristic. Thus, proper technical choices have to be made to achieve a successful helium extraction project. </p...|$|E

40|$|Since the field-defining patient HM, {{consistent}} links {{have been}} made between a region of the brain called the hippocampus and memories that can be consciously declared â so called declarative memories. Declarative memories fall into two categories (1) episodic memories, memories that are highly detailed and re-experiential, and (2) semantic memories, fact-based memories for personal and public information but that {{have no sense of}} re-experiencing. It is believed that the intrinsic anatomy of the hippocampus supports episodic memory but not semantic memory. The hippocampus consists of five regions (cornu Ammonis, CA, 1 - 3, dentate gyrus, subiculum) with each purported to have a specific role in episodic memory acquisition and retrieval. However, controversy surrounds the temporal extent to which episodic memories rely on the hippocampus for retrieval: current consensus suggests the hippocampus supports these memories for five- 10 years post-acquisition, but some suggest that it is required for retrieval across the lifetime. Voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibody-mediated limbic encephalitis (VGKC-complex LE) is a recently described autoimmune disease that causes chronic hippocampal atrophy and mild amnesia on standardized neuropsychological assessment. Two subfields of the hippocampus â CA 1 and CA 3 â contain the antigenic targets of the disease but it is unknown if specific atrophy of these subfields underlies the hippocampal damage in humans. Here, the human hippocampal subfield volumes of VGKC-complex LE patients (n = 19, mean age: 64. 0 ± 2. 55; range: 24 - 71) were investigated using ultra-high spatial resolution MRI at 7. 0 -Tesla. Assessment also included standardized neuropsychology to examine the impact of the pathology on hippocampal-dependent and âindependent memory performance, as well as attention, language, executive function, and perception Declarative memory assessment measured semantic and episodic memory performance across the lifespan. Manual segmentation detected lesions to <b>just</b> <b>CA</b> 3, with no volume loss noted elsewhere in the hippocampus or brain. Patients were impaired on hippocampal-dependent memory domains but not the hippocampal-independent and non-memory domains. Notably, episodic memory assessment revealed episodic amnesia across the lifetime except for their earliest memories. This counters the received convention that the hippocampus has a temporally limited role in episodic retrieval. Conversely, the performance of the VGKC-complex LE patients for semantic memory, including a new test developed herein, was comparable to controls across the lifespan. It was then shown that CA 3 volume predicted episodic memory performance across the lifetime. Together, the results suggest that VGKC-complex LE provides a novel model of human hippocampal subfield pathology, with which to explore the roles of hippocampal subfields in episodic memory acquisition and retrieval. </p...|$|E
40|$|The late Holocene distal {{tract of}} the Adige {{sedimentary}} system is bounded {{to the north}} by the Brenta River megafan and to the south by the Po sedimentary system (MURST, 1997; FONTANA, et alii, 2008). This latter boundary is not well defined, as branches of the Po River have occasionally intersected the Adige alluvial plain and, vice versa, Adige channels have crossed the Po Plain. The study area is located within the belt where the Adige and Po rivers have interfingered in the past. This alluvial plain {{is characterized by a}} complex network of alluvial ridges formed by the aggradation of sandy and silty channel deposits, natural levees and minor proximal crevasse splays (VEGGIANI, 1972; PERETTO, 1986; MARCOLONGO, 1987; CASTIGLIONI, 2001; PIOVAN et alii 2010). The interdistributary depressions are generally silty-clay, but frequently show evidence of accumulation of organic deposits in extensive swamps or are occupied by dense networks of distal crevasse channels and splays. High-resolution sedimentological and geochronological data, here presented, allow the description of major alluvial ridges. As well, the correlation among stratigraphical elements is shown in a number of cross-sections. A stratigraphic marker is provided by a calcic horizon which has been reached at average depth of 7 m in Cona and Conselve cross-sections. It can be correlated with the “caranto” palaeosoil of the Lagoon of Venice (GATTO & PREVIATELLO, 1974; MOZZI et alii 2003), which formed during the sedimentary hiatus and sub-aerial exposure of the alluvial plain between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the post-glacial transgression. This buried soil marks the top of the Late Pleistocene sequence in the whole Venetian-Friulian Plain (FONTANA et alii, 2008). Another important element for stratigraphic reconstruction is a 1 m thick peat layer recognized in the whole study area at the average depth of 5 m. Chronostratigraphic evidence indicates that this major organic-rich sedimentary event in the fluvial series may correlate with the marine maximum flooding surface. The radiocarbon dating of the bottom of this peat layer is 4435 ‒ 5306 cal BP at Cona and 3557 ‒ 3699 cal BP at Conselve, <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 1 m above the calcic palaeosoil; this points to condensed alluvial sedimentation during the early Holocene. Other ages from the bottom of this layer are 4570 ‒ 5330 cal BP in Saline and 5595 ‒ 5754 cal BP in Santa Margherita. The radiocarbon dating {{at the top of the}} peat provided the ages of 3455 ‒ 4094 cal BP in Cona, 3201 ‒ 3354 cal BP in Conselve, 4237 ‒ 4979 cal BP in Saline and 3158 ‒ 3383 cal BP in Santa Margherita cross sections. Radiocarbon datings evidence that the base of the peat layer is progressively younger in more landward locations. Peat started to form around 5700 cal BP in Santa Margherita, the place nearest to the coastline, at 5300 ‒ 4400 cal BP in Saline-Cona and 3600 cal BP in Conselve. After peat deposition, a phase of major aggradation occurred in the area, which resulted in the formation of alluvial ridges. Radiocarbon datings on organic clays in natural levee deposits in Conselve and Santa Margherita cross sections give the ages of 1950 ‒ 2119 cal BP at 3. 53 m depth and 1995 ‒ 2157 cal BP at 2. 5 m depth respectively. This evidences continuous aggradation until Roman times, mainly related to the Adige alluvial system as around 3000 BP the Po di Saline-Cona palaeochannel was not anymore active (PIOVAN et alii, 2010) ...|$|E

We have measured nAChR-mediated currents in rat chromaffin cells by using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine (Nic) activated inward currents in chromaffin cells with EC 50 of 63 and 24 μM, respectively. Choline, a selective agonist a 7 and a 9 a 10 nAChRs, and oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M), a selective agonist of a 9 a 10 -containing nAChRs, elicited inward currents that, reached values of 13 % and 27 %, respectively, of the maximum elicited by ACh (100 μM). a-bungarotoxin partially blocked (IC 50 of 3, 13 nM) currents induced by Oxo-M (300 μM) in a reversible manner, suggesting {{the presence of the}} a 9 a 10 subtype in chromaffin cells. The inhibitory effects of d-tubocurarine, strychnine, atropine and nicotine on Oxo-M-induced currents confirmed this interpretation. Ionic selectivity of the a 9 a 10 nAChRs study established the following permeability sequence for: Ca 2 + >> Cs+ > Na+ Li+>> Tris+.

La bungarotoxina (BgTx) bloqueó parcial y reversiblemente (CI 50 de 3, 13 nM) las corrientes inducidas por Oxo-M (300 μM), sugiriendo la presencia de un nAChR formado por subunidades a 9 y a 10 en esta preparación. Los efectos bloqueantes de d-tubocurarina, estricnina, atropina y Nic sobre corrientes inducidas por Oxo-M confirmaron esta interpretación. El estudio de la selectividad iónica de los nAChRs a 9 a 10, determinó la siguiente secuencia de permeabilidades: Ca 2 + >> Cs+ > Na+. Li+>> Tris+. Los resultados indican que los a 9 a 10 son altamente permeables al Ca 2 + y que este catión modula la corriente a través de dicho receptor. Finalmente, cabe señalar que la entrada de Ca 2 + a través del receptor 9 10 fue capaz de inducir la respuesta secretora en células cromafines de rata...|$|E

40|$|The {{study area}} {{is located in}} the distal portion of the Adige {{alluvial}} system between the cities of Rovigo and Adria and is characterized by a complex network of alluvial ridges formed by the aggradation of sandy deposits along the river branch during the Holocene avulsions by Adige and Po rivers. The reconstruction of the palaeohydrographical conditions during the Late Holocene of this area has been mainly based on remote sensing interpretation and archaeological data (Veggiani, 1972; Peretto, 1986; Marcolongo, 1987; Cremonini, 2007). In this research, new chronostratigraphical and petrographical data are presented, in order to provide better insights on the Holocene palaeohydrography and stratigraphy of this area. Geomorphological, stratigraphical and petrographical results confirm the presence of a Po branch from Fratta Polesine through Sarzano to Cona which activity began after 4237 - 4979 cal. BP in Saline 1 and after 4141 - 4712 cal. BP in Cona, and produced the Villadose crevasse splay. The palaeochannel deactivation dates back in the Late Bronze Age as confirmed by archaeological settlement in Saline that lies on the natural levee deposits. In Cona 1, a calcic horizon has been reached at the mean depth of - 7. 5 m a. s. l. It can be correlated with the “caranto” palaeosoil of the Lagoon of Venice (Mozzi et al. 2003), produced during a sub-aerial exposure of the sediment after the last glacial maximum lowstand phase. In this interpretation, this buried soil marks the top of the Late Pleistocene sequence. As evidenced in the whole Venetian-Friulian Plain, the alluvial sequence is characterized by a sedimentary hiatus since 14500 to 8000 BP (Fontana et al., in press). After this hiatus, the transgressive phase began and the sea level rise caused an increase of the underground water table with the setting of swamp conditions, which characterized the floodplain during the maximum flooding (6000 - 5500 BP in the Po delta region (Stefani & Vincenzi, 2005). The peat deposits found in Cona, Saline and Chiaroni at the mean depth of - 4 m a. s. l. may be correlated with those formed, in the alluvial plain behind the coast line, during the transgressive and maximum flooding phase (Bondesan et al., 1995). In the hypothesis that in Cona the sedimentation possibly began again around 8000 BP, the radiocarbon dating of the peat layer at 4435 - 5306 cal. BP, <b>just</b> <b>ca.</b> 1 m above the caranto palaeosoil, supports the presence of an Early Holocene sedimentary hiatus in the alluvial series. The overlying radiocarbon dating (4141 - 4712 cal. BP), at - 4. 5 m a. s. l., shows that the aggradation of the floodplain continues during the 3 rd millennium B. C. with a deposition of about 3 m in 3500 years. After this date, a sandy channel body, which can be interpreted as related to a Po River palaeochannel, cut the floodplain and the deposition seems to increase. In the following 1500 years, calculated from the dated peat layer and the topographic surface that corresponds to the Late Bronze Age, 4. 5 to 7. 5 m of sediment were deposited, in the floodplain and in the channel-levee system, respectively. The chronostratigraphy of Cona section shows that in the study area, the highstand phase and the aggradation of the alluvial ridge of Po northern branch starts since about 4000 cal. BP. In Pettorazza, there is evidence of floodplain aggradation during the 2 nd millennium B. C. until the 1 st B. C. - 4 th century A. D. In this time interval a first sand body, belong to the Adige River, was deposited and the peat on top of these sands was formed in the 11 th- 13 th century A. D. Thus, the main sand body, which corresponds to the modern alluvial ridge of the Adige River, formed in the Middle Ages. Some authors (Peretto, 1986; Balista, 2004) have suggested the presence of a southern branch of Adige River active during the Roman Age, which produced the alluvial ridge cut, in more recent times, by the Adigetto channel. Stratigraphical results show, in Ramalto, no important sand body in correspondence of the Adigetto alluvial ridge. On the other hand, the “Fasanara” alluvial ridge, about 1 km to the north, corresponds to an important sand body. In the Ramalto cross-section the stratigraphy of a branch of the Po di Adria is also presented...|$|E
