The scientific work of <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> define species has been called microtaxonomy. By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from subgenus and above only, than species.|$|E

They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E

Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, the emphasis was on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance or sound. The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{contributions}} were {{of prime}} concern to policymakers in the 17th century, {{as they have}} remained ever since, for the wise country would not spend above its revenues. By Petty's time, England was engaged in war with Holland, {{and in the first}} three chapters of Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure, to which the monarch could adhere, when <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> raise money for the war. Petty lists six kinds of public charge, namely defence, governance, the pastorage of men's souls, education, the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure, or things of universal good. He then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges. He thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges, and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly, sick, orphans, etc., as well as the government employment of supernumeraries.|$|E

500|$|There are {{difficulties}} in <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> allocate the revenues raised. This is a controversial issue among scholars. The revenues {{can be used}} to improve public transport (as is the case in London), or to invest in new road infrastructure (as in Oslo). [...] Some academics make the case that revenues should be disposed as a direct transfer payments to former road users. Congestion pricing is not intended to increase public revenues or to become just another tax, however this is precisely one of the main concerns of road users and taxpayers.|$|E

However, they decided to keep Starkiller as the player character as they were fond of and were attached to him and {{felt that there was}} more story that he could supply and they could build a franchise around him. Blackman commented that after <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> have Starkiller return, he felt [...] "it all made sense and fell into place". Developers tried to make The Force Unleashed more personal to Starkiller, with the game focusing on Starkiller's search for the truth of his identity.|$|E

500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> end [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] {{in a way}} that would bring {{everything}} back to normal in South Park. Originally, the episode ended with Ms. Ellen being taken away by the Iraqi soldiers, leaving the impression that she was in fact an Iraqi fugitive. They ultimately decided this was a poor way to end the show, so they recast the ending to make Ms. Ellen an innocent woman who was framed by Wendy. Parker and Stone also struggled with how to make Mr. Garrison decide he wanted his old nose back. It was only a few days before the episode aired that these final decisions about the ending were made.|$|E
500|$|The Cambridge studio {{decided it}} would not be {{difficult}} to make a sequel to the first MediEvil, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period. Shepherd settled on MediEvil 2 being set in the Victorian era, the birthplace of the Neo-Gothic revival. Shepherd considered the hardest part of the development was <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make the game better than its predecessor through making certain aspects of the game humorous. To achieve this end, the Cambridge studio recoded a lot of core technology, which Shepherd considered was arguably similar to [...] "starting from scratch". Various features cut from the previous game were added into MediEvil 2, such as playable characters and levels that featured puzzles. By the time the game reached beta status the game offered larger levels, improved NPC logic, and more moves for the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the villain}} {{of the episode}} [...] "Hell House" [...] has supernatural origins, {{the basis of the}} story came from a {{situation}} writer Trey Callaway had as a child; he and his friends created a fake murder scene in an abandoned barn and then convinced their friends that killings occurred there. The children would often go there to scare each other, with one girl running away and breaking her leg after believing that she saw an attacking ghost. The human antagonists of [...] "The Benders", however, were completely devoid of supernatural elements. Shiban made this decision not only to surprise the audience, but also to have the Winchesters face something they had never encountered before. For [...] "Nightmare", Tucker tried to write the character Max as sympathetic, and thus had difficulties in <b>deciding</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> end the episode.

[...] Now holder {{of one of the most}} powerful posts in all of Congress, he said the chairmanship “couldn’t have come any later for me.” [...] Age was not otherwise a factor with Rangel, who worked a scheduled 16 hours a day and looked a good deal younger than he was.

[...] Rangel was able to establish an effective working relationship with ranking member Jim McCrery.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{after the}} success of the first MediEvil, Sony {{requested}} that SCE Cambridge develop a sequel that would be released {{before the end of the}} PlayStation's lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was not involved in development thus the project was handed over to James Shepherd. SCE Cambridge decided it would not be difficult to make a sequel to the first MediEvil, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period. Shepherd settled on MediEvil 2 being set in the Victorian era, the centrepiece of the Neo-Gothic revival.

To achieve this end, the studio recoded various core technology, which Shepherd considered was arguably similar to [...] "starting from scratch".

[...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving. But we were totally wrong, people totally loved it." ...|$|E
