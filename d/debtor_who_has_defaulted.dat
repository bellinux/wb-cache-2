25|$|All {{avoidance}} actions {{attempt to}} limit {{the risk of the}} legal system accelerating the financial demise of a financially unstable <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not yet declared bankruptcy. The bankruptcy system generally endeavors to reward creditors who continue to extend financing to debtors and discourage creditors from accelerating their debt collection efforts.

50|$|In United States {{bankruptcy}} law, {{an automatic}} stay is an automatic injunction that halts actions by creditors, with certain exceptions, to collect debts from a <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> declared bankruptcy. Under section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the stay {{begins at the}} moment the bankruptcy petition is filed. Secured creditors may, however, petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay upon a showing of cause.|$|R

5000|$|When a {{creditor}} {{has taken}} judgment against a <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> failed to comply, the creditor may enforce the judgment by {{applying for a}} writ of execution.

50|$|The Debtors Act of 1869 {{significantly}} reduced {{the ability of}} the courts to detain those in debt, although some provisions were retained. <b>Debtors</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> the means to repay their creditors but refused to do so could still be imprisoned, as could those who defaulted on payments to the court. Further reform followed through the Bankruptcy Act of 1883. These Acts initially reduced the amount of debtors sentenced to prison, but by the early twentieth century, the annual amount had risen to 11,427, an increase of nearly 2,000 from 1869.|$|R
5000|$|Supplementary {{process is}} a method of debt {{collection}} where the <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a court money judgement against him is brought into court, [...] "requiring the judgment debtor to appear {{at a time and}} place named therein and submit to an examination relative to his or its property and ability to pay." [...] The process is common in Massachusetts under M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14. If the debtor does not appear in court, a Capias ad respondendum may issue where a sheriff brings the debtor into court to respond.|$|R

50|$|Debt relief orders (DROs) are a {{new form}} of {{insolvency}} measure in the United Kingdom. They were introduced under Chapter 4 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

5000|$|After {{his release}} from prison in the early 1980s, Bufalino also became a high-priority target for federal investigators. Bufalino was soon indicted for {{plotting}} to murder the <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> testified against him in 1977. Before the extortion trial, Bufalino had discovered the witness' hiding place and ordered hitman Jimmy [...] "The Weasel" [...] Fratianno to kill him. Unfortunately for Bufalino, Fratianno was a government informant. Fratianno later told Bufalino {{that he could not}} locate the witness. Now Fratianno was brought forward to testify against his boss. Bufalino was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison.|$|R
5000|$|The Debtors' Act of 1869 {{limited the}} ability of the courts to {{sentence}} debtors to prison, but it did not entirely prohibit them from doing so. <b>Debtors</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> the means to pay their debt, but did not do so, could still be incarcerated for up to six weeks, as could those who defaulted on debts to the court. [...] Initially, there was a significant {{reduction in the number of}} debtors imprisoned following the passage of the 1869 Act. By 1870, the total number of debtors imprisoned decreased by almost 2,000, dropping from 9,759 in 1869 to 6,605 in 1870. [...] However, by 1905 that number had increased to 11,427.|$|R

[...] was all he could say; and very likely the cabman thought he was a disappointed <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> asked in vain to renew a bill.

Enacted after {{twelve years of}} intense {{lobbying}} by unsecured lenders, BAPCPA represents the most sweeping set of amendments to the Bankruptcy Code in over a century. BAPCPA imposed {{a large number of}} new requirements on all consumer debtors. From a consumer perspective, the most dramatic change is that <b>debtors</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> incomes above their state 2 ̆ 7 s median and who fail a 2 ̆ 2 means test 2 ̆ 2 are presumed to be abusing the system.

5000|$|At {{its height}} in the 1960s, underworld loansharking was {{estimated}} to be the second most lucrative franchise of organized crime in the United States after illegal gambling. Newspapers in the 1960s were filled with sensational stories of debtors beaten, harassed, and sometimes murdered by mob loan sharks. Yet careful studies of the business have raised doubts about the frequency with which violence was employed in practice. Relations between creditor and debtor could be amicable, even when the [...] "vig" [...] or [...] "juice" [...] was exorbitant, because each needed the other.

5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner {{who was living}} alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were <b>debtors</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|R

50|$|The law treats {{differently}} those creditors who are secured (i.e. have an authenticated, perfected security interest) {{from those}} creditors who are unsecured. An unsecured creditor {{is simply a}} person who is owed money and has not received payment according to the terms of the agreed upon transaction. Upon <b>default</b> of a <b>debtor</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> multiple creditors, the distinction between being a secured creditor and an unsecured creditor is legally significant. The secured creditor will generally always have priority to getting his money before the unsecured creditors do. In other words, the unsecured creditor is {{at the back of the}} line of priority - his only remedy is to obtain a judgment from the court for the amount of the defaulted loan.|$|R
