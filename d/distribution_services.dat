40|$|This {{research}} {{was intended to}} investigate the effect of trust and commitment on vertical collaboration and physical <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> quality in the soft drinks’ demand chains in Uganda. The study was prompted {{by the fact that}} research on physical <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> quality in Uganda is still sparse and the effect of trust and commitment on the performance of soft drinks demand chains is less explored. This study was purposely conducted to significantly contribute in this area by adding knowledge on the factors affecting the performance of soft drinks’ demand chains. Data was collected from 270 manufacturers and distributors in Kampala District which is the capital city of Uganda. The findings revealed significant positive relationships between trust, commitment and physical <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> quality. Commitment also had a positive effect on vertical collaboration while trust did not significantly relate to vertical collaboration. The most significant predictor of physical <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> quality however, was vertical collaboration and all the study variables accounted for 13 % of the variation in Physical <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> quality. This study contributes in the area of physical <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> quality and also provides implications for theory and practice...|$|R
5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King <b>Distribution</b> <b>Services</b> or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 2009, Ubisoft {{released}} {{a special edition}} of The Shadow of the Templars for the Wii and Nintendo DS. According to Cecil, the Director's Cut came about thanks to a group of Broken Sword fans, who started an online petition begging him to bring the series to the Wii and DS. The game starts a day before the Parisian cafe explosion in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, worked on visual references for the game; He also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. In the Director's Cut, Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard in the new sections, playing Nico again {{for the first time since}} the original game's release. Rolf Saxon, as in every sequel, also returns to voice George Stobbart. Unlike in the original game, players control Nicole Collard for selected game sections. Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the Director's Cut also features a new first person view for certain puzzles. In the DS version, there is no spoken dialogue, only subtitles. A version of the Director's Cut for iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20, 2010.

25|$|Starting {{with his}} tenure at Allegheny Observatory in the Pittsburgh {{area in the}} late 1860s, Langley was {{a major player in}} the {{development}} of astronomically derived and regulated time <b>distribution</b> <b>services</b> in America through the later half of the 19th century. His work with the railroads in this area is often cited as central to the establishment of the Standard Time Zones system. His very successful and profitable time sales to the Pennsylvania Railroad stood out among the many non-government based observatories of the day who were largely subsidizing their researches by time-service sales to regional railroads and the cities they served. The United States Naval Observatory's increasing dominance in this field threatened these regional observatories' livelihoods and Langley became a leader in efforts to preserve the viability of their commercial programs.|$|E

Distron, founded shortly after establishment of Burger King, primarily served the company-owned stores and 50–60 percent of franchised stores.
