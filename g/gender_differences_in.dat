5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded {{that of the}} males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{reports have}} found that adolescent, young adult, and middle-aged adult girls and {{women are more likely}} to be diagnosed with unipolar depression and report greater symptoms of depression when compared to boys and men of similar ages. What is less well-known is whether this <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> persists into late life. This literature review examines whether the well-known <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> unipolar depression continues into old age, and, if it does, whether the variables that are known to contribute to the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> unipolar depression from adolescence through adulthood continue to contribute to the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the elderly, and/or whether there are new variables that arise in old age and contribute to the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the elderly.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The {{purposes}} of this study were (i) to investigate the effect of age on <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> Hawaii Ironman triathlon performance time and (ii) to compare the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> among swimming (3. 8 km), cycling (180 km), and running (42 km) performances as a function of age. METHODS: <b>Gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> performance times and estimated power output in the three modes of locomotion were analyzed for the top 10 men and women amateur triathletes between the ages of 18 and 64 yr for three consecutive years (2006 - 2008). RESULTS: The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> total performance time was stable until 55 yr and then significantly increased. Mean <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> performance time was significantly (P < 0. 01) smaller for swimming (mean ± 95 % confidence interval = 12. 1 % ± 1. 9 %) compared with cycling (15. 4 % ± 0. 7 %) and running (18. 2 % ± 1. 3 %). <b>In</b> contrast, mean <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> cycling estimated power output (38. 6 % ± 1. 1 %) was significantly (P < 0. 01) greater compared with swimming (27. 5 % ± 3. 8 %) and running (32. 6 % ± 0. 7 %). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study provides evidence that <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> ultraendurance performance such as an Ironman triathlon was stable until 55 yr and then increased thereafter and differed between the locomotion modes.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{variety of}} studies suggest the {{existence}} of a distinct phenotype of somatic depression, i. e., depression accompanied by significant somatic symptomatology. Previous research suggests that the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the prevalence of depression is primarily due to a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> somatic depression. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the prevalence of somatic depression and of depression not accompanied by significant somatic symptomatology (labelled "pure" depression) in two representative samples, the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) and the Zurich Study. METHOD: The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> lifetime somatic depression was compared to that of pure depression based on analyses weighted back to the general population in two representative samples. The NCS-R analyses involved a narrow definition of somatic depression with items from the DSM criteria for depression [...] appetite, sleep, and fatigue. The analysis of the Zurich study added headaches, body image issues, and breathing difficulties to the criteria and comparison to atypical depression. RESULTS: In both samples, the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depressive prevalence was due to a large <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> somatic depression with other phenotypes showing little or no <b>gender</b> <b>difference.</b> The <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> were found to be due to the somatic symptoms rather than the number of symptoms and were much larger for somatic than for atypical depression.

BACKGROUNDType 1 diabetes abolishes the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> coronary heart disease mortality because it {{is associated with a}} greater elevation of coronary disease risk in women than men. The pathophysiological basis of this is not understood. METHODSCoronary artery calcification and coronary risk factors were compared in 199 type 1 diabetic patients and 201 nondiabetic participants of similar age (30 to 55 years) and gender (50 % female) distribution. Only one subject had a history of coronary disease. Calcification was measured with electron beam computed tomography. RESULTSIn nondiabetic participants there was a large <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> calcification prevalence (men 54 %, women 21 %, odds ratio 4. 5, p < 0. 001), half of which was explained by established risk factors (odds ratio after adjustment = 2. 2). Diabetes was associated with a greatly increased prevalence of calcification in women (47 %), but not men (52 %), so that the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> calcification was lost (p = 0. 002 for the greater effect of diabetes on calcification in women than men). On adjustment for risk factors, diabetes remained associated with a threefold higher odds ratio of calcification in women than men (p = 0. 02).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{there was}} an {{increased}} interest <b>in</b> investigating the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> performance {{and the age of}} peak performance in ultra-endurance performances such as ultra-triathlon, ultra-running, and ultra-swimming, but not in ultra-cycling. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> ultra-cycling performance and the age of peak ultra-cycling performance in the 720 -km 'Swiss Cycling Marathon', the largest European qualifier for the 'Race Across America'. METHODS: Changes in the cycling speed and age of 985 finishers including 38 women and 947 men competing in the Swiss Cycling Marathon from 2001 to 2012 covering a distance of 720 km with a change of altitude of 4, 993 m were analyzed using linear regression. RESULTS: The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> performance was 13. 6 % for the fastest cyclists ever, 13. 9 % ± 0. 5 % for the three fastest cyclists ever and 19. 1 % ± 3. 7 % for the ten fastest cyclists ever. The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> performance for the annual top three women and men decreased from 35. 0 % ± 9. 5 % in 2001 to 20. 4 % ± 7. 7 % in 2012 (r 2 = 0. 72, p = 0. 01). The annual top three women improved cycling speed from 20. 3 ± 3. 1 km h- 1 in 2003 to 24. 8 ± 2. 4 km h- 1 in 2012 (r 2 = 0. 79, p 0. 05). The age of peak performance for the ten fastest finishers ever was 35. 9 ± 9. 6 years for men and 38. 7 ± 7. 8 years for women, respectively (p = 0. 47). CONCLUSIONS: The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> ultra-cycling performance decreased over the 2001 to 2012 period in the 720 -km Swiss Cycling Marathon for the annual top three cyclists and reached approximately 14 %. Both women and men achieved peak performance at the age of approximately 36 to 39 years. Women might close the gender gap in ultra-endurance cycling in longer cycling distances.

To investigate the robustness of <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> color preference in a different culture, we tested 81 young adult Indians from a school of Design and compared them to 80 young British students in Psychology. A 35 -item International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) questionnaires were also administered to explore possible links between personality traits, gender schemata and color preferences. Results confirmed a <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> both cultures; participants collectively expressed a preference for cool over warm colors, while in addition females showed a preference for pink colors, with a warm bias for Indian females and a cool bias for British females. While these results extend <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> to Indian culture and support the universality of an underlying pattern they also reveal a culture-specific contribution essentially observed in females.
