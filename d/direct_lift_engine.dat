50|$|Basically the F119-PW-614S was a <b>Direct</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>engine,</b> {{whereas the}} Lockheed Martin STOVL team used {{a more complex}} and riskier alternative, known as the F119-PW-611, which {{comprised}} a remote shaft-driven lift fan powered by the main engine. However, this generated more lift thrust than possible with only direct exhaust gases. A successful design would have greater payload, and thus longer range than a simple thrust vectored turbofan.|$|E

This led to the F119-PW-614S which powered the X-32B JSF demonstrator. Two contracts to develop prototypes were awarded on November 16, 1996, one each to Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Each firm would produce two aircraft to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV version), and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL). McDonnell Douglas' bid was rejected in part due to the complexity of its design. Lockheed Martin and Boeing were each given $750 million to develop their concept demonstrators and the definition of the Preferred Weapon System Concept (PWSC). The aim of this funding limit was to prevent one or both contractors from bankrupting themselves in an effort to win such an important contract.|$|E
25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using vectored thrust from the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> being shut down and covered by hinged doors.|$|R

50|$|Instead of lift engines {{or using}} a <b>direct</b> <b>lift</b> <b>engine</b> like the Rolls-Royce Pegasus in the Harrier Jump Jet, the X-35B was {{powered by the}} F119-PW-611 which used an {{innovative}} shaft-driven lift fan, patented by Lockheed Martin employee Paul Bevilaqua, and developed by Rolls-Royce. In normal wing-borne flight, the F119-PW-611 was configured as a normal reheated turbofan. Somewhat like a turboprop embedded into the fuselage, engine shaft power was diverted forward via a clutch-and-bevel gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located forward of the main engine {{in the center of}} the aircraft. Bypass air from the cruise engine turbofan exhausted through a pair of roll-post nozzles in the wings on either side of the fuselage, while the thrust from the lift fan balanced the thrust of the core stream exhausting through vectored cruise nozzle at the tail. The X-35B powerplant effectively acted as a flow multiplier, much as a turbofan achieves efficiencies by moving unburned air at a lower velocity, and getting the same effect as the Harrier's huge, but supersonically impractical main fan. Like lift engines, this added machinery was dead weight during flight, but the increased lift thrust enhanced take-off payload by even more. The cool fan also reduced the harmful effects of hot, high-velocity air which could harm runway pavement or an aircraft carrier deck. Though risky and complicated, it was made to work to the satisfaction of DoD officials..|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} {{describes how}} <b>direct</b> <b>lift</b> control has been incorporated in a nonlinear autoflight control algorithm. <b>Direct</b> <b>lift</b> control demonstrated {{its use in}} earlier aircraft designs. In two recent internal DLR projects, accurate flight path tracking in atmospheric disturbances was an important research goal, where <b>direct</b> <b>lift</b> control could potentially provide an important contribution. In these projects, use {{has been made of}} nonlinear control techniques. Objective of this research publication is to incorporate <b>direct</b> <b>lift</b> control in these nonlinear control laws. Simulations as well as flight tests have shown that more accurate flight path changes are achieved by this addition. <b>Direct</b> <b>lift</b> control can be particularly useful for path tracking as well as in turbulent air, since it facilitates lift changes without pitching. More precisely, the non-minimum phase behaviour of the aircraft caused by the elevators is eliminated in this way...|$|R

50|$|Rybinsk Motors was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Kolesov Engine Design Bureau. Kolesov took over the organization from V.A. Dobrynin who founded it in the late 1930s or early 1940s. Under Kolesov's direction, the bureau designed turbojet engines for the Myasishchev M-50 Bounder experimental supersonic bomber, turbojets for the Tu-22 Blinder medium bomber, RD-36-35FVR <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> for the Yak-38 Forger, RD-36-51A supersonic engines for the Tu-144 SST, RD-36-51V engines for the Myasishchev M-17 Mystic, and <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> for the Yak-141 Freestyle.|$|R
50|$|During {{conventional}} flight, the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> {{would be}} inactive; shortly prior to entering vertical flight, compressed air {{provided by the}} single cruise engine {{would be used to}} accelerate the startup of the <b>lift</b> <b>engines.</b> Considerable attention was paid during development to the design of the air intake for the engines, while involved a set of 7 variable hinged grills which open in a forward-facing position to increase airflow to the lift engines; flow into the engines had to be relatively consistent and stable to avoid issues such as engine surges and vibration. Initially, the series of scuttles were fitted to the exit nozzles of the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> to maintain a low-pressure environment beneath the engines and ensure that that the turbine blades rotated in the correct direction; due to the effectiveness of the intake and engine refinements, the scuttles became unnecessary.|$|R

40|$|During the 1970 {{academic}} year {{the students in}} Aircraft Design worked {{on the design of}} a vertical take off and landing airliner. The aircraft is intended to be capable of carrying up to 118 passengers over stage lengths of 500 n. miles. The maximum cruise speed is Mach 0. 83 at an altitude of approximately 20, 000 ft and the predicted take off weight is 125, 000 lbs. Vertical take off is achieved by using 12 fan <b>lift</b> <b>engines,</b> each of 1. 500 lb thrust, which are based on the Rolls Royce RB 202 design. The <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> are housed in two large nacelles which are mounted on the high, sweptback wing.

An unusual feature of the design is the location of the two propulsion engines on either of the vertical fins. Some indication was gained of the penalties associated with this type of aircraft, but the weighing of these against the realisable advantages was outside the scope of the work...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s both the USSR and western nations {{considered}} the possibility of <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> {{as a way of}} providing STOL or even VTOL capability to combat aircraft. The Soviets did side-by-side testing of versions of combat aircraft using variable geometry wings and lift jets (the results became the Mikoyan MiG-23 and Sukhoi Su-24). The problems with the auxiliary <b>lift</b> <b>engine</b> are high fuel consumption, extra weight (which is simply dead weight when the engines are not needed for lift), and taking up fuselage volume {{that could be used for}} fuel or other systems. The Soviets decided that variable-geometry wings provided comparable advantages in take-off performance without as many penalties.|$|R
