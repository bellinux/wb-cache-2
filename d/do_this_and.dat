The teenagers saw her <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> left immediately. It was acknowledged that Till whistled while Bryant was going to her car. However, it is disputed whether Till whistled toward Bryant or toward a checkers game that was occurring just across the street.|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|In 1201 Walter {{went on a}} {{diplomatic}} mission to Philip II of France, which was unsuccessful, and in 1202 he returned to England as regent while John was abroad. In April 1204 Walter returned to France with John de Gray the Bishop of Norwich, Eustace the Bishop of Ely, William Marshal, and Robert de Beaumont the Earl of Leicester to seek peace with Philip Augustus. Philip insisted that John hand over Arthur of Brittany, Arthur's sister Eleanor, and renounce all of his continental possessions before the French king would make peace. John refused to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> the embassy returned to England not long before Philip conquered Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} season, {{the format of}} the show changed drastically. The maximum age dropped from 31 to 28. The cast of season two were given {{mandatory}} non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in teamwork and commitment, to equip them for success in later life. Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation. Season two was the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> was also the last to air 30-minute episodes.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal is {{attempting}} to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy travels back to {{the ruins}} from the {{beginning}} of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.|$|E

Huckabee denied any plans to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> Huckabee campaign manager Chip Saltsman claimed that the campaign had actually surpassed its first quarter fund raising goal.|$|E
25|$|In 1789, Sir Thomas Gooch leased {{the land}} to John Willmore, a local toymaker. It was agreed that within a year, Willmore should {{construct}} two or more large houses at a total cost, including the outbuildings, of no less than £700. Willmore failed to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> Court 15, as well as Court 14 adjacent, were built by his successors who remained on the street throughout the 19th century. When John Willmore died, the land was split between his sons Joseph and John Willmore, leading to the constructions looking different.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, his assistant, Charles Chamberland (of French origin), {{had been}} {{instructed}} to inoculate the chickens after Pasteur went on holiday. Chamberland failed to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> went on holiday himself. On his return, the month-old cultures made the chickens unwell, but instead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely. Chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture, but Pasteur stopped him. He inoculated the chickens with virulent bacteria that killed other chickens, and they survived. Pasteur concluded that the animals were now immune to the disease.|$|E

In the following weeks, Bianca and Marissa start dating, much to JR's fury, and discuss moving in together.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{occurred}} when Barry suddenly departed {{the group with}} no public explanation on the program. Rumours in magazines and newspapers suggested she had been caught stealing items from other members. Six years later in 2006, Barry appeared on the program Where Are They Now?, {{to speak for the}} first time over the incident. She stated that she accidentally kept Monk's weekly money allowance with the intention of giving it back to her, but forgot to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> was therefore removed from the group. In a 2017 Woman's Day interview, Barry stated that she was paid $1000 to leave and keep quiet on the matter, and blamed her actions on her youth and naivety.|$|E
25|$|In February 1992, {{a report}} ordered by Kiruna Municipality {{recommended}} that LKAB, SJ and NSB create a common company {{to operate the}} ore trains.
