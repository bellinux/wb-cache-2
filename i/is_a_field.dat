5|$|Bioinformatics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> {{of study}} that {{includes}} the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, {{that can be used}} in studies of the human brain, particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression. Bioinformatics and studies in genomics, and functional genomics, generated the need for DNA annotation, a transcriptome technology, identifying genes, and their and location and function. GeneCards is a major database.|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> {{of anatomy}} {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{engineering}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> {{of engineering}} {{devoted to the}} analysis of wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics and a number of specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

A commutative {{division ring}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>field.</b> A prominent {{example of a}} division ring {{that is not a}} field is the ring of quaternions. Any centralizer in a division ring is also a division ring. In particular, the center of a division ring <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>field.</b> It turned out that every finite domain (in particular finite division ring) is a field; in particular commutative (the Wedderburn's little theorem).|$|E
