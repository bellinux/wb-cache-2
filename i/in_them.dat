5|$|A report {{written by}} Roger Travis and {{published}} by The Escapist compares Halo with the Latin epic Aeneid, written by classical Roman poet Virgil. Travis posits similarities between the plots of both works and compares the characters present <b>in</b> <b>them,</b> with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians, and the Master Chief's role in the series to that of Aeneas.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters only the nests that contain P. rebeli caterpillars. It {{is able to}} enter the nest without being swarmed because it releases a chemical that causes the worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the caterpillars, it marks the individuals most likely to survive by ovipositing <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E

5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> When {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements {{of the four}} factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 {{ways in which the}} karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E
5|$|Along the Georgia coastline, The Golden Isles of Georgia were {{evacuated}} due to large swells produced by Diana. Two nursing homes in Tybee Island {{were evacuated}} and a voluntary evacuation was issued for all {{residents in the}} town. Several shelters were also opened at schools in a few counties; however, relatively few families sought refuge <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> Local schools and beaches were also closed {{for the duration of}} the storm's passage.|$|E

Hemimerina also has two genera, Hemimerus and Araeomerus, {{with a total}} of 11 species.|$|E

5|$|Asylums {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping catalyze the reform of mental health systems {{in a number of}} countries, leading to reductions in the numbers of large mental hospitals and of the individuals locked up <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> It has also been influential in the anti-psychiatry movement.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones <b>in</b> <b>them</b> {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E

He never traveled abroad but nonetheless understood the relation between microorganisms and the spreading of disease.|$|E

5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed objectionable to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations <b>in</b> <b>them</b> can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
