5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then circled the supply wagons in a defensible area. This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action. On his command, Carpenter's men rushed inside at the gallop. They dismounted and took up a defensive <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> at the gap between the wagons they had just entered.|$|E
5|$|The air pistol {{range is}} the same as the air rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide firing point, and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> and the target line. The current rules require ranges to be built indoors, with specified minimum requirements for artificial lighting. Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the <b>firing</b> <b>line,</b> covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elementary {{analysis on the}} difference and similarity between upslope fire and jump fire, {{by a series of}} experiments performed in laboratory. The rate of spread (ROS), <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> angle (separation angle of the two <b>fire</b> <b>lines),</b> angular velocity of <b>fire</b> <b>line,</b> flame residence time and non-dimensional radiant heat transfer for the two kinds of phenomena are investigated. For upslope fire, it is found that ROS remains almost steady for line ignition, while it increases with time for point ignition. For upslope <b>fires</b> with <b>line</b> ignition, the <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> angle decreases with time from the initial 180 o to a steady small value, while for point ignition, the initially generated <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> angle remains steady. The angular velocity of <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> does not depend on slope angle in an upslope <b>fire</b> with <b>line</b> ignition. For jump fire, the ROS first increases sharply and then decreases gradually, and it depends on slope angle more significantly than the initial <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> angle. The <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> angle increases with time, and the angular velocity of <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> varies with slope angle. For upslope <b>fires</b> with <b>line</b> ignition, the flame residence time increases with slope angle, while it remains almost constant for upslope tests with point ignition. For jump fire, under one specific initial <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> angle, the overall mean residence time increases with increasing slope angle. Non-dimensional heat radiation for fuel preheating is calculated which effectively explains the ROS development in upslope <b>fire</b> with <b>line</b> ignition and jump fire...|$|R
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of suppression effectiveness in <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> growth models is formulated {{as a system}} of differential equations. The model draws on earlier ideas using ellipses to model fire growth, particularly the head fire and flank fire rates of spread, combines this with recent studies {{of the effect of}} <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> on spread rate and appends a single equation for the increase of suppressed <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> with time. Representative parameter values are used to illustrate this way of describing the effect of fire suppression activities on the <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> and to develop criteria for the likely outcome of containment activities...|$|R
5000|$|On August 29, crews {{worked on}} a <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> across {{the north side of}} the fire as well as a {{contingency}} fire break between the eastern flanks of the two fires. In the Bear Butte area, mop-up operations continued along completed <b>fire</b> <b>lines.</b> However, easterly winds increased fire activity in the northwest. On the west side of the Booth Fire, crews built <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> north from Lost Lake running towards Craig Lake while burn-out operations began on the northeast corner of the fire.|$|R
5|$|On 14 April, Maryland {{left the}} <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> at Okinawa and escorted several {{retiring}} transports.

All of her 5in guns were removed and replaced by sixteen 5inch/38 cal guns in new twin mounts. Turret No. 3 was repaired and the crew quarters were improved. She completed repairs in August, leaving for tests and training runs just as Japan surrendered, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army to the dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was a greater {{emphasis}} on advancing in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance as far as possible in a <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended <b>firing</b> <b>line,</b> unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman {{artillery}} {{batteries and}} trenches {{were difficult to}} locate, but by 10:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was advancing towards the <b>firing</b> <b>line.</b> At this time, an aerial report described small groups of the Magdhaba garrison beginning to retreat, {{and as a result}} the still-mounted reserve, the 1st Light Horse Brigade, was ordered to move directly on the town, passing the dismounted Imperial Camel Brigade battalions on their way. After meeting severe shrapnel fire as they trotted over the open plain, they were forced to take cover in the Wadi el Arish where they dismounted, continuing their advance at 10:30 against the Ottoman left. Meanwhile, the battalions of the Imperial Camel Brigade, continued their advance over the flat ground for , section by section, covering fire provided by each section in turn.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} winning the Kentucky Derby, American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, run over {{nine and a half}} furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Despite an {{unfavorable}} inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of <b>Firing</b> <b>Line</b> and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983, and American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.|$|E
5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} width of the Plains, the main <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire {{to keep them out of}} enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to {{the width of the}} lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E
50|$|An {{attempt was}} made to fall back and create a new <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> to halt the fire at Hellegate street. The fire boat was {{directed}} to Apotekerbrygg and the fire forces were concentrated there. But before they could begin activity establishing the <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> there, the roofs of houses {{on the east side of}} Hellegate caught fire. Further, the crews dispatched to Rønneberg’s warehouse were unsuccessful in extinguishing that fire. It became clear the outer town was lost. The fire chief chose to halt the fire with the natural water gap <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> of the Brosund combined with suppression of the Rønneberg’s warehouse fire.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{atmospheric model}} is {{coupled with a}} simple dry eucalyptus forest fire model to create a wildfire simulation model. This is used to show how certain atmospheric conditions can lead to commonly observed forest fire behavior. Using short <b>line</b> <b>fires,</b> simu-lations show that with moderate winds, the <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> inter-acts with the updraft ahead of it causing the <b>fire</b> <b>line</b> to curve forward into a conical shape. Other experiments show that when ambient winds change with height, a pair of rotating updrafts at the curved fire front can touch down within the fire and break up the <b>fire</b> <b>line.</b> We also demonstrate 'dynamic fingering', in which the rotating columns near the fire front intensify to tornado strength and can result in rapid and strong increases in the fire spread rate...|$|R
5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9–1 {{favorite}} in an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; <b>Firing</b> <b>Line,</b> winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.|$|E

This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> and that the seventy rounds each man took to the <b>firing</b> <b>line</b> were not sufficient.|$|E
