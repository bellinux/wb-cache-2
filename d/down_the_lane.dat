500|$|The story {{focuses on}} a family of {{anthropomorphic}} rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit cautions her young against entering the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, telling them: [...] "your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor". Her three daughters obediently refrain from entering the garden, going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> to pick blackberries, but her rebellious son Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up eating more than is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's scarecrow. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, while his well-behaved sisters receive a sumptuous dinner of milk and berries as opposed to Peter's supper of chamomile tea.|$|E
500|$|In their {{accounts}} afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired {{at them from}} behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations {{in the style of}} European warfare. [...] This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: [...] "Chasing the red-coats <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees {{at the turn of the}} road, / And only pausing to fire and load." [...] To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. [...] Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics: During the whole affair the Rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance & resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so. Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians, & this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the foul line for the bowler themselves, there is a line [...] <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> from the foul line; this is the lob line, and the ball must first contact the lane at any point on the bowler's side of it, be it on the approach or the first ten feet of the lanebed. Any [...] "airborne" [...] ball delivery not making contact with the approach or lanebed short of the [...] "lob line" [...] constitutes a violation of this rule, and is termed a lob with any pins knocked down by such a ball not counting — and such pins are not reset if the lobbed ball was not the third and last shot for that player in that box.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{bowling ball}} is {{designed}} to roll vertically, and the core is naturally lop-sided so that the ball will hook naturally if the thumb and finger holes are drilled in the proper places. In parts of Asia, where oil conditions are more difficult and lanes maintenance is poor, hooking the ball makes bowling more difficult. The [...] "spinner", [...] "helicopter" [...] or [...] "UFO" [...] release is popular. A top spinning bowling ball will slide (rather than roll vertically,) but also spin like a top <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane,</b> and will always slide straight regardless of the oil pattern applied to the lane. Because of the spin, the ball will take an unconventional path through the pins at impact, creating a domino effect (spinners call it [...] "deflection") pin reaction not normally seen when using more conventional releases. The spin is generated by rotating the hand counter clockwise (right-handed) until the hand {{is on top of}} the ball, the two fingers are in the 12-o'clock position, and the thumb is in the 6-o'clock position. At this point, both the fingers and thumb come out of the ball at the same time. The forearm is also used to create the spin on the ball and push the ball onto the lane. Once on the lane surface, the ball will continue to spin on the X-axis, and slide <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane.</b> This technique is not seen frequently in world-class competition where oil patterns are more standardized. Spinning is difficult to master, and can even cause injury if not done right. Using a lighter bowling ball (10 to 12 pounds) with a completely rounded core is recommended, along with a conventional grip. Spinning causes results like a weak 5-pin more frequently. Use of the spinner technique is seen more frequently in Taiwan and Hong Kong.|$|E
2500|$|Spinners use a {{style of}} release known {{variously}} as spinning, helicopter, or UFO. Regardless of what it's known as, a spinner releases a ball such that it is rotating along a horizontal axis (the x-axis) in a counter clockwise motion (right-hander) as it moves <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane.</b> Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the pin rack, and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown {{in one of the}} three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane. A hook needs friction, in order to allow the ball to [...] "grab" [...] the lane. In spinning, very little of the ball's surface touches the lane, which is what the spinner intends. Spinning does not require friction of any kind.|$|E

2500|$|Alicia Christian [...] "Jodie" [...] Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American {{actress and}} filmmaker {{who has worked}} in films and on television. She has often been cited {{as one of the best}} actresses of her generation. Foster began her {{professional}} career at the age of three as a child model in 1965, and two years later moved to acting in television series, with the sitcom Mayberry R.F.D. being her debut. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several primetime television series and starred in children's films. Foster's breakthrough came in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), in which she played a teenage prostitute; the role garnered her a nomination for an Academy Award. Her other critically acclaimed roles as a teenager were in the musical Bugsy Malone (1976) and the thriller The Little Girl Who Lives <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lane</b> (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's Freaky Friday (1976), Candleshoe (1977) and Foxes (1980).|$|E

The unsuccessful single [...] "Dragonfly", recorded late in the year, was also written by Kirwan, and included lyrics adapted from a poem by W. H. Davies. Peter Green said of [...] "Dragonfly", [...] "The best thing he ever wrote... that should have been a hit." [...] This was not to be the last time Kirwan used a poem as lyrics for a song, and may have been a solution to Kirwan's apparent occasional lack of inspiration when writing lyrics. The B-side of the single, [...] "The Purple Dancer", was written by Kirwan, Fleetwood and John McVie and uniquely featured Kirwan and Spencer duetting on lead vocals.|$|E
2500|$|Foster's fourth film of 1976 was the Canadian-French thriller The Little Girl Who Lives <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lane,</b> {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Martin Sheen. The film combined aspects from thriller and horror genres, and showed Foster as a mysterious young girl living on her own in a small town; the performance earned her a Saturn Award. On November 27, she hosted Saturday Night Live, becoming the youngest person to do so until 1982. Her final film {{of the year was}} Freaky Friday, a Disney comedy commenting on the generation gap, which was [...] "her first true star vehicle". She played a tomboy teen who accidentally changes bodies with her mother; she later stated that her character's desire to become an adult was matched by her own feelings at the time, and that the film marked a [...] "transitional period" [...] for her when she began to grow out of child roles. It received mainly positive reviews, and was a box office success, gaining Foster a Golden Globe nomination for her performance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objective}} in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than [...] "carry" [...] (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane,</b> usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes {{the right side}} of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as [...] "riding the rail" [...] among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as [...] "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sport of}} ten-pin bowling is {{performed}} on a straight, narrow surface {{known as a}} lane. This bowling lane is [...] from the foul line to the head pin (1-pin).

Hilde and Erika visit her old house and she recalls beatings; they then visit the pond where she is reminded of the many loads of laundry she was forced to wash with her mother.
