50|$|A <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strip</b> {{is a small}} {{strip of}} paper used to track a flight in air traffic control (ATC). While it has been {{supplemented}} by more technologically advanced methods of flight tracking since its introduction, it is still used in modern ATC as {{a quick way to}} annotate a flight, to keep a legal record of the instructions that were issued, to allow other controllers to see instantly what is happening and to pass this information to other controllers who go on to control the flight.|$|E
50|$|With this {{activity}} ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting {{they were ready}} for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strip</b> for this flight {{had not yet been}} given to the local controller by the clearance delivery controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation, but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of the strip in the board is {{a significant part of}} the information of the strip board: approach and area controllers typically keep their strips in level/altitude order, whereas tower controllers use the bays to represent the ground, the runway and the air. Each bay might be further sub-divided using 'designator strips' and metal bars to allow even more information to be portrayed by the {{position of}} a <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strip.</b> Other special strips can be used to indicate special airspace statuses, or to represent the presence of physical obstructions or vehicles on the ground. They may even be used to provide a quick reminder to the controller of other pertinent information, e.g. the time when night begins or ends.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{techniques}} controllers use to organize <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strips</b> in order to best detect conflicts: grouped together by altitude, or grouped together by route intersection points (fix posting area). Altitude grouping is the easiest and most common method when most aircraft in the sector tend to be level at a cruising altitude, such as in trans-oceanic sectors. Each aircraft's strip is placed in a [...] "bay" [...] (labeled section of the strip rack) depending on its altitude. Because aircraft cruising at different altitudes will never conflict regardless of route of flight or estimated times, they don't need to be checked against each other. Only aircraft at the same altitude (i.e. in the same bay) need to be further evaluated. If an aircraft needs to transition to a new altitude (whether changing cruising level, or descending to or climbing from an airport), it only needs to be checked against others in the bays between the current altitude and destination altitude.|$|R
40|$|To {{accommodate}} new technologies, U. S. {{air traffic}} controllers must eventually convert from paper <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strips</b> to Electronic <b>Flight</b> Data Replacements (EFDRs). It is anticipated that controllers {{may be reluctant to}} accept decision support tools (DSTs) and EFDRs. It would be useful to identify factors predicting EFDR resistance because failure to use these tools would reduce projected capacity gains. We analyzed data from 2 studies to determine if age and preferences for strips would predict strip marking and the ability to use a procedure that allowed removing strips early. In the first study, we found that older controllers said they preferred strips more than younger controllers and a preference for strips predicted two types of frequent strip markings. However, age did not predict overall strip marking. In the second study, we found that older controllers could use an experimental strip reduction procedure effectively. We expected that age alone would predict strip usage. The results suggest that age and a preference for strips may predict EFDR transition problems...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the OcuLometer {{as a visual}} fixation mea 3 uring device for man/machine interface investigations, six air traffic controllers performed simulated radar control functions. A seventh controller performed the control tasks, while both an Oculometer record and a manual record were made of visual attention. It was found that all the controllers spent approximately 80 percent of the test time looking at the radar display, {{with a mean of}} 76 glances at the display per 15 -minute session. Average glance duration was 10 seconds. Approximately 11 percent of the remaining time was spent looking at the <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strips,</b> less than 5 percent looking at the computer input keyboard, and less than 3 percent looking at miscellaneous or indeterminate objects. No marked differences appeared in the scores of individual controllers although they had been selected to represent a diversity of air traffic control experience.

5000|$|Using {{procedural}} control, {{the controller}} must maintain a mental {{picture of the}} location of aircraft based on each aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strip,</b> which contains its route, altitude and estimated times over reporting points. That information is compared against all other aircraft in the sector {{to determine if there}} are any conflicts. For aircraft that conflict, the controller issues an altitude, speed or routing change that both separates the conflicting aircraft from each other, while still remaining separated from all others. After all conflicts have been resolved in this way, the sector is considered [...] "separated" [...] and the controller only needs to check again for conflicts when new aircraft are added, or if an aircraft needs to change its altitude, or if the aircraft reaches a reporting point significantly earlier or later than previously estimated.|$|E
5000|$|In some countries, flight {{progress}} strips {{have been}} replaced by computer displays. This is not always a problem free transition, since physical strips have many characteristics that a computer system cannot replicate. In fact, the term [...] "handoff," [...] which is used today to denote the computerized transfer of control of an aircraft from one sector to another, comes from the older technique of physically handing off the <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strip</b> to the next controller to denote the transfer of responsibility. This technique is still used today within some control towers; for example, the ground controller may physically hand the strip to the local controller as the aircraft reaches the runway, or the local controller will drop the strip and strip holder down a chute to the departure radar controller in the room below, once the aircraft has been cleared for takeoff.|$|E

50|$|In the U.S. system, {{at higher}} altitudes, over 90% of the U.S. {{airspace}} {{is covered by}} radar and often by multiple radar systems; however, coverage may be inconsistent at lower altitudes used by unpressurized aircraft due to high terrain or distance from radar facilities. A center may require numerous radar systems to cover the airspace assigned to them, and may also rely on pilot position reports from aircraft flying below the floor of radar coverage. This results in {{a large amount of}} data being available to the controller. To address this, automation systems have been designed that consolidate the radar data for the controller. This consolidation includes eliminating duplicate radar returns, ensuring the best radar for each geographical area is providing the data, and displaying the data in an effective format.Centers also exercise control over traffic travelling over the world's ocean areas. These areas are also flight information regions (FIRs). Because there are no radar systems available for oceanic control, oceanic controllers provide ATC services using procedural control. These procedures use aircraft position reports, time, altitude, distance, and speed to ensure separation. Controllers record information on <b>flight</b> <b>progress</b> <b>strips</b> and in specially developed oceanic computer systems as aircraft report positions. This process requires that aircraft be separated by greater distances, which reduces the overall capacity for any given route. See for example the North Atlantic Track system.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{air transport}} demand suggests looking at Air Traffic Management (ATM) as a continuously and evolving process.

With the continued call to eliminate paper strips from control towers, this study seeks to verify the usefulness of paper strips. The study shows that a combination of paper strips and digital strips is what controllers prefer. While the controllers want to use digital strips because of the significant functionality obtained from them, paper strips are still maintained as a backup interface because of their inherent reliability...|$|E

The problem is formulated in terms of two complimentary models. First, a model of the ATM domain describes the cognitive task environment of managing the simulated air traffic. Second, a model of the ATM worksystem describes the abstracted cognitive behaviours of the controllers and their tools in performingw the traffic management task.

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in using electronic alternatives to the paper <b>Flight</b> <b>Progress</b> <b>Strip</b> (FPS) for air traffic control. However, most research has been centered on radar-based control environments, and has not considered the unique operational needs of the airport air traffic control tower. Based on {{an analysis of the}} human factors issues for control tower Decision Support Tool (DST) interfaces, a requirement has been identified for an interaction mechanism which replicates the advantages of the paper FPS (e. g., minimal head-down time, portability) but also enables input and output with DSTs. An approach has been developed which uses a Portable Electronic FPS that has attributes of both a paper flight strip and an electronic flight strip. The prototype Portable Electronic <b>Flight</b> <b>Progress</b> <b>Strip</b> system uses handheld computers to replace individual paper strips in addition to a central management interface which is displayed on a desktop computer. Each electronic FPS is connected to the management interface via a wireless local area network. The Portable Electronic FPSs replicate the core functionality of paper flight strips and have additional features which provide an interface to a DST. A departure DST is used as a motivating example. This report presents the rationale for a Portable Electronic FPS system and discusses the formatting and functionalities of the prototype displays. A usability study has been conducted to determine the utility of the Portable Electronic FPS in comparison to paper flight strips. This study consisted of a human-in-the-loop experiment which simulated the tasks of an air traffic controller in an airport control tower environment. Specific issues explored during the experiment include the appropriateness of displaying departure advisories on the Portable Electronic FPS, the importance of FPS portability, and the advantages of interaction mechanisms enabled by an electronic interface. Experimental results are presented which show that test subjects preferred the Portable Electronic FPS to a paper FPS. However, results for performance-based measures were partially confounded by a dominance of practice effects, experimental limitations, and characteristics of the prototype hardware itself. The implications of the experimental results are discussed with the aim of directing further research toward the goal of creating an operationally-deployable Portable Electronic FPS system. Future research should explore emergent display technologies which better emulate the physical characteristics of the paper FPS. Once this is accomplished, higher-fidelity performance-based analyses may be conducted, engaging air traffic controllers on design and implementation issues.

40|$|Air Traffic Management (ATM) is a {{continuously}} evolving process, {{where many}} current system elements derive {{from a time}} when ATM characteristics were very different from today. Nowadays, the provision of ATM services has to design new solutions and adapt to new scenarios. Although ESARR 4 and EU Regulation 1035 / 2011 define the need of evaluating ATM system risks before implementing any change, they do not define a practical tool to support the decision-makers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to fill this gap, proposing a systematic methodology; the Preliminary System Safety Assessment Tool (PSSA-T) capable of helping the decision makers in evaluating safety implications due to system changes. PSSA-T relies on the definition of two Indexes, which have been built according to the Aerospace Performance Factor (APF) methodology, and allow safety assessment of any proposed change. In detail, the former Index compares the evolutionary scenario with the current one and the latter evaluates the evolutionary scenario in which there is a failure of intervention, in the hypothesis the system change has been implemented already.
