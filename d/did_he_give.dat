2500|$|Rømer neither {{calculated}} this ratio, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> a {{value for}} the speed of light. However, many others calculated a speed from his data, the first being Christiaan Huygens; after corresponding with Rømer and eliciting more data, Huygens deduced that light travelled [...] Earth diameters per second.|$|E
2500|$|On {{assuming}} office, President Kibaki did not appoint Raila Odinga as Prime Minister {{in the new}} government, {{contrary to}} a pre-election MOU. (Kenya's [...] constitution had no provision for Prime minister yet); neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> LDP (Raila's faction) half of the cabinet positions as per the MOU. He instead sought to entrench [...] and increase his own [...] NAK's side in cabinet, even appointing MPs from the opposition parties (KANU and FORD people) to the cabinet.|$|E

2500|$|Acceptance of {{the letter}} into the canon did not occur without some difficulty; however, [...] "nowhere did doubts about the letter's authorship {{take the form of}} {{definitive}} rejection." [...] The earliest record of doubts concerning the authorship {{of the letter}} were recorded by Origen (c. 185–254), though Origen mentioned no explanation for the doubts, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> any indication concerning the extent or location. Donald Guthrie suggests that, “It is fair to assume, therefore, that he saw no reason to treat these doubts as serious, and this would mean to imply that in his time the epistle was widely regarded as canonical.” ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{and other}} changes were {{designed}} to facilitate the promotion of talent. Young realised that the police could no longer rely on habits little changed for a century. He fought for the recruitment and promotion of women. He resisted the well-ingrained tradition of parachuting senior officers from the armed forces into police commands; and only with great reluctance <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> in to the demand from the Hertfordshire police committee that he use his wartime military rank. He sternly opposed Lord Trenchard's officer-class philosophy as wholly inappropriate for the British police service. Rather, he was wedded to Sir Robert Peel's intention that the police be [...] "filled from the bottom up". The young man whose own family had thought that being a policeman was far from suitable dedicated his own long career to making the police a respected and attractive profession. Young's lobby of the 1960 Royal Commission on the Police overcame Home Office objections to a strengthened police inspectorate, although Sir Charles Cunningham blocked Young's selection as inaugural Chief Inspector of Constabulary.|$|E

"Aaron {{argued with}} himself, saying: If I say to Israel, Give ye to me gold and silver, they will bring it immediately; but behold I {{will say to}} them, Give ye to me the {{earrings}} of your wives and of your sons, and forthwith the matter will fail, as it is said, [...] "And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings." [...] The women heard (this), but they were unwilling to give their earrings to their husbands; but they said to them: Ye desire to make a graven image of a molten image without any power in it to deliver. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the women their reward {{in this world and}} the world to come. What reward <b>did</b> <b>He</b> <b>give</b> them in this world? That they should observe the new moons more stringently than the men, and what reward will He give them in the world to come? They are destined to be renewed like the new moons, as it is said: Who satisfieth thy years with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle." ...|$|E

6000|$|What applause <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> to gallantry of Sir Thomas Fairfax, to his modesty, to his conduct, {{under which}} {{he himself was}} subdued, and to the justice <b>he</b> <b>did</b> the king's troops when they laid down their arms! ...|$|R
2500|$|Moses Meïr Perls, {{for many}} years Wertheimer's {{secretary}} and almoner, mentions him in his [...] "Megillat Sefer" [...] (1709) as [...] "a rabbi of great congregations in Israel." [...] In some works Wertheimer is called [...] "rabbi of Prague and Bohemia"; {{but he did not}} accept this title, as may be seen in an edition of Alfasi (Frankfurt-am-Main, 1699–1700). His reputation spread even to the Orient, where he was described as a [...] "prince of the Holy Land" [...] and given the title of [...] "rabbi of Hebron and Safed". His native city also honored him with the title of rabbi. Many authors sought his [...] "approbation", but only in a few cases <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> it, e.g., in Moses ben Menahem's Va-Yachal Mosheh, and Rabbi Yair Bacharach's [...] "Chavath Yair." [...] He contributed liberally toward the publication of such works as [...] "Chavath Yair" [...] (in which his name appears with that of Samuel Oppenheimer), Rabbi Yehudah ben Nisan's [...] "Beth Yehudah", Rabbi Gershon Ashkenazi's [...] "Avodath ha-Gershuni" [...] and [...] "Tif'ereth ha-Gershuni" [...] (in which David Oppenheimer also is mentioned). He and his son-in-law Moses Kann bore the greater part of the expense of printing the Babylonian Talmud in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1712-22; this excellent edition was confiscated and for thirty years kept under lock and key (see Kann, Moses).|$|E

'Who is the boy? What account <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> of himself? Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> come from? He didn't drop out of the clouds, <b>did</b> <b>he,</b> master?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{could have}} KILLED them!' she cried in passion. 'DOGS!--they are dogs! Why is Rupert such a FOOL as to write such letters to them? Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> himself away to such canaille? It's {{a thing that}} CANNOT BE BORNE.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{it might}} have been you!" [...] he said jestingly. [...] "Was he an admirer of yours, Cynthia, that strange, uncouth countryman? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> you the locket?" ...|$|E

60|$|As {{he gripped}} my hand I {{perceived}} {{that he was}} smitten but unbowed. He was taking his orders like a soldier, without complaint or question.--Only when Zulime kissed him <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> way.|$|E

60|$|The {{starving}} creature {{looked up}} from his food, and made an effort to collect his thoughts--to exert his memory. It was not to be <b>done.</b> <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> up the attempt in despair. His language, when he spoke, was as wild as his looks.|$|R
40|$|I {{think it}} is Mr. G. K. Chesterton who writes {{that one of the}} first {{questions}} he would ask of a new landlady is: "Madam, what is your view of the universe?" His opinion of her as alandlady would be determined by the reply she gave. Similarly every thoughtful reader of the novel asks: "What is the author's view of life? What message <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> concerning human experience and character? What are his views of the universe around us and of the world within us? What explanation, if any, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> of sin, sorrow and suffering, and what are his theories of goodness, beauty and truth: In short what is the author's philosophy?" Undoubtedly the novel reader's first interest is in the story. [ [...] . ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What!" [...] The dark man's voice sharpened. He {{sounded as}} though he were cross-examining a {{reluctant}} witness. [...] "Then why aren't you there? What are you doing here? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> you a holiday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} yet told me, by-the-bye, what old Mr Rogan said to you just before we started. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> you any hint as to where you might be sent to after {{reaching}} Norway House?" ...|$|E
25|$|According {{to another}} story, {{he heard that}} a horse was to be put down, so he bought the horse, bought a few grassy acres nearby, and turned it out to recover. When it <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the horse to someone needy, {{exacting}} a promise to treat it humanely.|$|R

60|$|The monk mused deeply. After {{a silence}} of several minutes he {{proceeded}} to the duties of his holy office. Receiving the spiritual confession of the prisoner <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the absolution with a fervor which proved how deeply his sympathies were enlisted in behalf of the youthful pair. This duty <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> Gelsomina his hand, {{and there was a}} mild confidence in his countenance as he took leave of Jacopo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{if that is}} so," [...] she said, [...] "I cannot {{imagine why}} we live down here, {{hundreds}} of miles away from everywhere. Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> it up? Why is he not in Parliament now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The old man {{snatched}} it from him, and devoured it greedily, as some hungry wild beast might have done, but never {{a word of}} thanks <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> his little benefactor--only growled [...] "More, more!" [...] and glared at the half-frightened children.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{until he}} had set this aflame {{and placed it on}} the table <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>give</b> any heed to the {{questions}} which we were showering upon him; but then he said with the air of one who is vexed with too many words: ...|$|E
25|$|Since Zeus {{could not}} undo {{what she had}} <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> him the gift of prophecy. An {{alternative}} and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, begged her to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him prophecy instead.|$|R
5000|$|... “‘Man’ {{stands in}} the heart of his work: man {{integrated}} in his natural environment, sometimes even absorbed by it. On the other hand, he seems to deny it, as Pevernagie introduces graffiti in his paintings. So <b>doing</b> <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> evidence of the solitude of the human being, his alienation in the urban texture.” (Benezit Dictionary of Artists, Paris) ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the seventh}} day, the police locate Hamel's cabin. Hamel gives {{himself up and}} lets Lemaire live.
