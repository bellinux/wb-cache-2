A retailer of e-books put together or [...] "facilitated" [...] a combination among its suppliers (publishers) to fix and raise prices. The Second Circuit held that [...] "the district court did not err in determining that Apple orchestrated an agreement with and among the Publisher Defendants, in characterizing this agreement as a horizontal price fixing-conspiracy, or in holding that the conspiracy unreasonably restrained trade in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. Pointing to [...] "express collusion among" [...] the publishers, the Court said that [...] "Apple consciously {{played a key role}} in organizing that collusion." [...] Apple argued that under Leegin its conduct was vertical and had to be judged under a rule-of-reason analysis. The Second Circuit rejected that argument, saying that it was settled law that a mixed vertical and horizontal conspiracy, where distributors and manufacturers act together to fix prices or engage in other conduct illegal per se, as in this case [...] "in which a vertical player organizes a horizontal cartel," [...] are to be judged under the rules applicable to horizontal cartels: [...] "In that situation, the court need not consider whether the vertical agreements restrained trade because all participants agreed to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint,</b> which is and ought to be, per se unlawful." ...|$|E

In that case the Government challenged both sales of bulk drug chemical and manufacturing licenses each with both bulk-sales restrictions and limitations to marketing the drug in a specific combination with another drug (for example, Ciba's patented hydrochlorothiazide plus Carter's meprobamate). The Government had two principal legal theories: (1) each agreement was a [...] "contract, combination, or conspiracy" [...] in violation of Sherman Act § 1; (2) the [...] "network" [...] of agreements amounted to a hub-and-spoke conspiracy. The district court found:The proof in this case has shown a series of supply agreements which limit, in varying degrees, the range of uses to which the purchaser was entitled to put the vended material. Although these contracts were reached in a vertical, supplier-purchaser, context, they, in fact, were designed to limit horizontal competition between CIBA and its vendees. Such agreements are more pernicious antitrust violations than simple vertical restraints, for, {{as a result of}} them, [...] "cartel activity then co-exists with the attempt to vertically control the discretion of the independent businessman." [...] Where it is shown, as it is here, that a vertically imposed restraint is intended to suppress horizontal competition, the court will treat the agreement as the equivalent of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint</b> of trade.|$|E

The aim of the study reported here was to test this model by examining the patient, staff, and environmental factors {{associated with the use of}} horizontal (as opposed to vertical) restraint. Logistic regression analysis of secondary data on the first-recorded episode of restraint of 261 patients occurring over a three-year period (1999 - 2001) in an acute care psychiatric trust in the UK was conducted, followed by a ROC analysis of the discriminative ability of the derived model to predict <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint.</b> It was found that patients admitted under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, those committing self-harm, and those with unclear thoughts and increased vocal volume prior to the incident were more likely to be restrained horizontally. Older people, those with perceived rational causation such as bad news and personal gain, and those with no obvious warning signs were less likely to be restrained horizontally. The AUC of the model was. 76 (95 % CI. 70 -. 82), indicating acceptable discriminative ability.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the numerical analyses of restrained concrete floor slabs exposed to fire. The {{analyses of the}} slabs were carried out with the SAFIR finite element program considering a 200 mm thick slab, spanning 5 metres between two end supports. The slabs {{were exposed to the}} ISO standard fire for up to four hours and were analysed with pinned and rotationally restrained supports. Different heights of the line of thrust at the supports and different levels of axial restraint were also investigated. The analyses show that fully restrained pin-supported slabs can survive the four hour ISO fire without collapse if the position of the line of thrust is located near the soffit of the slab. If the position of the line of thrust is located much above the soffit of the slab, the slabs will rapidly undergo large deformations and sag into a catenary, imposing axial tensile forces at the supports. The analyses have shown that even if the line of thrust is located close to the soffit, the slab can still deform into a catenary if there is insufficient horizontal axial restraint. In this study, rotationally restrained slabs experience much smaller vertical deflections than pin-supported slabs when exposed to fires. Rotationally restrained slabs with low levels of <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint</b> do not collapse, due to the beneficial effects of moment redistribution.

In addition, the inclusion of a footbridge made of glass reinforced plastic in the test programme enabled the performance of this new type of footbridge construction to be investigated. The techniques of ambient excitation, impulse response using an instrumented hammer, and free-vibration decay were employed to obtain the modal properties of the test structures. The practicalities of using these techniques are discussed and improvements in their application are suggested. Very good agreement was obtained between the experimental and the numerical results. The calibrated numerical models were employed to investigate ways of removing the natural frequencies of the structures from the common range of pedestrian excitation, thereby improving their vibration performance. The handrails were identified as a potential way to increase the stiffness and thus the natural frequencies of a structure.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{full-scale}} fire tests {{conducted at the}} Cardington steel framed test building in the United Kingdom have shown that unprotected composite floor slabs do not collapse after a compartment burnout, despite suffering considerable deformations and very high measured steel temperatures. When the unprotected steel beams weakened, the load resistance progressively transferred from the beams to the slabs which resisted the loads by tensile membrane action. These tests have prompted extensive computer modelling by many researchers to simulate the behaviour of steel framed buildings and tensile membrane action of the slabs under fire conditions. However, there are no published fire tests of two-way concrete slabs in a controlled furnace environment This report describes the fire tests of two-way concrete slabs conducted at the BRANZ fire resistance furnace. The tests were conducted to investigate the behaviour of unrestrained simply suppmted slabs in a controlled furnace environment. The test data {{can be used to}} verify current simple design methods and sophisticated computer models. Six slabs were tested, comprising three reinforced concrete flat slabs and three composite steel-concrete slabs. The slabs measured 3. 3 m by 4. 3 m and had thicknesses ranging from 90 mm to 130 mm. The three flat slabs had different quantities of reinforcing steel to investigate their effect on controlling crack widths to prevent integrity failure. The slabs were simply supported on all four sides over the furnace with no <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint.</b> The slabs were subjected to a live load of 3. 0 kPa and were heated on the underside with the gas time temperature curve following the ISO 834 standard fire for three hours. The slabs petformed very well in the fire tests, supporting the loads for the full duration of three hours without collapse. By three hours, the gas temperatures had reached 1100 °C and high temperatures were measured across the depth of the slab. The temperatures of the reinforcing steel exceeded 700 °C. All the slabs suffered extensive surface cracking and loss of moisture. Some of the slabs suffered large midspan deflections (up to 270 mm) and full depth cracks which were associated with the yield line crack pattern. The slabs with higher steel contents and closer bar spacings suffered only surface cracking, while the slabs with the lower steel content suffered full-depth cracks. The cold-drawn mesh used in the tests performed well and did not fracture as might have been expected if such large strains had been imposed at ambient temperature; {{this is due to the}} increased ductility of the steel caused by the elevated temperatures. The slabs resisted collapse even though the calculated ultimate load capacities had dropped significantly below the level of the applied loads.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the evaluation of a selected test bridge using instrumentation to obtain site-specific factors contributing to the evaluation, with the ultimate objective of improving the estimate of the bridge’s reliability in order to assess allowable loading more accurately. The experimental portion of the research program involved instrumenting the test bridge with strain gauges, and recording field measurements using two forms of loading. The analytical portion of the research program involved the analysis of the bridge in the as-designed state, based on the design drawings and specification, followed by a re-analysis of the bridge using the site-specific factors measured on-site. The bridge was evaluated using methods outlined in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code CAN/CSA-S 6 - 00 (CSA 2000). The test bridge is located near the community of Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan. The bridge is constructed of steel-reinforced concrete, and there are three, three-span arch-shaped girders. There are also external steel bars added after initial construction to increase the midspan bending moment resistance. In total, 45 strain gauges were placed on the middle spans of the three girders to record strain induced by two forms of loading: controlled loading, in which a truck of known weight and dimensions was driven over the bridge in a number of pre-determined configurations, and in-situ loading, in which normal truck traffic was used. The current allowable loading on the bridge is a gross vehicle weight of 62. 5 t, although increasing the allowable loading to 110 t has been proposed, along with two strengthening alternatives to make this increased loading feasible. To provide a base-line analysis for comparison purposes, the bridge was first evaluated based strictly on information taken from the design drawings and specifications. The evaluation was performed using the load and resistance factor method, in which load and resistance factors were used to account for uncertainty, {{as well as by the}} mean load method, in which statistical properties of the variable’s parameters included in the design were used to account for uncertainty. The result of the load and resistance factor method was a live load capacity factor, indicating the overall “rating” of the bridge. In addition to the live load capacity factor, the mean load method was also used to determine the reliability index. The results of the as-designed analysis showed that the mean load method gave more conservative estimates of the bridge capacity. Furthermore, it was determined that, based on these assessments, the bridge would not have sufficient capacity to carry the proposed 110 t truck loads. The bridge was re-evaluated using site-specific factors with the mean load method. Using the measured strains, statistical parameters were determined for live load effects, distribution factors, dynamic load allowance, and resistance. Statistical parameters that could not be obtained readily through testing were obtained from the literature. The results indicated that code-predicted estimates of a number of factors were highly conservative. Flexural and shear load effects in the girders were found to be less than 15 % of the theoretical predictions, as a result of apparent arching action in the girders, generating significant axial forces. For this arching action to occur, <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint</b> was required at the supports, either through unanticipated restraint in the bearings, or tension tie action of the tensile girder reinforcement. Furthermore, the dynamic amplification was found to be less than 1. 0. The resulting reliability indices indicated that the bridge would be safe under the proposed increased allowable loading (110 t). Finite element models were used to confirm the dynamic amplification observations and examine the effects of different degrees of bearing restraint. The model showed results similar to those measured for dynamic amplification. It was found that if the bearings were to become completely fixed against horizontal translation, the bridge would become overloaded as a result of increased shear effects, demonstrating the need for proper bearing maintenance. An analysis of relative costs was completed to determine the most cost-effective solution for hauling logs. Assumptions were made regarding truck and maintenance and operating costs. The results indicated that the most economic solution was to use the method outlined in the research to increase the allowable loading on the bridge to 110 t, over the strengthening alternatives and simply leaving the bridge in the current state...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of several structural failures in the last decades, the European Standard EN 1990 (2002) ‘Basis of structural design’ incorporated the following requirement with respect to robustness: “A structure shall be designed and executed {{in such a way}} that it will not be damaged by events such as explosion, impact and the consequence of human errors to an extent disproportionate to the original cause”. In addition, the European Standard EN 1991 - 1 - 7 (2006) ‘Actions on structures – Part 1 - 7 : Accidental actions’ points to strategies to enhance structural robustness, emphasising amongst others the favourable contribution of developing alternate load paths in case of abnormal loading events. The investigations reported in the present thesis aim for a better understanding of the alternate load path provided by the transition from a flexural to a tensile load transfer. In particular, the load transfer provided by tensile membrane action developing at very large displacements after a support removal scenario and, subsequently, excessive loading is investigated. It is widely appreciated that this tensile membrane behaviour has a positive effect on the structural behaviour. The ultimate limit state behaviour for tensile membrane action developing in slabs, however, is largely unknown due to the limited amount of experimental largescale investigations. Based on an extensive literature review, an experimental program has been elaborated in order to investigate tensile membrane action developing in a restrained one-way concrete slab. A unique test set-up has been developed allowing a loading test on a four-span reinforced concrete slab strip under longitudinal elongation restraint into the region of large deflections. The tested slabs were 140 mm or 160 mm thick and 1800 mm wide with a geometric reinforcement ratio of about 0. 5 %. The total length of each specimen was 14. 3 m, whereas the distance between the inner supports and the central support was 4 m. These spans changed to one span of 8 m between the inner supports after the controlled removal of the central support, thus simulating an accidental event. Further, also a testing procedure was elaborated, consisting of 3 phases (i. e. loading until an arbitrary preloading level, removal of the central support and loading until failure). During the first phase, the load was gradually increased up to the preloading level for the situation where the central support was still present. Subsequently, the slab was unloaded. In a second phase, the central support of the specimens was gradually removed in order to simulate a failure of the support and to obtain valuable data regarding the robustness of the specimens. Accordingly, the two inner spans of 4 m each, changed to a single span of 8 m. The specimens were allowed to bend progressively in the central span of the slab, resulting in a redistribution of stresses and the development of an alternate load path distributing the emerging forces to the remaining supports. Finally, in the third phase, the load was applied again by two line loads in a displacement controlled manner until failure. With increasing vertical deflections of the specimens the slabs’ ends started to move inwards provoking a significant increase in the loadcarrying capacity due to emerging tensile membrane forces established by a horizontal restraining system. In total three different tests on slab strips with <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraint</b> were performed. In case of slab 1, the longitudinal top and bottom flexural reinforcement was continuous over the entire length of the specimen. Hence, no reinforcement curtailing was applied. Further, a second specimen featuring a realistic reinforcement curtailment was tested. In case of slab 3 the longitudinal flexural reinforcement was curtailed similar to slab 2, but the thickness of the slab was reduced from 160 mm to 140 mm. In all three tests, tensile membrane action was activated during the third phase of testing, significantly increasing the load carrying capacity of the specimen under investigation. During the tests, manual measurements were executed after each successive increase of the load or displacement, comprising dial gauges, crack widths measurements and DEMEC measurements. Further, around 60 digital channels were recording the digital measurements comprising displacements, horizontal (membrane) and vertical (reaction) load cell forces and strain measurements with stirrups. Each tested slab strip was exposed to three distinct stages: an elastic, plastic and tensile membrane stage. The development of displacements, strain measurements as well as the horizontal forces within this investigation confirmed a load transfer process from an elastic bending mechanism, over a plastic stage towards a tensile membrane mechanism controlled by tension. As tensile membrane forces developed, the load bearing capacity was able to increase until approximately 3 times the service load for slab 1 and 2. 6 times for slab 2 (despite the removal of the central support). For slab 3 the ultimate collapse load even amounted to about 3. 6 times the service load. Hence, the importance of quantifying this additional bearing capacity became clear, especially in robustness analysis, as otherwise one disregards an inherently available and very large additional safety. The test results provide a unique set of detailed experimental data (crack widths, deformations, rotation angles, displacements, etc.) allowing for a detailed analysis and refined comparisons with respect to the structural response under tensile membrane action as well as regarding the failure criteria. Finite element modelling was used to simulate the structural behaviour of oneway slabs under large deformations and tensile membrane actions. On the basis of the experimental findings, the numerical model was validated with special attention to material models, mesh definition and boundary conditions accounting for highly non-linear material performances as well as geometrical non-linear behaviour. In summary, the load-displacement curves until the failure of the top reinforcement bars, displacements, rotation angles, the development of strains and tensile membrane forces were calculated within a reasonable tolerance and showed good agreement with the laboratory tests. As such, it is demonstrated that the developed finite element model is a suitable tool being capable to predict the structural response under tensile membrane forces. By means of this developed finite element model, a parametric study was conducted. In this study the influence of several geometries (various span lengths, thicknesses and reinforcement ratios), material assumptions (various steel qualities and ultimate reinforcement strains) and boundary conditions are investigated and discussed. A literature study with respect to analytical models for tensile membrane action was performed serving as a starting point for the analytical investigation. On the basis of the standard plastic theory an analytical model is proposed firstly considering perfectly restrained edges. The loading response, the formation of tensile membrane action and the failure load is accounted for. Further, the proposed method was applied and refined in order to simulate the structural behaviour of the conducted slab experiments by incorporating non-linear horizontal movements of the restraining system. The calculation results were compared with numerical and experimental findings and the analysis results show good agreement. In the presented PhD thesis it is demonstrated by means of experimental, numerical as well as analytical investigations that the development of tensile membrane behaviour as a result of horizontal edge restraint is capable of generating a considerable strength reserve significantly increasing the loading response of one-way reinforced concrete slabs when very large deformations occur. The insights gained from these investigations give strong evidence of the beneficial contribution of tensile membrane action to the loading capacity and robustness of concrete structures in accidental load situations. The developed numerical and analytical calculation techniques are shown to be feasible tools not only to quantify the loading response corresponding to the experimentally observed ultimate limit state behaviour but also to predict the structural response under tensile membrane action for other boundary conditions and material characteristics serving as a general calculation framework to include tensile membrane action in conventional design when robustness is considered...|$|E

This comment suggests that, if the law of vertical restraints is finally rationalized so that an issuer of a security may lawfully restrict price and other competition among its distributors, the traditional basis for inferring a congressional intention to exempt securities offerings from the Sherman Act (a “clear repugnancy” between two statutory regimes) would at least arguably disappear.

40|$|Professors Goldberg vigorously {{attacks the}} merits of the Three Tenors {{decision}} while emphasizing the issue of whether the challenged restraint resides within the boundaries of the firm. Professor Muris responds that the Commissions analysis is correct {{as a matter of law}} and fact, and that Professor Goldbergs call for a market power screen for all <b>horizontal</b> <b>restraints</b> ignores the legal costs of rulemaking. I take a third view of the debate. While conceding that per se rule is properly applied to naked restraints, I show that the Commissions analysis relies on an inappropriately narrow view of the ancillary restraints doctrine in order to justify application of the per se rule. In particular, the Commissions emphasis on the timing of the restraint as well as its hostility towards PolyGrams free rider defense are not supported as a matter of law. In any event, the facts of the Three Tenors do not support the Commissions conclusion that the moratorium agreement was not ancillary to the joint venture. ...|$|R
