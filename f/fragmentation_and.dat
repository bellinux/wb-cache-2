5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire.

The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four <b>fragmentation</b> <b>and</b> four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E

PNW-RP- 545. Portland, OR: U. S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 19 p. We integrated landscape data from science assessments of the interior Columbia basin (basin) into one variable that functions as a robust index of departure from native conditions. This variable, {{referred to as the}} disturbance departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> index, is a spatially explicit measure of landscape quality and resiliency. Primary causes of departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> include fire exclusion, timber harvest, mining, oil and gas development, livestock grazing, invasive species, road networks, and the interface of these activities with agricultural and urban development. We derived four classes of the disturbance departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> index: very high, high, moderate, and low. Very high departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> was associated with low-elevation subwatersheds dominated by agricultural and urban lands. High departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> was found in subwatersheds containing a mix of agricultural lands with low-elevation forests, woodlands, or rangelands. Subwatersheds with moderate departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> were associated with low- to mid-elevation forests, woodlands, or rangelands in public ownership. Subwatersheds with low departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> typically occurred at higher elevations, on public lands within or near wilderness areas, roadless areas, or national parks. Because the disturbance departure <b>and</b> <b>fragmentation</b> index represents the composite effects of management activities that do not mimic native or natural processes, the index appears useful as a planning tool for integ [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>and</b> collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep <b>fragmentation</b> <b>and</b> nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{classified}} as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to habitat <b>fragmentation</b> <b>and</b> loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful {{in the vicinity of}} pine plantations. It has been listed as vulnerable in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity. As a result, the population has increased from a low of 19–21 individuals in 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{a genetic}} {{study found that}} the wolf {{population}} in Europe was divided along a north-south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Dinaric-Balkans, the Carpathians. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster, with wolves from the Carpathians cluster coming from a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape <b>fragmentation</b> <b>and</b> the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.|$|E
