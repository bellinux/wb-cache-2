30|$|The textural {{characteristics}} were studied at five intervals for the <b>GM</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 7 cores (Table 1).

The standard deviation values vary between 1.53 – 1.60 and 1.54 – 1.74 ϕ in the <b>GM</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 7 cores, respectively, which reveal that the sediments are poorly sorted. The skewness (Sk 1) values vary between 0.02 – 0.05 and 0.02 – 0.07 ϕ for the <b>GM</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 7 cores, respectively, indicating that the energy was constant during the deposition of sediments. The kurtosis (KG) values of the <b>GM</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 7 cores (0.92 – 0.94 and 0.93 – 0.95, respectively) indicate that the sediments are mesokurtic type (Table 1).|$|R

5|$|Holden's second {{full-scale}} car factory, {{located in}} Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne), {{was completed in}} 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood, New South Wales. However, World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted {{to the construction of}} vehicle bodies, field guns, aircraft and engines. Before the war ended, the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry. Both <b>GM</b> <b>and</b> Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining the production of the first Australian-designed car. Ford's proposal was the government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GM's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention. After the war, Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies, this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall. The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} quality of general {{movements}} (GMs) in the first fourteen days of life in relation to obstetric and postnatal risk factors and neurodevelopmental outcome in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. STUDY DESIGN: The GMs of nineteen infants were assessed on days 2, 4, 6, 10 and 14 with Prechtl's method. Additionally, detailed GM assessment produced optimality scores (OSs). <b>GMs</b> <b>and</b> the OSs were related to obstetric and postnatal data and to neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months. RESULTS: <b>GMs</b> <b>and</b> OSs fluctuated substantially during the first fourteen days of life. Most infants had abnormal GMs, especially poor repertoire (PR) GMs. No relation was found between <b>GMs</b> <b>and</b> obstetric factors. Regarding postnatal factors, septicaemia correlated to hypokinesia (H) and artificial ventilation correlated to a lower OS. CONCLUSIONS: Due to physiological disturbances {{the quality of}} GM in ELBW infants fluctuates substantially during the first fourteen days of life. Abnormal GMs, especially PR GMs, are mostly seen for the same reason. Septicaemia and artificial ventilation are associated with deterioration of the <b>GMs</b> (lower OSs), <b>and</b> in case of septicaemia also with hypokinesia...|$|R
40|$|The {{preferred}} conformation of gangliosides GM 3, GM 2, GM 1, GD 1 a and GD 1 b {{have been}} studied by computing their potential energies. The conformation of NeuNAc in GM 3 differs from that expected for the same residue in <b>GM</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 1. The NeuNAc residues in <b>GM</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 1 exhibit identical conformations. Theory predicts that the terminal NeuNAc of GD 1 a is conformationally {{similar to that of}} <b>GM</b> 3 <b>and</b> that the internal one is similar in conformation to those present in <b>GM</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> 1 in agreement with NMR studies. The differences in chemical shifts of the C 2 and C 3 carbons of the internal and terminal NeuNAc of GD 1 a have been attributed to differences in orientation. The present studies suggest that the binding site of cholera toxin is much smaller than that of tetanus toxin. The preferred shape of these gangliosides correlate well with their biological properties...|$|R

There was no change in the penetration ratio of VCM <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> into perilymph between administration of VCM or <b>GM</b> alone <b>and</b> the combination of both drugs.
