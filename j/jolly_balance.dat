Invented by the German physicist Philipp von Jolly in 1864, it consists of a spring fastened at the top to a movable arm. At the lower end, the spring is provided with two small pans, one suspended beneath the other. The lower pan is kept immersed to the same depth in water, while the other one hangs in the air. On the upright stand behind the spring is a mirror on which is engraved or painted a scale of equal parts. The specific gravity of an object, typically a solid, is determined by noting how much the spring lengthens when the object is resting in the upper pan in air (...) , {{and then when the}} object is moved to the lower pan and immersed in water (...) [...] The specific gravity is [...]|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} on surface tension of TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids {{is much less}} than that of thermal conductivity or viscosity. Some results showed that adding TiO 2 nanoparticles had little effect on the surface tension of nanofluids. Liu et al. [125] prepared TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids whose particle size ranged from 11 to 50  nm and the surface tensions TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids were investigated experimentally. They found the surface tension had no obvious change with the increase in particle loading because the surface tension of nanofluids (1 % mass fraction) increased only 1.6 % compared with deionized water. Hu et al. [126] found the surface tension of TiO 2 –H 2 O nanofluids increases slightly when adding nanoparticles. And the surface tension decreased as an increase in temperature. Buschmann and Franzke [127] found that no obvious variation occurs when adding a high-volume fraction (5  vol.%) of TiO 2 nanoparticles in water. Tian and Wang [128] measured the surface tension of TiO 2 –water nanofluids by <b>Jolly</b> <b>balance</b> and abruption method. They found that the surface tension behavior of TiO 2 –water nanofluid was the same as water viz. the surface tension decreased as the temperature increases. However, the variation of surface tension is related to the content of nanoparticles. When the content of nanoparticles increases rapidly, the decrease rate of surface tension of TiO 2 –water nanofluids will slow down. Yang et al. [129] observed that nanoparticles have little effect but the surfactant can greatly change the surface tension of nanofluids, when the loading of surfactant is below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). And they explained this appearance as follows: The effect of surfactant on the surface tension of liquid is much greater than that of nanoparticles. When adding nanoparticles into a fluid containing surfactant whose loading is below CMC, the “free” surfactant will be absorbed on the surface of nanoparticles and then immersed in the liquid, which can weaken the reducing effect of surfactant on the surface tension of liquids.|$|E

Introduction: It is my purpose {{in this experiment}} to attempt to demonstrate the {{tensile strength}} of single wool fibers from four of the chief breeds, viz. Cotswold, Shropshire, Southdown, and the Rambouillet. Samples {{from different parts of}} the body were also compared. The apparatus used consisted of two <b>jolly</b> <b>balances,</b> a compound microscope with ocular or eye piece, micrometer, small forceps, mechanical stage, and other microscopic equipment. Two <b>jolly</b> <b>balances</b> were used because of the wide variation between the Cotswold and Rambouillet wools, the Cotswold fibers being so strong that a special balance with an extra strong spring or coil was required. The test was begun by first determining the constant of each balance, which was done by making the zero reading and then noting the displacement caused by a weight of one gram. Next a wool fiber was fastened on the hook of the balance by knotting one and half-hitching. The tensile strength was then easily read in grams by simply pulling down on the fiber until it broke, the reading being made just at the moment the fiber parted. No particular length of fiber was used as the weight of a single fiber is so very slight that it was concluded the results would not be influenced. The only opportunity for a variation might be based on the cry that in a greater length the chances for weak points are greater. No objection can be raised on account of this theory, however, because a thread is no stronger than its weakest point. This last statement might also be sited as a reason for testing many fibers and each but one. In connection with obtaining the strength of each fiber the diameter was also taken as {{it was found that the}} strength varied directly with the diameter. For the purpose of measuring the diameters, the fibers were fastened on a glass slide by means of balsam and cover slips. In this condition the fibers were held firm and straight, so that with the aid of a micrometer–microscope and mechanical stage the diameter was very easily determined...|$|R
