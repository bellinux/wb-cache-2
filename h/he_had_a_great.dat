5|$|While we did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|E

In the interim <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor John Barrymore in Edna Ferber's Theatre Royal. His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run, {{in one of the}} athletic, acrobatic stunts with which he liked to enliven his performances.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{appreciation}} of sacred music {{and was a}} great reader of works about art, but he detested physical activity. He appeared to have suffered periodic crises of depression. An aversion to changes in his routine extended to his clothing: he wore the same coat until it tore, forcing his chamberlains to sew it on his body while he slept in it. He suffered from panic attacks when he heard thunder, staying in his rooms with the windows shut and receiving no one.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{rivalry with}} yokozuna Wakanohana Kanji I, who {{reached the top}} rank in January 1958.
