5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS Church leaders {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent {{on the question of}} his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad {{travelled}} to the Jama Masjid Delhi (main mosque) of Delhi {{accompanied by}} twelve of his followers, where some 5,000people were gathered.

He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the one who will descend to Earth himself.

25|$|Various books, memoirs {{and stories}} were written about Jesus {{by the early}} Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are {{believed}} to have been written within 50â€“70 years of the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> with the Gospel of Mark believed to be the earliest, and the last the Gospel of John. Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a short letter by St Paul: the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, which appeared about 25 years after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.|$|E
