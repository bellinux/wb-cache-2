5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided {{they did not have}} enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E
25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied {{thousands of pages of}} daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although everyone <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E

25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number not nearly enough energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E

[...] Washington Post editor and later press critic Ben Bagdikian said, [...] "When Seldes was no longer printed by the mainstream press, he was an important conduit to the journalistic community, who <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> flaws in the system, but often couldn't get printed in their own newspapers, because the press cannot be a watchdog on itself. So they fed stories critical of the press to Seldes." [...] At the height of its popularity it had a circulation of 176,000.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, Bradford invited tenders for the {{construction}} of Angram Reservoir, and the project was awarded to John Best in October–November, at a contract price of £365,492. Meanwhile, the Corporation had reached provisional agreement with the Nidd Valley Light Railway Company to purchase the powers awarded to them to build the light railway. There was some debate about the gauge of the railway. Bradford wanted to ask the Light Railway Commissioners for permission to increase it to , probably influenced by Best, who <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> supplies of suitable contractors stock available for such a railway. They also wanted to ensure that they bought enough land to allow a standard gauge railway to be constructed [...] "at any future time." [...] The North Eastern Railway, owners of the Nidd Valley Railway, argued that it should be standard gauge from the outset, since they were running excursions to Pateley Bridge twice a week, and these could continue over the Nidd Valley Light Railway. It would also remove the necessity of transshipping goods.|$|E

[...] In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients: “There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there. [...] The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood. [...] The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated. [...] Her ears had been cut off. [...] And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. [...] She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering. [...] We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures. [...] We were completely overwhelmed, and she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> so many others. [...] She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha' — 'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
