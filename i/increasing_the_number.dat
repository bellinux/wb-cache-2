5|$|As Apostolic Delegate, Lefebvre's chief {{duty was}} the {{building}} {{up of the}} ecclesiastical structure in French Africa. Pope Pius XII wanted to move quickly towards a proper hierarchy (with bishops instead of vicariates and apostolic prefectures).

5|$|As a consequence, most {{battles in}} the 4th century were, as in {{previous}} centuries, primarily infantry encounters, with cavalry playing a supporting role. The main qualification is that on the Eastern frontier, cavalry played a more prominent role, due to the Persian reliance on cavalry as their main arm. This obliged the Romans to strengthen their own cavalry element, in particular by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of cataphracti.|$|E

However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed {{by the fact that}} early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E

5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E

Their desire to achieve Test status {{was in part}} {{to stem the tide}} of Irish players using residency rules to switch to England for the opportunity to play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of iterations required in the average and worst case. This {{is the case for}} other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
