40|$|Problem statement: The {{absorption}} {{characteristics of}} coir fiber were analyzed previously. &# 13; Analytical method {{to predict the}} acoustical behavior of coir fiber has already been developed. &# 13; However, compression effects of coir fiber were not explored which might significant for acoustics&# 13; absorption during seat padding. In this study, compression effect on the sound absorption&# 13; characteristics of coir fiber are demonstrated based on the previous analytical approach such as rigid&# 13; frame method with the modification in the physical parameters. Approach: The verification of the&# 13; estimated acoustical absorption coefficient in uncompressed condition using rigid frame Johnson-&# 13; Allard Model are shown <b>for</b> <b>three</b> different <b>thicknesses</b> of industrially processed coir fiber mixed with&# 13; binder latex. Measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption&# 13; of coir fiber. It {{is well known that}} the absorption behavior of a porous material varies during&# 13; compression and affects the physical parameters. In these analyses, formulas proposed by Castagnede&# 13; are employed to predict the compression effect on the absorption of coir fiber which takes into account&# 13; the modifications of the physical parameters during compression. Results: The agreement between the&# 13; analytical and measured results is justified <b>for</b> all <b>three</b> sample <b>thicknesses</b> in uncompressed condition. &# 13; Analyses on the acoustic behavior of material during compressed condition show that compression has a&# 13; substantial effect on the absorption of coir fiber.

40|$|The task of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the possibilities of using micro-structuring {{on the surface of}} thin light-guides to efficiently couple light from top-emitting LEDs into such light-guides. Areas of application are backlighting for LCD TV and flexible light emitting layers for lighting purposes. The micro-structures considered are prisms and pyramids. The micro-structures can be {{on the same side of}} light-guide as the LEDs or on the opposite side. When located on the opposite side, the micro-structures are coated with a specular reflecting layer or with a diffuse reflecting layer. The LEDs can either be in optical contact with the light-guide or not in optical contact. Optical ray-tracing software package Light-Tools is used for all ray-tracing simulations of these geometries. In simulations, a two-step approach is taken: Firstly, we build in Light-Tools a simple model of an LED in proximity to a micro-structured light-guide in order to ascertain which geometry is most likely to show a high in-coupling efficiency. In the next step, we made a more elaborate and more accurate model of the most promising geometries. The results of these simulations show that, for micro-structures that are located on the light-guide on the side opposite to the LEDs, a diffuse reflecting layer (i. e. a Lambertian scatterer) is more useful than a specular reflecting layer (i. e. a mirror). Also, in general, the prisms structures perform better than the pyramid structures. The highest efficiency reached in the simulations is 60 % for Model I 1   in which the light source is not in optical contact with the light guide and the mirror is on the opposite side of the light guide. Compared to the result reported in a previous paper, the incoupling efficiency improvement is 8 %. We also looked into using Retro-reflection Films for improving the in-coupling efficiency.

All three approaches {{result in a}} broadly similar characterisation of uncertainty, but each has associated strengths and weaknesses.

DGM is more sophisticated and accounts properly for skewness and proportional effect.

The differences in a solar absorptance (α) of the <b>three</b> <b>thicknesses</b> of Ni–Al coating are not statistically significant, with an average α value of 0.74 – 0.75. However, there are differences in thermal efficiency of the PTC depending on the thickness of the Ni–Al coating. Of the three samples, the thickest one (299  µm) demonstrates the highest ability to convert solar radiation into thermal energy.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} studies {{the effect of}} the distance between the sample and the plasma sputtering source on the properties of the junction (silicon wafer-carbon nanotubes). The silicon wafer is fixed at (near, medium and far distances from the plasma source which {{is in the form of}} high puri-ty graphite rod heated electrically). <b>For</b> the <b>three</b> cases, <b>thickness</b> of the sample is constant (20 nm). The samples were studied by scanning electron (SEM) and atomic force microscopes (AFM), X-ray and Raman spectra. For optimum distances the carbon layer is in the form of multi wall car-bon nanotube (MWCNT). SEM images shows no formation of CNT on the Si wafer for near distance, which is consistent with the AFM images, X-ray and Raman spectrograms and no existence of cha-racteristics (002) peaks whereas it appears for medium and longer distances, and by experience the optimum distance was found. This means that at closer distance high energy and high intensity plasma particles prevent the formation of CNT. This effect decreases with increasing distance of substrate from the graphite rod...|$|R
40|$|D-PeniciUamine {{alters the}} normal {{metabolism}} of collagen by inhibiting cross-linking and protein synthesis. This could affect wound healing, accelerate skin thinning and possibly exaggerate the osteoporosis of rheumatoid disease. The mean time to wound healing after 42 orthopaedic surgical operations in 21 patients treated with penicillamine was 19. 8 (± 13. 1) days. Compared with an earlier study, {{these results suggest}} that the drug has a comparable effect on wound healing to corticosteroids given <b>for</b> <b>three</b> years. Skinfold <b>thickness</b> over the fourth metacarpal of the dominant hand was measured in 28 cases before and during penicillamine treatment. There was a significant decrease both in the first and second four-month periods of treatment (P< 0. 005 and P< 0. 01). Corticosteroids in constant dose did not have an additive effect. In view of the wound healing findings the significance of these results must await further sequential measurements. The normal progression of osteoporosis over three years was documented in 70 patients who had not received penicillamine. Penicillamine reversed this trend in 35 patients after one yea...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the capability of}} our previously published undoped Double-Gate (DG) MOSFET explicit and analytical compact model to also forecast {{the effect of the}} volume inversion (VI) on the intrinsic capacitances. For that purpose, we present simulation results for these capacitances. We show now that the model presents an accurate dependence on the silicon layer thickness, consistent with two-dimensional numerical simulations, for both thin and thick silicon films. As opposed to our previous work, here we test the capacitance model <b>for</b> <b>three</b> different film <b>thicknesses</b> and also show that the transition from VI regime to dual gate behaviour is well simulated. We demonstrate in this paper that even if the current drive and transconductance are enhanced in VI regime, our results show that intrinsic capacitances are higher as well, which may limit the high-speed (delay time) behaviour of DG MOSFETs under VI regime. The good agreement between the numerical simulations and our model shows the high potential of our complete DG MOSFET model. c 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} FePt/Fe 3 Pt bilayer system using ferromagnetic resonance at room temperature. Measurements were {{taken as a}} function of the direction of the applied external magnetic field with respect to the sample plane. Results show that the effect of exchange coupling is manifest by the induction of a strong perpendicular anisotropy into the soft layer (Fe 3 Pt) from the hard layer (FePt). We have used the angular variation of the resonance field to allow us to assess the anisotropy constants <b>for</b> <b>three</b> different <b>thicknesses</b> of the soft layer (2, 3. 5 and 5 nm). We observe a decrease of the overall perpendicular anisotropy as the soft layer thickness increases. We note that the hard layer does not contribute to the spectra under the experimental conditions used (9. 3 GHz, magnetic fields up to 1 T). We have modeled the bilayer system using the free energy of the system, which includes the effective anisotropies of the layers. In order to fully appreciate the effects of exchange coupling, we have used previously published data of the spin orientation in the soft layer to assess the most appropriate values of the anisotropy constants for the FePt/Fe system. The results indicate that the best way to model these hard-soft coupled ferromagnetic layers is by using a variable effective anisotropy constant in the soft layer, from which almost exact solutions can be obtained. Averaging the anisotropy over the entire layer gives a good measure of the effective anisotropy and the thickness dependence of the effective anisotropy agrees very well with that found experimentally using ferromagnetic resonance...|$|R
40|$|Ensuring the {{effective}} thermal insulation in regions, where the cooling requirement of building {{with respect to}} heating requirement is dominant, is very important from the aspect of energy economy. In this study, the influence of thermal insulation on the building cooling load and the cooling system in case of air-conditioning by an all-air central air-conditioning system was evaluated for a sample building located in Adana, {{based on the results}} of three different types of insulation (A, B and C-type buildings) according to the energy efficiency index defined in the Thermal Insulation Regulation used in Turkey. The operating costs of the air-conditioning system were calculated using cooling bin numbers. Life-cycle cost analysis was carried out utilizing the present-worth cost method. Results showed that both the initial and the operating costs of the air-conditioning system were reduced considerably <b>for</b> all <b>three</b> insulation <b>thicknesses.</b> However, the optimum results in view of economic measurements were obtained for a C-type building. The thickness of thermal insulation for the buildings in the southern Turkey should be determined according to the guidelines for a C-type building.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the quality of solar dried tomato flakes by {{determining}} its safety, nutritive value and wholesomeness. In {{order to determine the}} safety of the dried tomato, the bacteria and mould loads were determined using <b>three</b> sliced <b>thicknesses</b> of solar energy dried samples. Two different types of agar culture media were used to culture the released bacteria and mould cells. Ascorbic acid and proximate tests were carried out to determine the nutritional value of the dried product as compared with the fresh products. To determine the wholesomeness of the dried product, the organoleptic properties in terms of colour (appearance) and taste (flavour) were examined and compared with those of three other tomato products. Results showed that the mean viable bacteria count ranged from 9 to 13 colonies/ml with the 25 mm thickness giving the highest value, followed by 20 mm thickness and the least value was from 15 mm thickness. The same pattern was observed for mould infection. The infection range <b>for</b> the <b>three</b> slice <b>thicknesses</b> was within the recommended safe limit of ≤ 30 colony forming unit/ml for bacteria and mould counts in food products. There was substantial drop in ascorbic acid content from 28. 2 mg/ 100 g for fresh ripe tomato to as low as 13. 6 mg/ 100 g for dried tomato of 25 mm slice thickness and highest value of 20. 6 mg/ 100 g for 20 mm thickness. The results for organoleptic properties showed the tomato dried by solar energy dryer is superior to the other tomato products...|$|R
