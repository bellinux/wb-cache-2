5|$|With little other {{employment}} {{available in}} the Rhondda the only solution appeared to be emigration. Between 1924 and 1939, 50,000 people left the Rhondda. During this time life was difficult for communities built solely around a singular industry, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> most families were on a single wage.|$|E

5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Although often inconspicuous, fungi {{occur in}} every {{environment}} on Earth and play very {{important roles in}} most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore {{play a critical role}} in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play an essential role in nutrient cycling, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E

5|$|At {{the heart}} of this epic, Lee relays another {{personal}} story that impacts intensely, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before.

5|$|Calisthenics, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> done in {{the huge}} {{formations}} favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E
5|$|Church {{and state}} {{maintained}} close {{relations in the}} Anglo-Saxon period, both socially and politically. Churchmen attended royal feasts as well as meetings of the Royal Council. During Æthelstan's reign these relations became even closer, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> the archbishopric of Canterbury had come under West Saxon jurisdiction since Edward the Elder annexed Mercia, and Æthelstan's conquests brought the northern church {{under the control of}} a southern king for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Clark is {{best known}} as a war hero of the Revolutionary War in the West, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> the leader of the secret expeditionary forces that {{captured}} Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79. Some historians have suggested that the campaign supported American claims to the Northwest Territory during negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Paris (1783).|$|E
5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan <b>especially,</b> <b>as</b> she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reduce the amount of supplies available to the French, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successfully blockading the ports in France.|$|E
