50|$|<b>Dioxybenzone</b> (benzophenone-8) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} used in sunscreen to block UVB and short-wave UVA (ultraviolet) rays. It is a derivative of benzophenone. It is a yellow powder with a melting point of 68 °C. It is insoluble in water, but moderately {{soluble in ethanol}} and isopropanol.|$|E
50|$|Substituted benzophenones such as {{oxybenzone}} and <b>dioxybenzone</b> {{are used}} in some sunscreens. The use of benzophenone-derivatives which structurally resemble a strong photosensitizer has been strongly criticized (see sunscreen controversy). Its use in sunscreen {{has been known to}} cause coral bleaching via algae blooms, as it washes into the ocean from human use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: Sunscreen {{compounds}} {{with added}} benefit of skin cancer prevention have both public and commercial interests. Our earlier study using the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen in vitro assay reported on skin cancer chemoprevention potential of benzophenone sunscreens. We now report the in vivo antitumor activity {{of two of the}} benzophenone sunscreens which tested positively in the in vitro assay, octabenzone (UV- 1) and <b>dioxybenzone</b> (UV- 2), in the two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model using (±) -(E) - 4 -methyl- 2 -[-(E) -hydroxyamino]- 5 -nitro- 6 -methoxy- 3 -hexanamide (NOR- 1) as inducer and 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) as promoter. Materials and Methods: Pathogen-free, female hairless mice of HOS:HR- 1 strain, 15 animals per control and test groups, were used. Skin tumors were induced by a single dose o...|$|E
