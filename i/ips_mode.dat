40|$|The {{directional}} intra prediction (IP) in H. 264 /AVC and HEVC {{tends to}} cause the residue to be anisotropic. To transform the <b>IP</b> residue, <b>Mode</b> Dependent Directional Transform (MDDT) based on Karhunen Loeve transform (KLT) can achieve better energy compaction than DCT, with one transform assigned to each prediction mode. However, due to the data variation, different residue blocks with the same <b>IP</b> <b>mode</b> {{may not have the}} same statistical properties. Instead of constraining one transform for each <b>IP</b> <b>mode,</b> in this paper, we propose a novel rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) scheme which allows a set of specially trained transforms to be available to all modes, and each block can choose its preferred transform to minimize the rate-distortion (RD) cost. We define a cost function which is an estimate of the true RD cost and use the Lloyd-type algorithm (a sequence of transform optimization and data reclassification alternately) to find the optimal set of transforms. The proposed RDOT scheme is implemented in HM 9. 0 software of HEVC.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new real-time versatile backend, the Pulsar Ooty Radio Telescope New Digital Efficient Receiver (PONDER), {{which has been}} designed to operate along with the legacy analog system of the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). PONDER makes use of {{the current state of the}} art computing hardware, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and sufficiently large disk storage to support high time resolution real-time data of pulsar observations, obtained by coherent dedispersion over a bandpass of 16 MHz. Four different modes for pulsar observations are implemented in PONDER to provide standard reduced data products, such as time-stamped integrated profiles and dedispersed time series, allowing faster avenues to scientific results for a variety of pulsar studies. Additionally, PONDER also supports general modes of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) measurements and very long baseline interferometry data recording. The <b>IPS</b> <b>mode</b> yields a single polarisation correlated time series of solar wind scintillation over a bandwidth of about four times larger (16 MHz) than that of the legacy system as well as its fluctuation spectrum with high temporal and frequency resolutions. The key point is that all the above modes operate in real time. This paper presents the design aspects of PONDER and outlines the design methodology for future similar backends. It also explains the principal operations of PONDER, illustrates its capabilities for a variety of pulsar and IPS observations and demonstrates its usefulness for a variety of astrophysical studies using the high sensitivity of the ORT.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the study of}} substrate-liquid crystal interaction from two different angles. In one approach, we used the IPS (in-plane switching) technique to investigate the liquid crystal alignment by rubbed polyimide films. The <b>IPS</b> <b>mode</b> of liquid crystal cell operation is facilitated through comb electrodes capable of producing planar electric field. We have fabricated comb electrodes with a periodicity of 2 μm in order to confine the planar electric field close to the liquid crystal-substrate interface. Through optical transmittance measurements and comparison with theoretical predictions based on the Ladau-de Gennes formalism, we found the experimental data {{to be consistent with}} the physical picture of soft anchoring, in which the liquid crystal director at the substrate interface is rotated azimuthally under the planar electric field. As a result, we were able to obtain the azimuthal anchoring strength as a fitting parameter of the theory. This part of the thesis thus presents evidence(s) for director switching at the liquid crystal-substrate interface, as well as a method for measuring the azimuthal anchoring strength through optical means. In the second approach, we used nano-lithographic technique to fabricate textured two dimensional periodic patterns on silicon wafers, and examined the resulting liquid crystal alignment effect of such textured substrates. It was found that with decreasing periodicity, there exists an orientational transition from a state in which the liquid crystal alignment copies the substrate pattern at larger periodicity, to a state of uniform alignment at smaller periodicity. In our system, this transition occurs at a periodicity between 0. 4 μm and 0. 8 μm. Through theoretical simulations based on the model of competition between the elastic distortion energy and the interfacial anchoring potential, it was found that there is indeed a first-order abrupt transition when the periodicity is decreased. This {{is due to the fact}} that the elastic distortion energy scales as the inverse of the periodicity squared. Hence when the periodicity is decreased, the elastic distortion energy increases rapidly. At the critical periodicity the elastic distortion energy crosses the interfacial anchoring potential, below which the uniform alignment becomes the lower energy state. The uniform-aligned state was confirmed by the excellent theory-experiment agreement on spectral measurements, in conjuction with the optical microscope observations. In the uniform-aligned state, a large pretilt angle (35 °) was obtained...|$|E

In the in-plane (<b>IP)</b> precession <b>mode</b> the STO adjusts to a state where its resistance (or voltage) lags Iac {{about a quarter of}} a wavelength [Δ φ 0 = (87 - 94) °]. In the <b>IP</b> <b>mode</b> Δ φ 0 increases somewhat with the direct current. As the precession changes into the out-of-plane (OOP) mode, Δ φ 0 jumps by about 180 °, i. e., the STO resistance now precedes Iac {{about a quarter of a}} wavelength (Δ φ 0 =- 86 °). At the IP/OOP boundary, the alternating current mixes the two oscillation modes and both periodic and chaotic oscillations are observed. As a consequence of mixing, subharmonic terms appear in the STO signal.

40|$|Liquid crystal {{displays}} (LCDs) {{constitute an}} important class of modern display tech- nologies. Their light-weight nature, coupled with their favourable power consumption char- acteristics make them useful in applications ranging from large area projection displays to small electronic {{devices such as}} digital watches and calculators. Despite being the market leader in the display industry, traditional configurations of LCDs suffer from serious drawbacks such as having a very narrow viewing cone. Newer configurations of LCDs, however, employ the in-plane switching (<b>IPS)</b> <b>mode</b> and its deriva- tives. These provide a much wider viewing cone with lower degradation of image quality as one moves off the central axis. IPS pixels have a unique configuration as they contain the electrodes on only {{one side of the}} domain. The electrodes are arranged in an interdigitated pattern and produce an electric field that varies periodically in space parallel to the substrates and decays exponentially in space along the through-plane direction. The highly non-homogeneous nature of the electric field makes the simulation of the electric field within an IPS domain more challenging as a minimum of two dimensions is needed to model the electric field with sufficient accuracy, in contrast to the electric field in the twisted nematic (TN) mode that may be modelled in only one dimension. Traditional approaches have employed an iterative technique wherein the Gauss law equations are solved for a pre-determined director configuration and the electric field thus obtained is employed to calculate the new director configuration over the domain. The iterations are continued till convergence is attained. Our method involves calculating the electric field by means of a semi-analytical expres- sion for an electric field produced by interdigitated electrodes and using this expression to calculate the domain configuration. This methodology is advantageous in terms of computational time and effort as it gives a possible way {{to do away with the}} back and forth iterations involving the dynamic equations and the Gauss’ law equations. In this work, we attempt to look at dynamic characteristics of the liquid crystalline domain in an IPS-LCD. Metrics were evolved to quantify the deformation in the domain. Finally, these metrics were used to examine the dependence of the equilibrium orientation on the domain thickness, electrode width, electrode spacing and electric voltage applied. The results show good match with the trends that can be expected from theoretical considerations. The variation of the domain deformation characteristics with the change in the geometric and physical parameters is along expected lines. For instance, increasing the voltage results in the domain getting deformed to a much greater extent and the defor- mation to penetrate deep within the domain. A greater pixel depth with the same values of the other parameters results in more of the domain staying undeformed as the electric field only penetrates upto a fixed distance into the domain. Increase in the electrode spac- ing was not found to make a significant contribution to the deformation while increasing the width of the electrodes increases the area affected by the electric field and thus, this increases the overall deformation. To conclude, the framework provided here is a valid first step in evolving a complete software package to model deformation characteristics of an LCD pixel. The code is flexible enough to accommodate different LCD configurations and thus, may be used to model a variety of other LCD configurations also. A parallel development of an optics code using a matrix based method may be used to model the propagation of light through the domain and this may be added very easily on top of the existing framework to create a complete package for analysing the electro-optical properties of the LCD...|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of integer programming, the field has been guided by {{research}} into solution approaches to combinatorial problems. We discuss some of the highlights and defining moments of this area. 1 Combinatorial integer programming Integer-programming models arise naturally in optimization problems over combinatorial structures, most notably in problems on graphs and general set systems. The translation from combinatorics {{to the language of}} integer programming is often straightforward, but the new rendering typically suggests direct lines of attack via linear programming. As an example, consider the stable-set problem in graphs. Given a graph G = (V, E) with vertices V and edges E, a stable set of G is a subset S ⊆ V such that no two vertices in S are joined by an edge. The stable-set problem is to find a maximum-cardinality stable set. To formulate this as an integer-programming (IP) problem, consider a vector of variables x = (xv: v ∈ V) and identify a set U ⊆ V with its characteristic vector ¯x, defined as ¯xv = 1 if v ∈ U and ¯xv = 0 otherwise. For e ∈ E write e = (u, v), where u and v are the ends of the edge. The stable-set problem is equivalent to the <b>IP</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R

40|$|Before {{examining}} {{the substance of}} the law it is necessary to discuss the contrast between law and practice. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that the letter of the law is sometimes not what is done in practice. This realisation is often referred to as the “law and society perspective. ” Advocates of this perspective treat legal doctrine as more than just a closed system because they recognise that there are other external influences at play. Beyond the law, people are also influenced by other factors such as social roles, morals, religion and culture. For example, university researchers have an external incentive mechanism outside of IP law. Such researchers frequently prefer to publish their results and discoveries in academic journals rather than file for patents. A patent cannot be granted where there has been a publication. However the researchers are motivated by other incentives such as access to research funds and the attainment of professorship. The Law and Society perspective highlights the fact that the formal processes, which are provided for by the law are at times substituted by informal customs and understandings. An information technology (IT) firm that contributed to this paper by participating in an interview (Interviewee A), provided a good example of such an occurrence. Rather than use any of the formal <b>IP</b> <b>modes</b> of protection which are discussed in the following sections of this paper, ‘Interviewee A’ uses a very unorthodox strategy to protect their IP.

The unexpected behaviour of νH/νD ratios is analysed through the examination of the continuous theoretical evolution of the frequencies with the mass of H. A consequence of this frequency increase in the heavier isotopomer is that the direction of the N-D OP bend is reversed from the N-H OP bend. The Raman scattering data recorded for ZnPc and H 2 Pc in KBr discs are also analysed and found to be quite similar and moreover, identical to the visible fluorescence of matrix-isolated Pcs. The visible absorption, emission and excitation spectra of ZnPc and H 2 Pc trapped in Ne, N 2, Ar, Kr and Xe matrices have been recorded. The visible absorption peaks for the Q band of ZnPc and the Qx and Qy transitions of H 2 Pc have revealed matrix shifts from the gas phase values and distinct sites of isolation. The spectral positions of the vibronic bands in emission with pulse dye laser excitation for both Pcs have been identified. A comparison of the fluorescence spectra with Raman spectra in KBr pellets has revealed very strong similarities. This is entirely consistent with the selection rules and points to the occurrence of only fundamental vibrational transitions in the emission spectra corresponding to those in the ground state. This favourable comparison between Raman and fluorescence spectra has allowed the vibronic modes of ZnPc and H 2 Pc coupling to the electronic emission to be assigned using DFT calculated vibrational spectra. A mirror symmetry between the vibronic structures of ZnPc has been observed in emission and excitation, indicating similar geometries in the ground and excited states. The vibrational modes of ZnPc in the excited state have therefore been assigned using the same DFT Raman vibrations determined for the ground state. For the excitation spectra of H 2 Pc, the mirror symmetry with emission has been seen to breakdown after ~ 950 cm- 1 due the onset of the higher energy Qy state absorption. A matrix dependence has been found for the Qx-Qy energy splitting varying from 916 cm- 1 in Xe and 985. 3 cm- 1 in Ar. In a comparison of the H 2 Pc excitation and emission spectra recorded in this work and those previously reported for D 2 Pc, a tentative assignment of the vibrational mode in the Qx state coupling to the Qy has been made using DFT to a weakly Raman active mode of B 1 g symmetry consisting of an in-plane bending motion of the central N-H bonds. The vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths of H 2 Pc and ZnPc {{as well as those of}} free-base and zinc tetraazaporphyrin (TAP), tetrabenzoporphyrin (TBP) and porphine (P) have been calculated with linear-response time-dependent DFT utilizing the B 3 LYP hybrid functional and 6 - 311 ++G(2 d, 2 p) basis set. The theoretical results for the lowest energy transition have been compared to experimental data and have been found to correctly predict many of the trends apparent for these molecules. One of the major discrepancies that has been observed between the TD-DFT and experimental transition energies was the underestimation of the theoretically determined Qx-Qy splitting of H 2 Pc and the relative intensities of these bands. Laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy of H 2 Pc and ZnPc phthalocyanines trapped in rare gas and nitrogen matrices reveals a quite unexpected phenomenon with a moderate increase in the laser intensity. For these molecules in all matrices, except for ZnPc in Xe, a huge increase in the intensity of a one particular emission band has been observed when pumping the S 1 ← S 0 transition. The band involves a vibrational mode of the ground state, located at 1550 and 1525 cm− 1 for H 2 Pc and ZnPc, respectively. This vibration has been assigned in both phthalocyanines using DFT to the most intense Raman active mode involving an out-of-phase stretching of the C-N-C bonds in the tetrapyrrole ring. Many of the characteristics of amplified emission (AE) are exhibited by this vibronic transition and the threshold conditions have been investigated. In light of the success of the DFT Raman spectra to correctly predict both the positions and relative intensities of the vibronic emission bands of H 2 Pc and ZnPc, the optimized geometries, vibrational frequencies and Raman scattering intensities have been calculated for a selection of other structurally related tetrapyrrolic molecules and their potential for exhibiting AE assessed. Excitation scans recorded for the AE band show greatly enhanced site selectivity compared to what is obtained in normal fluorescence excitation scans...|$|R

The <b>mode</b> that we designed is identical in many aspects to Jutlas Integrity Aware Parallelizable Mode (IAPM). There is one important difference in our proposal. In the IP world, {{a large number of}} packets might arrive out of order. Integrity Aware Parallelizable Mode (IAPM) and the proposed variations incur a large overhead for out of order packets[JU 01]. Each packet requires at least the time to perform a full decryption to obtain an IV before decryption of the cipher can begin. This note describes our solution to this problem. First, we describe the basic mode and its features. We then describe how to implement this mode for IPSec. DUAL COUNTER MODE Dual counter mode is a hybrid of ECB mode and counter mode.

This <b>mode</b> of operation is called Route Optimization (RO), as it allows the packets to traverse a shorter route than the default one through the Home Agent. In Route Optimization, the peer node learns a binding between the Mobile Node’s permanent Home Address and its current temporary Care-ofAddress. Once such a binding is in place, the peer node will send all packets whose destination is the Home Address to the Care-ofAddress. This is potentially dangerous, since a malicious host might be able to establish false bindings, thereby preventing some packets from reaching their intended destination, diverting some traffic to the attacker, or flooding third parties with unwanted traffic.

30|$|The size {{distribution}} of rock pores {{is a key}} factor in determining the storage capacity of oil or water in the strata. Compared with the NMR logging <b>mode,</b> the <b>IP</b> logging <b>mode</b> has greater probing depth, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and less cost, so it has wider and more favorable application prospects (Titov et al. 2002, 2010; Wang 2004). The IP logging instrument can obtain the polarization decay potential (Guan et al. 2010; Li et al. 2011) which contains very rich underground information. The RTS inverted from the IP decay potential can be used to analyze the pore {{size distribution}} of the strata, and then to make assessments on the rock permeability, the amount of oil or water storage, and so on (Liu et al. 2014 a, b; Rezaee et al. 2006; Binley et al. 2005; Zimmermann et al. 2008; Gurin et al. 2013; Beckett and Augarde 2013; Li et al. 2010). A lot of research work has been carried out on the RTS, including inversion algorithms (Moody and Xia 2004; Xiao et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013; Jang et al. 2014; Florsch et al. 2014), determining the appropriate number of relaxation time constants and its distribution (Tong et al. 2004; 2005; Buecker and Hoerdt 2013; Revil et al. 2014). The results of this work have a certain relevance for the inversion of IP RTS (Liu et al. 2014 a). However, the above research was mostly done in the laboratory, and very little was in the in situ environment (Nie et al. 1987; Wang et al. 2011).|$|R

We use two platforms for comparison and evaluation, transversal and torsional phacoemulsification. Patients and methods: This study includes 139 consecutive cataractous eyes (nuclear color 2 &ndash; 4, {{according to the}} Lens Opacities Classification System III [LOCSIII]) of 82 patients undergoing cataract surgery through a 2. 2 mm corneal incision. Two different phacoemulsification platforms were used and assigned randomly: we used the WhiteStar Signature&reg; system with the Ellips&trade; FX transversal continuous ultrasound (US) mode for group I (mean age: 65. 33 &plusmn; 6. 97 years), and we used the Infiniti&reg; system with the OZil&reg; Intelligent Phaco (<b>IP)</b> torsional US <b>mode</b> for group II (mean age: 64. 02 &plusmn; 7. 55 years). The corneal endothelium and pachymetry were evaluated preoperatively and at 1 month postoperatively. Incision size changes were also evaluated. Results: All surgeries were uneventful. Before intraocular lens implantation, the mean incision size was 2. 24 &plusmn; 0. 06 mm in both groups (P = 0. 75). In terms of corneal endothelial cell density, neither preoperative (I vs II: 2304. 1 &plusmn; 122. 5 cell/mm 2 vs 2315. 6 &plusmn; 83. 1 cell/mm 2, P = 0. 80) nor postoperative (I vs II: 2264. 1 &plusmn; 124. 3 cell/mm 2 vs 2270. 3 &plusmn; 89. 9 cell/mm 2, P = 0. 98) {{differences between the groups}} were statistically significant. The mean endothelial cell density loss was 1. 7 % &plusmn; 1. 6 % and 2. 0 % &plusmn; 1. 4 % in groups I and II, respectively. Furthermore, no significant differences between groups I and II were found preoperatively (P = 0. 40) and postoperatively (P = 0. 68) in central pachymetry. With surgery, the mean increase in central pachymetry was 28. 1 &plusmn; 23. 6 &micro;m and 24. 0 &plusmn; 24. 0 &micro;m in groups I and II, respectively (P = 0. 1).

40|$|NASA {{is moving}} toward a networkcentric {{communications}} architecture and, in particular, is building toward use of Internet Protocol (IP) in space. The use of IP is motivated by its ubiquitous application in many communications networks and in available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology. The Constellation Program intends to fit two or more voice (over IP) channels on both the forward link to, and the return link from, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) during all mission phases. Efficient bandwidth utilization of the links is key for voice applications. In Voice over IP (VoIP), the IP packets are limited to small sizes to keep voice latency at a minimum. The common voice codec used in VoIP is G. 729. This new algorithm produces voice audio at 8 kbps and in packets of 10 -milliseconds duration. Constellation has designed the VoIP communications stack to use the combination of IP/UDP/RTP protocols where IP carries a 20 -byte header, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) carries an 8 -byte header, and RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol) carries a 12 -byte header. The protocol headers total 40 bytes and are equal in length to a 40 -byte G. 729 payload, doubling the VoIP latency. Since much of the IP/UDP/RTP header information does not change from IP packet to IP packet, IP/UDP/RTP header compression can avoid transmission of much redundant data as well as reduce VoIP latency. The benefits of IP header compression are more pronounced at low data rate links such as the forward and return links during CEV launch. IP/UDP/RTP header compression codecs are well supported by many COTS routers. A common interface to the COTS routers is through frame relay. However, enabling IP header compression over frame relay, according to industry standard (Frame Relay IP Header Compression Agreement FRF. 20), requires a duplex link and negotiations between the compressor router and the decompressor router. In Constellation, each forward to and return link from the CEV in space is treated independently as a simplex link. Without negotiation, the COTS routers are prevented from entering into the <b>IP</b> header compression <b>mode,</b> and no <b>IP</b> header compression would be performed. An algorithm is proposed to enable IP header compression in COTS routers on a simplex link with no negotiation or with a one-way messaging. In doing so, COTS routers can enter <b>IP</b> header compression <b>mode</b> without the need to handshake through a bidirectional link as required by FRF. 20. This technique would spoof the routers locally and thereby allow the routers to enter into <b>IP</b> header compression <b>mode</b> without having the negotiations between routers actually occur. The spoofing function is conducted by a frame relay adapter (also COTS) with the capability to generate control messages according to the FRF. 20 descriptions. Therefore, negotiation is actually performed between the FRF. 20 adapter and the connecting COTS router locally and never occurs over the space link. Through understanding of the handshaking protocol described by FRF. 20, the necessary FRF. 20 negotiations messages can be generated to control the connecting router, not only to turn on IP header compression but also to adjust the compression parameters. The FRF. 20 negotiation (or control) message is composed in the FRF. 20 adapter by interpreting the incoming router request message. Many of the fields are simply transcribed from request to response while the control field indicating response and type are modified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Recent {{research}} has shown that capturing a scene using several cameras has many advantages over traditional single viewpoint or stereo capture. Here, we focus on multicamera systems using Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> as the <b>mode</b> of communication. As these networks of cameras grow in size, the problem of handling the immense amount of data they are capable of producing becomes an important problem. Our goal is to build a system consisting of many inexpensive cameras interconnected via an IP network and capable of rendering novel views in a distributed and bandwidth-minimizing fashion. The system should scale well as cameras are added to the network; we wish to design a system that is capable of handling on the order of 1000 cameras. The presented system utilizes in-network processing in order to minimize the amount of bandwidth needed. A novel data structure (the binmesh) is presented that enables us to efficiently aggregate representations of available views at each node. We present a working prototype of the system consisting of 16 cameras, as well as simulation results for networks of up to 1024 cameras. I...|$|R
