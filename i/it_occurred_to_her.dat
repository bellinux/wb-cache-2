60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as {{a rather}} drastic means {{to this end}} that she might commit suicide.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} did not need a suit, and that the order might have been hard to explain to Kennicott.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you saying?" [...] she cried, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at {{last that}} Richard was afraid. He was a coward! She felt {{as she would}} faint.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} in that, but I can't accept without knowing my position, and I would not utter {{a word to}} disturb my mother till <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of herself." ...|$|R
60|$|She looks puzzled, casting {{about in}} <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> find a definition, when <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> {{is easier to}} point out the {{substantial}} object itself, massive against the dark-blue sky and the early stars.|$|R
60|$|He spoke quickly, {{his tone}} was full of nervous passion. <b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> doubt him.|$|R
6000|$|... "How is it possible?" [...] cried Emma, {{turning her}} glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that he might}} have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} had said enough. [...] "What a dignity that old gold-fish has!" [...] she remarked. [...] "He waves his tail--as {{if he were a}} beadle waving little boys out of church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, whativer is the matter, sister?" [...] said Mrs. Tulliver. She was not {{an imaginative}} woman, but <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the large toilet-glass in sister Pullet's best bedroom was {{possibly}} broken for the second time.|$|E
60|$|An idea {{concerning}} {{this young man}} came into her mind, startling as all great ideas are at birth. The older it grew, the more she approved of it. She decided to put a few questions to him. She {{had a habit of}} questioning people, and <b>it</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that they might resent it. If <b>it</b> had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she would have done it just the same. She was like that.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after Joel's hospitalisation, Audrey meets Berenice Mason, a young, unattractive African American {{freelance}} {{photographer and}} visual artist who claims that Joel {{is the father}} of her four-year-old son Jamil. Audrey is incredulous at first but after seeing written proof realizes the woman is telling the truth. For Audrey, this revelation is more distressing than her husband's illness as <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> how little their relationship has been based on mutual trust and honesty: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> {{suddenly}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> try persuasion; and accordingly {{she whispered}} in his ear, {{with as much}} firmness and decision as she could summon-- ...|$|R
60|$|Picotee {{waited in}} her seat until <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she could escape the lady's-maid by going off into her father's pantry in her absence. But before this had been put into effect Menlove {{appeared}} again.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she wanted}} to go away. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> like a miracle, that she might go away into another world. She had felt so doomed up here in the eternal snow, as if there were no beyond.|$|E
60|$|Allie lied. Her {{first thought}} was to lead them astray as to her skill with a horse; and then <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that if she rode Fresno's saddle {{there might be an}} {{opportunity}} to use the gun.|$|E
60|$|How could <b>it</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{examine the}} letter, {{to look at}} it {{critically}} as a profession of love? Her whole soul was possessed by the fact that a fuller life was opening before her: she was a neophyte about to enter on a higher grade of initiation. She was going to have room for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and pressure of her own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the world's habits.|$|R
60|$|That {{would have}} ended it. As {{a matter of fact}} that did end it five minutes past eleven. <b>It</b> hadn't <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> before.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as <b>it</b> did to him, {{that the}} {{kindness}} {{might have come}} sooner. 'I only hope you like it,' she added, after a pause.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} she saw Rachel redden; for she remembered silly {{things she had}} said, and also, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she treated this {{exquisite}} woman rather badly, for Mrs. Dalloway had said that she loved her husband.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise hesitated; {{then she}} hung up the {{receiver}} without reply. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the hotel office was a public place and that the telephone girl {{would be likely to}} yell out the number for all to overhear.|$|E
6000|$|She {{crept into}} Dave Dyer's. Dave {{held up his}} arms with, [...] "Don't shoot! I surrender!" [...] She smiled, but <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that for nearly five years Dave had kept up this game of pretending that she {{threatened}} his life.|$|E
50|$|Far way on a {{tropical}} island resort, Preston and Alex lounge {{back on a}} beach. Alex however is unsettled - her memory then triggered by the pop of the champagne cork - and she realises it was Gabe Preston who murdered her husband. Looking down to reveal the wedding ring she now wears as Mrs. Alex Preston, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Preston now not only {{has access to the}} entire fortune, but that she is unable to testify against him because of marital privilege.|$|R
50|$|Sophie {{is doing}} her driving test when <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the {{bracelet}} {{she thought her}} father sent her was not from him, but from Cap. All the things she said and did to him and {{all he did was}} respond in kindness. As soon as she passes her test she drives to Garland, determined to take Cap to the Halloween Bash. Cap has had the same idea and {{a few miles from the}} commune they meet each other. Jumping into Sophie's car, they drive to Claverage Middle School.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> {{had never}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Sidney might {{possibly}} marry a plain woman.|$|R
60|$|She {{was about}} winded when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to try working the dugout {{into the stream}} by loading the stern with ballast and then rocking the bow back and forth along the bank until the craft {{eventually}} worked itself into the river.|$|E
60|$|Alora {{stood by}} the door, irresolute, {{wondering}} what to do. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that she was not}} much afraid of Janet Orme. She had been trapped in order to bleed her father of money; it was all her father's fault-- his fault and Janet's.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{instantly}} {{that the}} more obvious remedy of sending another driver had been already discussed and rejected by them. Yet, when her own driver appeared a moment afterwards, she ascended to her seat with some dignity and a slight increase of color.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had given}} <b>her</b> time, however, <b>to</b> produce at last {{something}} that, <b>it</b> visibly <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> might pass. [...] "As soon as I {{was not with}} you--I mean with you personally--you never had my sympathy." ...|$|R
50|$|As with This Morning With Richard Not Judy and later, As <b>It</b> <b>Occurs</b> <b>To</b> Me, <b>Herring</b> {{made the}} show's title in to an {{unwieldy}} acronym, which was repeated by the audience {{every time it}} was said.|$|R
6000|$|... “She’s {{much more}} lonely with me. We’re perpetually having differences. Barb’s dreadfully vexed because I like America instead of—instead of—” And Lady Agatha paused a moment; for <b>it</b> just <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that this might}} be treacherous.|$|R
6000|$|But Lydia {{would not}} look at the lancer's horse. [...] "Paradise!" [...] she heard Skene exclaim just then with scornful incredulity. [...] "Ain't it likely?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that if he was {{alluding}} to his own chance of arriving there, it was not likely.|$|E
60|$|Ughtred was {{approaching}} with her father, and watching him <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{for the first}} time how well his new part in life would become him. He was tall and broad, and he moved with the free, easy dignity of a soldier accustomed to command.|$|E
60|$|Jill {{drew a deep}} breath. The Stop-and-Go sign swung round again. She {{crossed the}} avenue, and set out once more to find Nelly Bryant. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> five minutes later, that a really {{practical}} and quick-thinking girl would have noted {{the number of the}} limousine.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> next <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} could not go alone into that castle with just Gonzaga and the men he was about to enrol. His answer came with a {{promptness}} that showed he had considered, also, that.|$|R
60|$|Alison was {{far from}} pleased with this confession, but while she {{considered}} <b>it</b> another point <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is frightfully cold; and I don't {{see how we}} are going, {{for both}} those caravans are brimful,' croaked Lavinia, chafing her purple nose, and wishing <b>it</b> had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> buy a muff before going to sunny Italy.|$|R
