5|$|Through his frenetic {{activity}} {{since coming}} to the throne, Philip had successfully shored up the Macedonian situation, defeating or making peace with Macedon's <b>erstwhile</b> enemies, whilst securing most of Macedon's borders, and revitalising and retraining his army.|$|E
5|$|Wizkid became {{engulfed in}} rifts with several artists {{including}} his <b>erstwhile</b> boss Banky W and former label mate Skales. Other artists include Davido, Dammy Krane, Saeon, Tonto Dikeh, Samklef and blogger Linda Ikeji.|$|E
5|$|Also {{interested}} in Rajasaurus is Aliya Babi (of the <b>erstwhile</b> royal family of Balasinore), {{who became a}} dinosaur enthusiast after closely watching the efforts made by GSI at Rahioli to unearth the fossils, and made efforts to promote dinosaur tourism to Rahioli in order to showcase its {{millions of years of}} dinosaur heritage. She also set up a small museum at her hotel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola offered his commiserations {{to each of}} Manchester United's players, while former Manchester United defender Gerard Piqué talked with his <b>erstwhile</b> teammates. Both teams then retreated to {{either end of the}} stadium to applaud their fans.|$|E
5|$|Mangalorean Catholics (Konkani: Kodialchein Katholik) are an ethno-religious {{community}} of Roman Catholics following the Latin Rite from the Mangalore Diocese (<b>erstwhile</b> South Canara district) on the southwestern coast of Karnataka, India. They are Konkani people and speak the Konkani language.|$|E
5|$|Since January 1691 Marlborough {{had been}} in contact with the exiled JamesII in Saint-Germain, anxious to obtain the <b>erstwhile</b> King's pardon for deserting him in 1688a pardon {{essential}} for the success of his future career in the not altogether unlikely event of a Jacobite restoration.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{finally reached}} the Virginia shore near Machodoc Creek before dawn on April 23. There, they made contact with Thomas Harbin, whom Booth had {{previously}} brought into his <b>erstwhile</b> kidnapping plot. Harbin took Booth and Herold to another Confederate agent in the area named William Bryant who supplied them with horses.|$|E
5|$|After India's {{independence}} in 1947, {{the territory of}} the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several <b>erstwhile</b> princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state. Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State. In April 1950, Municipal limits of Bombay were expanded by merging the Bombay Suburban District and Bombay City to form the Greater Bombay Municipal Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their <b>erstwhile</b> colleagues to fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E

5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, <b>erstwhile</b> member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|In 1199, Tamar's armies led by two Christianised Kurdish generals, Zak'are and Ivane Zakarid-Mkhargrzeli, {{dislodged}} the Shaddadid dynasty from Ani, the <b>erstwhile</b> {{capital of}} the Armenian kingdom, and received it from the queen as their fief. From their base at Ani, the brothers surged ahead into the central Armenian lands, reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers: Bjni was taken in 1201 and Dvin fell in 1203.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its <b>erstwhile</b> ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not {{to wait until the}} larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
5|$|In October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the {{conclusion}} of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a preceding massacre of Christians by their <b>erstwhile</b> ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{some large}} {{district}}s {{were divided into}} smaller districts. On 1 March 1986, the district of 24 Parganas was bifurcated into two districts—the North 24 Parganas district and the South 24 Parganas district. On 1 April 1992, the West Dinajpur district was bifurcated into the Uttar Dinajpur district and the Dakshin Dinajpur district. On 1 January 2002, the <b>erstwhile</b> Midnapore district was bifurcated into the Purba Medinipur district and the Paschim Medinipur district.|$|E
5|$|Mannargudi {{was founded}} as an agraharam village by the Medieval Cholas during the 11th century. The town was {{subsequently}} ruled by various dynasties including the Medieval Chola king Rajadhiraja Chola (1018–1054 CE),Vijayanagar Empire, Delhi Sultanate, Thanjavur Nayaks, Thanjavur Marathas and the British Empire. Mannargudi {{was a part}} of the <b>erstwhile</b> Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district. The town is known for agriculture, metal working and weaving. The region around Mannargudi has considerable mineral deposits.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity {{now joined}} forces with its <b>erstwhile</b> enemy, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), and some protests were {{organized}} by both trade unions. The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over {{the state of the}} Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as policja) using batons and water cannons. Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wałęsa in the 1995 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, {{started to feel}} his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble he {{could not afford to}} take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and <b>erstwhile</b> owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|The Alupas {{ruled the}} <b>erstwhile</b> Dakshina Kannada region between the 8th and 14th century CE. Before 1860, Dakshina Kannada {{was part of}} a {{district}} called Kanara, which was under a single administration in the Madras Presidency. In 1860, the British split the area into South Kanara and North Kanara, the former being retained in the Madras Presidency, while the latter was made a part of Bombay Province in 1862. Kundapur taluk was earlier included in North Kanara but was re-included in South Kanara later.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{complex is}} located in the Tikamgarh {{district}} of Madhya Pradesh in the <b>erstwhile</b> state of Orchha. The fort complex is within an island formed by the confluence of the Betwa River and Jamni River in Orchha town. Approach to the complex from {{the eastern part of the}} market in the town is through a multiple arched bridge with 14 arches built in granite stones.|$|E
5|$|Theodore's {{drive into}} Macedonia disquieted another local strongman, Alexius Slav, ruler of Melnik. A sworn enemy of Boril, Alexius had been {{abandoned}} by his <b>erstwhile</b> ally, the Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders (r. 1205–16), who in 1213 allied himself with Bulgaria. Facing a possible attack by Theodore as well, Alexius now preferred to make common cause with him, and married a niece of Theodore's wife.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no records}} {{relating}} to {{the administration of the}} Mysore territory during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign (1399–1565). Signs of a well-organised and independent administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who {{is believed to have been}} sympathetic towards peasants (raiyats) who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time. The first sign that the kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins (Kanthirayi phanam) resembling those of the <b>erstwhile</b> Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar's rule.|$|E
5|$|After Gaza was {{occupied}} on 7 November, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (XXI Corps) rode through {{the ruins of}} Gaza to reach Beit Hanun at 13:00; and the 157th Brigade (52nd Division) began the infantry pursuit along the Mediterranean shore, to reach Sheikh Hasan by 12:15. In {{the centre of the}} line the Anzac Mounted Division found a gap on the eastern side of Sheria to begin their pursuit at daylight on 7 November. After being held up at Sheria, the Australian Mounted Division and the 60th (London) Division advanced to capture Huj on 8 November. By that evening, all the Ottoman positions which had made up the Gaza-to-Beersheba line had been captured, and the <b>erstwhile</b> defenders were in full retreat.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other <b>erstwhile</b> Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his <b>erstwhile</b> king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{decided that}} he could gain little by {{continuing}} to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, {{and that there were}} easier pickings for his army in the Kingdom of Poland. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners back over to his <b>erstwhile</b> coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch FrancisII, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for {{religious and ethnic}} minorities, and limit {{the powers of the}} government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the <b>erstwhile</b> USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, <b>erstwhile</b> allies of the Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|Mansur was {{dismissed}} in 1579 {{and replaced by}} his son Muhammad, who was imprisoned by the authorities in 1584 for alleged involvement in a looting raid against an Istanbul-bound caravan. He was restored to Keserwan in 1585 and was given tax collection authority over the rural districts of Tripoli Eyalet; this brought him into conflict with the Sayfa clan, the Assafs' <b>erstwhile</b> Turkmen clients, one of whose members, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa, was governor of Tripoli. The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in Akkar. Afterward, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa married Muhammad's widow and inherited the Assaf realm.|$|E
5|$|Once back in {{northern}} Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, {{while many of}} his <b>erstwhile</b> aides were captured and executed. Nothing is known of him {{for the next three}} years, although a short remark by a chronicler seems to indicate that he resurfaced and led another armed rebellion during the last months of Anastasius's life. When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by Justin I, the comes excubitorum (commander of the imperial bodyguard). The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of <b>erstwhile</b> Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the <b>erstwhile</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, {{but it is not}} clear whether Philip agreed to this. By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their <b>erstwhile</b> allies, and they would now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the <b>erstwhile</b> rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{suffered}} incursions from Mughals {{towards the}} end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, the city emerged as an important trading town, with maritime trade contacts with Mecca and Basra. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century with the first-ever Indian railway line beginning operations between Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in 1853. The city became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century and was the epicentre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha of 1919 and Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946. After India's independence in 1947, the territory of Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several <b>erstwhile</b> princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Bombay State.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{effort by}} Someshvara IV {{to rebuild the}} Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After {{the fall of the}} Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas {{continued}} warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time. This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western Deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the <b>erstwhile</b> Chola empire.|$|E
