Historically, the MEI concept was used for dose compliance at the Savannah River Site (SRS) using adult dose coefficients and adult male <b>usage</b> <b>parameters.</b> In the future, SRS plans to use the representative person concept for dose compliance to members of the public. The representative person dose will be based on the reference person dose coefficients from the DOE Derived Concentration Technical Standard (DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011) and on <b>usage</b> <b>parameters</b> (at the 95 th percentile of national and regional data) specific to SRS for the reference person. <b>Usage</b> <b>parameters</b> in the 50 th percentile will be used in calculating dose to the "typical" person for determining collective doses. <b>Usage</b> <b>parameters</b> were determined for the following pathways: inhalation, ingestion of water, meat, produce, grains, freshwater fish, saltwater invertebrates, and dairy. External exposures from submersion in air and water and from ground shine also are included in the respective dose coefficients. The reference intake for air, water, meat, dairy, freshwater fish, saltwater invertebrates, produce (fruits and vegetables), and grains for the 95 th percentile are 17. 4 m³ /day, 2. 19 L/day, 220. 6 g/day, 674 cm³/day, 66. 4 g/day, 23. 0 g/day, 633. 4 g/day (448. 5 g/day and 631. 7 g/day) and 251. 3 g/day respectively.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} model-based {{approach}} to synthesizing insulin infusion pump <b>usage</b> <b>parameters</b> against varying meal scenarios and physiological conditions. Insulin infusion pumps {{are commonly used}} by type- 1 diabetic patients to control their blood glucose levels. The amounts of insulin to be infused are calculated based on parameters such as insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios and correction factors {{that need to be}} calibrated carefully for each patient. Frequent and careful calibration of these parameters is essential for avoiding complications such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. In this paper, we propose to synthesize optimal parameters for meal bolus calculation starting from models of the patient’s insulin-glucose regulatory system and the infusion pump. Various off-the-shelf global optimization techniques are used to search for parameter values that minimize a penalty function defined over the predicted glucose sensor readings. The penalty function “rewards ” glucose levels that lie within the prescribed ranges and “penalizes ” the occurrence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. We evaluate our approach using a model of the insulin-glucose regulatory system proposed by Dalla Man et al. Using this model, we compare various strategies for optimizing pump <b>usage</b> <b>parameters</b> for a virtual population of in-silico patients. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} two {{intelligent}} leaky bucket algorithms for sustainable-cell-rate <b>usage</b> <b>parameter</b> control of multimedia transmission in {{asynchronous transfer mode}} net-works. One is the fuzzy leaky bucket algorithm, in which a fuzzy increment controller (FIC) is incorporated with the conventional leaky bucket algorithm; {{the other is the}} neural fuzzy leaky bucket algorithm, where a neural fuzzy increment controller (NFIC) is added with the conventional leaky bucket algorithm. Both the FIC and the NFIC properly choose the long-term mean cell rate and the short-term mean cell rate as input variables to intelli-gently determine the increment value. Simulation results show that both intelligent leaky bucket algorithms have significantly outperformed the conventional leaky bucket algorithm, by re-sponding about 160 % faster when taking control actions against a nonconforming connection while reducing as much as 50 % of the queueing delay experienced by a conforming connection. In addition, the neural fuzzy leaky bucket algorithm outperforms the fuzzy leaky bucket algorithm, in aspects of three performance measures such as selectivity, responsiveness, and queueing delay, especially when the traffic flow is bursty, dynamic, and nonsta-tionary.
