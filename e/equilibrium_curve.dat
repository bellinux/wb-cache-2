40|$|Oxygen <b>equilibrium</b> <b>curves</b> and the {{relationships}} between the partial pressure of CO 2 and pH were determined for the haemolymph of the arachnids Eurypelma californicum, Pandinus imperator and Cupiennius salei. A new type of experimental apparatus was constructed, tested and used to make these measurements on small undiluted cell-free haemolymph samples. Most of its components were made in our workshop and were inexpensive. The apparatus proved to be very reliable as demonstrated by control (oxygen concentration) experiments. In previous reports on O 2 <b>equilibrium</b> <b>curves</b> of E. californicum haemocyanin, Tris–HCl buffer was used to set the pH, whereas in our experiments, pH was adjusted by altering the partial pressure of CO 2. The O 2 concentration measurements demonstrate an increase in oxygen affinity of E. californicum haemocyanin when using Tris–HCl buffer. The position and shape of the O 2 <b>equilibrium</b> <b>curves</b> of E. californicum and P. imperator haemocyanin show a distinct dependency on pH. Oxygen affinity is lower in E. californicum and cooperativity changes with pH in E. californicum, but not in P. imperator.
