5|$|Aristo {{was born}} in Jakarta in 1976. As a child, he became {{interested}} in film {{when he and his}} family went to the movie theatre together; in an interview with Tabloid Nova, he recalled that one of the first films <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a comedy starring Warkop. After beginning junior high school in 1988, he began to go to the theatres to watch films on his own. Despite his enjoyment of film, he was initially active in an indie band.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> {{a lack of}} drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E

60|$|Cutting {{the traces}} he rode off, taking a course {{to the north}} in his ignorance of the country; but, {{discovering}} his mistake, he turned about, and the first persons <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> those of our party.|$|R
25|$|During this time, Tabitha King was {{inspired}} to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel Lisey's Story (2006).|$|E
25|$|While he {{understood}} the jurisdictional issue was most important to them and planned to discuss it first, Gottesman told the justices, he hoped {{to spend some time}} on the facts of the case. He conceded that the implied cause of action <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> not necessary to establish jurisdiction. Rather, it had been a response to the school district's late argument {{that it was not a}} person under Section 1983, and that he should have cross-appealed Hogan's ruling, in which he dismissed the case against the individual members as defendants, but did not because he did not expect that issue to arise again.|$|E
25|$|According to Homer, Idomeneus {{reached his}} house safe and sound. Another {{tradition}} later formed. After the war, Idomeneus's ship hit a horrible storm. Idomeneus promised Poseidon {{that he would}} sacrifice the first living thing he saw {{when he returned home}} if Poseidon would save his ship and crew. The first living thing <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> his son, whom Idomeneus duly sacrificed. The gods were angry at his murder of his own son and they sent a plague to Crete. His people sent him into exile to Calabria in Italy, and then to Colophon, in Asia Minor, where he died. Among the lesser Achaeans very few reached their homes.|$|E

25|$|Snowed in, Lockwood is grudgingly {{allowed to}} stay and is shown to a bedchamber where he notices books and {{graffiti}} left by a former inhabitant named Catherine. He falls asleep and has a nightmare in which he sees the ghostly Catherine trying to enter through the window. He cries out in fear, rousing Heathcliff, who rushes into the room. Lockwood is convinced that what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window and opens it, hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} and fourth seasons of the show, Magneto dedicates himself to {{preventing}} the awakening of the mutant Apocalypse, although all his attempts fail and upon Apocalypse's awakening he is transformed into one of his Four Horsemen after he is thought to have been killed by Apocalypse. He is freed of this enslavement in the finale episode Ascension: Part Two, and is last seen being helped by his two children. In the final moments of the episode, Charles Xavier reveals that he witnessed the future in the mind of Apocalypse, and among the visions <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Magneto becoming an ally of the X-Men and training the New Mutants, like he did in the comics.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1847 crisis, invalids {{were placed}} in {{hospitals}} while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left {{lying on the ground}} without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down for a moment, and died'. Many children were orphaned.|$|E

50|$|A 20 {{years old}} Ariel Lambert, after a suicide attempt, is sent {{with her mother}} to a small summer town {{in the state of}} Buenos Aires. Ariel arrives in winter, a time of the year in which the village is almost deserted. From his room {{and with the help of}} a telescope, Ariel witness a man taking {{children}} into his house, children that will not ever come out again. Ariel tries to call the police, but given his precarious mental state, they will not take him seriously. Determined to prove what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> true, <b>he</b> set forth in search for the evidence required to prove that what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> not only part of his imagination but a horrible truth.|$|R

25|$|In {{his early}} years he worked with twelve-tone technique, for example in his First Symphony and Violin Concerto of 1947. Sadler's Wells Ballet visited Hamburg in 1948; this {{inspired}} Henze to write a choreographic poem, Ballett-Variationen, which he completed in 1949. The first ballet <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Frederick Ashton's Scènes de Ballet. He wrote a letter of appreciation to Ashton, introducing himself as a 22-year-old composer. The next time he wrote to Ashton he enclosed the score of his Ballett-Variationen, which he hoped Ashton might find of interest. This work was first performed in Düsseldorf in September 1949 and staged {{for the first time}} in Wuppertal in 1958. In 1948 he became musical assistant at the Deutscher Theater in Konstanz, where his first opera , based on the work of Cervantes, was created.|$|E
25|$|In the Echtra Neraí ('The Adventure of Nera'), King Ailill of Connacht {{sets his}} retinue {{a test of}} bravery on Samhain night. He offers a prize to whoever can make it to a gallows and tie a band around a hanged man's ankle. Each {{challenger}} is thwarted by demons and runs back to the king's hall in fear. However, Nera succeeds, and the dead man then asks for a drink. Nera carries him {{on his back and}} they stop at three houses. They enter the third, where the dead man drinks and spits it on the householders, killing them. Returning, Nera sees a fairy host burning the king's hall and slaughtering those inside. He follows the host through a portal into the Otherworld. Nera learns that what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> only a vision of what will happen the next Samhain unless something is done. He is able to return to the hall and warns the king.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

6000|$|... "As soon as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> suspected, Prescott ran away," [...] he continued. [...] "That must count against him. If {{he had had}} any motive {{except the}} wish to escape, he would have {{mentioned}} it." ...|$|R
500|$|Rogoziński {{observes that}} Morgan is {{probably}} the [...] "best-known pirate" [...] because of Exquemelin's book, although, Cordingly writes that Exquemelin bore a grudge over what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Morgan's theft of the bounty from Panama. His experience explains [...] "why he painted such a black picture of Morgan and portrayed him as a cruel and unscrupulous villain", which subsequently affected historians' view of Morgan. Allen observes that, partly because of Exquemelin, Morgan has not been well-served by historians. He cites the examples of the historians whose biographies were so flawed they wrote that Morgan either died in London, prison or the Tower of London. These included Charles Leslie, A New History of Jamaica (1739), Alan Gardner, History of Jamaica (1873), Hubert Bancroft, History of Central America (1883) and Howard Pyle's work, Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates (compiled in 1921).|$|E
500|$|Although Taylor and US {{military}} commander General William Westmoreland wanted Khánh out, the pro-Diệm political ideology expressed by Thảo's supporters alienated them, as they {{feared that the}} coup plotters would destabilize and polarize the country if they took power. The Americans worried that Phat and Thảo could galvanize support for Khánh through their extreme views, which {{had the potential to}} provoke large-scale sectarian divisions, playing {{into the hands of the}} communists and hindering wider American objectives. They were also worried by Thảo's intention to remove Quát and the civilian government, whom <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> [...] "too susceptible to Buddhist peacemongering". The U.S. saw civilian participation in governance as a necessity. They worried that a Khánh victory would enhance his prestige, so they wanted to see some third force emerge and defeat both the Thảo and Khánh factions. Westmoreland and Taylor decided to work for the failure of both Thảo and Khánh, and helped organize US advisers for the purpose.|$|E
500|$|Barker {{was born}} on 25 September 1929 in Bedford, Bedfordshire, the only son of Leonard (known as [...] "Tim") and Edith (known as [...] "Cis") Barker. Barker's elder sister Vera was born in 1926 and his younger sister Eileen was born in 1933. His father was a clerk for Shell-Mex, and this job saw the family move to Church Cowley Road in Cowley, Oxfordshire when Barker was four. Barker's biographer Bob McCabe {{described}} his childhood as [...] "a happy time, marred by no ructions or family tensions, apart from the occasional wet sock." [...] As a child, Barker enjoyed dressing up, particularly in his father's pierrot outfit, as well as films, comics, and animals. He developed a love of the theatre, often attending plays with his family. The first play <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Cottage to Let and he once skipped school to see Laurence Olivier in Henry V. He frequently stood outside stage doors to collect autographs, his first being the actress Celia Johnson.|$|E

500|$|The {{next morning}} Sherlock realises [...] "hound" [...] {{may be an}} acronym rather than a word. The pair run into DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) who was sent by Mycroft {{to keep an eye}} on Sherlock. They {{interrogate}} the innkeepers about a past order for meat that John has spotted, which struck him as odd for a vegetarian restaurant. The innkeepers kept a dog on the moor to boost the tourist trade, but assure the investigators they had put it down. This explanation satisfies Lestrade but not Sherlock, who insists the dog <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> monstrous. Calling Mycroft, Sherlock gains access to Baskerville again. Searching the lower levels of the genetics labs, John finds himself trapped and then hears growling which he assumes is the hound. Locking himself in an empty cage, he calls Sherlock, who rescues him. Sherlock deduces a chemical weapon designed to trigger violent hallucinations was responsible. Retreating into his [...] "mind palace", a memory technique, Sherlock realises [...] "Liberty" [...] and [...] "In" [...] stands for Liberty, Indiana. After viewing confidential files, he sees [...] "H.O.U.N.D." [...] was a secret C.I.A. project aimed at creating a hallucinatory anti-personnel chemical weapon, but the project was abandoned several years before. Sherlock realises Frankland, who participated in the project, has continued it in secret.|$|E
500|$|Malachy later {{witnessed}} Mercedes and Calvin kissing {{but did not}} interrupt them. Wallace {{felt this}} was because he truly loved Mercedes and had accepted that [...] "his life is much better with Mercedes in it". Whittle explained that Malachy tested Mercedes and Calvin {{because he wanted to}} discover if [...] "what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a one-off or more serious". The pair failed the test and Mercedes, fearing that Malachy knew the truth, told Calvin that they had to end their affair, [...] "but they simply can't stay away from each other". He added that the relationship could become more serious for Calvin as [...] "he's in danger of really falling for her". Mercedes began to develop feelings for Calvin who did not expect Mercedes to develop [...] "such deep feelings" [...] for him. When Calvin rejected Mercedes she informed Calvin's sister Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel) that Calvin left Sasha's then boyfriend Warren to die in a fire; Sasha responded to the revelation by throwing Calvin out of their home. Not being able to [...] "get past what happened with Warren", Calvin and Carmel decide to end their relationship. Calvin confronted Mercedes, who [...] "tells him that he's ruined her life and warns that she's going to do the same to him".|$|E
2500|$|Jindal's pre-2001 {{writings}} {{include several}} {{articles in the}} New Oxford Review, one of which later made news during his 2003 gubernatorial race. [...] In that 1994 article titled [...] "Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare", Jindal described the {{events leading up to}} an apparent exorcism of a friend and how he felt unable to help her at the time. However, Jindal questioned whether what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> actually an example of [...] "spiritual warfare".|$|E
6000|$|Conrad looked confusedly around, and {{the same}} voice said again, [...] "Mr. Dryfoos!" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that it <b>was</b> a lady {{speaking}} to him from a coupe beside the curbing, and then <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that it <b>was</b> Miss Vance.|$|R

5000|$|The Times {{described}} it as [...] "It was a depressing tour streaked with black humour but Theroux seemed out of depth analysing what <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> at his best getting to know and under {{the skin of his}} subjects." ...|$|R
