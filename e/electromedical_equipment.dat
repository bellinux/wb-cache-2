50|$|Three years previously, in 1844, Werner von Siemens {{put one of}} his inventions to use {{for medical}} {{purposes}} for the first time, using electricity to treat his brother Friedrich for tooth pain. After teaming up with Halske, the new company’s products included <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment.</b> In Erlangen, Erwin Moritz Reiniger laid the cornerstone for Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall, a company specializing in medical technology.|$|E

BPL concentrated 100% on Healthcare Business group {{which has its own}} manufacturing of <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment</b> such as electrocardiography apparatus and patient monitors, with a well-established distribution and service network across the country. The company focuses on delivering to the customers a high degree of support reliability and has rebranded the service offering under the [...] "Sure Care" [...] brand.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{proposed}} method for mapping the competencies for innovation required by Brazilian manufacturers of <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment</b> is to help revert these companies ’ and Brazil’s relative competitive disadvantage in the global medical, dental, hospital and laboratory equipment market. This industry has a growing structural trade deficit, which has {{a major impact on}} the country’s future health policies. A critical analysis was conducted of a study by Alves (2005) {{in the light of the}} specific features of the business environment in which <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers operate, which were identified through a literature review. As a result, a new list of basic competencies adapted particularly to these target companies ’ needs was formulated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{have tested}} the output {{intensity}} of 9 ultrasonic therapeutic devices {{according to the}} safety requirements stated in the relevant international and at the national standard. Our results show that nearly 40 % of transducer heads are not operating properly and another 46 % should be recalibrated. Through this example {{we would like to}} point out the need for regular preventive maintenance of all <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment</b> by profes-sional engineering staff – clinical engineers. Preventive maintenance is the first and irreplacable step in safety assurance...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the electronics industry requires its transition to sustainable production patterns, {{as defined by the}} European directives WEEE, RoHS, and the National Policy on Solid Waste. In 2010, the group began a national project whose purpose is to support sustainability with a focus on the triple bottom line Brazilian electronics industry. The implementation of these proposals began with the implementation of a pilot project with nine companies of <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment,</b> chosen because they are technology intensive, and require exporters suit environmental regulations. This paper aims to present the main results obtained in the studies with these nine companies in the period Apr/ 2011 Mar/ 2012 regarding the suitability of its products, processes, management systems and supply chains. The study was divided into three stages: an assessment to identify general aspects of each organization, a thorough assessment to understand the characteristics of each organization ahead of the general characteristics of the group analyzed and a detailed diagnosis, performed individually during visits in companies. The main findings were that the waste management and reverse logistics associated are still incipient, the products still have dangerous substances and supply chain is still very poorly prepared for the challenges. The level of employment of employees and costs associated with the adequacy of its products and processes, constitute the two biggest problems for companies fit the relevant environmental legislation. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} electromagnetic interference phenomena occurring between <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment</b> and modern telecommunication devices, with a particular attention to W-LAN network terminals. The legislative terms have been considered concerning electromagnetic compatibility in medical devices; a set of simulations have been performed in a realistic model of hospital scenery to test the effective levels of electric field over medical devices due to some typical wireless sources. Once that the interference level have been fixed, an accurate planning is advisable by taking into account all the electromagnetic sources present in the environment (at least {{the ones that are}} known). This activity is very useful in determining the optimum number of base stations for radio coverage, maintaining, at the same time, an overall low level of the total field. Additionally, by pursuing a proper planning of the network, we are able to take into account if some rooms contain susceptible equipment so that electromagnetic field can be preferably directed towards other rooms. Due to the modern computing resources, this activity (experimental part of the project) can be easily carried out by performing realistic simulations (final section of the work), followed by a measurement campaign. Finally, we point out that the information obtained by the radio planning activity can be used to rearrange the disposition of devices and equipment within the medical environment to reduce the probability of interference...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{impact caused to}} the {{environment}} by the electronic products disposal has been turning {{the environment}}al regulations a global trend regarding the proper management of Electrical & Electronic Equipment Waste (REEE). The Brazilian government, aware of this need, developed and promulgated in 2010 the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS), which gives the responsability to the companies of several economic branches and other supply chain participants for the final destination of the goods when they {{reach the end of}} their life cycle or cannot be used by the organizational user anymore. Due to these new demands, a project started in 2010 resulting from the partnership between Renato Archer Information Technology Center (CTI) and the Brazilian Association of the Industry of Medical Equipments, Dental, Hospital and Laboratories (ABIMO), called CTI-ABIMO Project, to support these companies to be adjusted to the new environmental regulations. The focused branch uses technology intensively, it is an exporter one and it consists mainly of small and medium national companies. The scope {{of this study is to}} report the fundamentals, methods and results of CTI-ABIMO project to support pilot companies to be adjusted to the PNRS requirements in order to keep their competitiveness and contributing to the sustainability of the Brazilian <b>electromedical</b> <b>equipment</b> industries. The specificities of this company branch for the REEE management were also considered, including: long-life equipments compared with other electronic products, predominance of hospitals and clinics as final customers and significant portion of government purchases on the total of the branch sales...|$|E
