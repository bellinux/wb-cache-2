Lynchburg Technology Center for metallurgical examinations. The primary objective of these examinations was to characterize the as-found condition of the head, which contained a large cavity caused by boric acid corrosion and examine the nozzles for evidence of cracking. Examinations included visual inspections, <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing,</b> scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), metallography, and Knoop microhardness. The axial crack found on the uphill side of Alloy 600 CRDM nozzle # 3 was typical of primary water stress-corrosion cracking (PWSCC). This cracking initiated on the nozzle l.

40|$|Investment cast {{aerospace}} {{components are}} prone to defects related to solidification process. The hollow columnar-grained aero engine Vane casting, being discussed in this paper, suffers further from extraneous defects such as inclusions, core shift and resultant dimensional deviations. Due to its design complexity and stringent specifications, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of this component is extremely difficult and critical. Complete inspection, employing different non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, has been aimed to assess full inspectability and reliability of the components. Radiography, visual / grain size inspection / fluorescent <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>test</b> (DPT) after macro etching of the components, and ultrasonic wall thickness measurement (with an accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm) of the aerofoil are the techniques utilized for complete inspectability.

The presence of cracks was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopic observation. Microscopic examination carried out on the cross section of the blades revealed that the cracks were extended from the cooling passage up to the surface. Fractographic study showed that there was multiple fatigue crack initiation on the inner surface.

40|$|A cracked {{engine mount}} of an {{aircraft}} {{was sent to}} the laboratory to analyze the cause of failure. <b>Dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>test</b> indicated a crack at one of the weld joints. Investigation revealed this crack to be a fatigue crack. The fatigue crack had initiated at the weld – parent metal interface and propagated circumferentially about 12 mm. Microstructural study showed martensitic structure in the heat affected zone (HAZ). This was further corroborated by high hardness in this region. A section of the tube close to the HAZ was found to have low hardness (170 - 210 HV). This indicates improper heat treatment of the weld joint. It appears most probable that the abnormal microstructure in the HAZ and the low hardness of the tube adjacent to HAZ were responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. As per the specification, the tube should have hardness of about 270 HV...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{case study}} {{regarding}} frequent forced outages in an oil-fired power generating station due to failure of fire resistant fluid (FRF) piping of material ASTM A- 304.

Methods for finding and analyzing the cracks include nondestructive testing techniques such as visual <b>testing</b> (VT) and <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> (PT) along with that periodic monitoring after rectification of problem. The study revealed that pitting and pit to crack transitions were formed in stainless steel piping containing high pressure (system pressure 115 bars) fire resistant fluid. However, after replacement of piping the pitting and cracking reoccurred. It was observed that due to possible exposure to chlorinated moisture in surrounding environment pitting was formed which then transformed into cracks.

40|$|Cyclic {{thermal shock}} tests have been {{performed}} on a RPV nozzle (HDR) with cracks to apply and assess technics available for the description of real cracks (non-destructive testing, fracture mechanics calculation). The application of <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing,</b> potential drop testing and acoustic emission measurements on the nozzle is considered. Some experimental results are described: assessments have been possible {{on the basis of}} destructive testing (fractography). The determination of crack parameters for correlating these NDT results with fracture mechanics data are discussed such as crack depth, a, cracklength, crack area and crack growth. Crack growth is considered over a period of cycles, a(N), per cycle, da/dN, and during a cycle, da/dt. A selection of numerical NDT findings is presented and compared with the results of fracture mechanics calculations. Conclusions: 1. The crack dimensions found by NDT are not quite conservative (fractography); 2. As the performed fracture mechanics calculations overestimated the crack growth advanced NDT data like da/dN indicate starting points for improvements of the calculations (influence of mean stress); 3. Although acoustic emission measurements give no quantitative fracture mechanics parameters qualitative correlations yield decisive understanding of dominating crack growth mechanisms (corrosion); 4. Reversely different comparisons between acoustic emission fracture mechanics results seem to confirm the classification of acoustic emission signals. (IZFP...|$|R
40|$|Among layer {{manufacturing}} techniques, Laser Consolidation (LC) {{finds its}} ideal application {{in the production}} of thin-walled metal parts for industrial niches characterised by high innovation and product complexity. To fully exploit the technological potential, developments must be made to assess LC’s repeatability and reliability. Previous studies proved that high strength parts of fine microstructure are obtained if appropriate build strategies are used. The aim of this research is to analyse a racecar exhaust collector, built in Inconel by LC, relating the failure modes and microstructure to the construction plan. The exhaust collector component was built using a custom strategy and was run on a dynamometer before failing after approximately 1200 km. An investigation of the failure mechanism was carried out by a primary macroscopic analysis, aided by an X-ray control and <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>test.</b> Metallographic sections were then sampled from the critical areas to study the microstructure and relate it to the manufacturing process. Results proved that the distribution of primary microcracks associated with internal residual stresses caused by the build strategy and aggravated by differential shrinkage during the test thermocycles was responsible for ultimate failure. This issue was a result of build strategy and the non-coaxial laser head, therefore, alternative pathways could be developed capable of removing most, if not all, of the contributory factors. The analysed case suggests that LC build strategy selection is as critical to ensure low cycle fatigue resistance as component design and confirms that LC is effective {{in the production of}} advanced technological parts with high geometrical complexity given the correct build strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the knowledge about non-destructive testing of adhesion of a coating to the steel substrate. Two technologies {{have been used for}} the deposition of the coating: the technology of conventional casting for the tin-base coating "Stanit" and the technology of thermal spray coating for the tin coating "Babbitt", copper-base coating CuSn 8 and for an NiAl interlayer. The above coating types have been compared using metallography, non-destructive ultrasonic and dye penetrant testing, X-ray diffraction, GD-OES depth profiling and energy-dispersive electron microanalysis. The following information has been collected that has to be sorted acording to the deposition technology used. For the evaluation of adhesion between the steel substrate and the coatings prepared by conventional casting, suitability of the ultrasound testing was proved, with the <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>test</b> as a supplementary method. Measurement parameters were defined for the ultrasonic testing. For te WAS technology (wire arc spraying), the non-destructive methods did not prove to be reasonably applicable in practice. The reason is that significant changes in the morphology of the structure occur in this technology. Layered structure with interfaces between the splatters of the coating, non-deformed particles and single layers of the coating results in a strong attenuation of the ultrasound waves. The coating exhibit a poor acoustic transmittion or no acoustic transmittion at all. results obtained by the non-destructive methods and other experimental methods used have been compared and a good agreement was found.

40|$|AbstractSpent fuel {{reprocessing}} for Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) requires a dissolver {{made of a}} material which is resistant to corrosion as the process involves nitric acid as the process medium. The focus was {{on the use of}} advanced materials with high performance in high concentrations (greater than 8 N) and high temperatures of nitric acid employed in the dissolver. The commercially available materials like SS 316 l, titanium, Ti – 5 % Ta, and Ti – 5 % Ta – 1. 8 % Nb were tried and the corrosion behavior of these materials was studied in detail. It was also decided to try out Zircaloy – 4 as the material of construction due to its excellent corrosion resistance in nitric acid environment. The specifications were stringent and the geometrical configurations of the assembly were very intricate. On accepting the challenge of fabricating the dissolver, NFC made different fixtures for electron beam (EB) welding and TIG welding. Trials were carried out for optimization of various operating parameter for EB welding & TIG welding process es, which were qualified by radiography, liquid <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing,</b> and metallographic, mechanical and chemical analys es. Finally the dissolver was subjected to helium leak test. The tests conducted at IGCAR with Zircaloy dissolver assembly revealed that Zircaloy- 4 exhibited the superior corrosion resistance over all other materials tried out so far for this purpose. The results clearly indicates that Zircaloy – 4 is a near-zero corrosion material in comparison to the other materials. It is thus demonstrated that the dissolver assembly for spent {{fuel reprocessing}} for Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) can be manufactured from Zircaloy - 4 on an industrial scale, with long life expectancy with near zero corrosion, employing EB & TIG welding processes...|$|R
40|$|Shear {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used in steel bridges to join the concrete deck and steel superstructure, providing a mechanism for shear transfer across the steel-concrete interface. The most common shear connector is the headed shear stud. In the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications on composite design, shear stud fatigue often governs over static strength, {{and a large number}} of shear connectors often result. This dissertation investigates headed shear stud fatigue capacities and demands, and provides insight into conservancies in existing design specifications through examination of existing high-traffic bridge performance. To investigate stud capacity, a total of six high-cycle fatigue tests are conducted on stud pushout specimens at low stress ranges and combined with existing experimental data to develop probabilistic S-N fatigue capacity curves. Results from composite push-out specimens tested at stress ranges between 4. 4 and 8. 7 ksi suggest a fatigue limit of 6. 5 ksi, which is near the existing limit of 7 ksi. Recommendations for modification of the existing AASHTO finite-life shear stud S-N fatigue capacity curve are proposed. In addition to experimental testing, a finite element parametric study considers the effects of stud pitch, girder depth, and girder span on shear flow demands. Results from the parametric study indicate that the shear forces within stud clusters are not captured by current AASHTO shear flow demand estimations. A new design method and updated formulation for predicting stud demands are presented. To examine high-traffic bridge performance, residual fatigue life is investigated by further fatigue testing, as well as magnetic particle inspection and <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> on two existing bridges. The lack of discovered fatigue cracks within the studs of the bridges investigated suggests that the shear stress range estimation in AASHTO specification is higher than what is actually experienced. This discrepancy is likely due to shear transfer through adhesion and friction, which are not considered in AASHTO design calculations. Fatigue tests from sections of the decommissioned bridge exceeded the design life expectancy of approximately 850, 000 cycles (at 11. 6 ksi) by over 2, 500, 000 cycles. This evidence further indicates that stud fatigue is an unlikely failure mode during service loading...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, focused on assessing the effectiveness of nondestructive examination (NDE) techniques for inspecting control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) nozzles and J-groove weldments. The primary objectives of this work are to provide information to the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{on the effectiveness of}} NDE methods as related to the in-service inspection of CRDM nozzles and J-groove weldments and to enhance the knowledge base of primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) through destructive characterization of the CRDM assemblies. Two CRDM assemblies were removed from service, decontaminated, and then used in a series of NDE and destructive examination (DE) measurements; this report addresses the following questions: 1) What did each NDE technique detect? 2) What did each NDE technique miss? 3) How accurately did each NDE technique characterize the detected flaws? 4) Why did the NDE techniques perform or not perform? Two CRDM assemblies including the CRDM nozzle, the J-groove weld, buttering, and a portion of the ferritic head material were selected for this study. This report focuses on a CRDM assembly that contained suspected PWSCC, based on in-service inspection data and through-wall leakage. The NDE measurements used to examine the CRDM assembly followed standard industry techniques for conducting in-service inspections of CRDM nozzles and the crown of the J-groove welds and buttering. These techniques included eddy current testing (ET), time-of-flight diffraction ultrasound, and <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing.</b> In addition, laboratory-based NDE methods were employed to conduct inspections of the CRDM assembly with particular emphasis on inspecting the J-groove weld and buttering. These techniques included volumetric ultrasonic inspection of the J-groove weld metal and visual testing via replicant material of the J-groove weld. The results from these NDE studies were used to guide the development of the destructive characterization plan. The NDE studies found several crack-like indications. The NDE and DE studies determined that one of these was a through-weld, radially oriented PWSCC crack in the wetted surface of the J-groove weld, located at the transition point between the weld and the buttering. The crack was 6 mm long on the surface and quickly grew to 25 mm long at a depth of 8 mm, covering the length of the weld between the penetration tube and the carbon steel. The NDE studies found that only ET was able to detect the through-weld crack. The crack was oriented poorly for the ultrasonic testing and was too tight for accurate <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>testing</b> or visual testing. The ET voltage response of the through-wall crack was 30 % of the response from a deep electrical discharge machined notch. Destructive examination showed the crack is PWSCC and that it initiated on the wetted surface, grew and expanded through the weld metal, and exited into the annulus. The crack was branched and discontinuous along its length...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with laser beam welding {{and its effect on}} size and microstructure of fusion zone then, on mechanical and corrosion properties of duplex stainless steel welded joints. In this regard, influence of different laser welding parameters was clarified. Both bead-on-plate and autogenously butt welded joints were made using carbon dioxide laser with a maximum output of 9 kW in the continuous wave mode. Welded joints were subjected to visual, <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> and radiography <b>tests</b> before sectioning it for different destructive tests. Accelerated corrosion test was carried out based on tafel plot technique. The results achieved in this investigation disclosed that welding parameters {{play an important role in}} obtaining satisfactory properties of welded joint. High laser power and/or high welding speed together with adjusting laser focused spot at specimen surface have produced welded joints with a remarkable decrease in fusion zone size and an acceptable weld profile with higher weld depth/width ratio. Besides, acceptable mechanical and corrosion properties were obtained. Using nitrogen as a shielding gas has resulted in improving mechanical and corrosion properties of welded joints in comparison with argon shielding. This is related to maintaining proper ferrite/austenite balance in both weld metal and HAZ in case of nitrogen shielding. As a conclusion, laser power, welding speed, defocusing distance and type of shielding gas combination have to be optimized for obtaining welded joints with acceptable profile as well as mechanical and corrosion properties...|$|R
