5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
25|$|According to Welch these revelations were {{accompanied}} by mysterious seizures, and the reports are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims. Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> from these messages.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Bernoulli {{was pleased}} by the {{similarity}} of Le Sage's model and <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> {{on the nature of}} gases. However, Bernoulli himself was the opinion that his own kinetic theory of gases was only a speculation, and likewise he regarded Le Sage's theory as highly speculative.|$|E

25|$|Following his death, a dossier was {{compiled}} by his friends detailing {{many of his}} achievements, recorded remarks and memories of him by distinguished officers and men who served with him during his lifetime. It also includes extracts from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> and writings. A copy of the dossier has been presented to the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon.|$|E
25|$|Friction arose between de Gaulle and Pétain over Le Soldat, {{a history}} of the French soldier which he had ghost-written and for which he wanted greater writing credit. He had written mainly {{historical}} material, but Pétain wanted to add a final chapter of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b> There was at least one stormy meeting late in 1926 after which de Gaulle was seen to emerge, white with anger, from Pétain’s office. In October 1926 he returned to his duties with the Headquarters of the Army of the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Charles Wheatstone {{was born}} in Barnwood, Gloucester. His father was a music-seller in the town, who moved to 128 Pall Mall, London, four years later, {{becoming}} a teacher of the flute. Charles, the second son, went to a village school, near Gloucester, and afterwards to several institutions in London. One of them was in Kennington, and kept by a Mrs. Castlemaine, who was astonished at his rapid progress. From another he ran away, but was captured at Windsor, {{not far from the}} theatre of his practical telegraph. As a boy he was very shy and sensitive, liking well to retire into an attic, without any other company than <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was looking}} after his {{daughter}} and Rupert with a grave, thoughtful face, and had evidently answered <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thought</b> rather than the old cavalier's remark.|$|R

500|$|A {{major theme}} of [...] "Box Cutter" [...] {{involves}} Walter's gradual change from an unwitting participant in a drug-dealing enterprise {{into a man}} more comfortable with {{a life of crime}} who embraces his darker side and becomes more proactively violent and dangerous. This development began during the latter episodes of the third season and would continue to be a major theme throughout the fourth season. The episode also introduced the ongoing theme of Jesse's moral decline and self guilt over his killing of Gale. Aaron Paul said of this, [...] "Jesse's much more raw this season. He's very distant, and he's turned to just utter chaos and destruction to keep his mind busy. When he's left alone in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts,</b> that's when things can get kind of dangerous and scary for Jesse." ...|$|E
500|$|Sahih Bukhari narrates Muhammad {{describing}} his revelations as [...] "sometimes it is (revealed) like {{the ringing of}} a bell". Aisha reported, [...] "I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over)". According to Welch these descriptions may be considered genuine, since {{they are unlikely to}} have been forged by later Muslims. Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> from these messages. According to the Quran, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment (Quran , Quran [...] ). Occasionally the Quran did not explicitly refer to Judgment day but provided examples from the history of extinct communities and warns Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities (Quran [...] ). Muhammad did not only warn those who rejected God's revelation, but also dispensed good news for those who abandoned evil, listening to the divine words and serving God. Muhammad's mission also involves preaching monotheism: The Quran commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God.|$|E

This duplication of mentality, as in a mirror, is (we repeat) the inmost thing of human philosophy. There is a mystical, even a monstrous truth, in the statement that two heads are better than one. But they ought both to grow on the same body." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} post-war, in a denigratory moment of idealism, and mostly of Actual idealism, accused of {{connivance}} with Fascism, Fazio’s position {{was one of}} open defence of Actual idealism and a faithful development of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|R
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "it's {{a melancholy}} record {{discussing}} the torturous pain {{that comes with}} thinking about someone all the time, even if they may not reciprocate the sentiment." [...] The track, being originally written for a woman, {{can be viewed as}} unisex composition. Following Ocean's revelation that he has been attracted to people of the same sex, some critics noted that lines such as [...] "my eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when I'm thinkin bout you" [...] had another additional message, expressing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> on love. The song has been called a forbidden love track, expressing Ocean's turmoil about his own hidden sexuality. The refrain [...] "boy" [...] was originally viewed synonym for “wow”, though [...] "new urgency" [...] was pumped into the track, adding extra pathos. Ocean reminisces about his [...] "first time", with an ex-lover who is addressed as [...] "boy" [...] during the song. The track is an apology to an unnamed lover. Lines like [...] "a tornado flew around my room before you came," [...] serves as a confession, and [...] "excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California" [...] outlines Ocean's own grief about the situation, admitting the situation got out of control.|$|E
500|$|Sakanaction {{found that}} {{after moving to}} Tokyo, where the band stood in the Japanese music scene was a lot clearer to them. The album's sound was {{inspired}} by Tokyo, and was a search to more consciously define what Sakanaction's identity was, compared to their first two albums. As a result, Shin-shiro felt {{like the end of}} the first chapter of Sakanaction to the band members. The music the band created on Shin-shiro was a mix of everything that the band wanted to try musically, and an attempt to make a more [...] "colorful" [...] album inspired by both new wave and live performance-style arrangements. They increased the tempo on the songs for the album, and focused on the beat of each song more than whether each song was structurally a pop song or not. Consciously attempting to create an album with a more popular sound, Yamaguchi was anxious about how his works would be received, and felt that these anxieties expressed themselves more on the album. For the song [...] "Enough", however, Yamaguchi wanted to create one song on the album that expressed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the album without being influenced by these pressures. The final studio takes of the songs were recorded in September 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The {{post-mortem}} video Faith {{receives from}} The Mayor is particularly telling because The Mayor expresses {{serious doubts about}} his ascension plans being successful. He also encourages Faith to 'go out with a bang'- perhaps mirroring <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thought</b> process prior to his ascension.|$|R
5000|$|An overdependence upon late {{scholastic}} commentators at {{the expense}} of fidelity to Aquinas' own text. However, Maritain is frequently developing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thought</b> to address contemporary problems. His work is that of a philosopher who makes use of historical sources to develop <b>his</b> <b>own</b> positions rather than that of a historian of philosophy.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the labeling of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> as [...] "conspiracy theory", Chomsky has replied {{that it is very}} rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard to sell their product.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{discussion}} with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> {{on whether the}} sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests {{that they have made}} a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to [...] "stay in their place" [...] and must be [...] "tethered" [...] by what he calls aitias logismos (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, Owen {{talked of}} his theories, {{influenced}} by Johannes Peter Müller, that living matter had an [...] "organising energy", a life-force that directed {{the growth of}} tissues and also determined the lifespan {{of the individual and}} of the species. Darwin was reticent about <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts,</b> understandably, when, on 19 December 1838, as secretary of the Geological Society of London, he saw Owen and his allies ridicule the Lamarckian 'heresy' of Darwin's old tutor, Robert Edmund Grant. In 1841, when the recently married Darwin was ill, Owen {{was one of the few}} scientific friends to visit; however, Owen's opposition to any hint of transmutation made Darwin keep quiet about his hypothesis.|$|E
6000|$|He frowned angrily {{upon his}} thought {{and on the}} shrivelled mannikin who had called it forth. His father's jibes at the Bantry gang leaped out of his memory.

Had Davin's simplicity and innocence stung him more secretly? ...|$|R

2500|$|Evelyn Waugh {{wrote the}} third contribution, An {{open letter to}} the Honble Mrs. Peter Rodd (Nancy Mitford) on a very serious subject from Evelyn Waugh, which also first {{appeared}} in Encounter. Widely regarded as a master of style of the 20th century, Waugh, who was a great friend of Nancy Mitford, added <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> to the class debate and points out that Nancy is a delightful trouble maker to write such a thing but also someone who only just managed to be upper class and now resides in another country, so — he [...] asks — who is she really to even bring it all up? Although this may seem offensive, Nancy Mitford said that [...] "everything with Evelyn Waugh was jokes. Everything. That's what none {{of the people who}} wrote about him seem to have taken into account at all".|$|E
2500|$|With the {{important}} exception of Four Quartets, Eliot directed {{much of his}} creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said [...] "Every poet would like, I fancy, {{to be able to}} think that he had some direct social utility [...] [...] [...] [...] He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} album, B.I.G. gave thanks to Wu-Tang in the album's liner notes, and also {{inserted}} lyrics praising the Wu-Tang Clan single [...] "C.R.E.A.M."; on the song [...] "Notorious Thugs," [...] he states, [...] "I'mma tell {{you like a}} nigga told me/Cash rules everything around me." [...] On his 2002 album God's Son, Nas references the feud on his song [...] "Last Real Nigga Alive," [...] implying that although he and Big had their differences, they were friendly; while he was also on good terms with Raekwon, neither Big nor Raekwon got along, and both warned Nas the other would copy his lyrics and style. In 2006, Ghostface and Raekwon did a posthumous collaboration with B.I.G., on the song [...] "Three Bricks," [...] which was originally intended {{to appear on the}} posthumous Biggie album, , but it instead became a bonus song on the Ghostface Killah album Fishscale. In 2008, Raekwon did a cover of Jadakiss' hit [...] "Letter to B.I.G.," [...] injecting <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thoughts</b> on his deceased former rival.|$|E
5000|$|In Germany, the {{psychologist}} and philosopher Karl Jaspers—who later described existentialism as a [...] "phantom" [...] {{created by the}} public—called <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>thought,</b> heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, Existenzphilosophie. For Jaspers, [...] "Existenz-philosophy {{is the way of}} thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker".|$|R
