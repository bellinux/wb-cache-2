40|$|To {{increase}} {{crop yield}} per unit of scarce water requires both better cultivars and better agronomy. The challenge is to manage the crop or improve its genetic makeup to: capture more of the water supply for use in transpiration; exchange transpired water for CO 2 more effectively in producing biomass; and convert more of the biomass into grain or other harvestable product. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> field, the upper limit of water productivity of well-managed disease-free water-limited cereal crops is typically 20 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 (grain yield per water used). If the productivity is markedly less than this, {{it is likely that}} major stresses other than water are at work, such as weeds, diseases, poor nutrition, or inhospitable soil. If so, the greatest advances will come from dealing with these first. When water is the predominant limitation, there is scope for improving overall water productivity by better matching the development of the crop to the pattern of water supply, thereby reducing evaporative and other losses and fostering a good balance of water-use before and after flowering, which is needed to give a large harvest index. There is also scope for developing genotypes that are able to maintain adequate floret fertility despite any transient severe water deficits during floral development. Marker-assisted selection has helped in controlling some root diseases that limit water uptake, and in maintaining fertility in water-stressed maize. Apart from herbicide-resistance in crops, which helps reduce competition for water by weeds, there are no genetic transformations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>offing</b> that are likely to improve water productivity greatly.

40|$|In this paper, a {{long wave}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of an estuary istreated {{by use of}} the method of the buffer domain. Dividing the whole domain into three parts, the equation of along wave is solved analytically by use of the Fourier Besselexpansion. Then an electronic computer was used to obtain the wave heights and phases <b>in</b> each domain. <b>The</b> conclusions obtainedin the present purview are :- (1) For the waves propagating into the canal, when kd(k: the wave number of the incident waves; d: half {{the width of the}} canal) approaches to zero, the wave height tends to double that of the incident waves, the phase becomes zero and <b>the</b> waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canal are propagated as if they originated at an infinite point. When kd increases <b>in</b> amount, <b>the</b> wave height diminishes monotonically to reach that of the incident waves at about kd= 1. 0, the phase takes a maximum value at about kd= 0. 3 and later decreases monotonically to zero value at kd= 1. 0, and the supposed origin of the waves propagated into the canal approaches the estuary. (2) For <b>the</b> waves <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> mouth of the canal, the equi-amplitude and phase lines run parallel to the coast facing the open sea and the amplitude of <b>the</b> waves increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of <b>the</b> <b>offing.</b> Provided that <b>the</b> linear approximations for sine and cosine functions are possible, it is found that <b>the</b> waves <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> mouth of the canal are propagated with the speed of a long wave into the canal. (3) As far as <b>the</b> waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open sea are concerned, our greatest interest is in damping reflected waves(instead of merely reflected waves). Regarding these waves, the following facts are known. When kd is small, the amplitude of the damping reflected waves is also small. As kd becomes large, a contribution of these waves to reflected waves is augmented. For the rates of the damping of these waves versus a variation of position, a similar tendency is seen. That is to say, the damping rate is gentle for small kd and rapid for large kd. And the rate is remarkable, <b>in</b> magnitude, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding part of the mouth of the canal. The surface composed by the amplitudes of the damping reflected waves tends to an asymptotic surface as kd becomes large. Finally, concerning the directivity of the damping reflected waves, the fact is known that a contribution of these waves to reflected ones is small <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction along the coast and becomes large as a line, along which a variation of the damping reflected waves is examined, is directed to <b>the</b> <b>offing.</b> 本論文においては河口附近における長波に関する研究が,buffer domainの方法を用いてなされている. まず全領域は 3 つの部分に分けられる. そのうち 1 つはbuffer domainである. そして河口部と広海(open sea) はベッセル函数を用いて解が求められ,水路の部分は三角函数を用いて解が表現されている. 得られた解の数値計算には電子計算機が用いられ,次のような結論を得た.

A reliable source model has been obtained for the 1923 event from seismological and geodetical data, but not for the 1703 event because we have only historical records and paleo-shoreline data about it.

The error on the experimental bottle filling plant can be defined without any interference using analog values taken from pressure sensors and linear potentiometers. The sensors and potentiometers are placed on different places of the plant. Neural network diagnosis faults on plant, where no bottle, cap closing cylinder B is not working, bottle cap closing cylinder C is not working, air pressure is not sufficient, water is not filling and low air pressure faults. The fault is diagnosed by {{artificial neural network}} with LVQ. It is possible to find an failure by using normal programming or PLC. <b>The</b> reason <b>offing</b> Artificial Neural Network is to give a information where the fault is. However, ANN {{can be used for}} different systems. The aim is to find the fault by using ANN simultaneously. <b>In</b> this situation, <b>the</b> error taken place on the pneumatic system is collected by a data acquisition card. It is observed that the algorithm is very capable program for many industrial plants which have mechatronic systems...|$|R
40|$|Cement paste was {{replaced}} with kaolin-bentonite. The specimens were exposed to elevated temperature for 3 hours in a ceramic furnace and cooled down to room temperature. After cooling, the effect of kaolin-bentonite (particles sized of < 45 μm) on hydration, rehydration, surface roughness and compressive strength of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste were investigated. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to study surface roughness of OPC paste-additive mixture. The application of fire on OPC paste was analyzed. The results showed imposed heat (500 oC for 3 hours) accelerates the hydration process of OPC, and reduces setting time. Increased heat to 1000 oC, leads to zero compressive strength of specimens, the compressive strength of OPC continuously reduces after specimen has fully cooled down. A method for recovery of compressive strength of OPC after offing fire has been suggested. <b>The</b> method of <b>offing</b> fire has important effects on the compressive strength of concrete. The best results for specimen content are cement-kaolin-bentonite paste, exposure to 500 o C, after 90 days of curing, and cooling down in water. <b>In</b> this case <b>the</b> compressive strength has been increased around 60 % compared to not using additive and not exposing to heat...|$|R
