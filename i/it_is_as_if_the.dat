500|$|While Christian theologians {{held that}} the natural world {{was part of an}} unchanging {{designed}} hierarchy, some theologians speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: [...] "Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to {{take the form of a}} ship." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{structure}} of the book drew mixed reactions, with Toronto Star's Kim Hughs describing it as [...] "the novel's most defining feature and its most exasperating conceit". She believed that Pari {{was meant to be}} the protagonist of the story but that the shifting focus on the numerous other personalities left her [...] "barely [...] through the clutter". The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> story of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)." [...] Kamal agreed, saying that the structure was [...] "exquisitely crafted". Scoop Empires Sherine El Banhawy added that the focus on multiple characters allowed to readers {{to gain a better understanding}} of the diversities of Afghan culture.|$|E
2500|$|If the photon gas is not Planckian, {{the second}} law of {{thermodynamics}} guarantees that interactions (between photons and other particles or even, at sufficiently high temperatures, between the photons themselves) {{will cause the}} photon energy distribution to change and approach the Planck distribution. [...] In such an approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, photons are created or annihilated in the right numbers and with the right energies to fill the cavity with a Planck distribution until they reach the equilibrium temperature. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> gas {{is a mixture of}} sub-gases, one for every band of wavelengths, and each sub-gas eventually attains the common temperature.|$|E

These relationships were invariably intimate and long-lasting; she regularly revisited the places she chose to photograph and learned the relevant language... Similarly, her photographs of people are born of intimacy without sentimentality. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> presentation of relationships {{takes the place of}} story structure, and her work is best understood as an ongoing series of observations of the life she made for herself." ...|$|E

[...] says: [...] "And Abraham rose up from before his dead," [...] indicating that he departed from the presence of Sarah's body.

(And this status affects a person's obligation to perform other commandments.). Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] Similarly, Rabbi Johanan taught that we learn from the words, [...] "And Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke," [...] in [...] that one whose dead lies before him is exempt from reciting the Shema (as the verse implies that until Sarah's burial, Abraham did nothing but make arrangements for it)..|$|E
2500|$|A century ago, {{nutritional}} deficiencies may have limited body and organ functionality, including skull volume. The {{first two years}} of life is a critical time for nutrition. The consequences of malnutrition can be irreversible and may include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity. On the other hand, Flynn has pointed to 20-point gains on Dutch military (Raven's type) IQ tests between 1952, 1962, 1972, and 1982. He observes that the Dutch 18-year-olds of 1962 had a major nutritional handicap. They were either in the womb, or were recently born, during the great Dutch famine of 1944– when German troops monopolized food and 18,000 people died of starvation. Yet, concludes Flynn, [...] "they do not show up even as a blip in the pattern of Dutch IQ gains. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> famine had never occurred." [...] It appears that the effects of diet are gradual, taking effect over decades (affecting mother as well as child) rather than a few months [...]|$|E
2500|$|In the book, five {{distinct}} [...] "mono-dialogues", a term Loevy himself used {{in personal}} correspondence, {{are used to}} tell the story of the family to an assumed listening partner, who is neither seen nor heard. Each of these mono-dialogues is different, and given by different people in different languages or period-appropriate forms of Hebrew. Loevy captured this in the film, creating a new television vocabulary. The [...] "mono-dialogue" [...] technique eliminated the [...] "fourth wall" [...] taboo of television and film, according to which the audience absolves itself of traditional neutrality and assumes the role of a character in the story. In Loevy's own words, [...] "Television demands text, but the television viewer is used to getting the complete text. Every question has an answer...." [...] In Mr. Mani, the role of respondent is filled by the camera and, by extension, the audience itself. [...] "As soon as the speaker turns to the camera—in other words, to the audience, speaking directly to it in a way that demands an answer, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> speaker stepped out of the screen, almost like in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo. The viewer is shaken up. The artificial nature of the situation itself in Mr. Mani screams its presence.". Like the characters in Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, the characters cease being the subjects of scrutiny by some external viewer. The external viewer, i.e., the audience, becomes a partner in dialogue with the actors and an active participant in the story.|$|E

[...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I suggest you try hard not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie." [...] In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, [...] "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it’s that one." ...|$|E
