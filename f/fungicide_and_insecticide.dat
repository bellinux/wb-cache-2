40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine the impacts of fungicide, insecticide, plant growth hormone (gibberellic acid) on soil microbiota, and the growth characteristics of Aspergillus flavus. In the fungicide or insecticide mixed with plant growth hormone treated soil sample, the total viable number of soil microbiota was found to be higher than that of the soil treated with fungicide or insecticide alone. Moderate effect of insecticide used on the total number of fungi was observed. On the other hand the effect of insecticide on soil bacteria was more than effect of fungicide, and the negative effect of fungicide on soil bacteria was observed particularly at latent periods (15 and 20 days) of application. A great sensitivity to <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>insecticide</b> was observed in the case of nitrogen fixing bacteria. At 15 days after <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>insecticide</b> application the adverse effect was found. Morphological deformations were clear in A. flavus cultivated on medium containing fungicide, the fungus failed to form conidiospores, conidiophores and vesicles.

40|$|Seed yam is costly, and {{can carry}} pests and diseases. To reduce costs and to manage seed health, in the 1970 s, the Yam Minisett Technique (YMT) was developed, which {{involved}} cutting yams {{into small pieces}} {{to be used as}} seed. Few farmers adopted the technique, {{in part because of the}} high labor requirements of making a nursery to sprout the pieces of tuber. In 1992, a DFID-funded project introduced <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>insecticide</b> treatment to improve the survival of yam minisetts. The Adapted Yam Minisett Technique (AYMT) was developed during 2003 to 2006 in response to the technical problems of the YMT. The AYMT involved larger pieces of yam, dipped in a solution of <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>insecticide,</b> to help manage pests and to ensure that more of the pieces survived. This allowed farmers to skip making the tedious seedbed, and to plant directly in the field. The technique was adapted on four on-farm trials. About 400 farmers in Kogi State, Nigeria have tried the technique. They had credit to buy the pesticides. Although various subsequent projects have promoted the AYMT, farmer response to the technique is yet to be quantified. Peer Revie...|$|E

40|$|Phytotoxins are {{secondary}} microbial metabolites {{that play}} {{an essential role}} in the development of disease symptoms induced by fungi on host plants. Although phytotoxins can cause extensive—and in some cases devastating—damage to agricultural crops, they can also represent an important tool to develop natural herbicides when produced by fungi and plants to inhibit the growth and spread of weeds. An alternative strategy to biologically control parasitic plants is based on the use of plant and fungal metabolites, which stimulate seed germination in the absence of the host plant. Nontoxigenic fungi also produce bioactive metabolites with potential <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>insecticide</b> activity, and could be applied for crop protection. All these metabolites represent important tools to develop eco-friendly pesticides.

40|$|The Author(s) 2011.

One of the most important processes influencing the behavior of a pesticide in the environment is its degradation in soil. It is known that due to several pesticide applications in one vegetation season, the pesticide may be present in mixtures with other pesticides or xenobiotics in soil. This study examines the role which a mixture of chemicals plays in pesticide degradation. The influence of other pesticides on the rate of pendimethalin (PDM) degradation in soil was measured in controlled conditions. Mixtures of PDM with mancozeb or mancozeb and thiamethoxam significantly influenced the degradation of pendimethalin under controlled conditions. The second type o...|$|E

However, there have been few experimental tests of a central prediction of the JCH: that removing host-specific enemies should lead to greater increases in per capita recruitment in areas of higher host density or lower relative phylogenetic diversity. Using spatially randomized plots of high and low host biomass in a temperate grassland biodiversity experiment, we treated developing seedheads of six prairie perennials to factorial applications of <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>insecticide.</b> We measured predispersal seed production, seed viability, and seedling biomass. Results were highly species-specific and idiosyncratic. Effects of insect seed predators and fungal pathogens on predispersal responses varied with neither conspecific biomass nor phylogenetic diversity, suggesting that—at least at the predispersal stage and for the insect and fungal seed predators we were able to exclude—the JCH is not sufficient to contribute to negative conspecific density-dependence for these dominant prairie species...|$|E

Nevertheless, {{in the field of}} wood protection, borates are only used for indoor non-exposed applications or in association with other biocides, due to their main disadvantage of being readily leachable from treated wood. To overcome this problem, boric acid was fixed into wood with condensed tannins and hexamine through a non-formaldehyde emission polymer network. Treated mixtures were tested with different proportions of mimosa tannins and hexamine, with and without co-added boric acid. The treated beech samples were leached and tested according to European Standard EN 113 against Pycnoporus sanguineus in tropical conditions. The systems had minimal boron depletion and good fungal decay efficacy, meeting the efficacy requirements of EN 113. Thus, these associations could be envisaged to treat timber with insufficient natural durability for above ground outdoor use, and for a long service-life of the wooden commodities.
