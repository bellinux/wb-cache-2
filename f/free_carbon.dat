25|$|Carbon {{and oxygen}} {{together}} {{have a total}} of 10 electrons in the valence shell. Following the octet rule for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a triple bond, with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or dipolar bond. This causes a C←O polarization of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C→O polarization, since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. In the <b>free</b> <b>carbon</b> monoxide, a net negative charge δ– remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small dipole moment of 0.122D.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{star has}} evolved {{sufficiently}} {{to become a}} red giant, its circumstellar habitable zone will change dramatically from its main-sequence size. For example, the Sun is expected to engulf the previously-habitable Earth as a red giant. However, once a red giant star reaches the horizontal branch, it achieves a new equilibrium and can sustain a new circumstellar habitable zone, which {{in the case of}} the Sun would range from 7 to 22 AU. At such stage, Saturn's moon Titan would likely be habitable in Earth's temperature sense. Given that this new equilibrium lasts for about 1 Gyr, and because life on Earth emerged by 0.7 Gyr from the formation of the Solar System at latest, life could conceivably develop on planetary mass objects in the habitable zone of red giants. However, around such a helium-burning star, important life processes like photosynthesis could only happen around planets where the atmosphere has been artificially seeded with carbon dioxide, as by the time a solar-mass star becomes a red giant, planetary-mass bodies would have already absorbed much of their <b>free</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide.|$|E

40|$|Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) {{has started}} to study and develop {{zirconium}} carbide (ZrC) coated fuel particles for advanced high temperature gas cooled reactors. The ZrC coating layer has been fabricated using the bromide process at JAEA. The coated particles with IPyC layers reported in a previous study were annealed at around 2073 K for 1 h, under which compact sintering will {{be done in a}} practical process, in order to study effects of the heat treatment (annealing) on their microstructure evolution. Then the microstructures of the ZrC layers in the cases (batches) of C/Zr = 1. 11 and 1. 35 were characterized by means of TEM and STEM. Microstructural evolution such as changes in the shape and size of voids or <b>free</b> <b>carbons</b> region caused by the heat treatment were found in the cases of both batches. After the heat treatment, the voids or <b>free</b> <b>carbons</b> region showed a clod like feature with diameters of 50 to 100 nm. The grain growth of ZrC was also observed in both cases: In the ZrC layer with C/Zr = 1. 11, the fibrous carbons grew as if to stand from the PyC to ZrC layers on some places in the IPyC/ZrC boundary.

500|$|In early September 2009, Rod Oram [...] {{predicted}} that the National Government's goals would be; to adopt intensity-based allocation of <b>free</b> <b>carbon</b> credits to export industries; have no cap on greenhouse gas emissions; to have a temporary cap {{on the price of}} carbon; to delay bringing in sectors into the NZETS; to delay phasing out free emission units; and, maximum alignment with the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Oram viewed these changes as significantly weakening the incentives to reduce emissions and to plant carbon forests.|$|E
500|$|Reuters {{reported}} that the amended NZ ETS allowed unlimited imports of offsets and that business groups largely backed the changes, while environmental groups largely felt that the NZ ETS would not do enough to reduce emissions. In March 2010, Reuters {{reported that}} the NZ ETS had [...] "no emissions cap nor any limit {{on the number of}} <b>free</b> <b>carbon</b> permits for energy-intensive companies that export their products". Reuters noted that the absence of a cap and the two-tonnes-for-one-unit surrender arrangement had led to [...] "accusations of some big polluters getting a free ride and that the scheme will fail to cut emissions of planet-warming gases".|$|E
500|$|Rod Oram commented in a Sunday Star Times {{column that}} the National Government's {{changes to the}} ETS were [...] "a giant step backwards" [...] which would [...] "drive up emissions, {{perpetuate}} old technology, necessitate ever-greater subsidies and reduce New Zealand's international competitiveness and reputation." [...] Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of <b>free</b> <b>carbon</b> credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the price signal with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon cap, forcing forestry holders of credits to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.|$|E

The financial years beginning on 1 July 2012, 1 July 2013 and 1 July 2014 are fixed charge years (otherwise known in popular terms as the 'carbon tax'). In a fixed charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act for a fixed charge. Later financial years are flexible charge years which involve emissions trading. In a flexible charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act as the result of an auction plus by means of free allocation to coal fired generators and emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) industries. However, in the flexible charge years beginning on 1 July 2015, 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2017, some carbon units may be issued for a fixed charge (to act as a cap).
