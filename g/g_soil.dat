40|$|Abstract One gram of soil is {{an immense}} bio-chemical gene library {{producing}} diverse genetic instructions, {{which have been}} present for almost 4 billion years on the Earth. There is sufficient DNA in 1 <b>g</b> of <b>soil</b> to extend 1, 598 km. However, this is certainly an underestimate for fertile soils. Can the amount of genetic information contained in one <b>g</b> of <b>soil</b> be accurately estimated? The answer is not always definitive as the estimate depends on the particular <b>g</b> of <b>soil</b> being researched and the methods for DNA extraction, purification and quantification. Moreover, {{there is no such}} entity as a typical or average <b>g</b> of <b>soil.</b> Extraction of DNA from soil samples is never 100 % efficient and can vary from a few lg to almost 200 lg DNA per <b>g</b> dry weight <b>soil.</b> However, estimates can be made that lead {{to a better understanding of}} the immense biochemical gene library and gene expression (combined transcription and translation) in microorganisms within a single <b>g</b> of <b>soil.</b> Accurate estimates of genes expressed in a single <b>g</b> of <b>soil</b> under a multitude of changing, environmental, conditions still requires considerable research.

The ion chromatography data showed there was significant variation in the nutrient status mainly nitrite, nitrate, ammonium and phosphate between the treatments (with worms) and control (devoid of worms). The significant variation in nitrite concentration was observed in treatment containing 60. 9 g soil+ 20. 78 g compost which was around 6. 32 (mg/kg). Phosphate concentration was predominant in treatment having 41. 57 g compost alone with 23. 855 mg/kg concentration. The amount of ammonium varied slightly, though major concentration around 6. 90 mg/kg was observed in treatment with 41. 57 g compost alone. The difference in nutrient status appeared {{to be due to}} the variations in nutrient cycling probably ascribable to the earthworm's activities.

Site 1 had higher contamination than Site 3. Bacteria were isolated using metal(loid) -supplemented (Cd, Zn, and As) media. Isolates were grouped by random amplified polymorphic DNA and identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Strains were also examined for their metal(loid) tolerance. The counts of metal(loid) -tolerant bacteria were higher in Site 1 and ranged between log 7. 17 CFU <b>g</b> 1 <b>soil</b> in As-containing medium and log 7. 57 CFU <b>g</b> 1 <b>soil</b> in Zn-containing medium, while counts at Site 3 varied between log 5. 33 CFU <b>g</b> 1 <b>soil</b> in Cd-containing medium and log 6. 97 CFU <b>g</b> 1 <b>soil</b> in As-containing medium. The composition of bacterial populations varied between locations. In Site 1, the classes Actinobacteria (36 %) and Bacilli (24 %) were well represented, while in Site 3 strains were mainly affiliated to classes Actinobacteria (35 %), g-Proteobacteria (35 %), and b-Proteobacteria (12 %).

A duplex {{real-time}} PCR {{technique for}} simultaneous detection and quantification {{of the two}} pathogens was developed. Species-specific primers for P. nicotianae and P. cactorum were designed based on the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of rDNA and the ras-related protein gene Ypt 1, respectively. TaqMan probes were labeled with FAM for P. nicotianae and HEX for P. cactorum. Specificities were demonstrated using 52 isolates, including various soil-borne pathogens. Sensitivities for P. nicotianae and P. cactorum DNAs were 10 fg and 1 pg, respectively. The technique was applied to naturally infested soil and root samples; the two pathogens were detected and the target DNA concentrations were quantified. Significant correlations of DNA quantities in roots and the surrounding soils were found. The minimum soil DNA concentration predicting the development of disease symptoms was estimated as 20 pg (<b>g</b> <b>soil)</b> − 1.

Root-knot nematodes are reported to break Fusarium wilt resistance in some chickpea genotypes (5). A num-ber of chickpea cultivars resistant to Fusarium wilt have been identified. However, there is no published infor-mation available in literature on the reaction of popular cultivars of chickpea to M incognita and F oxysporum f. sp. ciceri disease complex.

Thirteen popular cultivars of chickpea were screened for their reaction to F oxysporum f. sp. ciceri, M incognita alone and to their combinations. The ex-periment was conducted under green house conditions at 20. 4 to 33. 4 °C air temperature and 10. 7 - 11. 5 %(db) soil moisture. Five seeds of chickpea were sown in 10 em dia.
