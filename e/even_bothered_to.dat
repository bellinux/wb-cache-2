Van Valkenburgh experienced at least two general quarters alarms per night; often four or five times between 21:00 and dawn.

[...] For the final scenes, in which Ward reveals his true allegiance by killing Hand, McCreary used only [...] "deep, horrifying synth tones", as he and the producers did not want to [...] "clutter these scenes with themes, melodies or emotions.
