500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed.</b> Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, {{because it would be}} too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

Scottish athletes were involved in 13 of the 65 medals won by Great Britain in 2012, but only three of those were won by Scots without assistance from other athletes. Sir Chris Hoy said in May 2013 that it could [...] "take time" [...] for Scottish athletes to [...] "establish themselves in a new training environment", indicating that the good performance of Scottish athletes in the Great Britain team would not automatically translate into that of an independent Scotland team.

2500|$|Hope for the Accord gained {{momentum}} after New Brunswick {{proposed a}} series of alternate concerns that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> to enable passage of the original agreement. [...] Jean Charest, a former cabinet minister, was tasked with heading a commission on addressing New Brunswick's concerns on March 22, 1990, which expanded into an attempt to forge an all-party consensus on the Accord. [...] Despite his opposition, leading Liberal leadership candidate Jean Chrétien, wishing the issue to be off the table, contributed to the commission via a back channel. On May 17, 1990, the commission recommended a companion accord that would be approved by all provinces along with Meech Lake; This would permit the original accord to stay in place, saving face for Quebec and the federal government, while addressing the concerns of other provinces. The companion Accord asserted that the distinct society clause {{would be subject to}} the Charter and would feature greater protections for minority language rights in the provinces.|$|E
2500|$|The European Union sent Development and Aid Commissioner Louis Michel as a {{diplomatic}} envoy {{in the region}} to ask rebel leader Nkunda to ask his delegation to be 'flexible' during the peace talks due to Obasanjo's complaint of the rebel delegation being uncooperative. Michel declared that he had [...] "urged some flexible proposals with Nkunda"; however, Nkunda reaffirmed that he still wanted direct talks with the Congolese president, saying that DR Congo's problems extended beyond its borders. [...] "The problems we are dealing with are national problems so they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> nationally and not as problems of one part of the country", he said. Nkunda also contested the president's election, saying that [...] "Legitimacy is not elections and elections are not a blank cheque for a government to do whatever it wants."
