40|$|Characteristics of <b>full</b> <b>applications</b> {{found in}} {{scientific}} computing industries today lead to challenges {{that are not}} addressed by state-of-the-art approaches to automatic parallelization. These characteristics are not present in CPU kernel codes nor linear algebra libraries, requiring {{a fresh look at}} how to make automatic parallelization apply to today 2 ̆ 7 s computational industries using <b>full</b> <b>applications.</b> The challenges to automatic parallelization result from software engineering patterns that implement multifunctionality, reusable execution frameworks, data structures shared across abstract programming interfaces, a multilingual code base for a single application, and the observation that <b>full</b> <b>applications</b> demand more from compile-time analysis than CPU kernel codes do. Each of these challenges has a detrimental impact on compile-time analysis required for automatic parallelization. Then, focusing on a set of target loops that are parallelizable by hand and that result in speedups on par with the distributed parallel version of the <b>full</b> <b>applications,</b> we determine the prevalence of a number of issues that hinder automatic parallelization. These issues point to enabling techniques that are missing from the state-of-the-art.

The district was required to develop a lengthy literacy plan, which included outreach into the community. The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant [...] It is a five-year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, School District was one of only 148 entities that were invited to submit a <b>full</b> <b>application.</b> In Potter County 1 school district was awarded funding for the first year. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of work in the {{literature}} about automatic unit tests generation, and many successful results have been reported so far. However, current approaches target library classes, but not <b>full</b> <b>applications.</b> A major obstacle for testing <b>full</b> <b>applications</b> is that they interact with the environment. For example, they establish connections to remote servers. Thoroughly testing such applications requires tests that completely control the interactions between the application and its environment. Recent techniques based on mocking enable the generation of tests which include environment interactions; however, generating the right type of interactions is still an open problem. In this paper, we describe a novel approach which addresses this problem by enhancing search-based testing with complex test data generation. Experiments on an artificial system show that the proposed approach can generate effective unit tests. Compared with current techniques based on mocking, we generate more robust unit tests which achieve higher coverage and are, arguably, easier to read and understand...|$|R
2500|$|Antonescu's racial {{discrimination}} laws and Romania's {{participation in the}} Holocaust earned significant objections from various individuals and groups in Romanian society. One noted opponent was Queen Mother Helen, who actively intervened to save Jews from being deported. The Mayor of Cernăuți, Traian Popovici, publicly objected to the deportation of Jews, as did Gherman Pântea, his counterpart in Odessa. The appeals of Queen Helen, King Michael, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Transylvania Nicolae Bălan, Apostolic Nuncio Andrea Cassulo and Swiss Ambassador René de Weck are credited with having helped avert the <b>full</b> <b>application</b> of the Final Solution in Antonescu's Romania. Cassulo and Bălan together pleaded for the fate of certain Jews, including all who had converted to Christianity, and the former publicly protested against deportations. While Romania and the United States were still at peace, American Minister Plenipotentiary Franklin Mott Gunther repeatedly attempted to make his superiors aware of Romanian actions against the Jews, and Turkish diplomats unsuccessfully sought American approval for transferring Romanian Jews to safe passage through Anatolia and into Palestine. Dinu Brătianu also condemned antisemitic measures, prompting Antonescu to accuse him of being an ally of [...] "the Yid in London". Together with Maniu and Ion Mihalache, Brătianu signed statements condemning the isolation, persecution and expulsion of Jews, which prompted Antonescu to threaten {{to clamp down on}} them. However, both parties were occasionally ambiguous on racial issues, and themselves produced antisemitic messages. Brătianu is also known for publicly defending the cause of Romani people, opposing their deportation on grounds that it would [...] "turn back the clock on several centuries of history", a stance which drew support from his civilian peers. In parallel, some regular Romanians such as nurse Viorica Agarici intervened to save Jewish lives, while, from inside the Jewish community, Chief Rabbi Alexandru Șafran and activist Mișu Benvenisti rallied with Wilhelm Filderman in public protests against Antonescu's decisions, being occasionally joined by A. L. Zissu. In 1943, Filderman himself was deported to Mohyliv-Podilskyi, but eventually allowed to return.|$|E

60|$|There {{have been}} men in all ages, {{who have been}} impelled as by an {{instinct}} to propose their own nature as a problem, and who devote their attempts to its solution. The {{first step was to}} construct a table of distinctions, which they seem to have formed on the principle of the absence or presence of the Will. Our various sensations, perceptions, and movements were classed as active or passive, or as media partaking of both. A still finer distinction was soon established between the voluntary and the spontaneous. In our perceptions we seem to ourselves merely passive to an external power, whether as a mirror reflecting the landscape, or as a blank canvass on which some unknown hand paints it. For it is worthy of notice, that the latter, or the system of Idealism may be traced to sources equally remote with the former, or Materialism; and Berkeley can boast an ancestry at least as venerable as Gassendi or Hobbes. These conjectures, however, concerning the mode in which our perceptions originated, could not alter the natural difference of Things and Thoughts. In the former, the cause appeared wholly external, while in the latter, sometimes our will interfered as the producing or determining cause, and sometimes our nature seemed to act by a mechanism of its own, without any conscious effort of the will, or even against it. Our inward experiences were thus arranged in three separate classes, the passive sense, or what the School-men call the merely receptive quality of the mind; the voluntary; and the spontaneous, which holds the middle place between both. But it is not in human nature to meditate on any mode of action, without inquiring after the law that governs it; and in the explanation of the spontaneous movements of our being, the metaphysician took the lead of the anatomist and natural philosopher. In Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and India the analysis of the mind had reached its noon and manhood, while experimental research was still in its dawn and infancy. For many, very many centuries, it has been difficult to advance a new truth, or even a new error, in the philosophy of the intellect or morals. With regard, however, to the laws that direct the spontaneous movements of thought and the principle of their intellectual mechanism there exists, it has been asserted, an important exception most honourable to the moderns, and in the merit of which our own country claims the largest share. Sir James Mackintosh,--(who, amid the variety of his talents and attainments, is not of less repute for the depth and accuracy of his philosophical inquiries than for the eloquence with which he is said to render their most difficult results perspicuous, and the driest attractive,)--affirmed in the Lectures, delivered by him in Lincoln's Inn Hall, that the law of association as established in the contemporaneity of the original impressions, formed the basis of all true psychology; and that any ontological or metaphysical science, not contained in such (that is, an empirical) psychology, was but a web of abstractions and generalizations. Of this prolific truth, of this great fundamental law, he declared Hobbes to have been the original discoverer, while its <b>full</b> <b>application</b> to the whole intellectual system we owed to Hartley; who stood in the same relation to Hobbes as Newton to Kepler; the law of association being that to the mind, which gravitation is to matter.|$|E
