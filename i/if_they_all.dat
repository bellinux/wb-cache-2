5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{the band}} members' drug {{problems}} still stood in their way. In 1986, Tyler completed a successful drug rehabilitation program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager Tim Collins, {{who believed that}} the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs {{over the course of}} the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> completed drug rehab. Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of Done With Mirrors, and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.|$|E
25|$|Setting up a {{hydrogen}} economy would require huge {{investments in the}} infrastructure to store and distribute hydrogen to vehicles. In contrast, battery electric vehicles, which are already publicly available, would not necessitate immediate expansion of the existing infrastructure for electricity transmission and distribution. Power plant capacity that now goes unused at night {{could be used for}} recharging electric vehicles. A study conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the US Department of Energy in December 2006 found that the idle off-peak grid capacity in the US would be sufficient to power 84% of all vehicles in the US <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> were immediately replaced with electric vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Analyzing {{multiple}} {{epidemiological studies}} on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests {{a small but}} measurable increase in risk for bladder cancer at 10 ppb. According to Peter Ravenscroft of the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since {{it does not include}} lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh {{the costs and benefits of}} arsenic remediation.|$|E
25|$|Players {{return to}} the map screen <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> run out of lives, or if all players lose their lives at the same time, leaving no one to free them. For most levels, there is a midway flag that if touched will return the player to that point after dying and being {{sent back to the}} map screen. Stages are {{completed}} by getting at least one player to touch the goal at the end, though a bonus is awarded if all players manage to grab hold of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. In a few levels, in addition to the normal goal and flag pole, there are alternative exits leading to a flag pole with a red flag. Reaching this goal will open up a new path on the map, leading to new stages on the overworld map and, in some worlds, a warp cannon (which will blast the player off to a later world).|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of future NY17F {{was divided into}} multiple parts, the {{construction of}} the road between Addison village and the hamlet of Rathbone and one between Rathbone and the town of Canisteo. The first section constructed was the stretch between Addison and Rathbone, with construction beginning in 1921. The contract was signed to Frank J. Foote, Inc for construction of the new road. By October 1921, the new road was constructed a mile (1.6km) from the village of Addison to Baldwin Cemetery. The project was not without its controversy. In July 1922, six workers went on strike after the contractor did not meet their demands to raise wages from 35 an hour to 40. The strikers amounting to six would make it appear to the contractor that a change of heart was had by most of the workers. The company stated that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> had struck, {{there might have been a}} raise in wage, but not with the lack of workers. The new road was about complete in August1922, with the exception of the tarva top that would go on the roads. By August 10, the road was completed with a speculated opening date of September 1, 1922. By November1922, the road was open to traffic.|$|E

500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still felt as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist {{in front of the}} wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
500|$|Girl in Mirror uses Ben-Day dots {{like many}} of his other works, but it was {{inspired}} by the hard reflective finish of signs in the New York City Subway system and, in turn, they inspired his subsequent ceramic head works. Enamel facilitated a more mechanical appearance than even his paintings while remaining in two dimensions. After 1963, Lichtenstein's comics-based women [...] "...look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> came out of the same pot of makeup."

500|$|The {{subject of}} Drowning Girl {{is an example}} of Lichtenstein's post-1963 comics-based women who [...] "look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> came out of the same pot of makeup." [...] In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein {{produced}} several [...] "fantasy drama" [...] paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable, such as Drowning Girl, Hopeless and In the Car. [...] These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent [...] "girls next door" [...] in a variety of tenuous emotional states. [...] "In Hopeless and Drowning Girl, for example, the heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs, with one displaying helplessness... and the other defiance (she would rather drown than ask for her lover's help)." [...] Drowning Girl, the aforementioned works and Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But... are among those tragedies that make the author a popular draw at museums.|$|E

500|$|On April 9 before {{boarding}} {{the airplane}} {{to return from}} the NCAA Final Four, Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek {{the advice of the}} NBA advisory committee. The draft board had until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players had until April 28 to enter the draft. [...] On that same date, ESPN's Jason King predicted that if all four players had left for the NBA draft, the 2013–14 team would have begun the season unranked. USA Today projected on April 9 that if one of the four possible 2013 NBA draft entrants returned, Michigan could have been ranked number twenty-four, and that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> returned, Michigan would have been preseason number one. ESPN journalist Myron Medcalf predicted on April 12 that Burke and Hardaway would enter the draft and that McGary and Robinson were on the borderline of doing so.|$|E
500|$|Wenger at {{the start}} of the season prioritised regaining the league title: [...] "I feel it is very {{important}} in our minds to do this and I know the hunger is strong to do it," [...] and named Newcastle United and Liverpool, along with Manchester United and Chelsea, as Arsenal's main rivals for the Premier League. Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson asserted that his old club were favourites because they had the [...] "best players … <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> remain fit week-in week-out then they will not be beaten." [...] Glenn Moore of The Independent wrote of Arsenal's chances: [...] "They will be thereabouts, but unless Wenger finally puts his faith in youth, and the likes of Jérémie Aliadière, Jermaine Pennant and Phillipe Senderos repay him, they may lack the depth to sustain a title campaign." [...] Defender Sol Campbell however believed the squad was [...] "strong enough for the league and FA Cup", but doubted their chances of winning the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
500|$|The parade {{was filmed}} at Universal Studios Hollywood in California on the New York Street set, due to safety concerns. The set was {{designed}} to resemble 2nd Avenue; the parade was shot from above by helicopters and stitched into matte shots of the real-life street. It took three weeks to film, with 1,500 extras {{being used in the}} scene, along with three custom designed floats. Other parts of the film to be shot in Los Angeles, California included store interiors, and the warehouse fight scene between Howard and the criminal Santas, for which a Pasadena furniture warehouse was used. Turbo-Man was created and designed for the film. This meant the commercials and scenes from the Turbo-Man TV series were all shot by Levant, while all of the Turbo-Man merchandise, packaging and props shown in the film were custom made one-offs and designed to look [...] "authentic, as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> sprang from the same well." [...] Along with Columbus and Levant, production designer Leslie McDonald and character designer Tim Flattery crafted Turbo-Man, Booster and Dementor and helped make the full-size Turbo-Man suit for the film's climax. Principal production finished in August; Columbus [...] "fine-tun the picture until the last possible minute," [...] using multiple test audiences [...] "to see where the big laughs actually lie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{point of}} {{disagreement}} concerns {{the uniqueness of}} evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge. [...] Rudolf Carnap held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence. [...] Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value. [...] Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> have the same information.|$|E
2500|$|One {{problem was}} that since the English edition omitted the epilogue, British reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who {{apparently}} did not survive to tell the tale. The reviewer in the Spectator objected that [...] "nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> perish." [...] The Dublin University Magazine asked [...] "how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story?" [...] and the Literary Gazette declared that how the writer, [...] "who {{appears to have been}} drowned with the rest, communicated his notes for publication to Mr. Bentley is not explained". A few other reviewers, who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of Ishmael telling the story, pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages.|$|E
