2500|$|Virgo is the eponymous debut studio album by American house music duo Virgo, {{released}} in 1989 on Radical Records in the United Kingdom. It compiles two 12" [...] EPs {{released in}} the United States on Trax Records, <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> You Are? by Virgo Four and Ride by M.E.. Both were pseudonyms of Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders, two art students and childhood friends from Chicago. The album was first reissued in 2010 on Rush Hour Recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Virgo {{was also}} {{included}} in The Guardians 2007 list of the 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die, and [...] In a retrospective review, Richard Carnes of Resident Advisor awarded the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, calling <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> You Are? [...] "the finest house music 12-inch ever created." [...] He also considered [...] "Take Me Higher" [...] to be [...] "one of the best electronic music tracks of all time." [...] "In a Vision" [...] was included in the 1999 compilation , therefore being recognized as an influence in the IDM style pioneered by Warp Records.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{term for}} a drag queen is female impersonator. Although this is still used, it is {{sometimes}} regarded as inaccurate, because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to pass as women. Female impersonation has been {{and continues to be}} illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen José Sarria to hand out labels to his friends reading, [...] "I am a boy," [...] so he could not be accused of female impersonation. American drag queen RuPaul once said, [...] "I do not impersonate females! How many women <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" [...] He also said, [...] "I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!".|$|E
6000|$|Saxton laughed harshly. [...] "Under the circumstances, I {{guess there}} is. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who's</b> {{stopping}} him cutting all the props he wants {{right behind the}} mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laramie, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who's</b> boss of {{this secret}} gang of rustlers hereabouts?" [...] asked Duane, bluntly. It was {{characteristic}} {{of him to}} come sharp to the point. His voice--something deep, easy, cool about him--seemed to steady Laramie.|$|R
5000|$|Again, {{the voice}} over was not {{supplied}} by Brian Cant, but is {{delivered in a}} similar style. It differs from the original by saying: [...] "This is a box, a magical box, playing a magical tune. But inside this box there lies a surprise. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who's</b> in it today?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As a {{footnote}} to this event, many years later, I ran across Lt. Comdr. Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated {{across from each}} other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right {{in the middle of my}} story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.|$|E
2500|$|Shriver was {{diagnosed}} with Alzheimer's disease in 2003. In 2004, his daughter, Maria, published a children's book, What's Happening to Grandpa?, to help explain Alzheimer's to children. The book gives {{suggestions on how to}} help and to show love to an elderly person with the disease. In July 2007, Shriver's son-in-law, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, speaking in favor of stem-cell research, said that Shriver's Alzheimer's disease had advanced to the point that [...] "Today, he does not even recognize his wife." [...] Maria Shriver discusses her father's worsening condition in a segment for the four-part 2009 HBO documentary series The Alzheimer's Project called Grandpa, <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> I Am?, including describing a moment when she decided to stop trying to correct his various delusions.|$|E
2500|$|When they {{approached}} Trax Records, Sanders and Lewis called themselves M.E., {{a reference to}} their initials, [...] "with a possible nod to the Gary Numan tune {{of the same name}} as well." [...] However, and despite Sanders' complaints, label head Larry Sherman insisted in releasing half of the material under the pseudonym Virgo Four as an effort to associate the duo with Virgo, a sort of supergroup consisting of Marshall Jefferson, Vince Lawrence, and Adonis. In 1989, the material was released as two 12" [...] EPs in the United States - <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> You Are? by Virgo Four, and later Ride by M.E. The same year, the tracks were compiled and released as a CD album titled Virgo in the United Kingdom. It was licensed to Radical Records (also known as Radikal), the house offshoot of 80s urban label StreetSounds. Since its release, several bootleg editions of the album appeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it? <b>Who</b> told <b>you?</b> Did Kendricks? I don't believe it!" [...] {{she cried}} in an {{excitement}} not unmixed with resentment.|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor woman}} dropped into {{her chair and}} hid her face from me. [...] "Oh, sir," [...] she said, [...] "how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it? <b>Who</b> can have told you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to make}} thirty {{thousand}} dollars as soon as I can, {{and it seems to}} me there are going to be opportunities in this business. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> anybody <b>who</b> would take me as clerk or salesman?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The first side of Virgo {{includes}} Virgo Four's <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> You Are? EP. Its opening track, [...] "Do You Know Who You Are", {{features an}} [...] "odd, nagging, guitar line" [...] reminiscent of funk music. Following track [...] "In a Vision" [...] {{has been described}} as [...] "strutting space-age bleep-house". Electro rhythms can be heard on [...] "Take Me Higher", a track with [...] "euphorically melancholic reggaematics". Richard Carnes of Resident Advisor felt that [...] "Going Thru Life"'s [...] "lolloping piano riff" [...] showcases the duo's [...] "visceral approach to music making." [...] He also considered that the Ride material - included as the album's second side - [...] "should really be looked upon as a different entity to the first half", as it features a [...] "darker and more vocal-led direction to their first EP." [...] He added that Ride [...] "could easily slot into a set of contemporary techno." [...] A [...] "low-slung house" [...] track, [...] "School Hall" [...] alludes to the high school parties were Lewis and Sanders were introduced to house music. [...] "Never Want To Lose You" [...] has been referred to as [...] "jacking balladry". Closing track [...] "All the Time" [...] {{has been described as}} [...] "a spirited attempt to introduce the sound of slap bass into the lexicon of house." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty fool you've {{been making}} of {{yourself}} to-night, Edith," [...] {{he said in}} a tone of suppressed anger, [...] "with that fellow Carvalho. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> he is, miss? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> he is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Self-conceit? What is it? Self-respect, {{self-tolerance}} even, {{what are}} they? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> sell the articles? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> anybody <b>who</b> <b>does?</b> Give an indication. They would find in me a liberal chapman. I would part with my last guinea this minute to buy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is indeed, Beric, {{the child}} you saved from death. And {{this is your}} wife Aemilia, the {{daughter}} of Norbanus, who is the uncle of my husband Pollio. And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> that is standing there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|An {{abandoned}} race-track on {{the outskirts}} of Chicago, a plot excellent for factory sites, was to be sold, and Jake Offut asked Babbitt to bid on it for him. The strain of the Street Traction deal and his disappointment in Stanley Graff had so shaken Babbitt that he found it hard to sit at his desk and concentrate. He proposed to his family, [...] "Look here, folks! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who's</b> going to trot up to Chicago for a couple of days--just week-end; won't lose but one day of school--know who's going with that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt? Why, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And to {{talk about}} birdcages, too!' whimpered the Grinder. 'As If that was a crime! Why, look'ee here! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> this belongs to?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Who {{were those}} two?' asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog. 'You {{have been in}} this yard longer than I have. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> they are?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{are only}} sick fancies?' he retorted. 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about fancies? <b>Who</b> {{told you about}} fancies? The old story! Fancies!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend!" [...] roared the Boolooroo. [...] "I haven't {{a friend}} in the country. Tell me, sir, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of anyone <b>who</b> is my friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] added Friedel, after a breathless space, [...] "he is on {{the lower}} parapet, whence begins the stair. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> him, sir? <b>Who</b> is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} there is {{something}} to be said--and it is difficult, but Hetty is my sister, after all. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> gave her that locket?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{of those}} fellows are that Jimson and Dan Baxter!" [...] he whispered. [...] "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> {{is in the}} wagon, on the rear seat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] Staunton declared. [...] "One more question. You {{say that}} on the {{committee}} of the Rifle Club was a German officer. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> he was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tush, man, {{you talk}} {{nonsense}} anyway; for even if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> this Scarlet Pimpernel is, <b>you</b> could <b>do</b> nothing to him--an Englishman!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> gentlemen, <b>who</b> {{this fellow}} is?" [...] he inquired, {{with an air}} of sly amusement. [...] "He is--Nay, you shall judge for yourselves. You shall hear the story of how we met; {{it is the story of}} his {{abduction}} of a lady whose name need not be mentioned; the story of his dastardly attempt to cozen her into a mock-marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! <b>do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> Miss Williams is? I am {{sure you}} must have heard of her before. She is a {{relation}} of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies." [...] Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor, [...] "She is his natural daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have returned, then, Sir Allan?" [...] she said, {{looking up}} at him with a smile. [...] "Have you heard the news? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> is expected?" ...|$|E
