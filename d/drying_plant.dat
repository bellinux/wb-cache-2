40|$|Essential oils of Mentha longifolia from Senegal were {{extracted}} from fresh <b>plants</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>plants</b> {{in the shade}} for 7 days. The yields were of 0. 39 and 0. 32 % in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants</b> respectively. Analysis of the essential oils, floral waters and the assay of pulegone were carried out by GC/FID and GC/MS. The major compounds identified in the oils were pulegone (52. 0 and 42. 4 %), menthone (14. 3 and 21. 2 %), 1, 8 -cineole (13. 1 and 11. 4 %) and isomenthone (9. 0 and 13. 2 %) in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively. Analyses revealed that floral waters were also characterized by the same major compounds as essential oils but at different rates. In these floral waters, pulegone constituted 60. 2 and 47. 0 %, 1, 8 - cineole 7. 9 and 19. 6 %, isomenthone 7. 2 and 10. 7 %, menthone 6. 4 and 9. 2 %, chrysanthenone 6. 4 and 3. 2 % and α-terpineol 3. 0 and 2. 7 % in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively.

50|$|The Peace River Phosphate Co. {{had built}} a narrow gauge {{railroad}} north of Arcadia to their load-outs along the Peace River. Like the Comer & Hull operations, the ore was hauled to the <b>drying</b> <b>plant</b> at Arcadia where it was loaded into the narrow gauge boxcars of the Florida Southern. When the railroad converted its Charlotte Harbor Division to standard gauge in 1892, both the Peace River Phosphate Co. and Comer & Hull operations converted their respective railroads. Joseph Hull of Comer & Hull purchased 50% interest in the Peace River Phosphate Co. about this time.|$|E
50|$|A small {{axial flow}} fan was {{constructed}} {{in the base of}} each silo. This was attached to perforated ducting, which sat {{on the floor of the}} silo. When in operation, the fan blew cool dry air, which was distributed via the ducting throughout the bin. This reduced the temperature of the maize within the structure to a level at which insect and mould development could not occur. A combination of drying and cooling using this method enabled the maize to be maintained in a sound and fresh condition for long periods. Cleaning equipment was located at each silo complex, while a <b>drying</b> <b>plant</b> was established at the Atherton silos to process maize with a moisture content exceeding 14 percent.|$|E

50|$|Dr. W.W. Bowen {{established}} the Brunswick Institute of Pharmacy in 1910. The school would train more than 5,000 pharmacists and druggists before closing in 1937. In 1914, farmers organized the Missouri Farmers Association (MFA), a cooperative, based in Brunswick. It has since moved to Columbia, Missouri. Brunswick saw a growth of industry through the mid-20th century, {{with the construction}} of an alfalfa <b>drying</b> <b>plant</b> constructed in 1939, the Chariton Electric Company in 1958, in 1965 the opening of the Tuloma Fertilizer blending plant, and in 1970 the establishment of a glove factory.

50|$|In September 1915 {{the mining}} company {{applied to the}} mining {{authorities}} in Senftenberg {{for the construction of}} a Bertzit unit (named after the Bertzit procedure described below). The Bertzit tower was built in 1920 on the initiative of the management of the company running the mine Ada. It is 35 meters high and situated in close proximity to the mine.The tower has a square floor plan with a skeleton construction made of reinforced concrete. It was intended to be part of a coal <b>drying</b> <b>plant,</b> which would use the Bertzit procedure invented by Camillo Mahnhardt from Munich, to dry the lignite. This procedure was developed for the drying of inferior and moister fuels such as peat. The procedure was tested in Pasing near Munich and seemed to be more appealing financially. It promised a cost efficient product enhancement through the doubling of the fuel value. Furthermore, the mine had high lignite deposits, which were ideal for this procedure. It was intended to extract a high quality, anthracite coal-like product using an air-sealed reaction between 250 °C and 300 °C. The majority shareholders of the project were the Bertzit-Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin-Charlottenburg and the Bertzit-Gesellschaft mbH in Munich. The Döllinger mining company was probably just a minority shareholder, but was still a board member. In later years the headquarters of the young company moved to Munich.|$|E
