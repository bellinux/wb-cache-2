40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the length, internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters,</b> cancellous bone volume and extent, and cortical thickness at predetermined locations in the radius and ulna of a cohort of skeletally mature, disease-free feline cadavers using radiography and computed tomography (CT). Methods: Five feline cadavers were used (mean weight 3. 31 kg, range 2. 55 – 4. 24 kg). Antebrachii (n = 10) were radiographed to confirm skeletal maturity and normal radiographic appearance prior to CT. Reconstructed CT images were used to measure bone length, cortical thickness, internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters,</b> and cancellous extent. Cancellous bone volume was calculated automatically using OsiriX after manual segmentation (350 – 850 Hounsfield units window) from axial CT slices. Results: CT images were used to measure bone length, cortical thickness, internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters,</b> and cancellous extent and volume. Mean radial length was 95. 89 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI] 88. 52 – 103. 26 mm) and mean ulna length was 114. 67 mm (95 % CI 105. 53 – 123. 81 mm). The olecranon had the largest mean cancellous bone volume (94. 16 mm 3; 95 % CI 72. 09 – 116. 23 mm 3) and it extended a mean of 13. 12 mm (95 % CI 11. 73 – 14. 51 mm) distally. The radius {{at the level of}} the trochlea and the ulna {{at the level of the}} coronoid processes had the largest <b>external</b> <b>diameters,</b> respectively. The medullary canal narrowed at the level of the coronoid processes and became cranially eccentric at the proximal third of the diaphysis. The cranial cortex at the level of the coronoid processes and the caudal cortex of the olecranon were markedly thicker than other cortices at those levels. Conclusions and relevance: Morphometry of the feline antebrachium was described using CT, and should be a useful reference for future research investigations and clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{changes of}} the {{peripheral}} vascular component as seen during hypertension and atherosclerosis have been suggested during heart failure but have never been reported. Therefore, we studied possible structural alterations in the peripheral vasculature in an experimental model of heart failure, induced by ligation of the left coronary artery in rats. Large conduit and resistance-type arteries were excised at 1, 3, 5, and 12 weeks after myocardial infarct induction (MI) or sham surgery. Vessel dimensions (medial cross-sectional area [CSA], internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters,</b> and media-to-lumen ratios) as well as medial collagen and elastin volume fractions were measured by computerized morphometry. The hydroxyproline assay {{was used to determine}} collagen and elastin content biochemically. In separate groups of animals, peripheral tissue flows were measured by using radioactive microspheres 5 and 12 weeks after MI. To evaluate the effects of the degree of heart failure, the animals of the 12 -week group (n = 10) were subdivided into groups of moderate (45 % infarct size) infarction. At all time points, body weights of sham-operated and MI rats were comparable. Lung weights of infarcted animals were increased proportionally to infarct size. No major changes in vessel dimensions were seen at the earlier time points. Twelve weeks after coronary artery ligation, significantly smaller CSAs were observed in several large conduit arteries such as the thoracic aorta, carotid artery, and superior mesenteric artery. These changes coincided with reductions in both internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters.</b> In contrast, internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters</b> of mesenteric and pulmonary resistance arteries were increased after 12 weeks of coronary artery ligation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION It {{has been}} {{recognised}} in industry that {{the measurement of}} large components to high orders of accuracy presents a particularly difficult problem. This fact has been emphasised by a survey {{carried out by the}} N. P. L. (Ref. 1) in which a number of engineering firms in Great Britain were asked to declare the size of several prepared test pieces ranging in diameter from 15 inches to 80 inches. In general terms the result of this investigation showed that, under industrial conditions using conventional equipment, it was not possible V declare the size of large components to an accuracy of better than - 30 parts in a million under workshop conditions and - 15 parts in a million under inspection conditions. The survey also showed that above 20 inches the accuracy of determination of internal diameters was somewhat higher than for <b>external</b> <b>diameters.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to indicate the main problems associated with measuring large sizes and to describe the experimental work undertaken at the College of Aeronautics in the design and testing of a new type of stick micrometer for internal diameters and micrometer frame for <b>external</b> <b>diameters...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In the Normand boiler, {{the tubes}} were {{comparatively}} straight and {{a portion of}} those in the inner and outer rows of each bank were formed into [...] "tube walls" [...] to direct hot gases generated by the furnace through the boiler. In the Reed boiler, the tubes were bent into pronounced curves of varying radii to maximise surface area and therefore steam production, and baffles were used to direct hot gases. Further, the <b>external</b> <b>diameter</b> of the tubes tapered at their lower ends from inches (27mm) to inch (22mm) to improve the passage of hot gases between them. They were connected perpendicularly to the chambers at each end, as were the tubes in the Normand boiler, to reduce stress. However, in the Reed boiler these connections were made by hemispherical faces, which allowed [...] "a certain angular play". The tubes were secured by nuts inside the chambers at each end. Handholes gave access to the bottom chambers, and a manhole gave access to the top chamber. In both types of boiler, the tubes joined the top chamber below the designed water line to stop them overheating, and large, external [...] "down-comer" [...] tubes transferred water from the top chamber to the two bottom ones. The down-comers thus promoted convection within the boiler, which needed to be rapid because of the small diameter of the tubes, and formed [...] "a substantial part of [...] framework." ...|$|E

METHODS: Ninety male Wistar rats (250 - 300 g) were randomly divided into six groups: control+saline (C 1), control+BoNTA (C 2), tobacco-exposed+saline (T 1), tobacco-exposed+BoNTA (T 2) diabetes+saline (D 1) and diabetes+BoNTA (D 2). A dorsal cutaneous flap (3 × 10 cm) was performed. Survival area and total area of the flaps were measured. Lumen <b>diameter,</b> <b>external</b> arterial <b>diameter</b> and lumen/wall thickness ratio were recorded. RESULTS: Survival area increased in control group with BoNTA injection compared with control animals injected with saline (C 2 x C 1; 0. 9 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 67 ± 0. 15, p= 0. 001). A similar result was found in diabetes group injected with BontA (D 2 x D 1; 0. 97 ± 0. 2 vs 0. 61 ± 0. 24, p= 0. 018). No difference was observed in skin flap viability in tobacco-exposed groups (T 2 x T 1; 0. 74 ± 0. 24 vs 0. 64 ± 0. 21, p= 0. 871).

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{internal and}} <b>external</b> retinal arteriolar <b>diameters</b> and {{to evaluate the}} relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and retinal arteriolar diameter in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods This single-site, prospective, cross-sectional study included 20 patients with POAG (20 eyes) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (20 eyes) with no history of systemic vascular disease. The internal and <b>external</b> <b>diameters</b> of the arterioles were assessed in-vivo by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry. RNFL thickness was measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Results Both the internal and <b>external</b> arteriolar <b>diameters</b> were smaller in eyes with POAG than in control eyes, although only the internal diameters were significantly smaller (P = 0. 04 versus P = 0. 23). A multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between RNFL thickness and both external (P = 0. 024) and internal (P = 0. 003) arteriolar diameters in eyes with POAG. No significant correlation was found between RNFL thickness and these variables in the control group. Conclusions The internal arteriolar diameter was smaller in patients with POAG than in normal subjects, and was significantly correlated with RNFL thickness in POAG patients. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to report that a narrower internal arteriolar diameter may be related to RNFL thinning in POAG patients...|$|R
