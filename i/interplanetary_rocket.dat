In his 1925 paper [...] "Проблема полета при помощи реактивных аппаратов: межпланетные полеты" [...] of flight by jet propulsion: interplanetary flights, [...] Friedrich Zander made a similar argument.|$|E
50|$|He is the {{dictator}} of Saturn {{and he wants}} to conquer Earth but his plans fail thanks to Dr. Marcus and Ciro. In the 1960s Carlo Chendi and Luciano Bottaro decided to reuse the character in Disney stories: Rebo made his debut in Disney stories in Paperino e il razzo interplanetario (literally Donald Duck and the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>rocket,</b> 1960) in which he tries to conquer Jupiter but his plans fail thanks to Donald. Luciano Bottaro created in the 1990s other three stories about Rebo and his attempts to conquer Earth and Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|The cartoon {{opens with}} a {{narrative}} about man's desire {{to break away from}} Earth and explore outer space (the moon being the first goal in this quest). After many unsuccessful attempts to launch rockets to the moon (including three scientists trying to launch a typical firework rocket that blows up in their faces), Professor Dingledong becomes the first man to reach the moon, but, two years later, hasn't returned to Earth. In the present day, at the <b>Interplanetary</b> <b>Rocket</b> Society, Professor P. Cosmo Clonk asks the other scientists if one of them will volunteer for the next manned mission to the moon. The scientists just look at each other until it boils down to Fido, the society's mascot, but Fido gulps and immediately pretends to have the measles.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was sold}} at many newsstands around the United States. The back cover of Avon Fantasy Reader carried this blurb: [...] Past, Present, or Future or {{whatever}} sector {{of time and}} space you prefer, you'll find the stories in these pages encompass the entire universe of imagination. From the eerie, spook-haunted corridors of ancient Asian castles to the water-choked avenues of Atlantean kingdoms... From the sinister sands of icy Martian deserts to the thunderbolt battles of future's <b>interplanetary</b> <b>rockets.</b> Neither the invisible energy of atom nor the monstrous matter of the Milky Way present barriers to the mind that author these amazing fantasies. There are no boundaries to the astonishment, thrills and chills you'll meet in the pages of... the Avon Fantasy Reader! ...|$|R

5000|$|In theory, MPD {{thrusters}} {{could produce}} extremely high specific impulses (Isp) with an exhaust velocity {{of up to}} and beyond , triple the value of current xenon-based ion thrusters, and about 25 times better than liquid rockets. MPD technology also {{has the potential for}} thrust levels of up to 200 newtons (N) (...) , by far the highest for any form of electric propulsion, and nearly as high as many <b>interplanetary</b> chemical <b>rockets.</b> [...] This would allow use of electric propulsion on missions which require quick delta-v maneuvers (such as capturing into orbit around another planet), but with many times greater fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 Italian Disney artists Carlo Chendi (script) and Luciano Bottaro (art) {{created a}} story, Paperino e il razzo interplanetario (literally Donald Duck and the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>rocket),</b> in which Rebo made his debut in Disney comics. In this story Rebo is the farcical {{dictator}} of Saturn, whose population was reduced (because of war) {{to a total}} of three (Rebo and his two helpers). Rebo wants to conquer Jupiter. When he finds out that the famous inventor Gyro Gearloose is on Jupiter with Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck and Huey, Dewey and Louie, he decides to kidnap him to force him to create fighting robots. Unfortunately his helpers mistake Donald Duck for Gyro, so they kidnap him. Donald Duck is forced by Rebo to create fighting robots, but thanks to Donald's inability, they are ineffective so the invasion of Jupiter fails. Donald escapes and returns to Jupiter where he is celebrated as a hero by Jupiter's inhabitants.|$|E
5000|$|Woody {{places a}} {{door on the}} ground and opens it so that Dingledong falls through the doorway and deep underground. After {{removing}} the door, Woody gets back aboard the rocket and prepares to return to Earth, but Dingledong (having reappeared) forces him at gunpoint to bring him back to Earth. Straight after the rocket blasts off, it leaves Dingledong behind, making him say [...] "Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles." [...] The rocket, however, returns and snags Dingledong onto its nose, making him burn his butt upon reentering the Earth's atmosphere. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, the rocket zips around the Los Angeles City Hall and crashes into the top floor, where the scientists of the <b>Interplanetary</b> <b>Rocket</b> Society (plus Fido) are having their latest meeting. Dingledong crashes through the table and right into Professor Clonk, at which both professors shout out each other's names to each other (indicating Dingledong was part of the society).|$|E
50|$|A {{spaceport}} (or cosmodrome) is a {{site for}} launching (or receiving) spacecraft, by analogy with seaport for ships or airport for aircraft. The word spaceport, {{and even more so}} cosmodrome, has traditionally been used for sites that are capable of launching spacecraft into orbit around Earth or on <b>interplanetary</b> trajectories. However, <b>rocket</b> launch sites for purely sub-orbital flights are sometimes called spaceports, as in recent years new and proposed sites for suborbital human flights have been frequently referred to or named 'spaceports'. Space stations and proposed future bases on the moon are sometimes called spaceports, in particular if intended as a base for further journeys.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{laws governing}} launch vehicles are reviewed, {{together with the}} performance of launch vehicles thus far used and expected developments in space transportation systems. Launches are generally made in the direction of earth rotation {{to take advantage of the}} initial velocity in that direction, which can amount to about 0. 46 km/sec at the equator. Spacecraft usually attain a parking orbit, where spacecraft conditions are assessed before moving on to final orbit or <b>interplanetary</b> trajectory. <b>Rocket</b> batteries were first used in a battle near Beijing in 1232, and manned space flight began with the Vostok flight in 1961, followed by the Apollo lunar landings in the later 1960 s. Rocket thrust performance is analyzed, together with the thrust/mass ratio for ascent and descent. The Shuttle, capable of placing 29. 5 t in LEO, will be or is equipped to also carry IUS and PAM engines for transferring payloads from LEO to GEO. Parallel burn boosters may be added to increase the payload capability, and Shuttle-derived launch vehicles may be developed to carry construction materials to space and return to earth for a runway landing. Alternatively, the Shuttle engines may be modularized in order to develop a heavy-lift launch vehicle for unmanned cargo ascents...|$|R
50|$|Development {{work began}} in earnest before 2012 when SpaceX began design work for the large Raptor rocket engine {{to be used for}} both the ITS launch vehicle and {{spacecraft}} (ITS tanker and <b>Interplanetary</b> Spaceship). New <b>rocket</b> engine designs are typically considered one of the longest of the development subprocesses for new launch vehicles and spacecraft. By June 2016, the company publicly announced conceptual plans that included the first Mars-bound cargo flight of ITS launching no earlier than 2022, followed by the first ITS Mars flight with passengers one synodic period later in 2024, following two preparatory research launches of Mars probes in 2018 and 2020 on Dragon/Falcon Heavy equipment. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled details of the system architecture at the 67th International Astronautical Congress on September 27, 2016.|$|R
50|$|Interstellar Low Ways is {{an album}} {{recorded}} by the American jazz musician Sun Ra and his Myth Science Arkestra, mostly recorded in Chicago, 1960, and probably released in 1966 on his own Saturn label. Originally titled Rocket Number Nine, the album had acquired its present name, and the red-on-white sleeve by Claude Dangerfield, by 1969. The album is known particularly for the two songs featuring space chants - <b>Interplanetary</b> Music and <b>Rocket</b> Number Nine Take off for the Planet Venus - that would stay in the Arkestras repertoire for many years;Rocket Number Nine points toward the music that the Arkestra would be playing on the lower East Side of New York City. The tenor sax solo isnt the work of John Coltrane in 1962, but of John Gilmore in 1960. And not even Ornette Colemans bassists were playing like Ronnie Boykins at this date. Robert CampbellWhen reissued by Evidence, Interstellar Low Ways was included as {{the second half of}} a CD that also featured the whole of Sun Ra and his Solar Arkestra Visits Planet Earth.|$|R
