5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington {{told them he}} had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E
25|$|Bradnum was exhumed on 21 December 1956. Adams {{had said}} on the death {{certificate}} that Bradnum died of a cerebral haemorrhage.

It was noticed that Adams, the executor, had put a plate on Bradnum's coffin stating she died on 27 May 1952. This was the date her body was interred.|$|E

After a fight with another landlord, she was arrested for assault, but {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity and placed under state supervision for eight years. She was released in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Some time later, Japp phones Poirot {{and tells}} him Winnie has been found about fifteen miles from Amiens. She is in a daze, has been doped {{according}} to the doctor who <b>examined</b> <b>her,</b> and is unable to remember much after setting off from her home town of Cranchester. She remembers nothing of meeting one of Miss Pope's staff, Miss Burshaw, in London before the trip to France. Despite the girl being found, Poirot speaks with Detective Inspector Hearn, who has been dealing with the case and is no nearer to solving the mystery of how the girl disappeared. The only {{other people in the}} carriage seemed clear of suspicion – two middle-aged spinsters, two French commercial travellers from Lyon, a young man called James Elliot and his flashy wife, and an American lady about whom very little is known. He is able to confirm that Winnie's shoes were found by the rail line which confirms Poirot's theory.|$|E

500|$|In appearance, Helena was {{described}} by John Van der Kiste as plump and dowdy; and in temperament, as placid, and business-like, with an authoritarian spirit. On one occasion, during a National Dock Strike, the Archbishop of Canterbury composed a prayer hoping for its prompt end. Helena arrived at the church, <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> service sheet, and in a voice described by her daughter as [...] "the penetrating royal family whisper, which carried farther than any megaphone", remarked: [...] "That prayer won't settle any strike." [...] Her appearance and personality was criticised in the letters and journals of Queen Victoria, and biographers followed her example. However, Helena's daughter, Princess Marie Louise, described her as: ...|$|E

500|$|In her writing, Frank <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> {{relationships}} {{with the members of}} her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's much nicer... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2009, 20-year-old Adele, who had {{recently}} embarked on her first serious relationship with a man 10 years her senior, began composing the follow-up to her 2008 debut album 19. In response to the media's typecasting her as an [...] "old soul" [...] due to the vintage production and sentimental nature of her songs, Adele decided on a more upbeat and contemporary second album. However, studio sessions were generally unproductive and, after two weeks, yielded only one song recorded to the singer's satisfaction—the Jim Abbiss-produced [...] "Take It All", a lovelorn piano ballad not unlike the songs on 19. Disillusioned with her lack of inspiration and the slow progress of the studio sessions, she cancelled the remaining recording dates. Adele had written [...] "Take It All" [...] during a difficult moment in her relationship. When she played the song for her boyfriend, the two got into a bitter argument that culminated {{in the end of}} their 18-month relationship. Heartbroken but musically stimulated, the singer channelled her rush of emotions into her music, crafting songs that <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> failed relationship from the perspectives of vengeful ex-lover, heartbroken victim, and nostalgic old flame.|$|E
500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E

500|$|Five {{women of}} Lynnhaven Parish Church {{examined}} Sherwood's naked {{body on the}} shoreline for any devices she might have to free herself, and then covered her with a sack. Six of the justices that had ordered the ducking rowed in one boat [...] out in the river, and in another were the sheriff, the magistrate, and Sherwood. Just before she was pushed off the boat Sherwood {{is said to have}} stated, under clear skies, [...] "Before this day be through you will all get a worse ducking than I." [...] Bound across the body—her right thumb to her left big toe and her left thumb to her right big toe– she was [...] "cast into the river", and quickly floated to the surface. The sheriff then tied a [...] Bible around her neck. This caused her to sink, but she untied herself, and returned to the surface, convincing many spectators she was a witch. As Sherwood was pulled out of the water a downpour reportedly started, drenching the onlookers. Several women who subsequently <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> for additional proof found [...] "two things like titts on her private parts of a black coller [...] ". She was jailed pending further proceedings.|$|E
500|$|The next day, on 14 July 1999, Cameron's {{daughter}} Avril took Climbié to see Marie Cader, a French {{teacher at}} her son's school. Cader advised that Climbié {{be taken to}} hospital. At 11:00 am the same day, Avril took Climbié to the emergency department of Central Middlesex Hospital. At 11:50am, Climbié was seen by Dr Rhys Beynon, a senior house officer in the department. Beynon took Climbié's history from Avril and {{thought that there was}} a strong possibility that the injuries were non-accidental. Due to hospital child protection guidelines, he referred the case to Dr Ekundayo Ajayi-Obe, the on-call paediatric registrar. Beynon conducted only a cursory examination of Climbié because he believed {{she was going to be}} examined by the paediatric team. The Laming report said that [...] "he exhibited sound judgement in his care of Victoria by referring her immediately to a paediatric registrar." [...] Climbié arrived at Barnaby Bear ward where she was examined by Ajayi-Obe, who noted various injuries. When asked about the injuries, Climbié said they were self-inflicted, a claim the paediatrician did not think was credible. Ajayi-Obe's notes were detailed and thorough, in contrast to those of the other doctors that <b>examined</b> <b>her.</b> Having examined Climbié, the paediatrician was [...] "strongly suspicious" [...] that the injuries were non-accidental, and she decided to admit Climbié onto the ward.|$|E
500|$|On 24 February 2000, Victoria Climbié {{was taken}} semi-conscious and {{suffering}} from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition, {{to the local}} Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. With {{the advice of the}} pastor, a mini-cab was called to send Climbié to the hospital. The mini cab driver was horrified at Climbié's condition and sent her to the nearby Tottenham Ambulance Station instead. Climbié was rushed straight to the accident-and-emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital; she was then transferred to the intensive-care unit at St Mary's Hospital. The ambulance crew who drove her to St Mary's described how although Kouao had kept saying, [...] "my baby, my baby", her concern seemed [...] "not quite enough", and that Manning seemed [...] "almost as if he was not there". Climbié died the following day at 3:15pm local time. The pathologist who <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> body noted 128 separate injuries and scars on her body, and described it as the worst case of child abuse she had ever seen; Climbié had been burnt with cigarettes, tied up for periods of longer than 24 hours, and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires. During her life in Britain, Climbié was known to four local authorities (four social services departments and three housing departments), two child protection police teams, two hospitals, an NSPCC centre, and a few local churches. She was buried in Grand-Bassam near her home town.|$|E

2500|$|August 1939 – Adams was {{treating}} Agnes Pike. Her solicitors {{were concerned}} {{at the amount}} of hypnotic drugs he was giving her and asked another doctor, Dr Mathew, to take over treatment. Mathew <b>examined</b> <b>her</b> in Adams's presence but could find no disease present. The patient was [...] "deeply under the influence of drugs", incoherent and gave her age as 200 years. Later during the examination Adams stepped forward unexpectedly and gave Pike an injection of morphia. Asked why he did this, Adams replied [...] "because she might be violent". Mathew discovered that Adams had banned all relatives from seeing her. Mathew withdrew Adams's medication and after eight weeks of his care, Pike was able to do her own shopping and had regained her full faculties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{victim was}} a young adult, between {{eighteen}} and twenty-two years of age.

[...] When found, her body was in an advanced state of decomposition rendering her facially unrecognizable and her eye color undetermined.
