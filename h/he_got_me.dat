5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E
2500|$|When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs {{was given}} a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an {{electronics}} project: [...] "He didn't know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters...well, assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn't matter; I was in heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{production}} by Wilson, the Beach Boys covered Bacharach's [...] "My Little Red Book" [...] and [...] "Walk On By" [...] in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased. Wilson {{has said that}} Bacharach was a direct influence on his [...] "She Knows Me Too Well", [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile", and [...] "Love and Mercy". Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". Discussing [...] "Let's Go Away", Wilson said: [...] "there {{were a lot of}} chord changes similar to the way he would put something together. And I think that his music had such a profound thing on my head; <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> going in a direction." [...] He mentions [...] "minor seventh chords" [...] as a specific point of influence.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{was born}} in Sydney, but {{has spent most of}} his life in Perth, Western Australia. Parker's father, Jerry, was from Zimbabwe and his mother, Rosalind, is from South Africa. Parker's parents {{separated}} and divorced when he was 3. From the age of 12 he lived in Cottesloe with his father, stepmother Rhonda and brother Stephen. [...] Older brother Stuart resided in Brisbane. [...] He also has a younger sister, Helen, from his mother's second marriage. Parker grew up with a passion for music from a young age. Parker's father [...] "played a lot of music as a hobby" [...] and was a [...] "big part of [...] musical upbringing". His first experience playing an instrument was accompanying his father on guitar, [...] "I learned guitar by playing rhythm guitar to his Shadows leads. He wanted to play Shadows lead riffs, because he loves Hank B. Marvin, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> to play the chords in the background." [...] Parker's father also played music by The Beatles, The Beach Boys and Supertramp in a cover band, which Parker believes was where he [...] "got [...] love of melody", which has been a significant part of Parker's music. Parker also recalls [...] "amusing self by singing along to the vacuum cleaner when [...] mum was cleaning." [...] Parker's father later purchased Kevin his first guitar.|$|E
2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
