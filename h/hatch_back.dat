It is rumored that only 11 of these smaller Vans were built and sold as the CitiVan but an unknown more were built and sold in 1979 as the first year Comuta-Van. The main design differences between the 1979 Comuta-Van and the later Postal Comuta-Van is that the much smaller 1979 Comuta-Van has swing out side doors and a <b>hatch</b> <b>back</b> window. The much larger Postal Comuta-Van has sliding side doors and a swing out rear entrance door.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the use of glass-mat-thermoplastic (GMT) {{composite}} to replace steel in spare-wheel wells (SWW) by European automakers and tier suppliers. Although this application has been successfully translated across multiple OEMs and platforms in this geography for 10 years, it is still little known and less understood in the Americas and Asia/Pacific despite its numerous advantages. In an attempt to help automakers and tier suppliers {{in other parts of}} the world understand the benefits of this technology, the paper will discuss OEM performance criteria, design requirements, tooling and manufacturing of the part, as well as requirements for finished assembly into the vehicle vs. traditional steel systems. Background and Requirements The spare-wheel well is a common component on most passenger vehicles with a trunk or rear <b>hatch</b> (<b>back</b> door). This round or square pan is mounted into the trunk opening, where it holds an extra wheel, tire iron, and jack. A loadfloor made from particleboard, natural-fiber composite sheet, a honeycomb-polypropylene-sheet sandwich construction, or straight GMT usually covers it.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} and scalability of RANS and LES approaches applied to external automotive aerodynamics. Due to {{the availability of}} considerable experimental and computational data available on the Ahmed body, this reference model was chosen for this study. The relative simple geometry of the Ahmed body model is able reproduce the common flow features of a <b>hatch</b> <b>back</b> style vehicle. The 25 ° slant angle configuration was used {{as it is a}} major challenge in terms of flow prediction. The RANS model used included the Standard K-ε, RNG K-ε, Realizable k-ε and K-ω SST. The LES simulations were run with the Smagorinsky-Lilly SGS model. Three grids with different level of refinement were generated. A viscous hybrid mesh approach was used for all the simulations. This type of mesh is commonly used by automotive manufactures and motorsport organizations. The commercial package Fluent 12 was used as a solver. The K-ω SST and LES models showed good agreement with the experimental data. LES in particular was the only model to predict flow re-attachment over the slant angle as seen on the experimental and computational data available in literature. The richness of the unsteady data available from the LES simulations and correct interpretation of flow topology balance in part the major computational requirements compared to the RANS models. Taking into account the hardware resources available to automotive manufactures, the LES is suitable {{to be part of the}} design process...|$|E
40|$|There are a {{range of}} objects {{that appear to be}} almost {{ubiquitous}} in countries in the global North. In households in Britain, for instance, a number of objects that once would have marked you out as socially distinct (as a technological pioneer, for instance, or as someone with enough disposable income to indulge in luxury goods) are now more noticeable by their absence. A household without central-heating is today more remarkable than one with such a system. Socially ‘indistinct’ groups of objects in over-developed countries might include cars, mobile (and not so mobile) phones, washing machines, denim jeans, refrigerators, radios, computers, TVs, and so on. But of course these are also objects that can be, and often are, inflected as socially distinct objects: after all there is a marked difference between a brand new Ferrari, a second-hand ‘people carrier’, and a souped-up <b>hatch</b> <b>back.</b> What does not mark you out is having a car; what marks you out is having a particular car. Indeed, the world of cars and car advertising is a semiotic field of intense differentiation. As cultural and social historians how should we attend to this field of objects that from one perspective lack distinction? What are the differences that make a difference: the myriad of small differences that inflect the world of car-ownership according to differences of class, gender, age, ethnicity, aspiration, politics, and so on; or the longue durée of human mobility and motility in which generalised private motorised transport is a key component? Is the fact of mass motoring of more or less significance than the way an industry has found sophisticated ways of inducing consumer desire and envy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{automobile}} industry {{today is the}} most lucrative industry. Due to increase in disposable income in both rural and urban sector and availability of easy finance are the main drivers of high volume car segments. Further competition is heating up with host of new players coming in and global brands like Porsche, Bentley, and Ferrari all set to venture in Indian market. This research will be helpful for the existing and new entrant car manufacturing companies in India {{to find out the}} customer expectations and their market offerings. Indian Automobile car business is influenced by the presence of many national and multinational manufacturers. This paper presents analysis of {{research in the area of}} Consumer Behavior of Automobile Car Customer. Proper understanding of consumer buying behavior will help the marketer to succeed in the market. All segments in Indian Car industry were studied and found that buyer has different priority of behaviors in each segment, where as main driver for car purchase is disposable income. Value for money, safety and driving comforts top the rank in terms of customer requirement; where as perceived quality by customers mainly depends on brand image. For this research, methodology adopted was to study the research papers in the area of Passenger Car segment, study the purchase decision process and its interaction with behavior parameters across all the segments of car such as small & <b>Hatch</b> <b>Back</b> segment, Sedan class segment, SUV & MUV segment and Luxury Car segment. The objective of this study is the identification of factors influencing customer’s preferences for particular segment of cars.

This examination will be useful for the current and new participant auto fabricating organizations in India to discover the client desires and their market offerings. Coimbatore auto business is impacted {{by the presence of}} numerous national and multinational car makers. This paper presents investigation of research in the zone of Consumer Behaviour of Automobile Car Customer at the geographical coverage of Coimbatore. Appropriate comprehension of buyer purchasing conduct will help the advertiser to prevail in the market.
