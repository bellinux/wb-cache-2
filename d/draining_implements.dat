This paper discusses the performance of ground improvement by pre-compression and vertical <b>drain</b> <b>implemented</b> {{for the construction of}} permanent campus of Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) in Kuala Pahang, Pekan. The comparison was made in terms of engineering properties of the soil such as shear strength and compressibility characteristics before and after improvement and the achievement of criteria in terms of time and post construction settlement. The soil investigation showed that subsoil profile consisted of four layers whereby the thickness of compressible layer varies from 6 to 14 m. Settlement monitoring showed that the required pre-construction settlement was achieved in less than six months after the completion of ground improvement by pre-compression. Installation of the vertical in swampy area further reduced the consolidation time to about one month. The undrained shear strength (Su) of the soft compressible layer increased from 6 - 30 kPa to about 67 kPa while the compression index (Cc) decreased from about 0. 2 - 0. 6 to about 0. 33. The coefficient of consolidation (Cv) of the soft soil layer decreases from 6 m 2 /yr - 21 m 2 /yr to about 2. 11 m 2 /yr - 3. 64 m 2 /yr due to compaction and consolidation process. ...|$|R

Governments have attempted to reverse the flow of brain <b>drain</b> through <b>implementing</b> new contracts, scholarships, government policies, and several other methods. Three methods of implementing and enhancing reverse brain drain are through governments retaining their students, encouraging students to pursue tertiary studies abroad and promoting them to return, and engaging with the diasporas which will encourage expatriates to remit savings, act as bridges for foreign investment and trade, and facilitate the transfer of skills and knowledge.

40|$|Perfect drain for the Maxwell Fish Eye (MFE) is a {{non-magnetic}} dissipative region {{placed in}} the focal point to absorb all the incident radiation without reflection or scattering. The perfect drain was recently designed as a material with complex electrical permittivity that depends on frequency. However, this material is only a theoretical material, so {{it can not be}} used in practical devices. Recently, the perfect drain has been claimed as necessary to achieve super-resolution [Leonhard 2009, New J. Phys. 11 093040], which has increased the interest for practical perfect drains suitable for manufacturing. Here, we analyze the super-resolution properties of a device equivalent to the MFE, known as Spherical Geodesic Waveguide (SGW), loaded with the perfect drain. In the SGW the source and <b>drain</b> are <b>implemented</b> with coaxial probes. The perfect drain is realized using a circuit (made of a resistance and a capacitor) connected to the drain coaxial probes. Super-resolution analysis for this device is done in Comsol Multiphysics. The results of simulations predict the super-resolution up to wavelength/ 3000 and optimum power transmission from the source to the drain...|$|R

The technological parameters involved in the formulation are obtained by means of a fully automatic extraction procedure. Finally, a detailed case study, in which a behavioural analysis of sample-and-hold circuits using the proposed toolbox is performed, is presented. The ATMEL 0. 24 @mm CMOS process was used as reference for the case study.

40|$|Energy is {{of primary}} concern in {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs). Low power transmission makes the wireless links unreliable, which leads to frequent topology changes. Resulting packet retransmissions aggravate the energy consumption. Beaconless routing approaches, such as opportunistic routing (OR) choose packet forwarders after data transmissions, and are promising to support dynamic features of WSNs. This paper proposes SCAD - Sensor Context-aware Adaptive Duty-cycled beaconless OR for WSNs. SCAD is a cross-layer routing solution and it brings the concept of beaconless OR into WSNs. SCAD selects packet forwarders based on multiple types of network contexts. To achieve a balance between performance and energy efficiency, SCAD adapts duty-cycles of sensors based on real-time traffic loads and energy <b>drain</b> rates. We <b>implemented</b> SCAD in TinyOS running on top of Tmote Sky sensor motes. Real-world evaluations show that SCAD outperforms other protocols {{in terms of both}} throughput and network lifetime...|$|R

We experienced two cases of lung injury resulting from fluted silastic drain extraction under reservoir-generated nega-tive pressure suction. In the first case, a 67 -year-old man underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. A 19 Fr BLAKE drain was placed at the pericardial cavity, the mediastinum, and the left thoracic cavity. All three drains were connected to J-VAC reservoirs. After removing the drains (which maintained the negative pressure), subcutaneous emphysema and hemopneumothorax occur. A trocar catheter was inserted. Bleeding and the air leak terminated within a day. In the second case, a 73 -year-old man underwent aortic valve replacement. Right pneumothorax occurred after {{the removal of the}} pleural cavity drain, which maintained the negative pressure generated by the reservoir. We inserted a trocar cathe-ter, and the air leak terminated within a day. We hypothesized that the reservoir-generated negative pressure causes the pleura to enter the groove of the drain and become damaged during extraction. We stopped using a reservoir to connect to the fluted silastic drain placed at the pleural cavity and removed the negative pressure when extracting the pleural cavity <b>drain.</b> Since <b>implementing</b> this change, we have not experienced a similar lung injury in more than 500 cardiac surgery patients...|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 19th century large parts of the parish were still little more than a morass, and the risk of flood was a constant one: in June 1816, for example, the parish was once again completely deluged following a period of heavy rain that caused several local rivers to overflow their banks. Critical to controlling events like this was the establishment of the Catchwater Drain. Plans for making the <b>drain</b> were <b>implemented</b> in 1805, an intention being announced to cut and embank ‘the intended Catch-water Drain from or near to Skellingthorpe Wood, in the parish of Skellingthorpe, through the said parish, in an Eastwardly direction’. By the middle of the 19th century, Skellingthorpe had been well-drained for some time. Two small steam engines were even erected by this time near the Decoy Farm to pump out water in times of flooding. In January 1841 it was reported how Joseph Booth, a labourer employed to attend the draining engine on a Skellingthorpe farm, had slipped ‘on the step of the fly-wheel’ and become entangled in the machinery of the engine. Mr Booth had been literally smashed to pieces, but even worse, this horrifying spectacle was discovered by his young son. An inquest at Skellingthorpe recorded a verdict of ‘Accidental Death’. The drains also brought with them their own problems. The Lincolnshire Chronicle reported in 1865 that ‘within {{the last two or three}} years several houses had been erected on the outskirts of the village of Skellingthorpe, and owing to an obnoxious ditch in front of the tenements much fever and sickness had prevailed. Several deaths had taken place from fever, the last two being an old man and a child’.|$|R

We have to stop the European Brain Drain. We have to reverse it; "Europeans who have moved abroad would love to come home". We have to remember that the "B rain Drain should work in both directions", then we have to attract foreign brilliant scientists and compete to the USA. In this paper we give a survey of the principal "Brain <b>Drain</b> Competition" policies <b>implemented</b> in Europe. The key strategies and mechanisms found are: making the academic system more open and flexible; improving the regulatory conditions particularly on immigration; better sign-posting and information at national level; dedicated grants for foreign researchers; adapting income situations to market forces; providing tax reductions specifically for researchers and knowledge workers; more active international marketing and support for international researchers. Finally, we analyse the effects of these policies on the Brain Drain in Europe by giving examples of countries (i. e. UK, France, Germany, Belgium, etc) that that effectively reverse the Brain Drain and attract foreign researchers, and the exemplum of the Italy that it is "a countries that supplies talent to Europe and the Americas"...|$|R
40|$|Oxidation of pyrites {{in coastal}} Australian soils {{has been a}} concern for {{researchers}} in recent times. Acid pollution of creeks and rivers close to estuaries {{has been attributed to}} pyrite oxidation (Indraratna, 1997). The leaching of acid through the waterways to the estuarine system has led to a number of environmental problems such as destruction of fish, oysters, and other important marine life, including their habitats. Loss of infrastructure and lower levels of agricultural production have also been documented in the acid sulfate soils literature (Blunden and Indraratna, 1997; Blunden et al., 1997). A few remedial strategies, such as manipulation of the water table, have been considered by the University of Wollongong 2 ̆ 7 s acid sulfate soils group to deal with the problems in the South Coast of Illawarra (New South Wales, Australia). Artificially raising water tables tends to submerge the pyritic layer, thus preventing oxygen from reaching the layer and oxidizing the pyrites. Blunden (2000) monitored the effect of groundwater manipulation at Berry and developed a three-dimensional model to predict the amount of acid produced during droughts (see also Blunden and Indraratna, 1999). More recently, a novel tidal buffering strategy in floodgated <b>drains</b> has been <b>implemented.</b> The drainwater retains a high level of acidity that may be neutralized by the action of bicarbonates and carbonates transported upstream via the tidal Broughton creek (New South Wales). Otherwise, the leached acid flows into the waterways, severely degrading the creek water quality. However, before remediation strategies can be undertaken, an accurate estimate of the total acid production in the pyritic layer is usually required. A few models for this purpose exist in the literature that have been utilized in the past, but a novel cylindrical model is developed in this article...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is part of the ongoing effort of the Seismic Risk Mitigation for Port Systems Grand Challenge. It addresses the problem of numerically simulating the response of sandy soils treated with earthquake drains, for liquefaction risk mitigation. This thesis describes 1) the implementation of finite 1 -D elements to simulate the uncoupled mechanical and flow properties of perforated vertical (PV) drains, 2) the investigation of scaling laws for laminar and turbulent flow inside a PV-drain, 3) the validation of the numerical models using a centrifuge experiment (SSK 01) performed at UC-Davis (Kamai, et al., 2008). The mechanical and flow behavior of the drains are assumed to be uncoupled. The mechanical behavior is treated as a truss element, taking into account the axial stiffness and assuming zero bending stiffness. The flow behavior is treated using the phenomenological Darcy-Weisbach equation. The elements are implemented in the Opensees framework. Two implementations are presented, one for laminar drains, and one for fully turbulent drains. Both of these implementations are used to estimate also the effect of drain storage capacity. It has been illustrated that the flow in the drains in model scale and in prototype scale might be qualitatively different. If the centrifuge model is scaled N times Reynolds number (Re) is N times larger in prototype scale, so under common situations model scale flow can be laminar even if at the prototype scale flow is fully turbulent. A methodology is presented to elect properties of model scale drains (where flow is laminar) to represent prototype drains (where flow is turbulent). Validation has been performed against SSK 01 centrifuge test. Results show good agreement with experimental data. (cont.) Limitations of the constitutive soil model and the selected input parameters are discussed. Model scale results validate the consideration of the storage capacity effect, and thus use of the <b>implemented</b> <b>drain</b> elements. On the other hand the need for turbulent flow (rather than laminar) drains does not affect significantly the results of the specific test used. by Antonios Vytiniotis. Thesis (S. M.)
