40|$|This paper {{develops}} a Structural Ricardian model to measure climate change impacts that explicitly models {{the choice of}} farm type in African agriculture. This two stage model first estimates the type of farm chosen and then the conditional incomes of each farm type after removing selection biases. The results indicate that increases in temperature encourage farmers to adopt mixed farming and avoid specialized farms such as crop-only or livestock-only farms. Increases in precipitation encourage farmers to shift from irrigated to rainfed crops. As temperatures increase, farm <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> crop-only farms or livestock-only farms fall whereas <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> mixed farms increase. With precipitation increases, farm <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> irrigated farms fall whereas <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> rainfed farms increase. Naturally, the Structural Ricardian model predicts much smaller impacts than a model that holds farm type fixed. With a hot dry climate scenario, the Structural Ricardian model predicts that farm income will fall 50 percent but the fixed farm type model predicts farm incomes will fall 75 percent.
