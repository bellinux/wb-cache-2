5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and <b>fatty</b> <b>liver.</b> Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
40|$|Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) {{injury is}} a {{commonly}} encountered clinical problem and occurs probably {{as a consequence}} of irreversible mitochondrial injury. The increased susceptibility of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> to ischemic injury is associated with depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, which is preserved by preconditioning. Mitochondria being the main ATP production source for the cell, we aimed to evaluate whether ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> prevents the impairment in mitochondrial function induced by I/R. Lean and steatotic animals were subjected to 90 min of hepatic warm ischemia and 12 h of reperfusion. IPC effect was tested in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> After reperfusion, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured. Mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration and susceptibility to mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) were evaluated, as well as ATPase activity and adenine nucleotides. IPC of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> decreased serum AST and ALT levels. Fatty animals subjected to I/R exhibited decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and a delay in the repolarization after a phosphorylation cycle, associated with increased state 4 respiration. Increased tolerance to MPT induction, preservation of F 1 Fo-ATPsynthase activity and mitochondrial bioenergetics were observed in ischemic preconditioned <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Thus, IPC is an endogenous protecting mechanism that preserves mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> A.

40|$|Graft {{steatosis}} is a {{risk factor}} for poor initial function after liver transplantation. Biliary complications are frequent even after normal liver transplantation. A subnormothermic machine perfusion (MP 20) preservation procedure was developed by our group with high potential for reducing injury to hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells of lean and <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> respect to conventional cold storage (CS). We report the response of the biliary tree to CS or MP 20, in lean and obese Zucker rat liver. Dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV), crucial for the inactivation of incretins and neuropeptides, was used as a marker. Liver morphology and canalicular network of lean livers were similar after CS/reperfusion or MP 20 /reperfusion. CS preservation of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> induced serious damage to the parenchyma and to the canalicular activity/expression of DPP-IV whereas with MP 20 the morphology and canalicular network were similar to those of untreated lean liver. CS and MP 20 had similar effects on DPP-IV activity and expression in the upper segments of the intrahepatic biliary tree of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> DPP-IV expression was significantly increased after MP 20 respect to CS or to the controls, both for lean and obese animals. Our data support the superiority of MP 20 over CS for preserving <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Dipeptidylpeptidase-IV activity and expression reveal decreased damage to the intrahepatic biliary tree in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> submitted to subnormothermic machine-perfusion respect to conventional cold storage. </p...|$|R

5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and <b>fatty</b> <b>liver,</b> can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the role of}} IL- 6 in the protection that ischemic preconditioning (IP) exerts against hepatic ischemia reperfusion-mediated (I/R) oxidative damage, particularly in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> IP-related IL- 6 up-regulation during reperfusion in steatotic and non-steatotic livers was correlated with reduced indices of liver damage, as also demonstrated by pharmacological modulation of IL- 6. IP activated NF-ÎºB and HSF during ischemia (Isc), whereas AP- 1 activity was unaffected. IP blunted the activation of STAT 3 and stress-responsive genes, such as NF-ÎºB, AP- 1 and heme oxygenase (HO- 1) during reperfusion. The role of reduced oxidative stress in hepatoprotection of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> was further demonstrated by the fact that: (i) IP prevented the decrease of glutathione levels and the increase of lipid peroxidation; (ii) the anti-oxidant GSH-ester prevented lipid peroxidation and necrosis. In conclusion, IP modulates the activity of transcription factors and triggers IL- 6 production; this may prevent hepatic I/R damage in a oxidative stress-dependent way, particularly in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Gd-BOPTA (gadobenate dimeglumine) is a {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) contrast agent that, after i. v. administration, distributes within the extracellular space, enters rat hepatocytes through the sinusoidal transporters organic anion transporting peptides (Oatps) and is excreted unchanged into bile through the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp 2). It {{is unclear how}} the hepatobiliary contrast agent would accumulate in cholestatic <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> from obese rats with bile flow impairment. Indeed, the expression of both Oatps and Mrp 2 transporters is decreased in cholestatic hepatocytes. To assess this question, we measured on-line the hepatic concentrations of ¹⁵³Gd-BOPTA with a gamma probe placed over perfused rat livers. During the perfusion of ¹⁵³Gd-BOPTA, we obtained a similar maximal hepatic concentration in normal and <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> despite the decreased expression and function of membrane transporters in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> By pharmacokinetic modeling and mathematical simulations, we show how changes of transport {{into and out of}} hepatocytes modify the concentrations of ¹⁵³Gd-BOPTA within hepatocytes. Mathematical simulations help to understand how each parameter (entry into hepatocytes, bile excretion, or efflux back to sinusoids) interferes with the hepatic concentrations. The hepatic concentrations of ¹⁵³Gd-BOPTA within hepatocytes rely on the entry into hepatocytes through the sinusoidal membrane and on two paths of exit, the efflux back to sinusoids and the elimination into bile. Understanding how ¹⁵³Gd-BOPTA accumulates in hepatocytes is then complex. However, such understanding is important to analyze liver imaging with hepatobiliary contrast agents in cholestatic <b>fatty</b> <b>livers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} is a {{major risk}} factor in ischemia-reperfusion. The present study evaluates whether preconditioning, demonstrated {{to be effective in}} normal livers, could also confer protection in the presence of steatosis and investigates the potential underlying protective mechanisms. Fatty rats had increased hepatic injury and decreased survival after 60 minutes of ischemia compared with lean rats. <b>Fatty</b> <b>livers</b> showed a degree of neutrophil accumulation and microcirculatory alterations similar to that of normal livers. However, in presence of steatosis, an increased lipid peroxidation that could be reduced with glutathione-ester pretreatment was observed after hepatic reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning reduced hepatic injury and increased animal survival. Both in normal and <b>fatty</b> <b>livers,</b> this endogenous protective mechanism was found to control lipid peroxidation, hepatic microcirculation failure, and neutrophil accumulation, reducing the subsequent hepatic injury. These beneficial effects could be mediated by nitric oxide, because the inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis and nitric oxide donor pretreatment abolished and simulated, respectively, the benefits of preconditioning. Thus, ischemic preconditioning could be an effective surgical strategy to reduce the hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in normal and <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> under normothermic conditions, including hepatic resections, and liver transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Machine {{perfusion}} at subnormothermic temperature (20 °C), MP 20, {{was developed}} by Vairetti et al. and showed to afford a better preservation of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> respect to traditional cold storage (CS) in terms of enzyme release into the perfusate and bile, glycogen stores, energy charge and oxidative stress. Here we investigated whether it also caused decreased cell death by apoptosis. Fatty and lean Zucker rats were submitted to MP 20 or CS for 6 h and reperfused normothermically for 2 h. Apoptotic cells were revealed by immunohistochemistry of activated caspase- 3 and M 30 (new epitope on CK 18 degraded by caspase- 3) and by the TUNEL assay. Portal pressure was also determined. A statistically significant reduction of hepatocyte apoptosis, but especially of sinusoidal cells was determined for <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> submitted to MP 20 respect to CS. Portal pressure was significantly lower after MP 20 respect to CS. The reduction of sinusoidal cell death by apoptosis without need for anti-apoptotic therapies appears particularly positive since apoptotic sinusoidal cells hinder microcirculation in the sinusoids and are thrombogenic. These results further confirm the potential of MP 20 for preserving <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> that would be otherwise discarded as grafts, and thus for increasing the donor pool for liver transplantation...|$|R

Until recently, weight reduction constituted the only proven therapy for patients with <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Steatosis was induced by a 3 -wk methionine/choline-deficient diet, followed by oral administration of omega- 3 FAs (Omega- 3), standard lipid solution (Lipid), or NaCl (Saline) during 2 wk.

Histological analysis revealed mild (5 - 33 %) macrovesicular steatosis in omega- 3 -treated animals vs. severe (> 66 %) macrovesicular steatosis in both Lipid and Saline groups. Following IR/PHx, omega- 3 -treated rats exhibited reduced serum ALT levels after 6 - and 24 -h reperfusion, a reduced hepatic TNF-α content, and an improved anti-oxidative capacity.
