40|$|International audienceThe <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> {{represents}} a complex environment, containing {{several types of}} pollutants that can be even used as nutrients by indigenous microorganisms, like hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, having good potentialities for the biodegradation of petroleum products. In this study, a <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> was collected from drilling quagmire. Physicochemical characterization of the <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> was done. Its mineralogy was obtained by diffractometry. The indigenous aerobic sludge hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were checked by counting on Bushnell–Haas medium, and their isolation and purification were performed by the selective microbial enrichment technique in a batch-enriched Bushnell–Haas culture, with crude oil as the sole carbon source. Isolates were characterized, and their power to emulsify crude oil was determined by emulsification index and oil spreading tests. Environmental conditions in the quagmire, like temperature, pH and moisture, were suitable for bacterial development. Physicochemical characteristics of the <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> showed richness in chemical elements and promote microbial life. Fifteen different colonies of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were isolated and purified; they have diversified morphological and microscopic aspects. Most isolates had a good emulsification index (between 31 and 76  %). Oil spreading test gave clear zone diameters > 28  mm, with a maximum of 60  mm. The results of these investigations prove the elementary, mineralogy and microbiology richness of <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> and reveal the high diversity of its indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial flora. These properties can be exploited for the own restoration of petroleum quagmires in oil fields, by means of bioremediation applications and by integrating indigenous microorganisms. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU) ...|$|E

40|$|Joint {{recycling}} of <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> and phosphogypsum with obtaining a building material is environmentally appropriate and cost-effective, as it helps {{not only to}} prevent environmental pollution, but also {{to solve the problem}} of rational nature management. <b>Drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> is a waste formed during drilling oil wells, and phosphogypsum is a waste of the chemical industry, formed as a result of the production of concentrational phosphoric acid. However, technogenic raw materials contain heavy metals that can be transformed into a finished product and leached out of it. The problem of minimizing the negative impact of pollutants is very important to reduce the risk to human health. The author's idea is to optimize ecological characteristics of drilling waste and phosphogypsum recycling process. The concentration of heavy metals in the extract of gypsum concrete was determined as the function of the target which depends primarily on structural and technological parameters. The purpose of the article is solution to mathematical programming task, i. e., finding optimal solutions for the factors values of <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> and phosphogypsum recycling process. Mathematical programming solution to optimization problem of the gypsum concrete environmental characteristics (to minimize concentration of heavy metals in the extract) was performed by the method of simple random search in the Borland C ++ programming environment using C programming language. It is necessary to observe the values of such factors to minimize concentration of heavy metals in the extract of gypsum concrete. The mass ratio of gypsum binder and <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> is 2. 93 units, the mass ratio of quick lime and gypsum binder is 0. 09 units, the age of gypsum concrete is above 19 days, exposure time is 28 days...|$|E

40|$|An {{improvement}} of the sludge electrodewatering process is proposed: the anode flushing by filtrate recirculation. According to this technique, the mixture of filtrates obtained at cathode and anode sides, is used for continuous flushing of anode chamber of the filter press during electrodewatering. The anode flushing is aimed to eliminate essential problems of electrodewatering: ohmic heating, rise of electric energy consumption, electrodes corrosion, and filtrate contamination. This is attained by better control of the filtrate pH, the filter cake temperature and the dryness at anode side, where the physicochemical conditions are most aggressive. The efficiency of the proposed technique is evaluated at lab scale on <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> electrodewatering with and without anode flushing. In experiments without anode flushing, increasing of electric current density caused strong increase of anode temperature, desiccation of the filter cake at anode side, rise of voltage and significant alkaline contamination of filtrate. The application of anode flushing allowed controlling the electric field strength and the temperature. Thus, the dewatering of the sludge has been extended at high electric field without damaging the filter equipment by drastic heating. Furthermore, it reduced the filtrate contamination by neutralization of the electrolysis products...|$|E

In particular, 0. 3 %– 0. 5 % bioremediation reagents were fully mixed with the waste <b>drilling</b> <b>sludge</b> according to its wet and dry degree, and 1. 5 folds to twice weight of more finely ground soil was added in the mix, which was covered by soil of 5 – 15  cm thick and thereby grasses or greeneries were planted on the soil. The process was successfully applied to some fields of Well Danqian 001 - 8, Well Lianhua 000 -X 8, etc. After three months of such treatment, the main indexes of the drilling solid waste such as the degradation of COD and the oil-degrading ratio reached more than 90 %, the index of leaching solution met the requirement of the first grade in the national “Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard”; heavy metal ion concentration in soil did not change significantly with the indicators meeting the requirement of the third grade in the national “Soil Environmental Quality Standard” (Dry Land); and no harmful effects of heavy metals have ever been found on the planted grasses and greeneries. In conclusion, with this microbe-soil technology, the soil property will recover its background values without any other chemical additives, realizing the ecological restoration and reuse of land covered by wellsite wastes, so it is in line with the energy-saving and environmentally-friendly treatment way...|$|E

Some 25, 000 tankers pass through the Strait of Hormuz annually and transport approximately 60  % of all the oil shipped globally (Happkylai et al. 2007). Oil exploration, production, transport, and discharges of mainly <b>drilling</b> wastes, operational <b>sludge,</b> and oily fluids from unused fracturing fluids or acids are major contributors to pollution levels in the Persian Gulf (Madany et al. 1998; ROPME 2013).|$|R

The equipment employed in land farming is typical of that used in agricultural operations. These land farming activities cultivate and enhance microbial degradation of hazardous compounds. As a rule of thumb, the higher the molecular weight (i.e., the more rings within a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), the slower the degradation rate. Also, the more chlorinated or nitrated the compound, the more difficult it is to degrade.|$|R

Kimberlite indicator grains, predominantly chromites, were recovered from both <b>drill</b> core and <b>sludge</b> samples. Over 900 surface heavy mineral samples were collected {{to the end of}} 2007 and a wide range of kimberlite indicator minerals have been recovered, including chromite, pyrope, diopside, picroilmenite, diamond, phlogopite, forsterite and orthopyroxene, with the highest concentration around Gem Pan. The age of the sediments and depositional environments were assigned on palynological evidence. For the first time a detailed geological description of Cainozoic sediments is provided for Flinders Island, including a new stratigraphic unit which has been formally named Flinders Island Sand. Five anomalous indicator mineral zones have been identified and the analysis of mineral grains appears to favour a kimberlitic origin. Mineralogical examination of the indicator minerals show that the grains are relatively fresh and have not been transported far from the source. The kimberlitic source still remains undiscovered, but indicator minerals recovered from analysed samples indicate an age of Miocene or older. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The company ways to {{maintain}} its production of crude oil, by drilling new wells and wells that have done some existing treatments. These activities will generate waste, and called with <b>sludge</b> <b>drilling</b> cutting. Characteristics of drilling cutting waste is similar to petroleum-contaminated soil. Based on the Decree of the Minister of the Environment No. 128 of 2003 on Procedures for the Technical Requirements for Waste Oil and Soil Contaminated by Petroleum Biological, waste oil is classified as hazardous and toxic waste (B 3). One way {{to improve the quality}} of petroleum-contaminated soil is bioremediation techniques. In the process of bioremediation, microbes in the soil to degrade hydrocarbons that contaminate the soil. In this study drilling cutting waste is added to the oil- contaminated soil samples, which will be processed in bioremediation using naturally existing microorganisms. The results of the most effective and efficient comparison of the addition of contaminated soil and drilling cutting waste is 3 : 2 and its supported by the pH value of the sample in neutral pH range (6, 5 - 7, 5), because the hydrocarbon degrading bacteria can grow well on the pH...|$|R
40|$|Many {{processes}} {{are available for}} treatment of contaminated waste and remediation of abandoned polluted areas. One of the main problem is remediation of contaminated silt or clay fractions. Particularly the cleaning of sediments or soils contaminated by mercurcy, PAH's or MKW is not solved satisfactorily regarding the economical aspect. In 1996 GKSS and Umwelt-Technics-Nord (UTN) have signed a co-operation contract. Aim of the co-operation is {{development of a new}} decontamination-technology based on desorption processes with high efficiency. The new technology combines operational concepts of GKSS and UTN. The combined technology allows cleaning of all kind of contaminated materials, like <b>sludge,</b> <b>drilling</b> mud, contaminated muds, remainders from soil washing plants, sediments, or even wood. A pilot plant was set up at GKSS research centre for the cleaning of mercury-contaminated soil, sediments and sludge with particle sizes less then 63 mm. A tube reactor is the essential element of this plant as well as for GKSS-tube-reactor-process (GTR-Process, patent pending). Umwelt-Technics-Nord GmbH is owner of the patent 'Method and Apparatus for separation of Volatile Components from a Base Material' as well of the registered design 'Apparatus for Separation of Volatile Components from a Base Material'. The UTN-technology is a batch-process. Pollutants are concentrated to a very high degree by this process. (orig.)

40|$|Crude {{oil and gas}} {{fields are}} located in remote areas known for their severe {{geological}} and climatic conditions that are aggravated {{by the presence of}} the paleocrystic frozen rock. Borehole drilling causes generation of the substantial amount of <b>drilling</b> waste. The <b>sludge</b> weighs millions of tons. Any rock is to remain frozen at any drilling site in the Yamal peninsula. Semifluid drilling waste occupies extensive areas around drilling sites; they prevent development of the surface infrastructure, they interfere with the work of drilling technicians and contribute to hazardous working conditions, they are a challenge to the local ecology. The above factors produce a negative impact on the environment and prevent sustainable development of the region. For example, disposal of drilling waste at condensed gas fields operated in the Yamal peninsula represents a substantial problem. Drilling waste contains drilling fluid used in the process of borehole drilling. It was discovered {{in the course of the}} preliminary research that drilling fluids were composite suspensions that contained bentonite, heavy spar, caustic soda, dilutants, and polymers. It was found out that the sludge was composed of silica, calcite, dolomite, aragonite, magnesite, some feldspars, heavy spar, gypsum and anhydrite, micas, hydromicas, clay minerals. Projections provided in the paper say that pre-neutralized sludge may be used in the manufacturing of building materials, such as bricks, claydite, small-size building units, etc. The authors argue that further research of the sludge elements and microstructure, as well as its chemical, mineral, granulometric and X-ray phase analyses need to be performed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{experimental}} measurements {{on the ability}} of biological origin surfactants (i. e. biosurfactants - aescin, lecithin, rhamnolipid, saponin and tannin) on removing crude oil and a heavy fuel oil blend from various soils, through soil washing process. The greatest advantage of soil washing {{is that it is a}} physical means of separating oil from soil using water or surfactants without chemically modifying either the soil or the oil. The oil removal performance of the biosurfactants was evaluated against that of a well studied synthetic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS) using water as a base case. For this purpose, different washing settings (i. e. test tubes, stirred flasks, packed column, and air bubble assisted stirred tank) were used to treat contaminated soils with high oil toxicity. The effects of operational parameters such as washing temperature (5 to 500 C), washing time (1 to 20 minutes), concentration of surfactant solutions (0. 004 to 0. 5 %-mass), volume of surfactant solution (5 to 20 cm 3), flow rate (2 to 16 cm 3 /minutes), pore volume (10 to 70) and contamination history was investigated. The interaction of the surfactant solutions with the oil and soils was also investigated, which was used to explain the dominant mechanisms behind soil washing. The contaminated soils were prepared in the laboratory by mixing the oil and soils. Two different contamination cases were considered: weathered contamination in which freshly contaminated soils were subjected to heat treatment in a fan assisted oven (simulating weathering effect in the natural hot environments), and non-weathered contamination in which contaminated soils were not subjected to any heat treatment. The different washing techniques employed in this study yielded a novel and informative description on the selection of biosurfactants in the remediation of crude oil contaminated soils. This is believed to have major academic and industrial values for the treatment of (1) soil contaminated with oil, (2) sand produced with oil, (3) drill cuttings, (4) enhanced oil recovery, and (5) waste <b>drilling</b> mud and <b>sludge</b> from oil storage tank. In addition, the characterization of the biosurfactants in oil-water, soilwater and oil-soil systems give a general knowledge of their behaviour, which is important in the application for effective removal of oil from soil. Soil washing was found to have a considerable potential in removing oil from the different contaminated soils and results were comparable with those reported in literature. Oil removal by rhamnolipid was more effective than the other biosurfactants and water was effective at higher parameter levels. Further, biosurfactants can preferentially remove certain aromatic groups, which may be desirable for more rapid soil remediation. The rhamnolipid can be equally as efficient at removing oil from soil as SDS at a repeatability range of ± 6 %. However, rhamnolipid have advantages over SDS beacuase the use of rhamnolipid will eliminate the need for removing surfactants from effluents as their release will not damage the environment due to their safe natures. Other surfactants (bio and/or synthetic) can be blended with rhamnolipid to achieve greater performance characteristics. In general, the stirred tank and air bubble assisted stirred tank reactors settings were more effective in removing oil from the weathered and the non-weathered contaminated soil samples. The most influential parameter on the oil removal was washing solution temperature with more than 80 % of crude oil removal at 500 C. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
