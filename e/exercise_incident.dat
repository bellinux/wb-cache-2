40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the incidence and epidemiology of major incidents occurring in Britain {{over the past}} 28 years. METHODS: Major incidents were identified through a MEDLINE search, a hand search of journals and government reports at the Home Office Emergency Planning College, newspaper reports, a postal survey of ambulance emergency planning officers, and through requests for information posted on the internet. MAIN RESULTS: Brief incidents profiles from 108 British major incidents are presented. Most major incidents pass unreported in the medical literature. On average three to four major incidents occur in Britain each year (range 0 - 11). Sixty three of 108 (59. 2 %) of incidents involve public transportation. The next two largest groups are civil disturbance 22 of 108 (20. 3 %) and industrial accidents 16 of 108 (14. 8 %). Although incidents at sports stadiums are rare they produce large numbers of casualties. The data currently available on major incidents are difficult to find and of questionable accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of data makes planning for major <b>incidents</b> and <b>exercising</b> major <b>incident</b> plans difficult. Casualty incident profiles (CIPs) may assist major <b>incidents</b> <b>exercises</b> and planning. CIPs from future major incidents should be collated and made available to all major incident planners...|$|R

40|$|Background & Objectives: Major {{incidents}} occur commonly in Uganda, {{but little}} is known about either local hazards which risk causing major incidents, or health system preparedness for such events. Understanding risk and current preparedness {{is the first step in}} improving response. Methods: We undertook a cross - sectional study across four teaching hospitals in Kampala (Mulago National Referral Hospital, Nsambya Hospital, Mengo Hospital and Lubaga Hospital). A local geographic area Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA) f or each site was combined with a key informant questionnaire and standardized facility checklist within the hospitals. Data collected included status of major incident committees, operational major incident plans and facility major incident operation centres, bed capacity, equipment and supplies and staffing. The HVA assessed the human impact, impact on property and on business of the hazards as well as measures for mitigation (preparedness, internal response and external response) in place at the hospitals. Results: Only one of the four hospitals was found to have had an operational major incident plan. The designated coordinator for major incidents across all facilities was mostly a general surgeon; no funds were specifically allocated for planning. All hospitals have procedures for triage, resuscitation, stabilization and treatment. None of the facilities had officially designated a major incident committee. All the facilities had sufficient supplies for daily use but none had specifically stock piled any reserves for major incidents. All hospitals were staffed by at least a medical officer, clinical officers, nurses and a specialist with procedures for mobilizing extra staff s for major incidents. Some staffs had received some emergency care training in courses namely basic life support, advanced trauma life support, primary trauma care and emergency triage and treatment but no team had received training in major incident response. Only one hospital carried out annual simulation <b>exercises.</b> <b>Incidents</b> involving human hazards specifically bomb threats, road crash mass casualty incidents, civil disorder and epidemics posed the highest risk to all four hospitals and yet preparation and response measures were inadequate. Conclusion: Hospitals in Kampala face a wide range of hazards and frequent major incidents but despite this they remain under - prepared to respond.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{sought to}} examine prospectively the {{difference}} in the association between incident functional disability and exercise with or without sports organization participation. METHODS: The study was based on the Aichi Gerontological Evaluation Study (AGES) Cohort Study data. In October 2003, self-reported questionnaires were mailed to 29, 374 non-disabled Japanese individuals aged 65 years or older. Of these, 13, 310 individuals were introduced to the Study, and they were followed for 4 years. Analysis was carried out on 11, 581 subjects who provided all necessary information for the analysis. RESULTS: Analysis was carried out on incident functional disability by 4 groups of different combinations of performance of exercise and participation in a sports organization Active Participant (AP), Exercise Alone (EA), Passive Participant (PP) and Sedentary (S). Compared to the AP group, the EA group had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1. 29 (1. 02 - 1. 64) for incident functional disability. No significant difference was seen with the PP group, with an HR of 1. 16 (0. 76 - 1. 77). When a measure of social networks was added to the covariates, the HR of the EA group dropped to 1. 27 (1. 00 - 1. 61), and significant differences disappeared. In contrast, it showed hardly any change when social support was added. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that, even with a regular <b>exercise</b> habit, <b>incident</b> functional disability may be better prevented when a person participates in a sports organization than when he/she does not. In addition, participation in a sports organization correlates positively with social networks, which may lead to a small decrease in incident functional disability...|$|R
40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: During {{the past}} 20 years, {{treadmill}} exercise testing has {{played an important}} role in both the study of equine exercise physiology and the investigation of poor athletic performance. However, it has been suggested that some trainers and veterinarians may be reluctant to refer horses for treadmill exercise testing because of fears that horses may be at increased risk of musculoskeletal injury during treadmill exercise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and types of injuries sustained by horses undergoing treadmill exercise. METHODS: Data were collated from 9 centres in the UK, France and Belgium, and the prevalence and types of injury were established. RESULTS: A total of 2305 records were reviewed, with 2258 horses performing treadmill exercise. There was an overall injury rate of 5. 4 %. However, the majority of injuries sustained were minor in nature (4. 7 %). Only 13 horses (0. 6 %) sustained major injuries in association with treadmill exercise. These included 5 cases of severe exercise-induced myopathy, 4 fractures (of which 1 was catastrophic), 2 tendon injuries, 1 case with undiagnosed severe lameness and 1 with marked exacerbation of a previously diagnosed lameness. Two other major incidents were reported but were not directly associated with treadmill exercise (one had iliac thrombosis and one collapsed and died as a result of a pulmonary embolism). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the majority of horses undergo treadmill <b>exercise</b> without <b>incident.</b> The majority of injuries that did occur were minor in nature and the incidence of major injuries was similar to that reported during competition elsewhere. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Treadmill exercise is a safe procedure and does not appear to pose an increased risk of injury in comparison with overground exercise. S. H. Franklin, S. Z. Barakzai, A.

40|$|History: In February of 2015 a 96 {{year old}} male started our rural-based cardiac and {{pulmonary}} exercise program. He {{was confined to}} a wheel-chair due to frequent episodes of extreme weakness and occasional syncope. An initial physical work-up, medical history, and exercise program was developed and he <b>exercised</b> without <b>incident</b> from Feb. to August. By September of 2015, he had increased his functional capacity by 1 - 2 METsand was regularly walking 50 - 100 meters with a walker during his exercise sessions. Differential Diagnosis: 1. Congestive Heart Failure; 2. Anemia, 3. chronic heart failure (CHF), 4. {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), 5. coronary artery disease (CAD), 6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 7. Pacemaker. Physical examination and symptomology: In October, he reported feeling weak and experiencing chest pain off and on for a few weeks. During exercise, he developed recurring episodes of atrial fibrillation with aberrancy with regular exercise, and chronotropic incompetence. Hemoglobin levels were normal and left ventricular function was stable. Tests and Results: The client’s cardiologist was contacted to check the pacemaker replacement date and see if it needed to be moved up and also to inquire to check medication levels. Rhythm strips and vitals for the month of October were sent as well. The client continued to exercise until December without a change in medication or pacemaker at which time he developed pneumonia and stopped exercising. Final management plan: The decision was made to move up the original pacemaker replacement date from February to January, and he returned to exercise program in early February.

BackgroundLittle {{is known about the}} relative frequency of sudden cardiac arrest at traditional indoor exercise facilities versus other indoor locations where people engage in exercise or about the survival at these sites in comparison with other indoor locations. MethodsWe examined every public indoor sudden cardiac arrest in Seattle and King County from 1996 to 2008 and categorized each event as occurring at a traditional exercise center, an alternative exercise site, or a public indoor location not used for exercise. Arrests were further defined by the classification of the site, activity performed, demographics, characteristics of treatment, and survival. For some location types, annualized site incident rates of cardiac arrests were calculated. ResultsWe analyzed 849 arrests, with 52 at traditional centers, 84 at alternative exercise sites, and 713 at sites not associated with <b>exercise.</b> The site <b>incident</b> rates of arrests at indoor tennis facilities, indoor ice arenas, and bowling alleys were higher than at traditional fitness centers.

Major outcomes: first of all, in session 1 on EU institutional stakeholders, the high added value of continuous information sharing and cooperation between EC services sharing CBRN responsibilities (HOME, JRC, SANCO, MOVE, RTD, ECHO, RELEX and AIDCO) and the EDA on civil-military dual research has been well confirmed by all speakers and participants. Session 1 also demonstrated {{the internal and external}} dimension of CBRN (e. g. Regional CBRN centers of excellence). Secondly, session 2 on end users has enlightened the essential role and responsibility of end users, early on in the CBRN research activities (design, specification, testing, validation, training, field <b>exercises).</b> Experience from <b>incidents</b> needs to be shared, although classification makes that difficult. Integration of field and real exercises are crucial to make applications accepted. Equipments and systems must be simple, robust, easy to use and affordable (cost and procurement feasibility). Solutions should be acceptable at the citizen level, respecting their privacy and rights. Civil protection forces and first responders are key stakeholders in this process. Sharing of information from intelligence databases and expertise has also been recognized. Finally, session 3 on demonstration activities revealed the way to a demonstration program on CBRN(E), with a key conclusion being that coordination between all CBRN stakeholders (prevention to recovery) is crucial. The examples of existing and recent CBRN(E) regional/national clusters or platforms are quite interesting and could pave the way or contribute to such a challenging program.

40|$|Introduction: The Dutch Major Incident Hospital (MIH) is a standby, highly prepared, 200 -bed {{hospital}} strictly reserved {{to provide}} immediate, large-scale, and emergency care {{for victims of}} disasters and major incidents. It has long-standing experience training for various major incident scenarios, including functioning as a back-up facility for the Netherlands. In 1995, the MIH had experience with overtaking an evacuated hospital when that hospital was threatened by flooding. In November 2014, an exercise was performed to transfer an evacuating hospital to the MIH. The scenario again became reality when a neighbouring hospital had to evacuate in September 2015. This article evaluates the events and compares the exercise to the real events {{in order to further}} optimise future training. Methods: All three events were analysed using the Protocol for Reports from Major Accidents and Disasters, a standardised protocol to evaluate medical responses to a major incident. Results: During the 2014 exercise, 72 patients were received, compared with 143 and 70, respectively, in the real events in 1995 and 2015. Personnel from the evacuating hospitals accompanied the patients and continued working in the MIH. The patient surge differed on all three occasions. The information technology (IT) systems proved to be more prone to fail during the real event, and legal implications to have staff from another hospital work in the MIH had to be put in protocol during the deployment. The acute phase was comparable in all three events, and performance was good. However, the exercise did not last long enough to analyse the implications on multiday care, as experienced during a multiday deployment. Conclusion: Large-scale major <b>incident</b> <b>exercises</b> are a great benchmark for the medical response in the acute phase of relief. The MIH was shown to be highly prepared to admit an entire evacuating hospital or large groups of patients in such a scenario. Experiences from the past, combined with regular training that closely resembles reality, guarantee the level of preparedness. Key differences between a true deployment and an exercise are the inability to train multiple days, and in our experience, a successful operation of IT systems in test environments does not guarantee their successful use during live events...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{care for}} a sudden, {{unexpected}} large number of victims from a mass casualty incident (MCI) is demanding and challenging for every healthcare system. It requires paradigm shift from regular trauma care. Instead of {{focusing on the individual}} patient with unlimited resources the focus of care should be on the benefit of the largest number of people, with limited resources. The Dutch healthcare system has a unique solution to increasing the resilience and preparedness of the healthcare system: a hospital dedicated to the handling of surge capacity from MCIs, the Major Incident Hospital (MIH). The on-going development of systems, the design of new concepts, and the evaluation of their deployment to gain lessons learned are the focus of this thesis. Several other dedicated MCI hospitals have been built or are presently under construction. The local circumstances should be taken into account during their design, to determine the functionality for both short-term solutions for surge capacity and as fortified structures to withstand under-siege situations, depending on the challenges and risk countries face. The MIH continuously seeks to optimise their preparedness, for example by improving patient tracking and tracing systems. The development of the Patient Barcode Registration System (PBRS) started 20 years ago and is under constant improvement. Documentation is an important element of patient care and is obligatory by law. The documentation during mass casualty incidents is however secondary to patient treatment and almost non-existent. By creating simplified and short forms designed for mass casualty situations, documentation in the MIH has shown improvement. A high level of preparedness is needed to treat a patient with a highly contagious infectious disease. In 2014 the MIH admitted a patient with Ebola virus disease. Lessons learned confirmed the need of clear protocols, education, training and buddy systems. A high demand on hospital resources and staff was experienced. Full-scale major <b>incident</b> <b>exercises</b> are a great benchmark for the medical response in the acute phase of relief. The MIH was shown to be highly prepared to admit an entire evacuating hospital or large groups of patients in two deployments and a full scale exercise. To further develop evaluation of full scale MCI drills a new technique was developed using point of view cameras, to capture the patient’s perspective during a MCI response. The footage has provided new insights and the patient centred approach can be implemented in disaster medicine as well. Engaging health care professionals in crisis management training has proven difficult {{due to the lack of}} exposure. By using a financial stimulus package the Dutch government has succeeded in raising awareness and training. However, consolidation of training and skills should be taken into account. Preparedness should include integration of systems and exchange of knowledge throughout the entire medical chain, in the end no chain is stronger than its weakest link...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} examine the {{utilization}} of exercise stress testing in relation to age and gender in a population-based setting. Background. The utilization of noninvasive procedures {{has been shown to}} be associated with the subsequent use of invasive procedures. Yet, there are no population-based data on the utilization of stress testing; in particular, although gender differences in the use of invasive procedures have been reported, the use of noninvasive procedures has not been examined in relation to gender. Methods. In Olmsted County, Minnesota, passive surveillance of the medical care of the community is provided through the Rochester Epidemiology Project. A population-based cohort of Olmsted County residents undergoing exercise tests was identified. The medical records of residents with prevalent and <b>incident</b> <b>exercise</b> tests in 1987 and 1988 were reviewed. For persons with an initial test (incidence cohort), data on clinical presentation, test indications and results were abstracted. Stress test utilization rates were calculated, and crude rates were directly adjusted to the age distribution of the 1980 U. S. population. To help interpret patterns of use at the population level, coronary heart disease mortality rates (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th revision, codes 410 to 414) were calculated (crude and directly adjusted to the overall age distribution of the 1980 U. S. population) and used as an indicator of coronary disease burden. Results. A total of 2, 624 tests were performed. The crude utilization rate (per 100, 000) was 1, 888 for men and 703 for women (rate ratio for men over women 2. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 5 to 2. 9); it remained significantly higher in men across all age strata. The crude incidence rate (per 100, 000) of initial stress tests was 1, 112 for men and 517 for women (rate ratio 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 2. 4). For both men and women, the incidence increased with age; however, incidence remained lower in women in all age strata. At the time that they underwent an initial test, women were more symptomatic and had poorer exercise performance than men. The rate ratio of men over women for coronary heart disease mortality was 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 9 to 1. 2). The age-adjusted rate ratios for stress test utilization were 2. 8 (95 % CI 2. 5 to 3. 0), and that for coronary heart disease mortality was 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 7 to 2. 2). Conclusions. These population-based data show that during the study period, the utilization of stress testing in Olmsted County was lower in women than in men. Women in the incidence cohort were older and more symptomatic and had poorer exercise performance than men. Such differences should be considered when examining the utilization of subsequent invasive procedures according to gender...|$|R
