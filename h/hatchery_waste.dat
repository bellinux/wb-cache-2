40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effect of autoclaving, toasting and cooking processes on raw <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste</b> with shell and without shell. Average crude protein contents of <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste</b> meal (with shell) were 18. 17 % due to cooking and 16. 83 % due to toasting. Crude fibre contents were the lowest under cooking process. Crude fat contents were reduced to 11. 44 % by autoclaving. Total ash contents were increased substantially during all treatments. Calcium contents were reduced to 20 % due to autoclaving. Nitrogen Free Extract (NFE) contents and metabalizable energy contents were significantly modified. Average crude protein contents of <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste</b> meal (without shell) and crude fat contents were significantly increased (P< 0. 01) under respective processes. Total ash contents were reduced due to removal of egg shell. Calcium and phosphorus contents were also reduced significantly due to removal of eggshell.

40|$|ABSTRACT In Experiment 1, {{two types}} of <b>hatchery</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{including}} cockerel chicks (CC), and shell waste (SW) blended with CC (60 : 40 CC:SW), were ground and mixed with a by-product carbohydrate (5, 10, and 15 % wt/wt) {{with or without a}} bacterial culture and fer-mented for a period of 21 d. Cockerel chicks fermented with 15 % carbohydrate and the culture had a pleasant smell and little H 2 S production. Elevated H 2 S concentra-tions were recorded for CC:SW samples at all carbohy-drate levels when the culture was not added. No NH 3 was detected from any treatments during fermentation. The addition of culture to the CC and CC:SW by-products resulted in pH values lower (P < 0. 05) than those without culture on Day 21, and the 15 % carbohy-drate treatment significantly reduced pH beyond the 5 % carbohydrate. Final proximate composition of CC and CC:SW samples with culture were not significantly different from those without culture added. In Experiment 2, carbohydrate was added at 10. 0, 13. 3, 16. 7, and 20. 0 % wt/wt to CC and CC:SW {{in the presence of the}} bacterial culture. Shell waste alone was fermented with 15, 20, and 25 % carbohydrate and the culture. Moisture level in this experiment was adjusted to approximately 70 % for all treatments.

40|$|A {{literature}} review was undertaken to identify methods {{being used to}} handle and treat <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste.</b> <b>Hatchery</b> <b>waste</b> can be separated into solid waste and liquid waste by centrifuging or by using screens. Potential methods for treating <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste</b> on site include use of a furnace to heat the waste to produce steam to run a turbine generator or to use an in line composter to stabilise the waste. There is also potential to use anaerobic digestion at hatcheries to produce methane and fertilisers. Hatcheries disposing wastewater into lagoons could establish a series of ponds where algae, zooplankton and fish utilise the nutrients using integrated aquaculture which cleans the water making it more suitable for irrigation. The ideal system to establish in a hatchery would be to incorporate separation and handling equipment to separate waste into its various components for further treatment. This would save disposal costs, produce biogas to reduce power costs at plants and produce a range of value added products. However the scale of operations at many hatcheries is too small and development of treatment systems may not be viable...|$|E

40|$|Animal {{by-products}} (ABP) Category 3 includes <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste,</b> {{and also}} slaughterhouse waste and manure, aimed {{for use in}} biogas production. In order {{to be used as}} fertilisers, they must be sanitised to reduce pathogenic microorganisms. The initial European regulations regarding processing standards for ABP intended for use in e. g. biogas plants (EC No. 1774 / 2002) stipulated thermal treatment at 70 °C for 60 min. A subsequent amendment (EC No. 208 / 2006) stated that a validated treatment process may be used if it can show a reduction in thermo-resistant viruses of at least 3 log 10, whenever deamed a risk. Thermal treatments of biogas substrate at 70 °C and at 55 °C, using porcine parvovirus and swine vesicular disease virus, were performed. As a chemical sanitisation process regarding <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste,</b> ammonia inactivation was tested using the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H 7 N 1 and the low pathogenic avian influenza virus H 5 N 3. Models for other avian pathogenic ssRNA viruses were bovine parainfluenza virus 3, feline calicivirus and feline coronavirus. As possible indicators for monitoring virus inactivation, bacteriophages MS 2, ΦX 174, and 28 b were evaluated. Thermal treatment at 70 °C for 60 min inactivated porcine parvovirus by 2. 6 log 10, while phage 28 b was unaffected. Swine vesicular disease virus was undetectable after 30 min. Using too thermostable viruses as models for sufficient virus reduction in thermal treatments regarding Category 3 ABP materials and manure intended for biogas or composting plants, according to EU regulations, would make demands on other time-temperature combinations very strict. All viruses tested were efficiently inactivated by ammonia treatment in <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste,</b> while phage ΦX 174 proved too conservative to be used as indicator.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Although Australia is {{free from}} highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI), incursions {{of this disease}} {{have the potential to}} have severe impacts on animal welfare and cause substantial economic losses for Australia’s commercial poultry industries. Australia has experienced five epidemics of HPAI between 1976 and 1997, and has detailed contingency plans for this disease, but the potential consequences and effectiveness of different control and eradication strategies under Australian conditions are not well understood. Epidemiological modelling is a tool {{that can be used to}} combine available information on infection dynamics from field and experimental studies with expert opinion to gain insights into disease transmission and control. This thesis describes the application of modelling tools to study the spread of HPAI within and between farms. In particular, it describes the development, verification, validation, sensitivity analysis and evaluation of a spatial, stochastic simulation model, called AISPREAD, to investigate the potential transmission and control of HPAI in the Australian chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey industries. AISPREAD is divided into three modules: a production module to simulate the timing of farm husbandry practices such as routine destocking and visits by service providers; an infection module to simulate the spread of infection between farms by local spread, the movement of live birds and contact networks of service providers; and a mitigations module which implements combinations of realistic outbreak response strategies. AISPREAD is a flexible simulation model that can incorporate different combinations of mitigation strategies including: active and passive surveillance; diagnosis; tracing; zoning; quarantine and movement restrictions; culling, disinfection and decontamination of infected farms; pre-emptive culling; process slaughter of chicken meat broiler and duck and turkey grower farms; and emergency vaccination. Data on the location, ownership, type, capacity, biosecurity and production characteristics and identity of service providers were obtained from a series of cross-sectional surveys of the commercial chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey industries conducted in 2005 and 2007. These studies revealed that these industries are functionally distinct and few of the 1594 farms produced multiple species of poultry. However, five Australian poultry production regions had poultry farm densities that were comparable to areas in Canada and Italy that have experienced extensive epidemics of HPAI, indicating that they may be more vulnerable to larger outbreaks. Results also revealed that movements of birds and service providers between farms could lead to the transmission of HPAI between companies, regions or industries. Limited data were available to estimate several important model parameters, including the likelihood of HPAI spreading between farms by different types of indirect contacts; the relative effectiveness of biosecurity measures on different types of farms to prevent indirect transmission of HPAI on fomites; the number of trucks operated by feed mills, <b>hatcheries</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal companies; and the risk of HPAI spread posed by the movement of used cardboard egg trays in the chicken egg layer industry. A modified Delphi conference approach was used in this study to gather the opinions of Australian poultry industry professionals to estimate these parameters. This study confirmed that poultry industry experts considered that indirect contacts by service providers between poultry farms and differences in biosecurity practices between poultry farms would be important in the spread of HPAI amongst poultry farms. In order to investigate within-farm spread of HPAI, a stochastic discrete entity simulation model was developed to estimate parameters regarding the dynamics of HPAI in unvaccinated and vaccinated chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey farms.

The monitoring of the process included observations of the reduction of the organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, and total (TS) and volatile solids (VS), as well as the variation of pH and electrical conductivity (EC). The results showed that the mixing between the hatchery fresh waste and swine wastewater (T 4) and among fresh <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste,</b> water from the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery and swine wastewater (T 5) represent significant sources of renewable energy and thereby greater potential for biogas production (192. 50 and 205. 0 L biogas per kg of VS added to T 4 and T 5, respectively). The average concentration of methane in the biogas varied from 72 to 77 % among the treatments. For all treatments, reductions were observed in TS and VS and increases in pH and EC.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of hatchery eggshell membranes (HESM) as a short term feed supplement on growth performance and immunity of chickens under bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged condition. Three studies were conducted to find the effect of HESM supplement on post hatch chickens. In the first study, the chickens were fed either a control diet or diets containing 0. 5 % whey protein or HESM as supplement and evaluated at 5 weeks of age using growth, hematology, clinical chemistry, plasma immunoglobulins, and corticosterone as variables. The second and third studies were done to compare the effects of LPS on control and HESM fed birds at 5 weeks of age following at 4 and 24 h of treatment where the HESM was also sterilized with ethanol to deplete bacterial factors. HESM supplement caused weight gain in 2 experiments and decreased blood corticosterone concentrations. While LPS caused a significant loss in body weight at 24 h following its administration, the HESM supplemented birds showed significantly less body weight loss compared with the control fed birds. The WBC, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the levels of IgG were low in chickens fed diets with HESM supplement compared with control diet group. LPS challenge increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene IL- 6 but the HESM fed birds showed its effect curtailed, also, which also, favored the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory genes compared with control diet fed chickens.

Considerando a problemÃtica este projeto teve por objetivo o estudo da viabilidade de aproveitamento dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio por meio da co-digestÃo anaerÃbia. Para o ensaio de co-digestÃo foi utilizada uma bateria de 20 biodigestores, confeccionados com tubos de PVC, com capacidade para aproximadamente 60 L cada, simulando um biodigestor tubular horizontal. Os resÃduos foram cedidos pela Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata â Copacol e sÃo provenientes das unidades de CafelÃndia â PR (Abate de aves), Nova Aurora â PR (IncubatÃrio de Aves) e Formosa â PR (Unidade Produtora de LeitÃes â UPL). Cinco misturas foram avaliadas, sendo elas: Tratamento 1 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua do tanque de equalizaÃÃo da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 2 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 3 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio. Tratamento 4 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Tratamento 5 (Misto) : ResÃduos de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Cada mistura compÃs um tratamento, o qual foi repetido quatro vezes. Todas as misturas foram processadas em liquidificador. As diferentes misturas foram calculadas de maneira a obter um substrato com 4 % de sÃlidos totais no inÃcio do processo - fase batelada, e com 2 % de sÃlidos totais para fase contÃnua. AlÃm dos materiais avaliados, todos os tratamentos receberam uma porcentagem de 15 % de inÃculo (resÃduo de gado de corte) na fase batelada e fase de adaptaÃÃo do sistema na alimentaÃÃo contÃnua. Primeiramente foi realizado o ensaio em batelada, o que possibilitou definir o ponto de queima do biogÃs nos diferentes tratamentos, bem como a curva de produÃÃo de gÃs, definindo assim, o tempo de retenÃÃo hidrÃulica (TRH) do substrato nos biodigestores. Para a fase contÃnua os biodigestores foram descarregados no final da fase batelada onde o efluente foi peneirado. ApÃs a fraÃÃo lÃquida foi novamente disposta nos biodigestores. A partir desta fase iniciouse o abastecimento continuo onde durante um mÃs os biodigestores alÃm de sua carga diÃria tambÃm receberam uma porcentagem de inÃculo para que houvesse uma adaptaÃÃo do sistema. As anÃlises de caracterizaÃÃo foram realizadas no afluente e efluente dos biodigestores na fase batelada, nos resÃduos separadamente, no afluente e efluente da fase contÃnua como tambÃm no resÃduo retido no biodigestor apÃs fase de abastecimento contÃnuo. Foram utilizadas metodologias especÃficas para as anÃlises, tais como: ST, SV, carbono orgÃnico total, nitrogÃnio (NTK), minerais, pH, condutividade elÃtrica, DQO, bem como o potencial mÃdio de produÃÃo de biogÃs e metano, porcentagem de metano e diÃxido de carbono no mesmo. T 4 apresentou os melhores desempenhos em produÃÃo de biogÃs. Maiores porcentagens de CH 4 na fase batelada foram apresentadas pelo tratamento T 2. Para fase contÃnua as maiores porcentagens foram apresentadas pelos tratamentos T 2, T 4 e T 5. A maior reduÃÃo nos valores de DQO foi observada no tratamento contendo Ãgua residuÃria da lagoa anaerÃbia do frigorifico - T 2. A concentraÃÃo de minerais no efluente dos biodigestores, para todos os tratamentos, agregou ao biofertilizante valor agronÃmico. The {{growth of}} the poultry sector, both to supply the internal market and for export, has moved the Brazilian agribusiness. The productive chain of the broiler generates a considerable variety and quantity of waste with the most distinct characteristics. In the case of <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste,</b> has been a considerable volume of material produced, with high pollution potential. Considering the problems this project aimed to study the feasibility of use of <b>hatchery</b> <b>waste</b> by anaerobic co-digestion. To test the co-digestion was used a battery of 20 digesters made with PVC pipes, with a capacity of about 60 L each, simulating a horizontal tubular digester. The wastes were disposed of by Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata - Copacol and are from the units of CafelÃndia - PR (Slaughter of poultry), Nova Aurora - PR (Poultry Hatchery) and Formosa - PR (Unit Production of Piglets - UPL). Five mixtures were evaluated, as follows: Treatment 1 : Residue hatchery drained + Waste water tank agribusiness. Treatment 2 : Residue hatchery drained + water from the first anaerobic pond agribusiness. Treatment 3 : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery. Treatment 4 : Residue hatchery fresh + swine wastewater. Treatment 5 (Mixed) : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery + swine wastewater. Each composed a mixture treatment, which was repeated four times. All blends were processed in the blender. The different mixtures were calculated to obtain a substrate with 4 % total solids early in the process - batch phase, and 2 % total solids for solid phase. Besides the materials evaluated, all treatments received a percentage of 15 % of inoculum (cattle waste) during batch and adaptation phase of the system in continuous feeding. First test was performed in batch, {{making it possible to}} define the point of burning the biogas in the different treatments, and the curve of gas production, thus setting the hydraulic retention time (TRH) substrate in the digesters. For the continuous phase digesters were unloaded {{at the end of the}} batch phase where the effluent was screened. After, the liquid fraction was again prepared in the digesters. From this phase, began one where supplies still over a month the digesters beyond their daily load also received a percentage of inoculum for there was an adaptation of the system. Analyses were performed to characterize the influent and effluent of the digesters in the batch phase, the waste separately, in the influent and effluent of the continuous phase as well in residue retained in the digester after stage continuous water supply. Specific methodologies were used for analysis, such as: ST, SV, total organic carbon, nitrogen (TKN), minerals, pH, conductivity, COD, and the average potential of biogas production and methane content of methane and carbon dioxide carbon in it. T 4 showed the best performance in biogas production. Higher percentages of CH 4 in the batch phase were presented by the T 2. For the continuous phase, the highest percentages were presented by the T 2, T 4 and T 5. The largest reduction in COD values was observed in plants containing wastewater from the anaerobic pond the fridge - T 2. The concentration of minerals in the effluent of the digesters, all treatments, added to biofertilizer agronomic value...|$|E
