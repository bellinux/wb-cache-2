5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for <b>definitive</b> <b>answers.</b> In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any <b>definitive</b> <b>answers.</b> The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided <b>definitive</b> <b>answers</b> to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E

25|$|Literary {{analysis}} {{has been going}} on since classical Greece, when the writers of those times read previous works on the subject. No <b>definitive</b> <b>answers</b> were ever forthcoming by this method; it rather served to better define the problems. The method perhaps reached a peak in the Victorian era when new methods of systematic comparison began to be applied in philology. Typical of the era is the long and detailed study of William Ewart Gladstone, who among his many talents was a trained classicist. Until further ancient texts come to light, advances on the subject cannot be made. The most likely source of progress regarding the Pelasgians continues to be archaeology and related sciences.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{one answer}} from modern science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or species in the required answer. It is thought that the genus of man {{has been around for}} ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that <b>definitive</b> <b>answers</b> are not available. The consensus view is that human beings are one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin in the past. (That assertion leaves aside the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E

Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for <b>definitive</b> <b>answers,</b> must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world.

500|$|Bell et al. {{wrote that}} while there was an ongoing debate over the origins of homosexuality, there is {{evidence}} supporting the view that homosexuality has a biological basis, and that hormonal factors could be involved. Though they acknowledged that their study {{did not have the}} necessary data to explain how sexual preference might be related to biology, Bell et al. wrote that their findings were consistent with what one would expect to find if sexual preference had a biological basis. They suggested that biological factors probably have a more powerful influence on exclusive homosexuals than on bisexuals, and {{that if there is a}} biological basis to homosexuality, it probably accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. They also proposed that the [...] "familial factors commonly thought to account for homosexuality" [...] may actually result from the way parents react to their prehomosexual children. Bell et al. argued that demonstrating that homosexuality is biologically innate would lead to greater social tolerance, and help to relieve parents of gay people of guilt. They expressed hope that researchers would eventually produce more <b>definitive</b> <b>answers</b> about the origins of homosexuality.|$|E

[...] Sosa, Rodríguez, Palmeiro and Clemens answered with either similar levels of ambiguity or denials. [...] Selig and Fehr defended the policy that was in place, stating they felt it was sufficient. [...] The hearing lasted 11 hours having produced neither any <b>definitive</b> <b>answers</b> besides denials nor any proclamations to make concrete steps to clean up the sport. [...] As a result, Selig, Fehr, the players Congress subpoenaed and any other player suspected of using PEDs became objects of public scorn.|$|E
