500|$|On 15 July 1895, Yeats and Olivia {{traveled}} to Kent to visit Valentine Fox; the trip Harwood says [...] "would have been, emotionally speaking a highly charged outing". Of the railway trip, Yeats {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "when on our first railway journey together—we were {{to spend the day}} at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> & a little shocked". They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> {{with this}} plain-dealing; yet, there was {{something}} about the manner of the man that prevented my being displeased.|$|E
60|$|He {{held out}} his arm to me, and bade me try his muscle. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled.</b> The hard flesh almost filled his sleeve.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{am quite}} {{equal to the}} walk,” {{returned}} a low, tremulous voice; “but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>startled</b> by the manner of that Indian, Oh! his eye was horrid, {{as he turned to}} the moon, in speaking to my father. But I forgot, sir; he is your friend, and by his language may be your relative; and yet of you I do not feel afraid.” ...|$|R
60|$|Mill. For my part, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>startled</b> at the message, that <b>I</b> shall {{scarcely}} <b>be</b> myself {{these two}} days.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{pleasant}} sort of face, I think; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>startled</b> <b>I</b> don't {{quite know}} what it <b>was</b> like. <b>I</b> wish we had a curtain there,' said Tilly.|$|R
60|$|As I {{passed through}} the living-room to reach my own, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by a white-robed figure {{in front of the}} Virgin's picture.|$|E
60|$|And there <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to {{see what}} I took to be a wild man, with unkempt beard and ragged hair, {{pursuing}} a giant butterfly with brilliant wings.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled.</b> Had I spoken {{my thought}} aloud? I turned, and the French window was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Indeed, I'll {{confess that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} <b>startled</b> {{when you came}} in. You see, I imagined that you were still in Canada." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>startled</b> by a voice pronouncing my name. Past {{and present}} {{have become so}} confusedly mingled under the {{associations}} of the spot that for a time it has escaped my memory that this mound was the place agreed on for the aforesaid appointment. I turn and behold my friend. He stands with a dark lantern {{in his hand and}} a spade and light pickaxe over his shoulder. He expresses both delight and surprise that I have come. I tell him I had set out before the bad weather began.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} <b>startled</b> at his words, but I stood my ground. Lowell ran to {{the starboard}} side of the schooner, and presently returned with a stout rope some three feet long.|$|R
6000|$|Still {{oppressed by}} {{reflections}} which {{pointed to the}} future in this discouraging way, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by a voice outside the door--a sweet, sad voice--saying, [...] "May I come in?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> and indignant when I {{discovered}} Mr. Allen Price with my handbag, {{trying to}} open it. It looked very much as if my fellow-passenger was endeavoring to rob me.|$|E
60|$|And it chanced that as I {{emerged from}} the hollies by {{the corner of the}} {{shrubbery}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to come unexpectedly upon a young man in evening dress smoking a cigar.|$|E
60|$|All of {{a sudden}} Jones stood up, {{and let out a}} wild Comanche yell. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more <b>startled</b> by the yell than by the great hand he smashed down on my shoulder, and for the moment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dazed.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{seeing my}} face, which <b>I</b> doubt not <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> enough, {{she seemed to}} repent of her haste and patted me gently on the head.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{things that}} <b>I</b> have remembered <b>are</b> {{constantly}} popping into my head. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> repeatedly <b>startled</b> by the vividness {{with which they}} recur to me after the lapse of years and their utter uselessness in being remembered at all.|$|R
60|$|I {{went across}} the quarry, down to where the brook ran murmuring a tale to the primroses and the budding trees. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> from my {{wandering}} among the fresh things by a faint clatter of stones.|$|E
60|$|But I had scarce {{finished}} my chocolate {{and begun to}} smoke in a pleasant revery, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> {{by the arrival of}} two gentlemen. One was Comyn, and the other none less than Mr. Charles Fox.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if an hour had fled, {{although}} the current should have carried us among the fleet in {{less than half that}} time, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by hearing a voice close by my side, apparently.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} <b>startled.</b> She laid {{her hand on}} my arm, and sank her voice to a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|I guessed {{what that}} {{sentence}} meant {{to a man}} of his energies; but he had accepted it gracefully, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost <b>startled</b> when he said: [...] "Do you know that I envied you, Ormesby, even when things looked worst for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The noise we made in {{ascending}} {{the stairs}} {{seemed to me}} loud enough to alarm the inmates of the house near at hand, and, therefore, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> neither <b>startled</b> nor surprised when some person {{at one end of}} the second floor, cried out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Given to government, Joe?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled,</b> for I {{had some}} shadowy idea (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had {{divorced}} {{her in a}} favor of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.|$|E
6000|$|From this delectable reverie, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by my father's {{slapping}} {{me on the}} shoulder. [...] "What {{possesses the}} lad?" [...] cried he; [...] "here have I been speaking to you half a dozen times, without receiving an answer." ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{interrupted}} by a sudden clearness that fell upon the night. The clouds dispersed: the stars shone {{in every part of}} the heavens; and, consulting my watch, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to find it already hard on five in the morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} <b>startled</b> by {{this latter}} exclamation. The tales were almost consumed, {{but just then}} threw forth a broad sheet of fire, which flickered as with laughter, making the whole room dance in its brightness, and then roared portentously up the chimney.|$|R
60|$|Several {{times at}} midnight <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>startled</b> {{out of a}} sound sleep by a sudden, violent rush under my hammock, caused by the abrupt {{breaking}} up of some nest of gamblers, who have scattered in all directions, brushing under the tiers of swinging pallets, and setting them all in a rocking commotion.|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{was in bed}} {{and about}} to fall asleep when I had the {{distinct}} impression that “I” was at the ceiling level looking down at my body in the bed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very <b>startled</b> and frightened; immediately afterward I felt that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> consciously back in the bed again.” ...|$|R
6000|$|To say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> {{would not}} express it. I {{remained}} still, {{like a man}} lost in a dream. Clapping both his hands {{to that part of}} his frail anatomy which had received the shock, the poor wretch said to me simply: ...|$|E
60|$|I stooped {{down with}} the double purpose of obeying Mr. Finch's {{commands}} and of humouring the child's whim, by carrying Jicks out of the room, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by a sound from the bed-chamber--the sound, loud and peremptory, of Lucilla's voice.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled.</b> This, then, is {{the secret}} of Italy's {{attraction}} for us, this phallic worship. To the Italian the phallus is the symbol of individual creative immortality, to each man his own Godhead. The child is but {{the evidence of the}} Godhead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I replied, [...] "that is the way: {{it leads}} to St. John's Wood and the Regent's Park. You must excuse my not {{answering}} you before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather <b>startled</b> by your sudden appearance in the road; and <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> even now, quite unable to account for it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{can hardly}} tell whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more <b>startled</b> or distressed at hearing him say that. If <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> younger, <b>I</b> might have confessed {{as much to}} Mr. Franklin. But when you are old, you acquire one {{excellent}} habit. In cases where you don't see your way clearly, you hold your tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... "There wasn't {{anything}} there!" [...] said Cuss, {{his voice}} running {{up into a}} shriek at the [...] "there." [...] "It's all very well for you to laugh, but I tell you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>startled,</b> <b>I</b> hit his cuff hard, and turned around, and {{cut out of the}} room--I left him--" ...|$|R
