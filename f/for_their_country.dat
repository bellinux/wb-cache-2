5|$|East Stirlingshire {{players have}} been capped <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country</b> at full {{international}} level 9 times by four different players. The first person to do so was Humphrey Jones, who captained the Wales national team four times out of the five caps he earned whilst at East Stirlingshire. His first came in a British Home Championship match against England in 1889. The three other players to make an appearance <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country</b> are Archibald Ritchie, David Alexander and James McKie, all for the Scotland national team at the British Championship. Each of them made their début against Wales, although in different seasons. Archibald Ritchie's one and only Scotland cap came in March 1891 against Wales, who were captained by former East Stirlingshire player Humphrey Jones. David Alexander made two appearances, one against Ireland and scoring against Wales at the 1894 British Home Championship which Scotland won. James McKie scored twice during his only appearance for Scotland, in a 5–2 victory over Wales in 1898. He is the last East Stirlingshire player to be capped by his country.|$|E
5|$|The Home {{opened its}} doors in 1923. It was built as a diocesan {{memorial}} to the Coloured men who paid the ultimate sacrifice <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country.</b> It was run by the Anglican Nuns, the Order of St Margaret, East Grinstead who remained in charge until 1978 when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid. The Main Block, Boys' House and Priests' House were designed by the diocesan architect F.L.H. Flemming. The Church successfully opposed removal of the Home because the property was on farm land and {{not part of a}} proclaimed township.|$|E
5|$|The tournament sees players {{competing}} <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country</b> in four {{singles and}} one doubles matches, known as rubbers, {{over the course}} of three days, with the team that wins three rubbers progressing.

The Davis Cup World Group is the top level of the competition and features matches between players from the top 16 countries {{at the start of the}} year. Countries that lose their first round match face a relegation play-off against winning countries from the continental zones. World Group winning countries progress to the quarter-finals. Nations have to win a further three ties in order to claim the position of Davis Cup Champions.|$|E

5|$|The two athletes {{that were}} {{selected}} to compete at the London Games were Benjamín Enzema in the men's 800 metres and Bibiana Olama in the women's 100 metres hurdles. Olama was the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. The country's Olympic women's football team was disqualified from the event's qualification stage after {{it was discovered that}} they were fielding an ineligible player. The Equatorial Guinea delegation was led by the NOC president Manuel Sabino Asumu Kawan and the country's Ambassador in London, Mari-Cruz Evuna Andeme. The athletes were coached by Jose Moises Bodipo Minter, and the competitors said that despite training being difficult in Equatorial Guinea, they wanted to establish a good reputation <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate {{drastically}} increased; {{where he}} had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years. He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta, Argentina's all-time top scorer, for the most goals scored in a calendar year <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country.</b> His first hat-trick with the Albicelestes came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure {{their place in the}} 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013; in addition to providing an assist, he scored twice from a penalty kick, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind only Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign. Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Despite this debacle, in {{the same}} summer he was {{entrusted}} with the post of magister militum for Thrace, and tasked with campaigning against the Avars {{at the head of}} an improvised force. His deputy (hypostrategos) Salvianus with 1,000 cavalry was sent to hold the passes of the Haemus Mountains, but after two days was forced by the Avars' numerical superiority to withdraw. The Avars sacked the city of Anchialos, but an attempted siege of Drizipera was broken off and the Avars marched south, reaching Heraclea Perinthus and cutting Priscus's forces off from Constantinople. Outflanked, Priscus retreated to Tzurullum, where he was besieged by the Avars. The 7th-century historian Theophylact Simocatta reports that after a few days, Priscus devised a stratagem to force the Avars to withdraw: he allowed one of his guards to be captured, bearing a fake letter purportedly coming from Maurice that informed Priscus of a seaborne attack against the Avars' homeland. The Avar khagan was persuaded that the letter was true and prepared to return home in haste; he arranged for a truce in exchange for the renewed payment of an annual tribute. The 12th-century history of Michael the Syrian gives this as 800 pounds of gold (some 60,000 solidi), a considerably reduced sum compared to the 100,000 solidi agreed in 584. The Avars departed <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>country,</b> while Priscus disbanded his army and returned to Constantinople. Priscus disappears for the next few years, as he fell into disfavour with Maurice. By 593, he had recovered his position, as a letter by Pope Gregory the Great which congratulates him on returning to the emperor's favour testifies. The Pope's letter also testifies that by this time, Priscus had been given the Empire's supreme honorary rank, that of patrikios.|$|E
