5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the <b>diffractometer</b> to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

There {{was a need for}} structural studies of liquid sodium and sodium-potassium alloys because these were used as coolants in fast-breeder reactors. [...] Fulmer developed a high temperature x-ray <b>diffractometer</b> for investigating the structures of liquid metals and alloys. In addition to its studies of liquid alkali metals, Fulmer discovered that certain eutectics, such as those in the gold-silicon and gold-germanium systems, have a structure in the liquid phase that has to be disrupted on crystallization. [...] This gives rise to considerable supercooling which results in multiple nucleation, and hence a very fine grain size in the resulting polycrystalline alloy.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the most effective detector configuration for neutron spectrometers using a discussion of a particular case - constant-wavelength powder <b>diffractometers</b> at continuous neutron sources. A first variation uses an essentially one-dimensional `banana' detector coupled with out-of-scattering-plane beam divergence before and after the sample. A second variation uses an incident beam tightly defined both in- and out-of-plane coupled to a ` 4 pi' detector covering all possible scattering angles after the sample. It is widely believed that the 4 pi arrangement is superior for most varieties of neutron spectrometer but is more difficult and more expensive to implement. Starting from a commonly used overall instrument figure-of-merit, this article presents simple arguments leading to the surprising conclusion that this is untrue for these constant-wavelength powder <b>diffractometers,</b> provided only that the cylindrical samples used with the banana detector have a height greater than 2. 4 times their diameter. © 2011, Wiley-Blackwell.
