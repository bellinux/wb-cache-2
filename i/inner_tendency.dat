2500|$|The {{official}} orthodox Marxist–Leninist {{theory of}} state monopoly capitalism ("stamocap") similarly suggested {{that in the}} 20th century epoch of the [...] "general crisis of capitalism", {{the state and its}} public funds acted as guarantor and promotor of stable monopoly profits by corporations, counteracting the TRPF. The general thrust of monopoly theories is that profitability does not fall, because the ordinary laws of the capitalist market are overruled by the state and monopolization. However, Ben Fine and Laurence Harris combined the TRPF with state monopoly capitalism theory at a higher level of abstraction: [...] " [...] is not a law which predicts actual falls in the rate of profit (in value or price terms)". At an even higher level of abstraction, Michael A.Lebowitz postulated [...] "the <b>inner</b> <b>tendency</b> of Capital to become one". Anwar Shaikh however recently made the case that monopoly capital never truly existed, since normally speaking business cannot totally monopolize a market, or evade competition altogether; as a logical corollary, business cannot evade the TRPF.|$|E

25|$|But in Matthew Arnold’s {{dramatic}} poem “The Strayed Reveller” (1849), {{in which}} Circe {{is one of}} the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The <b>inner</b> <b>tendencies</b> unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet’s participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced, he craves for it to be continued.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to see how Leonardo Polo’s Transcendental Anthropology can give a {{foundation}} to the levels of happiness of Robert Spitzer, in his work: Healing the Culture and the hierarchy of basic needs of Abraham Maslow. Spitzer distinguishes four levels of happiness according to the <b>inner</b> <b>tendencies</b> of the human being, which he names in Latin as “laetus, felix, beatitudo and gaudio”. Maslow orders the basic human needs from physiological to safety, love, esteem, and finally self actualization. This paper observes that a) both Spitzer and Polo are in agreement with the perennial philosophy views about happiness and b) that Polo gives a trans-metaphysical (transcendental) grounding to a personal consideration of the last two levels analysed by Spitzer and c) that Maslow bases his analysis in dynamic psychology, and tends to mix Spitzers’ last three levels in his three last levels of needs.

Among Michaelson’s prominent ideas {{is the notion}} of inner passivity; a passive attitude with which he claims people treat inner masochism.

5000|$|Prophecy {{believes}} that this world is God's world and that in this world His goodness and truth will yet be vindicated. Hence the prophet prophesies of a definite future arising out of and organically connected with the present. The apocalyptic writer despairs of the present and directs his hopes to the future, to a new world standing in essential opposition to the present. This becomes a dualistic principle, which, though it can largely {{be accounted for by}} the interaction of certain <b>inner</b> <b>tendencies</b> and outward sorrowful experience on the part of Judaism, may ultimately be derived from Mazdean influences. This principle, which shows itself in the conception that the various nations are under angelic rulers, who are in a greater or less degree in rebellion against God, as in Daniel and Enoch, grows in strength with each succeeding age, till at last Satan is conceived as [...] "the ruler of this world" [...] or [...] "the god of this age." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hindu {{literature}} variously discuss ethics as {{one or more}} of four topics: (1) Gunas that is <b>inner</b> <b>tendencies</b> {{of conduct}} found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) Purushartha that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness (dharma, artha, kama and moksha); (3) Ashramas that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) Varnasramas that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society. Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism. Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes: (1) ethics {{is an essential part of}} dharma concept, (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible, and (3) Ethics cannot always be dualistically or non-dualistically reduced from first principles, ethics is closely related to moksha (self realization and spiritual freedom) with Vivekacudamani stating, [...] "individuals with self knowledge and spiritual freedom are inherently self examining and ethical" [...] and [...] "ethics, freedom and knowledge require each other". In addition to the above four topics in Hindu ethics, scholars state that the karma doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.|$|R

Our two-stage study of 18 - to 25 -year-old college students {{suggests that many}} of the advertising dollars consumer goods firms spend on Facebook are likely wasted. This study highlights that, in addition to staying in touch with friends and relatives, Facebook users are primarily motivated by three desires: (1) to voyeuristically peer into others’ lives, (2) to create a distinctive identity for themselves, and (3) to act on their <b>inner</b> narcissistic <b>tendencies.</b> These motivations also make them poor prospects for advertisers, as users seem disinterested in Facebook ads and disengaged from marketers’ attempts to build brands. Herein, we discuss challenges for marketers, as well as opportunities for building brands and driving sales via Facebook...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{applications}} of the multi-agent attitude to the stock market. In this paper we focus on influence of psychological analysis on each agent decision making process leading to buying or selling shares. Article inscribes the creation process of proper multi-agent system simulating the stock market members, {{each with its own}} <b>inner</b> properties and <b>tendencies.</b> Finally the implementation of the model in object oriented language is described. The whole model in paper is working with few basic entities like participants, decision function, simulation control and reporting module. Participants on the stock market (software agents) are affected by the behaviour of surrounding competitors. Each participant has the different set of inner behavioural rules of processing his inputs. Developed simulation gives wide range of possible simulation tasks and our future aim is to upgrade it to the simulation framework. The main goal of paper is answering the question, how the change in behaviour of watched competitors affects the decision making of each single participant (using stochastic approach) and how to use this type of simulations in learning process to let students understand psychological aspects of stock market member decision...|$|R
60|$|Consider {{next the}} {{movements}} of the planets on their axes. Laplace alleged as one among other evidences of a common genetic cause, that the planets rotate in a direction the same as that in which they go round the Sun, and on axes approximately perpendicular to their orbits. Since he wrote, an exception to this general rule has been discovered in the case of Uranus, and another still more recently in the case of Neptune--judging, at least, from the motions of their respective satellites. This anomaly has been thought to throw considerable doubt on his speculation; and at first sight it does so. But a little reflection shows that the anomaly is not inexplicable, and that Laplace simply went too far in putting down as a certain result of nebular genesis, what is, in some instances, only a probable result. The cause he pointed out as determining the direction of rotation, is the greater absolute velocity of the outer part of the detached ring. But there are conditions under which this difference of velocity may be too insignificant, even if it exists. If a mass of nebulous matter approaching spirally to the central spheroid, and eventually joining it tangentially, is made up of parts having the same absolute velocities; then, after joining the equatorial periphery of the spheroid and being made to rotate with it, the angular velocity of its outer parts will be smaller than the angular velocity of its inner parts. Hence, if, when the angular velocities of the outer and inner parts of a detached ring are the same, there results a tendency to rotation in the same direction with the orbital motion, it may be inferred that when the outer parts of the ring have a smaller angular velocity than the <b>inner</b> parts, a <b>tendency</b> to retrograde rotation will be the consequence.|$|R
