5|$|A {{radio galaxy}} {{is an active}} galaxy that is very {{luminous}} in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars {{are believed to be}} the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.|$|E

5|$|Hubble's law violates special {{theory of}} {{relativity}}: Hubble's law predicts that <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> are beyond Hubble Distance recede {{faster than the}} speed of light. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion of space, rather than through space.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Herschel also {{observed}} three faint galaxies, {{two of which}} are interacting with each other. NGC 2508 is a lenticular galaxy of thirteenth-magnitude, estimated at 205 million light-years (63 million parsecs) distance with a diameter of 80 thousand light-years (25 thousand parsecs). Named as a single object by Herschel, NGC 2402 is actually a pair of near-adjacent <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> appear to be interacting with each other. Only of fourteenth- and fifteenth-magnitudes respectively, the elliptical and spiral galaxy are thought to be approximately 245 million light-years distant, and each measure 55,000 light-years in diameter.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical <b>galaxy</b> <b>that</b> displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar <b>galaxy</b> <b>that</b> does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a <b>galaxy</b> <b>that</b> has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|R

5|$|The NGC 2841 {{group is}} a group of <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> lie both in Lynx and {{neighbouring}} Ursa Major. It includes the loose triplet NGC 2541, NGC 2500, and NGC 2552 within Lynx. Using cepheids of NGC 2541 as standard candles, the distance to that galaxy (and the group) has been estimated at around 40 million light–years. NGC 2841 itself lies in Ursa Major.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, {{which can be used}} to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E
5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy is}} a member of an {{association}} named the Local Group, a relatively small group of <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster. And the Virgo Supercluster itself {{is a part of the}} Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E

5000|$|The anticenter shell or anticenter superbubble is {{a region}} near the anticenter of the Milky Way <b>Galaxy</b> <b>that</b> emits 21 cm radiation. It {{is located at}} [...] , or l = 197°, b = +2° in galactic coordinates, near {{the border of the}} constellations Gemini and Orion. It is a supershell (a very large superbubble) within our <b>galaxy</b> <b>that</b> is spherical in shape and {{features}} jets of gas.|$|R
25|$|A {{lenticular}} {{galaxy is}} a type of galaxy intermediate between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies (like spiral <b>galaxies)</b> <b>that</b> have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Because of their ill-defined spiral arms, if they are inclined face-on {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish between them and elliptical galaxies. Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the Universe.|$|E
25|$|In the few radio-loud Seyfert <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> {{have been}} observed, the radio {{emission}} {{is believed to}} represent synchrotron emission from the jet. The infrared emission is due to radiation in other bands being reprocessed by dust near the nucleus. The highest energy photons {{are believed to be}} created by inverse Compton scattering by a high temperature corona near the black hole.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, {{soon after}} its discovery, Hyron Spinrad {{estimated}} {{the distance to}} Maffei 1 at about 1Mpc, which would place it within the Local Group of galaxies. In 1983 this estimate was revised up to 2.1Mpc by Ronald Buta and Marshall McCall using the general relation between the luminosity and velocity dispersion for elliptical <b>galaxies.</b> <b>That</b> distance puts Maffei 1 well outside the Local Group, but close enough to have influenced it in the past.|$|E

25|$|Discovery of the M–σ {{relation}} {{was taken}} by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies. Prior to about 2000, the main concern had been the simple detection of black holes, while afterward the interest changed to understanding the role of supermassive black holes as {{a critical component of}} galaxies. This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other galaxies located in Hydra. NGC 3314, usually {{delineated}} as NGC 3314a and NGC 3314b, {{is a pair of}} <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> appear superimposed, {{despite the fact that they}} are not related or interacting in any way. The foreground galaxy, NGC 3314a, is at a distance of 140 million light-years, and is a face-on spiral galaxy. The background galaxy, NGC 3314b, is an oblique spiral galaxy, and has a nucleus that appears reddened because of NGC 3314a's dusty disk. ESO 510-G13 is a warped spiral galaxy located 150 million light-years from Earth. Though most galactic disks are flat because of their rate of rotation, their conformation can be changed, as is the case with this galaxy. Astronomers speculate that this is due to interactions with other galaxies. NGC 5068 may be a member of the M83 group, but its identity is disputed. It has a low surface brightness and has a diameter of 4.5 arcminutes. It is not perfectly circular, rather, it is elliptical and oriented on a west-northwest/east-southeast axis. However, it is of fairly uniform brightness throughout.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Seyfert progression from Typenbsp&I to Typenbsp&II (including Typenbsp&1.2 to Typenbsp&1.9), there are other types of <b>galaxies</b> <b>that</b> {{are very similar to}} Seyferts or that can be considered as subclasses of them. Very similar to Seyferts are the low-ionisation narrow-line emission radio galaxies (LINER), discovered in 1980. These galaxies have strong emission lines from weakly ionised or neutral atoms, while the emission lines from strongly ionised atoms are relatively weak by comparison. LINERs share a large amount of traits with low luminosity Seyferts. In fact, when seen in visible light, the global characteristics of their host galaxies are indistinguishable. Also, they both show a broad line emission region, but the line emitting region in LINERs has a lower density than in Seyferts. An example of such a galaxy is M104 in the Virgo constellation, also known as the Sombrero galaxy. A galaxy that is both a LINER and a Type I Seyfert is NGC 7213, a galaxy that is relatively close compared to other AGNs. Another very interesting subclass are the narrow line Seyfertnbsp&I galaxies (NLSy1), which have been subject to extensive research in recent years. They have much narrower lines than the broad lines from classic Seyfertnbsp&I galaxies, steep hard and soft X-ray spectra and strong Fe emission. Their properties suggest that NLSy1 galaxies are young AGNs with high accretion rates, suggesting a relatively small but growing central black hole mass. There are theories suggesting that NLSy1s are galaxies in an early stage of evolution, and links between them and ultraluminous infrared galaxies or Seyfertnbsp&II galaxies have been proposed.|$|E
