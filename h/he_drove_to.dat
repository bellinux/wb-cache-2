5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the monument's base. U.S. Park Police shot and killed Mayer. The monument was undamaged in the incident, and it was discovered later that Mayer did not have explosives. After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at Paddington <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> straight <b>to</b> Valleys House.|$|R
60|$|Thus, {{laden with}} treasure, after {{three and a}} half blocks of romantic adventure, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the club.|$|R
60|$|Her {{confidence}} was justified, {{for on the}} following day <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> over <b>to</b> the police post and found Curtis alone.|$|R
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky {{played a}} much-anticipated game versus Kansas on December 16, 1950, with Spivey matched up against Jayhawks center Clyde Lovellette. The Wildcats won by 29 points as Spivey outplayed Lovellette, {{in what he}} later called the best {{performance}} of his college career. After one steal, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Kansas basket and did a slam dunk; this was rare for Kentucky basketball at the time, as Rupp instructed players not to dunk during games. Spivey set another school record in a February 13, 1951, game, gathering 31rebounds. As of 2010, he remains tied for the team record with Bob Burrow, who had {{the same number of}} rebounds in a 1955 game. For the season, Spivey again averaged more than 19points per game, and he added 17.2rebounds per game. His point total led the SEC, and his 479regular season points were the third-most in league history at the time.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1993, Jordan {{announced}} his retirement, citing {{a loss of}} desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that {{the death of his}} father three months earlier also shaped his decision. Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked the luxury vehicle. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone. The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the basket. In 1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.|$|E
60|$|That answer enraged her, and she despised him. She did not {{actively}} question the Bible herself. But <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> her <b>to</b> contempt.|$|R
60|$|FALDER. [To WALTER, appealing] He {{must have}} given her full cause since; she could prove that <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> her <b>to</b> leave him.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>drove</b> them <b>to</b> the Kansas State 4, where Hawkins re-entered {{and handed}} off to Stewart, who {{ran into the}} end zone to give Colorado a 7-6 lead.|$|R
5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his {{engine control unit}} and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} a problem with his car. Bräck remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between Bräck and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. Bräck maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass Bräck around the outside for the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre because of the presence of slower cars.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{began when}} Rodger stabbed three men {{to death in}} his apartment. Afterwards, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a {{sorority}} house and shot three female students outside, killing two. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a nearby deli and shot to death a male student who was inside. He began to speed through Isla Vista, shooting and wounding several pedestrians and striking several others with his car. Rodger exchanged gunfire with police twice during the attack, receiving a non-fatal gunshot to the hip. The rampage ended when his car crashed into a parked vehicle {{and came to a}} stop. Police found him dead in the car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.|$|E
25|$|Matsuzaka became {{involved}} in a scandal when he began dating Shibata. On September 13, 2000, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> her apartment without a valid license. He illegally parked his car and it got towed, and then had a team official take the blame to avoid a scandal. The truth soon got out and he was fined 195,000 yen {{by the police and}} put under house arrest for one month by the Lions.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> off <b>to</b> {{the station}} his aunt was {{arranging}} that Gabriel-Ernest should help her {{to entertain the}} infant members of her Sunday-school class at tea that afternoon.|$|R
50|$|Palmer’s {{work with}} McLaren {{included}} {{development of the}} McLaren F1 road car, and <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> one <b>to</b> a record-breaking 231 mph at the Nardo test track. In addition, he helped develop the Caterham 7 JPE.|$|R
6000|$|... "Scour the country!" [...] {{said the}} father. [...] "All {{the country will}} turn out to defend the murderer of my boy." [...] But <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the front, and Peter knocked at the door.|$|R
25|$|In an interview, Muhammad {{said his}} jihad started in Little Rock. He then drove to Nashville {{and threw a}} Molotov {{cocktail}} at an orthodox rabbi's house, but the device failed to detonate. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> an Army recruiting center in Florence, Kentucky, because {{it was close to}} the highway and near the Ohio border. But the center was closed. He then returned to Little Rock, where he shot the soldiers at the recruiting station.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Cranstone's {{engineering}} company {{was founded in}} 1798, and was responsible {{for much of the}} early street lighting in the town as well as it first gasworks. It became the Hemel Hempstead Engineering Company and stayed in business until the Second World War. In 1867 Cranstone's son built a steam powered coach which <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> London, but which was destroyed in a crash on the return journey. A local Boxmoor pub commemorates the event.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and no one knew where he was. He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Apparently, he had become so depressed that <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> over <b>to</b> Elmwood and was {{fortunate}} to find Mr. Hopkins in his [...] "office" [...] at home where he was busily engaged instructing his [...] "workers" [...] in their duties at the polls.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> over <b>to</b> Scarcombe, {{and to his}} pleasure, on {{entering}} the cottage, found John and his wife both sitting just where he had last seen them. They both rose to greet him.|$|R
60|$|An {{hour later}} McNutt {{was on his}} mission, the three copies, which had been {{carefully}} dusted, reclining on the buggy seat beside him. Arrived at the Wegg farm, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the stile and alighted.|$|R
25|$|When his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1938, Strauss used his {{connections}} in Berlin, including opera-house General Intendant Heinz Tietjen, to secure her safety. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Theresienstadt concentration camp in order to argue, albeit unsuccessfully, {{for the release of}} his son Franz's Jewish mother-in-law, Marie von Grab. Strauss also wrote several letters to the SS pleading for the release of her children who were also held in camps; his letters were ignored.|$|E
25|$|John {{ran from}} the car and summoned help from his older sister, Rose. He then went to a friend's house and on {{returning}} they found Syriani still at the car and still stabbing Teresa. She was still alive, and Syriani stopped his attack, got into his van and left. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a nearby fire station to receive medical attention for cuts and scratches. A fireman testified that Syriani told him that Teresa had assaulted him. The police arrived shortly afterwards and arrested him.|$|E
25|$|Sykes had a {{difficult}} start to his next posting, in the Middle East. He was almost {{killed in a car}} accident on a steep road to the Horns of Hattin in Palestine. His car was fired on by a French warship as <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Sidon; he noticed tiny flashes blinking on the side of the ship, shortly followed by explosions on the road in front of him. He was violently sick on an aerial reconnaissance flight, and he became ill with malaria, ending up in hospital in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|He {{would say}} it was his dream in life to own a pig farm so he could feed his victims to the pigs. <b>He</b> even <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> pig farms just to watch them for hours.|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} the day of Pa's good angel. When <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the door where Ma was waiting, a breathless, hatless imp of ten flew into the yard, and hurled himself between Ma and the wagon-step.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "that man! If {{she could}} only get rid of him! That {{ought to have been}} done long ago, before <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> her <b>to</b> drink like this. Why didn't she, Mrs. Shortman, why didn't she?" ...|$|R
25|$|In late 1960, {{he moved}} to Howard Johansen's team. He raced the Howard Cam Twin Bears gas dragster, which {{featured}} two side-mounted engines. In 1961, he used the car for the first 8-second run in NHRA national event history, when his 8.99 second pass beat Dick Rea in the Top Eliminator (Top Gas) final at the first Winternationals. That summer <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a 8.78 e.t. at Caddo Mills, Texas, which was the lowest e.t. of the year. Chrisman won the 1961 World Championship after winning in national, regional, and divisional meets throughout the United States.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Zehaf-Bibeau {{returned}} to his vehicle, a small grey Toyota car, which was parked {{on the south side}} of Wellington Street behind the memorial, and drove west along Wellington a short distance to Parliament Hill, where he abandoned his vehicle. Past scattering bystanders, he ran through a gate in the fence surrounding the Parliament Hill precinct and carjacked a parliamentary vehicle assigned to ministers of the Crown, which <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Centre Block parliament building. RCMP officers on patrol in the precinct witnessed the carjacking and pursued the vehicle to the base of the Peace Tower.|$|E
25|$|After 1937 the Lord Mayor and {{the state}} commissioners of Hanover {{were members of the}} NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish {{population}} then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and {{lay down}} at {{the back end of}} the waggon, and Tony covered her over, so that the waggon seemed to be empty but for the loose tarpaulin; and then <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> on <b>to</b> meet Milly.|$|R
60|$|As if {{in answer}} <b>to</b> the question, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> {{directly}} <b>to</b> the harness shop {{instead of to}} the tannery house. Ephraim greeted them from within with a cheery hail, and hobbled out and stood between {{the wheels of the}} buggy.|$|R
60|$|From {{the main}} road <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> {{the right of the}} house, where, under a dip of wooded slope, {{clustered}} barns, sheds, corrals, granaries, engine and machinery houses, a store, and the homes of hired men--a little village in itself.|$|R
