5|$|A Starfleet Admiral {{and former}} {{commanding}} officer of the Enterprise. Kirk and Khan never confront each other face-to-face during the film. All of their <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> over a viewscreen or through communicators and their scenes were filmed four months apart, although a draft script had Khan defeating Kirk in a swordfight. Meyer described Shatner as an actor who was naturally protective of his character and himself, and who performed better over multiple takes.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> regulated.|$|E
50|$|Developmental gene-environment <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> {{a concept}} more {{commonly}} used by developmental geneticists and developmental psychobiologists. Developmental <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> present or not, developmental <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.|$|R
30|$|The {{confidence}} value (CV) for experimental {{support of a}} predicted <b>interaction</b> <b>was</b> calculated using the following formula, CV[*]=[*]N x E x S; where N is {{the total number of}} data sets in which the <b>interaction</b> <b>was</b> recorded, E is the number of different experimental methods from which an <b>interaction</b> <b>was</b> inferred, and S is the number of reference species from which the same <b>interaction</b> <b>was</b> recorded. The higher the CV, the more likely an <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> to be conserved in multiple species and to be more convincing as it is supported by different experimental methods. The <b>interactions</b> <b>were</b> classified according to their CV to three groups: low confidence (CV[*]=[*] 1), medium confidence (CV[*]=[*] 2 to 10) and high confidence (CV[*]>[*] 10).|$|R
5000|$|When {{comparing}} relative stability, 6- and 7-atom <b>interactions</b> can <b>be</b> used {{to approximate}} differences in enthalpy between conformations. Each 6-atom <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> worth 0.9 kcal/mol and each 7-atom <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> worth 4 kcal/mol.|$|R
5|$|Note: While {{the general}} plot of Invisible War follows a {{distinct}} path, many {{elements such as}} faction alliances and character <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> subject to the player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots and explanations which the player {{may or may not}} encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, unavoidable plot thread of the game.|$|E
5|$|Products of volcano-ice {{interactions}} {{stand as}} various structures, whose shape {{is dependent on}} complex eruptive and environmental interactions. Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are imbedded in ice, as ice retracts worldwide there are concerns that tuyas and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass landslides. Evidence of volcanic-glacial <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> evident in Iceland and parts of British Columbia, and it is even possible that they {{play a role in}} deglaciation.|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> rare. As time passes, mergers of {{two systems}} of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged {{for the last}} few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion years ago.|$|E

50|$|While <b>interaction</b> {{techniques}} <b>are</b> typically technology-, platform-, and/or implementation-dependent (see #level of granularity above), human-computer or human-information <b>interactions</b> can <b>be</b> characterized {{at higher}} levels of abstraction that are independent of particular technologies and platforms. At such levels of abstraction, the concern is not precisely how an <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> performed; rather, the concern is a conceptual characterization of what the <b>interaction</b> <b>is,</b> and what the general utility of the <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> for the user(s). Thus, any single <b>interaction</b> pattern may <b>be</b> instantiated by any number of interaction techniques, on any number of different technologies and platforms. <b>Interaction</b> patterns <b>are</b> {{more concerned with the}} timeless, invariant qualities of an interaction.|$|R
50|$|The {{electron}} Zeeman interaction {{describes the}} interaction between an electron spin and the applied magnetic field. The nuclear Zeeman <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> the <b>interaction</b> of the magnetic moment of the proton with an applied magnetic field. The hyperfine <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> the coupling between the electron spin and the proton's nuclear spin. The nuclear quadrupole <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> present only in nuclei with I>1/2.|$|R
5|$|At {{the extreme}} of <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} {{relative}} momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the level of uncertainty {{and the level of}} <b>interaction</b> has not <b>been</b> well studied in the literature for static team optimization problems. In this proposal, the effects of uncertainty on <b>interaction</b> <b>are</b> investigated in the framework of team optimization. First, the literature related to team optimization and <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> reviewed. Second, the concepts of the level of uncertainty and the level of <b>interaction</b> <b>are</b> formalized when there is a single decision maker making decisions in an uncertain environment and, for the single decision maker case, the relation between the level of uncertainty and the level of <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> derived. An example from internet routing is given to illustrate the results. Third, the concepts of the level of uncertainty and the level of <b>interaction</b> <b>are</b> formalized for the case of multiple decision makers with simple interactions and imperfect information and, for the multiple decision maker case, the {{relationship between}} the level of uncertainty and the level of <b>interaction</b> <b>is</b> derived.

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E
5|$|Other than humans, tigers {{appear to}} be the only serious predators of wolves. Wolf and tiger <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> well {{documented}} in Sikhote-Alin, where tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks {{appear to be}} competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} {{imbalance}} of brain metal homeostasis {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E

5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles {{close to the}} speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main <b>interactions</b> <b>are</b> known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.|$|E
