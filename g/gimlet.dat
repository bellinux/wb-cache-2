25|$|Despite {{the seeming}} success, however, the <b>Gimlet</b> was already {{becoming}} obsolete; guided missiles were now {{considered to be}} the wave of the future. Production of <b>Gimlet</b> was cancelled in early 1957, after production of 15,000 rockets; that October, the T-Gimlet version was cancelled as well. Although the missile age meant that <b>Gimlet</b> did not enter operational service, the production processes developed for the rocket would be modified and used in the production of the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Gimlet</b> was an unguided air-to-air and air-to-surface rocket {{developed}} by the United States Navy during the early 1950s. Although it proved successful in testing and was ordered into large-scale production, {{the arrival of the}} guided missile as a practical and reliable weapon resulted in the cancellation of the <b>Gimlet</b> rocket in 1957.|$|E
25|$|The {{tip of the}} <b>gimlet</b> bit acts as a tapered screw, to {{draw the}} bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without {{necessarily}} cutting them. The cutting action occurs {{at the side of}} the broadest part of the cutter. Most drill bits cut the base of the hole. The <b>gimlet</b> bit cuts the side of the hole.|$|E

25|$|<b>Gimlet</b> was {{primarily}} {{intended for use}} in the air-to-air role. The rocket would use {{a modified version of the}} FFAR's fuse, reduced in size to fit the smaller rocket; the warhead used for <b>Gimlet</b> took advantage of the latest advancements in explosives technology, and, combined with the advanced fuse, would detonate inside the target aircraft, instead of upon contact. The rocket used a thin-walled aluminum body, also based on FFAR work; the motor used an eight-point star configuration to ensure even burning.|$|E

25|$|Testing of the <b>Gimlet</b> {{began in}} 1954. In the initial test, a FJ-2 Fury shot down a F6F Hellcat target drone, proving the rocket's {{effectiveness}} in the air-to-air role. Early launchers carried four rockets, while seven- and 19-round models were developed as well. A six-round clip capable of fitting the internal rocket bays of the F4D Skyray interceptor was also developed.|$|E

500|$|William Earl Johns (professionally {{known as}} W. E. Johns; 1893–1968) was an English writer and journalist. He wrote over 150 books and was, after Enid Blyton, [...] "the most {{prolific}} and popular children's writer of his time". Most of Johns's work—102 books—consists {{of the stories}} of Biggles, a First World War pilot and, later, adventurer, detective and Second World War squadron leader. He also wrote science fiction stories, and two further series of war stories, featuring the characters Worrals of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and <b>Gimlet,</b> a British Commando.|$|E
500|$|When {{they arrived}} at Trujillo, however, they heard gunfire, and came upon a battle in {{progress}} that had been waged for 55 hours between rebels called Bonillista and Honduran government soldiers at a local fort. At {{the sight of the}} Marines, the fighting ceased and Butler led a detachment of Marines to the American consulate, where he found the consul, wrapped in an American flag, hiding among the floor beams. As soon as the Marines left the area with the shaken consul, the battle resumed and the Bonillistas soon controlled the government. During this expedition Butler earned the first of his nicknames, [...] "Old <b>Gimlet</b> Eye". It was attributed to his feverish, bloodshot eyes—he was suffering from some unnamed tropic fever at the time—which enhanced his penetrating and bellicose stare.|$|E
500|$|Fashion Nugget, Cake's second album, was {{released}} on September17,1996. Like Motorcade, it was produced by the band and released on Capricorn Records. Cake considered the album more professionally produced than Motorcade, despite references to its [...] "raw" [...] sound, and the reception was again generally positive; critics noted the broadening of Cake's sound, with Joshua Green noting in the Westword that [...] "Nugget spans {{a broader range of}} topics than did Motorcade, with similarly appealing results", and Matt Weitz in the Dallas Observer saying that [...] "The <b>gimlet</b> eye and sardonic humor of 1994's Motorcade of Generosity is intact, but Fashion Nugget is aptly named; it updates Motorcade with beatboxy soul and hip-hop rhythms". The album's first single, [...] "The Distance", written by Greg Brown, became the band's biggest hit to date and is considered their [...] "ubiquitous" [...] song; it hit number 5 on the RPM Alternative 30, and entered the Modern Rock Tracks top5.|$|E

[...] They soon found themselves booked after school and on weekends throughout Kansas and neighboring Missouri, where they played their original compositions, which were a blend of pop, English and psychedelic rock. After graduating from Topeka West High School in 1967, Livgren continued to perform with the <b>Gimlets</b> through college before joining a predominantly black mainstream rhythm and blues band named the Mellotones, in which he met keyboard player Don Montre in 1969.|$|R
500|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that Schwimmer has been cast as the lead in the ABC comedy pilot Irreversible. He would play [...] "one half of a somewhat eccentric, self-absorbed couple" [...] in his first comedic television role since Friends finished in 2004. In 2016, Schwimmer played Robert Kardashian in the first season of the FX anthology series American Crime Story. The series was developed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and was based on the novel, The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson by Jeffrey Toobin. In January 2016, it {{was announced}} that Schwimmer and Jim Sturgess would be starring in the new AMC crime drama, Feed the Beast. The series premiered on June 5, 2016, and aired ten episodes until August. The series was canceled because of poor reviews and low ratings.

500|$|On {{leaving the}} RAF {{he became a}} {{journalist}} and illustrator. In 1932 he founded Popular Flying magazine and became its first editor. He used the magazine to publish his Biggles short stories. Johns described Biggles as [...] "typical {{of the type of}} British airman I knew during the Great War. His chief characteristics are courage, loyalty and sportsmanship." [...] He continued to publish his stories in periodicals and newspapers throughout his career. Six months after the first Biggles stories were published they were collected in book form in The Camels are Coming. [...] During the Second World War, Johns worked for the Air Ministry; the ministry asked him to create a female character to boost recruitment into the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, which resulted in the publication of the Worrals stories and books. The character was successful and the War Office requested Johns introduce a soldier, which led to the introduction of <b>Gimlet.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Following a flyoff {{against the}} T-214 rocket, which {{indicated}} {{the necessity to}} modify the rocket motor to reduce the Gimlet's visual signature, the Navy directed {{the development of a}} modified, 'hybrid' rocket, using the T-214's tail; this became known as [...] "T-Gimlet". The modified rocket was considered to be suitable for the Navy's purposes; both the original <b>Gimlet</b> and the T-Gimlet were ordered for production, a 5 million dollar USD contract being allotted to start production at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot in Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the <b>Gimlet</b> rocket began in 1951, with the initiation of {{development of}} a [...] rocket for air-to-air use. Work on the rocket was conducted at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at China Lake, California, and the project was begun {{at the behest of}} North American Aviation. in addition, the 1.5-inch rocket was felt as the ideal caliber to 'fill in a gap' in the U.S. Navy's rocket inventory; studies indicated that aircraft could carry six times the number of 1.5-inch rockets as opposed to the then-in-service [...] Folding Fin Aerial Rocket.|$|E
