5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> gone as Morisi described.|$|E

25|$|De Landa {{provides}} the most comprehensive account of calendar festivals and rituals (chapters 34-40), but in none of these regular events is human sacrifice mentioned, which must mean his Maya informants were unaware of any instances since the cleric would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> suppressed such information.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed, the Lixos {{can be identified}} as the Draa (28°45’N). The Draa is the largest river in the area, and marks the southernmost limit of cultivable land. This well corresponds to Hanno's account. Certainly the area of Herne was known to the Carthaginians because they would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> sent a colony to an unknown place.|$|E

25|$|That {{same year}} BBC TV started its Pot Black series. A single-frame format could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been more {{removed from the}} epic finals of the 1940s, and Davis was quick to admit he was a slow starter in matches. Nevertheless, he would be runner-up in the 1971 series (to John Spencer) and {{achieved}} the highest break in the 1970, 1971 and 1975 series.|$|E
25|$|In the {{big picture}} the fight would not mean much - Denmark had already lost the war, and a {{possible}} victory would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> altered this. Generally {{it is said that}} an attacker at the start should have a strength superiority on a factor of three; Here were the Danes not even twice so many as the defending. But yet different causes come from analysing supplementary causes of the Danish defeat.|$|E
25|$|His lack of {{consistency}} {{meant that he}} did not play in the triangular tournament in Australia, which also included West Indies, until the final match. He could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored over 300 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 in the final over, bowled by Glenn McGrath, to win the match.|$|E

25|$|Chelmsford {{realised}} that {{he would}} need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as {{it was meant to be}} temporary.|$|E
25|$|It is unclear, though, how John {{might have}} {{had access to the}} works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only {{translated}} into Latin {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century. This means that copies would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.|$|E
25|$|Among {{his other}} rewards for loyalty, Censorinus {{was allowed to}} buy Cicero's house on the Palatine, which the orator had exerted such strenuous efforts to restore after its {{confiscation}} in connection to his exile. Its value was reckoned at 3,500,000 sesterces. Although the Palatine house, along with Cicero's other confiscated property following his death, was sold ostensibly at public auction, the symbolism of its possession can <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been left to chance. The house next passed to T. Statilius Taurus, whom Cicero notoriously associated with Calvisius.|$|E

25|$|The accompaniments...are {{delightful}} to hear, {{and especially}} does {{the treatment of}} the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in The Yeomen of the Guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage. (Allen, p. 312).|$|E
25|$|The {{contrast}} between Mao's top field commanders could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been more sharp, {{but on the}} Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again and again he wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} events which {{led up to}} the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been attained but for the tact and patience of the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Storting and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. He declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better {{relations between the two countries}} were restored before his death. Oscar II died in Stockholm on 8 December 1907 at 9:10 am.|$|E

25|$|Brunelleschi's {{first major}} {{architectural}} commission {{was for the}} enormous brick dome which covers the central space of Florence's cathedral, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design utilizes the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, {{in keeping with the}} building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the Pantheon, a circular temple, now a church.|$|E
25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, {{the text}} of the codex is a {{somewhat}} dilute form of family Π, with a large number of peculiar readings, most of which are either misspellings or careless and ignorant mistakes. An educated scribe could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> produced the variants in Mark 4:1; 6:26; 9:4; 13:3; 14:38; 16:4. The readings which it does not share with other representatives of Family Π are supported outside that family and they seem to be connected with the late Alexandrian group (C, L, M, N, Δ), but the number of the Alexandrian readings is not high and according to Silva they are rather result of accident than influence of a foreign text-type.|$|E
25|$|Gerda, posing under several aliases {{including}} that of Mrs Albert Chapman, invited Sainsbury Seale to visit her, killed her, and took her identity; {{but she had to}} buy new shoes because those of Sainsbury Seale did not fit her. This is why the buckles on the shoes found on the corpse were dull, whereas the buckle of the woman whom Poirot met going into Morley's surgery was shiny: the fake Mabelle had newer shoes. The woman in the trunk could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> worn through a new pair of shoes in a single day. Ironically, the face of the corpse had been disfigured not because it wasn't Mabelle Sainsbury Seale, but because it was.|$|E
