5|$|A Kingdom Hearts {{game was}} {{developed}} exclusively for V CAST, Verizon Wireless's broadband service, {{and was released}} on October 1, 2004 in Japan and on February 4, 2005 in the United States. It {{was one of the}} launch games for the V CAST services. The game, developed by Superscape and published by Disney Mobile with no involvement from Square Enix, features gameplay akin to the first Kingdom Hearts game, modified for the <b>input</b> <b>method</b> of mobile phones. The game's storyline features Sora struggling to free himself from a nightmare induced by Maleficent's magic.|$|E
5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust a Groove features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional <b>input</b> <b>method.</b> The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.|$|E

5000|$|... ibus-m17n is an IME {{that uses}} <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> and {{corresponding}} icons in the m17n database. Unlike ibus-table which supports plain tables, m17n <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> also support states, whose labels are {{displayed on the}} IBus panel (language bar). M17n <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> also support surrounding text, consequently, languages such as Thai and IMs such as plain Zhuyin that require this feature are supported through ibus-m17n.|$|R
25|$|Most modern <b>input</b> <b>method</b> {{implementations}} would {{adjust the}} positions of word candidates in the candidate list based on prior usage statistics. In addition, the <b>input</b> <b>method</b> would also support user-defined phrases via a user dictionary.|$|E
25|$|Although {{thorough}} {{training and}} practice {{are required to}} use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the <b>input</b> <b>method.</b> This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this <b>Input</b> <b>Method.</b> The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows. On Mac OS X, handwriting recognition <b>input</b> <b>method</b> is bundled with the OS.|$|E

25|$|Pinyin <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> {{differ in}} a number of {{possible}} aspects. Most pinyin <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> provide convenience features to speed up input. Some of these features can speed up typing immensely.|$|R
25|$|The obvious {{advantage}} of pinyin-based <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> is {{the ease of}} learning for Standard Chinese speakers. Those {{who are familiar with}} pinyin would be able to input Chinese characters with almost no training, compared to other <b>input</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... ibus-table, {{developed}} by Yu Wei Yu, is an IME that loads tables of <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> {{which do not}} need complicated logic to select words. Many structure-based Chinese <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> such as Cangjie and Wubi are supported this way.|$|R

25|$|Chinese {{keyboards}} {{are usually}} in US layout with/without Chinese <b>input</b> <b>method</b> labels printed on keys. Without an <b>input</b> <b>method</b> handler activated, these keyboards would simply respond to Latin characters as physically labelled, {{provided that the}} US keyboard layout is selected correctly in the operating system. Most modern input methods allow input of both simplified and traditional characters, and will simply default to {{one or the other}} based on the locale setting.|$|E

50|$|With the {{influence}} of Chinese <b>input</b> <b>methods</b> built-in whole sentence input pattern, the focus of Menksoft Mongolian IME is not placed on a Mongolian keyboard layout, but on phoneme pattern <b>input</b> <b>methods,</b> as they are more commonly used for Chinese language text.|$|R
50|$|The Menksoft IMEs provide {{alternative}} <b>input</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some input methods are, in fact, {{related to}} the {{structure}} of the character, as opposed to those based on pronunciation. Cangjie is one popular example of such a structure based <b>input</b> <b>method</b> for Chinese. Input methods based on phonetic transcription which do not require the user to know how to write the character by hand are the most popular, because they are easier to use. In China, more than 97 percent of computer users enter Chinese characters using such a phonetic <b>input</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{basic idea}} of an <b>input</b> <b>method</b> {{is to have a}} buffer that holds the user input until it is {{converted}} into characters that would otherwise be unavailable from the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|For {{people who}} do not speak Chinese, the main {{advantage}} of pinyin becomes its disadvantage. They will need to learn the Standard Chinese pronunciation of characters before they are able to use this <b>input</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

25|$|Windows 10 {{includes}} its own {{implementation of}} a mnemonic QWERTY-based <b>input</b> <b>method</b> for Russian, which does not fully rely on assigning a key to every Russian letter, but uses the sh, sc, ch, ya (ja), yu (ju), ye (je), yo (jo) combinations to input ш, щ, ч, я, ю, э and ё respectively.|$|E
25|$|Vowel {{groups in}} pinyin can {{be up to}} four letters long. Double pinyin (双拼) is a method whereby longer vowel groups are {{assigned}} to consonant keys as shortcuts, and zh, ch, sh are assigned to vowel keys as shortcuts. Thus, when the <b>input</b> <b>method</b> expects a vowel, the user can use the shortcuts to speed up typing.|$|E

25|$|Chinese, Japanese and Korean {{require special}} input methods, often {{abbreviated}} to CJK IMEs (<b>Input</b> <b>Method</b> Editors), {{due to the}} thousands of possible characters in these languages. Various methods have been invented to fit every possibility into a QWERTY keyboard, so East Asian keyboards are essentially the same as those in other countries. However, their input methods are considerably more complex, without one-to-one mappings between keys and characters.|$|E
