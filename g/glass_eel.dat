50|$|The European eel has {{a number}} of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the leptocephalus stage, then a quick {{metamorphosis}} to <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> {{at the edge of the}} continental shelf (eight days for the Japanese eel), two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> undergoes a quick metamorphosis into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult freshwater stage, the eel also has phenotypic plasticity because fish-eating eels develop very wide mandibles, making the head look blunt. Leptocephali are common, occurring in all Elopomorpha (tarpon- and eel-like fish).|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Glass eel:As {{they enter}} the {{continental}} shelf, leptocephali metamorphose into glass eels (juveniles), which are transparent and possess the typical elongate and serpentine eel shape. The term <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> refers to all developmental stages {{between the end of}} metamorphosis and full pigmentation. Metamorphosis occurs when leptocephali are about 55 to 65 mm long. Mean age at this metamorphosis has been evaluated at 200 days and estuarine arrival at 255 days; giving 55 days between <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> metamorphosis and estuarine arrival. Young eels use selective tidal stream transport to move up estuaries. As they enter coastal waters, the animals essentially transform from a pelagic oceanic organism to a benthic continental organism.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether thyroidal status {{is related to}} migratory and settling behavior in Anguilla anguilla <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> we sampled <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> showing different migratory behaviors in the Arzal dam, which constitutes the tidal limit of the Vilaine River (France). We collected 4 groups of glass eels: flood and ebb tide <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> were netted in the estuary during the flood and ebb tides, respectively, trap <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> were sampled from the eel ladder trap, and bottom <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> sheltering {{on the bottom of}} the estuary during flood tide. We measured individual whole-body triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) levels for these groups, and calculated total thyroid hormone (TH) levels as T 3 + T 4 contents reflecting the thyroid gland secretory activity, and T 3 :T 4 ratios reflecting T 4 outer-ring desiodase (T 4 ORD) activity. Trap <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> had the highest TH levels, indicating an activation of the thyroid gland via the thyreotrop axis. This could be responsible for the behavioral transition (loss of circatidal rhythm and switch to counter-current swimming) at the tidal limit and active colonization of river habitats by <b>glass</b> <b>eels.</b> Ebb and flood tide <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> had similar TH levels that were lower than those of trap <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> indicating a lower thyroid gland secretory activity in the former. Ebb tide <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> had higher T 3 :T 4 ratios than flood tide and trap <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> indicating physiological stress related to inefficient use of tidal streams. Bottom <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> had the lowest TH levels, and high T 3 :T 4 ratios similar to those of ebb tide glass eels; this suggests that physiological stress induced by frequent counter-current swimming leads to precocious settlement of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> in estuarine habitats. Our data supports the critical role of the thyroid status in the migratory and settling behavior of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> in estuarine and marine habitats...|$|R
30|$|The {{temporal}} {{patterns of}} <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> catches {{near the mouth}} of the Poigar River differed among species and years suggesting that there was considerable inter-annual variation in the recruitment patterns of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> in the region. However, such systematic surveys for tropical <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> have never been conducted in other tropical regions. Further long-term surveys should be urgently needed to understand natural (e.g. ambient environments such as global climate change and oceanic transportation systems) and anthropogenic impacts (e.g. overexploitation, habitat degradation and pollution) on the recruitment of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> in tropical regions.|$|R
50|$|There are two gastronomical {{products}} that have given fame to Usurbil: <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> and cider. <b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> {{used to be}} common in most Basque rivers and in the Oria used to come upstream as far as Aginaga, whose inhabitants became expert angula fishers. Angulas de Aguinaga, made with oil and capsicum are famous throughout Spain. <b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> have become rare {{as a result of}} pollution and have pushed up the price considerably.|$|R
50|$|In New Jersey, {{an ongoing}} project {{monitors}} the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> migration with an online in situ microscope. As soon as more funding becomes available, {{it will be}} possible to log into the system via a Longterm Ecological Observatory (LEO) site.|$|E
50|$|No one yet {{knows the}} reasons, but {{beginning}} in the mid-1980s, <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> arrival in the spring dropped drastically — in Germany to 10% and in France to 14% of their previous levels — from even conservative estimates. Data from Maine and other North American coasts showed similar declines, although not as drastic.|$|E
50|$|American eels are {{economically}} {{important in}} various areas along the East Coast as bait for fishing for sport fishes {{such as the}} striped bass, or as a food fish in some areas.

40|$|European eels Anguilla {{anguilla}} stocked as wild-sourced <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> {{showed a}} better overall performance {{of growth and}} survival compared with farm-sourced eels after stocking in five isolated lakes within a 7 -year study period. Eels stocked as farm eels lost their initial size advantage over <b>eels</b> stocked as <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> within 3 – 5 years after stocking. Population sizes estimated for consecutive stocking batches indicated that 8 – 17 % of eels stocked as farm eels survived 3 – 6 years after stocking compared with 5 – 45 % of <b>eels</b> stocked as <b>glass</b> <b>eels.</b> This study coupled with results of previous studies suggests that stocking of farm eels may have no advantage in growth and survival compared with stocking of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> if stocking occurs at an optimal time in spring. In addition, the use of relatively expensive farm eels may provide no general advantage over stocking of <b>glass</b> <b>eels.</b> However, if <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> are only available for stocking purposes {{very early in the}} year, lower survival rates than obtained in the present study can be assumed and stocking with relatively more expensive farm eels could possibly be a better option.

40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> (Anguilla anguilla, L. 1758) caught during ascent at {{the mouth}} of the River Tiber were kept in aquaria with {{freshwater}} and full strength salinity (35 parts per thousand) for four months. Morphological features of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> at capture and after four months of experimental rearing are described. The structure of the gut, an important osmoregulatory organ, observed in <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> in seawater experimental rearing suggests that they undergo an irreversible process of adaptation to freshwater, despite the fact of survival in seawater...|$|R
50|$|One {{well-known}} {{location in}} which the large-scale collection of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> takes place (for deli food and stocking) is Epney, on the Severn, in England. (<b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> are a food item in Spain.) Once they recruit to coastal areas, they migrate up rivers and streams, overcoming various natural challenges — sometimes by piling up their bodies {{by the tens of}} thousands to climb over obstacles — and they reach even the smallest of creeks. These freshwater eels spawn in the ocean, and then enter estuaries as <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> and swim upstream to live in fresh water during their juvenile growth phase. As the <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> enter fresh waters, they start to become pigmented and are typically referred to as elvers. The elvers grow larger and are referred to as yellow eels, which are the juvenile stage of eels before their reproductive maturation begins.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, European {{demand for}} eels {{could not be}} {{met for the first}} time ever, and dealers from Asia bought all they could. The {{traditional}} European stocking programs could not compete any longer: each week, the price for a kilogram of <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> went up another US$30. Even before the 1997 generation hit the coasts of Europe, dealers from China alone placed advance orders for more than 250,000 kg, some bidding more than $1,100 per kg. Asian elvers have sold in Hong Kong for as much as $5,000 to $6,000 a kilogram at times when $1,000 would buy the same amount of American glass eels at their catching sites. Such a kilogram, consisting of 5000 glass eels, may bring at least $60,000 and as much as $150,000 after they leave an Asian fish farm. In New Jersey, over 2000 licences for <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> catch were issued and reports of 38 kg per night and fisherman have been made, although the average catch is closer to 1 kg.|$|E
50|$|After {{hatching}} in the ocean, the leptocephali {{are carried}} westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia. In the open ocean, the larvae feed on marine snow, before they metamorphose into the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> stage. The glass eels then enter the estuaries and headwaters of rivers and many travel upstream. In fresh water and estuaries, the diet of yellow eels consists mainly of shrimp, other crustaceans, aquatic insects, and small fishes.|$|E
50|$|The Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts {{research}} into the ecology, conservation, and management of lotic and estuarine fishes. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> (the larvae of freshwater or American eels) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that's endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management (dam releases) in the Upper Delaware River to native and introduced fish populations.|$|E
40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> (Anguilla anguilla) {{arriving}} {{after the}} fishing {{season in the}} Vilaine estuary (France) were caught by boat and at a trapping ladder located at a blocking dam upstream in the estuary. They were marked with Bismarck brown, rhodamine B or neutral red, and released into the estuary. The effect of marking on behaviour, mortality and recapture differed according to the dye and concentration used. The <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> also differed in response to marking according to their origin. Estuarine <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> were clearly desynchronized in their selective tidal stream transport and left the release area after a few tidal cycles. Trapped <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> were less sensitive to marking. They remained in the release area and were recaptured in larger number both in the trapping ladder and in the estuary. These results supported a model of two behavioral fractions in the estuary: flow-carried migrants and active <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> with stronger rheotactic behaviour. The proportion of active <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> in the estuary shifted from none for the {{two weeks after the}} fishery closure, to 10 % value of the total stock. At the trapping ladder, the migration ended in June each year, while a large stock was still present in the estuary. These observations favour the interpretation of a short duration of the active phase at this site followed by the transition towards a more benthic behavior. The daily efficiency of the trapping ladder was calculated as 4 % of the active stock from both stock estimations and average recapture rate. This value was consistent with the low annual efficiency of the trapping ladder, calculated as 30 % of the estuarine stock of <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> that arrived after the fishing season...|$|R

5000|$|The larvae of European eels {{travel with}} the Gulf Stream across the Atlantic Ocean, and grow to 75-90 mm within {{one to three}} years, {{before they reach the}} coasts of Europe. Eels in this {{so-called}} [...] "recruitment" [...] developmental stage are known as glass eels because of the transparency of their bodies. Glass eels typically refers to an intermediary stage in the eel's complex life history between the leptocephalus stage and the juvenile (elver) stage. Glass eels are defined as [...] "all developmental stages from completion of leptocephalus metamorphosis until full pigmentation". The term typically refers to a transparent <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> of the family Anguillidae.|$|E
50|$|Leptocephali (singular leptocephalus) {{all have}} {{laterally}} compressed bodies that contain transparent jelly-like substances {{on the inside}} of the body and a thin layer of muscle with visible myomeres on the outside. Their body organs are small and they have only a simple tube for a gut. This combination of features results in them being very transparent when they are alive. Leptocephali have dorsal and anal fins confluent with caudal fins, but lack pelvic fins. They also lack red blood cells until they begin to metamorphose into the juvenile <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> stage when they start to look like eels. Leptocephali are also characterized by their fang-like teeth that are present until metamorphosis, when they are lost.|$|E
50|$|The leptocephalus {{stage of}} the larvae begins after the {{nutrients}} from the yolk have been absorbed and the eyes and teeth are formed. At this point, the larvae usually have long forward-facing pointy teeth. As the larvae grow larger, the teeth {{will be replaced by}} shorter teeth and will increase in number. The maximum size larvae reach varies from about 5-10 cm but can be as large as 30 cm or more depending on the species. After the leptocephali have reached their maximum size, they enter their <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> stage. Their laterally compressed bodies tend to become more rounded in this stage. The head also thickens, the olfactory organ enlarges, and their teeth are lost.|$|E
40|$|The eel is a {{catadromous}} {{fish that}} grows in rivers and spawns in the sea. Every year, between November {{and the end}} of March, when <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> migrate up river, illegal nets catch them in the Tagus River (downstream of the estuary, in Portugal). Every day, authorities organise policing actions to capture illegal nets placed in river specifically intended to capture <b>glass</b> <b>eels.</b> Usually, the seized nets are filled with <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> and other species, since the net is very narrow (1 - 2 mm); it therefore captures everything. The mortality rate caused by these is huge and affects the eel’s preservation and the river’s biodiversity...|$|R
30|$|The Japanese eel Anguilla japonica {{has been}} one of the most {{valuable}} fishery resources in East Asian countries. The aquaculture of these eels solely depends on the <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> harvested in estuaries because the artificial production techniques for anguillid eels have not yet been established at a commercial scale. The recruitment of the <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> of A. japonica, however, has been decreasing in the last few decades, particularly since 2009 (Aoyama et al. 2012). In addition to the overexploitation of the <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> ocean-atmospheric changes have been proposed as one of the major reasons for the recent decline of A. japonica (Kim et al. 2007; Miller et al. 2009; Zenimoto et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|Among the 767 specimens, 52 <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> {{collected}} in January {{were found to}} be A. japonica, while the remaining were tropical anguillid species.

5000|$|Larval eels — transparent, leaflike two-inch (five-cm) {{creatures of}} the open ocean — were not {{generally}} recognized as such until 1893; instead, they {{were thought to be}} a separate species, Leptocephalus brevirostris (from the Greek leptocephalus meaning [...] "thin- or flat-head"). In 1886, however, the French zoologist Yves Delage discovered the truth when he kept leptocephali alive in a laboratory tank in Roscoff until they matured into eels, and in 1896 Italian zoologist Giovanni Battista Grassi confirmed the finding when he observed the transformation of a Leptocephalus into a round <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> in the Mediterranean Sea. (He also observed that salt water was necessary to support the maturation process.) Although the connection between larval eels and adult eels is now well understood, the name leptocephalus is still used for larval eel.|$|E

The present study was undertaken to gain a preliminary understanding of basic husbandry requirements for rearing of juvenile A. australis (<b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> and elvers) in tanks and earthen ponds. Newly caught <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> were successfully acclimated to culture conditions. During tank culture trials, specific growth rates (SGR) and survival rates ranged from − 2. 1 to 2. 8 % day − 1 and 52 % to 100 % respectively. <b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> weaned onto a commercial eel diet exhibited a significantly greater SGR and survival rate than those weaned onto a commercial trout diet. <b>Glass</b> <b>eels</b> weaned onto an eel diet over a 15 -day period grew slightly faster than eels weaned over a 5 -day period, but survival rates were not significantly different for each treatment.

40|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> is {{fished in}} the Gironde Basin, France, with large push nets, scoop nets, and the {{recently}} introduced small push net. This study uses fishery data to generate fisheries and abundance indicators for glass eels.

Use of GLM enabled the correction of sampling variation and offered better trend estimation than classical CPUE. During the study period, the principal source of <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> landings shifted from the scoop net fishery in the tidal river to the large push net fishery in the estuary. General linear model-based CPUEs for large push nets and for scoop nets showed that <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> abundance declined {{by a factor of}} two to three {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 s.

40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>eel</b> catches and FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) {{landings}} of the European freshwater eel (Anguilla anguilla) show {{a decrease}} {{over the past}} 20 years. The long-term trends in the time series mask an interannual fluctuation, which becomes apparent on {{the application of a}} high-pass filter and autocorrelation analysis. Both the FAO landings and the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> catches show interannual fluctuations with a repeat period of 6 – 8 years, similar to the period of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Most <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> catch monitoring stations are in phase. The <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> catches show a significant negative correlation with the NAO lagged by 0 – 2 years, consistent with the hypothesis that the positive NAO phase has an adverse impact on the larval survival in and migration from the Sargasso Sea spawning location, one year prior to the arrival of the glass eels in Europe and North Africa. The FAO landings can be divided into two groups of different phase that have an approximate correspondence to the NAO dipole in winter rainfall in Europe and North Africa. One group (P) comprises Denmark, Ireland, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, and the other group (N) comprises France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. At least for the interannual fluctuations, the success of the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> fishery (and eel recruitment) may be coupled with the number of migrating silver eels from the N group of countries and uncoupled with the P group of countries...|$|E
40|$|Glass eels {{are known}} to reach the shores of Holland by using ocean {{currents}} and selective tidal transport (DM ¿ Downstream Movements). Most of the fish ladders that are installed at the interface of salt and fresh waters, however, are designed for fish that are attracted by freshwater currents and that actively move upstream (Upstream Migratory (UM) behaviours). From this, we questioned the efficiency of these fish ladders for <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> immigration. We tested our hypothesis of UM versus DM behaviours by comparing the catch of <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> in two experimental fish ladders: a siphon and an eel trap, appealing to DM and UM behaviours respectively. These traps were installed at two sluice complexes in Holland and operated at night during the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> season of 2005. These experiments were supplemented by direct scuba observations. The results showed that most glass eels gained access to inland waters by DM instead of UM behaviours. At low tide, none of the <b>glass</b> <b>eel</b> were observed to reach fresh waters as the water velocities in the cracks of the sluice doors were too high for upstream migration. At high tide, many glass eels were observed to reach fresh waters by DM-behaviours and small cracks in the sluice doors.

40|$|Anguilla japonica and Anguilla marmorata share {{overlapping}} spawning sites, similar drifting routes, and comparable larval durations. However, they exhibit allopatric geographical distributions in East Asia. To clarify this ecological discrepancy, <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> from estuaries in Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and China {{were collected}} monthly, and the survival rate of A. marmorata under varying water salinities and temperatures was examined. The composition ratio of these 2 eel species {{showed a significant}} latitude cline, matching the 24 °C sea surface temperature isotherm in winter. Both species had opposing temperature preferences for recruitment. A. marmorata prefer high water temperatures and die at low water temperatures. In contrast, A. japonica can endure low water temperatures, but their recruitment is inhibited by high water temperatures. Thus, A. japonica <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> which mainly spawn in summer, are preferably recruited to Taiwan, China, Korea, and Japan by the Kuroshio and its branch waters in winter. Meanwhile, A. marmorata <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> which spawn throughout the year, are mostly screened out in East Asia in areas with low-temperature coastal waters in winter. During summer, the strong northward currents from the South China Sea and Changjiang River discharge markedly block the Kuroshio invasion and thus restrict the approach of A. marmorata <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> to the coasts of China and Korea. The differences in the preferences of the recruitment temperature for <b>glass</b> <b>eels</b> combined with the availability of oceanic currents shape the real geographic distribution of Anguilla japonica and Anguilla marmorata, making them "temperate" and "tropical" eels, respectively...|$|R
50|$|The {{main reason}} that the {{aquaculture}} of Anguillid eels has become more popular in recent times is that the wild seed supply cannot support the demand of the consumer. Because of declining catches of both the European and Japanese <b>glass</b> <b>eels,</b> seed from the short-finned eels is at a commercial premium. The increasing pressure on eels has led to reduced recruitment of juveniles of angullid species which limits the industry and potentially leads to ecological impacts.
