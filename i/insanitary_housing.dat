This was in sharp {{contrast}} to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century, the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree's report of 1901, entitled Poverty: a study of town life. It revealed appalling statistics of dark, overcrowded and <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{population}} {{explosion in the}} cities came a housing crisis. Casual employment demanded that individuals should live {{within walking distance of}} the sources of their work. In many cases, this meant living and working in the traditional centres of the cities. Notwithstanding the fact that many Victorian cities were expanding far beyond their traditional boundaries through suburban development, made possible by the growth of the railways, the corresponding flight to the suburbs was very much a facet of the expanding middle classes in the 1880s. By contrast, the inner city areas were turned into chronically overcrowded centres of <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing</b> unable to cope with the huge influx of people.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{proposals}} {{for the city}} centre were rejected, the later concept of the Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) can trace its roots directly to the Bruce Report. In the 1950s, Glasgow Corporation designated CDAs as districts suffering from severe overcrowding and <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing,</b> where the only solution would be complete demolition and rebuilding. Of the 20 CDAs which the Corporation identified, two of them - Anderston and Townhead - lay partially within the city centre and saw nearly total destruction {{to make way for}} roads, high-rise housing and concrete office buildings. For example, the southern reaches of Townhead were re-zoned for educational use in preparation for the former Royal College of Science and Technology's growth into a university. The resulting John Anderson Campus of what became the University of Strathclyde now occupies a huge proportion of Townhead. In Anderston, entire communities were wiped off the map {{to make way for the}} controversial ring road (see below) as well as commercial developments on the western edge of the city centre - new buildings such as Elmbank Gardens and the Anderston Centre being prime examples.|$|E
50|$|Following the Second World War, Hutchesontown was {{declared}} a Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) {{in the aftermath}} of the Bruce Report.

50|$|For social historians Hay’s {{observations}} were {{typical of the}} time and reflected a dynamic change in the interaction between social problems, social thought and social action from the 1880s onwards and his work must be understood in the context of that change. As the population of Britain’s cities grew, so too did the problem of housing the poor. Slum dwelling, the public health and public order issues that were associated with overcrowded and <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing</b> challenged the minds of philosophers, sociologists, charities, philanthropists, local government and national government for decades. Were the poor morally blameworthy for their own condition? Why were there slum dwellings? How were the poor to be housed and who had the responsibility for housing them? These were questions that went to heart of how the late Victorians and Edwardians understood the very nature of society. The proposed solutions evolved and illustrate that in studying the intellectual and social history of the period, it is difficult to establish a causal nexus between social thought and social action.|$|E
5000|$|In 1835 Mimerel stated {{publicly}} {{that half of}} the workers in his cotton mill in Lille were children.They usually started work at the age of eight, often earlier, had the same hours as adults and had no schooling or protection of any form.He clearly thought that employment was better than limited schooling and long periods of idleness.In his 1840 Tableau Louis-René Villermé described child labor conditions in the textile industry as [...] "too terrible to be endured".In 1841 the work of Villermé, the report of Alexandre Loiset on <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing</b> in Lille and the intervention of Villeneuve-Bargemont led to a law regulating child labour.The employers of Nord were particularly hostile to the bill, saying that although the children worked long hours their work was not tiring, and {{it was not possible to}} separate the work of adults and children.It was unjust to blame industrialists for working-class pauperism.In an open letter of 1841 entitled Pauperism, its increase attributed to industry in a host of writings, Mimerel pointed out that pauperism existed before the industrial revolution, and it was normal for it to be found among workers.He said that manufacturers showed humanity and charity by founding hospices and setting up canteens for their workers.|$|E
40|$|The {{cities of}} the world are often {{regarded}} as hubs of wealth and privilege, but they are also home to hundreds of millions of children for whom poverty and exclusion are a daily reality. Some of these children live on the street; many more live in dangerous, <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing</b> which often lacks the most basic amenities, including clean water and satisfactory sanitation. These urban children rarely have access to adequate services, including schooling, or to safe areas for play and recreation. The imperative of economic survival can mean not only that parents are unable to dedicate sufficient time to childcare, but also that children themselves are forced to work, often in hazardous conditions. Yet all this need not be the case: this Digest examines the potential of good urban governance founded upon human rights principles to promote positive change for and with children. The key to eradicating urban poverty and exclusion lies in the development of child-friendly cities where children’s rights are made a priority in budgeting, planning and resource allocation and where children’s voices inform the democratic process. child poverty; child protection; governance; poverty; street children; street children; urban children; urban communities;Global;...|$|E
50|$|After the {{publication}} of the Bruce Report in 1946, Glasgow Corporation identified Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), which were largely inner-urban districts (such as the Gorbals, Anderston and Townhead), with a high proportion of overcrowded slum housing. These areas would see the mass demolition of overcrowded and <b>insanitary</b> tenement slum <b>housing,</b> and their replacement with lower density housing schemes to create space for modern developments. The dispersed population would be relocated to new estates built on green belt land on the outer periphery of the city's metropolitan area, with others moved out to the New Towns of Cumbernauld and East Kilbride. These initiatives began to be implemented in the late 1950s.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the complexities of}} factory workers' problems in an export processing zone in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in managing their health, illness and well-being. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used to collect the data. Single and young men and women, of whom the majority worked in food and wood factories, were recruited {{to participate in this}} study. The search for good fortune, rural poverty, the desire to have material goods, and to escape from the social constraints of village life, drives people to move to the city. Despite a predominant desire to pursue economic gain, workers also relate urban living as providing them with a modern lifestyle, which they translate as having freedom and independence, providing them with a space {{to make their own decisions}} especially in relation to spending money. But this freedom seems to be illusive, as privileges are not stated in work agreements. Insecurity and having no choice in the workplace, poor working conditions, strained relationships with supervisor, long hours of work, and fear of losing jobs, obscure and dilute the freedom that workers hope to have in their personal lives. These factors also lead to deteriorations in workers' health conditions. Their health is exacerbated by stressful living conditions, such as a dirty and <b>insanitary</b> environment, crowded <b>housing,</b> and lack of water supply, and the complicated nature of social and personal relationships, such as family problems, low remuneration for their work, and pressure on them to remit to their families. Instead of being passive victims of the stressful working environment and social structure, most informants showed positive attitudes and strong individual agency as can be seen through their various coping strategies, which involved seeking treatment, professionally and traditionally, being grateful, self-blaming (and so a sense of personal responsibility), spiritual practices, and their involvement in labour unions. Drawing on this data, I argue that interventions are needed which are not limited only to health and treatment facilities, but expanded to improve the policies of employers, industrial relations, and the quality of government's policies, all of which influence workers' daily lives, both in workplace and living environment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) —Boston UniversityThe {{public health}} {{movement}} had its genesis in urban centers where overcrowding and <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing</b> conditions intensified human misery and {{the ravages of}} disease. Boston by the mid-nineteenth century was a crowded city with {{a high incidence of}} disease. Through the efforts of the municipal Board of Health and humanitarian urban reform groups, the city became a leader in the public health movement. 	By 1870, the first strides had already been made in the United States to promote interest among sanitarians in preventive medicine and the preservation of the public health. In Massachusetts, the first modern state Board of Health, encompassing the idea that the state has a duty to preserve the public health, was established in 1869. Four years previously the Metropolitan Board of Health was formed in New York, with doctors among its members, to study and enforce methods for preserving internal health rather than merely quarantine and street cleaning regulations; this was the first such municipal venture. In 1870, efforts to establish a similar municipal board of health were gaining importance in Boston. 	The Board of Aldermen in Boston had charge of the enforcement of the health laws for the city in 1870. The Aldermen, who were burdened with other duties and lacked any scientific interest in hygiene, neglected to enforce the sanitary laws of the city. Consequently, the leading physicians of Boston repeatedly suggested that the health administration of the city be changed, and a board of health, independent of the Board of Aldermen be formed, with at least one doctor as a member. Such proposals were, however, ignored by the Aldermen. [TRUNCATED...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} discern the impact of social housing on public health in the cities of Glasgow, Scotland and Baltimore, Maryland in the twentieth century. Additionally, this dissertation seeks to compare the impact of social housing policy implementation in both cities, to determine the efficacy of social housing {{as a tool of}} public health betterment. This is accomplished through the exposition and evaluation of the housing and health trends of both cities {{over the course of the}} latter half of the twentieth century. Both the cities of Glasgow and Baltimore had long struggled with both overcrowded slum districts and relatively unhealthy populations. Early commentators had noticed the connection between <b>insanitary</b> <b>housing</b> and poor health, and sought a solution to both of these problems. Beginning in the 1940 s, housing reform advocates (self-dubbed ‘housers') pressed for the development of social housing, or municipally-controlled housing for low-income persons, to alleviate the problems of overcrowded slum dwellings in both cities. The impetus for social housing was twofold: to provide affordable housing to low-income persons and to provide housing that would facilitate healthy lives for tenants. Whether social housing achieved these goals is the crux of this dissertation. In the immediate years following the Second World War, social housing was built en masse in both cities. Social housing provided a reprieve from slum housing for both working-class Glaswegians and Baltimoreans. In Baltimore specifically, social housing provided accommodation for the city’s Black residents, who found it difficult to occupy housing in White neighbourhoods. As the years progressed, social housing developments in both cities faced unexpected problems. In Glasgow, stable tenant flight (including both middle class and skilled artisan workers) + resulted in a concentration of poverty in the city’s housing schemes, and in Baltimore, a flight of White tenants of all income levels created a new kind of state subsidized segregated housing stock. The implementation of high-rise tower blocks in both cities, once heralded as a symbol of housing modernity, also faced increased scrutiny in the 1960 s and 1970 s. During the period of 1940 - 1980, before policy makers in the United States began to eschew social housing for subsidized private housing vouchers and community based housing associations had truly taken off in Britain, public health professionals conducted academic studies of the impact of social housing tenancy on health. Their findings provide the evidence used to assess the second objective of social housing provision, as outlined above. Put simply, while social housing units were undoubtedly better equipped than slum dwellings in both cities, the public health investigations into the impact of rehousing slum dwellers into social housing revealed that social housing was not a panacea for each city’s social and public health problems...|$|E
