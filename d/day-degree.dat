40|$|Abstract: In 1996 - 1999, {{studies on}} the {{utilization}} of pheromone traps for the estimation of adult emergence and the observation of the seasonal population dynamics of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.), which tends to spread in cotton growing areas, and on the determination of <b>day-degree</b> values for its biological stages were carried out in Amik Plain. It was found that adult emergence of the overwintering generation first occurred between late April and early May and lasted for 2 - 2. 5 months. The effective total summation for first adult emergence was 136. 43, 137. 43 and 186. 95 <b>day-degree,</b> and that for maximum adult emergence was 570. 80, 460. 23 and 479. 35 <b>day-degree</b> in 1996, 1997 and 1998 respectively. In the same years, adult emergence of the overwintering generation finished at 980. 80, 1090. 57 and 1157. 50 <b>day-degree</b> respectively. Sex pheromone traps were used to monitor both first adult emergence and population changes in cotton growing seasons. The level of damage in 1997 {{was significantly related to}} the number of adults trapped (r: 0. 799). It was concluded that sex pheromone traps can be used to monitor pink bollworm populations and that effective total thermal summation can be employed together with sex pheromone traps to observe first adult emergence...|$|E

40|$|The minimum water {{temperature}} for development (t 0) and the thermal constant (K) {{for the development}} of immature stages of Simulium damnosum s. l.

Thus, at a constant water temperature of 30. 0 ◦C (approximately 10 ◦C above t 0), adult flies would emerge about 9 days after oviposition. Analysis of a dataset probably restricted to S. damnosum s. s., but for which the temperature for the egg stage varied, revealed a much lower t 0 (16. 3 ◦C) and a much higher K (181 <b>day-degrees),</b> suggesting that the insects’ thermal relations may be cytoform-specific.

40|$|A {{method to}} predict the {{beginning}} of the flight of apple sawfly, Hoplocampa testudinea (Klug) (Hymenoptera, Tenthredinidae) is presented. Adults were monitored during 8 years at the experimental orchard ‘De Schuilenburg’, Kesteren, The Netherlands, with visual sticky traps. Temperature sums, accumulated until the day of the first capture of sawfly, were calculated for different starting dates of the summations. Beginning on 1 January, variation of the temperature sums, calculated in each of 8 years, decreased when later starting dates for temperature summation were chosen, reaching a minimum on 1 April for soil temperatures (− 5 cm). The soil temperature sum, accumulated from 1 April until the first capture, was on average 134 <b>day-degrees</b> above a threshold of 4 °C. So this was the most suitable starting date {{to predict the}} beginning of sawfly flight activity.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Council for National Academic Awards in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophySeed tubers conditioned to 0, 200 or 400 day-degrees above 4 t were grown in land infested with Q. pallida. Plants from 400 <b>day-degree</b> seed emerged earlier, had larger canopies and greater dry weights early in the growing season than plants from 0 <b>day-degree</b> seed. However, physiological ageing reduced peak percentage ground cover and advanced crop senescence so that similar quantities of solar radiation were intercepted over the whole growth period. Overall, total and ware yields were not affected much by seed tuber physiological age. The partially resistant cultivars tested were more tolerant than the non resistant cultivars but tolerance was not usually affected by physiological age of seed tubers. The effects of nematicide treatment, initial Q. pallida population density, cultivar maturity class, cultivar resistance status and planting date on nematode multiplication, plant growth and tolerance of attack by Q. pallida are discussed. Using data from a variable temperature water bath experiment, probability and regression analysis estimated mean basal temperatures {{for the development of}} Q. pallida and Q. rostochiensis at 2. 5 and S. rCi least variance analysis estimates were 3. 5 and 4. rC respectively. Approximately 200 day-degrees above 3. 5 and 4. rC were required from the inoculation of JJ 2 of Q. pallida and G. rostochiensis to the peak numbers of JJ 5 found in potato roots. From a range of chemicals tested for their ability to release antigen from Q. pallida cysts, sodium hypochlorite was found to be the most effective.

30|$|In China, A. mali is {{comprised}} of two distinct genetic clades (Zhang et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2014). We hypothesized that the expansion of WAA {{in recent years is}} related to differences in low-temperature adaptability between these clades. Earlier studies outside of China have found that low-temperature adaptability differs among geographic populations of A. mali (Mols and Boers 2001). For example, in the Annapolis River valley of Nova Scotia (Canada), the parasitoid population appears earlier in the year than a strain of A. mali found in the Netherlands, thus providing better control in Nova Scotia than Holland. By the time, the Dutch strain of A. mali becomes active and its population was grown to levels that make its control by A. mali difficult (Mols and Boers 2001). The Nova Scotian and the Dutch strains of A. mali also differ in their low-temperature threshold (8.6 and 9.4  °C, Nova Scotia vs Holland, respectively) and their effective accumulated temperature requirements, which were lower for the Canadian strain than for the Dutch strain (123.5 and 136.4 <b>day-degree,</b> respectively) (Mols and Boers 2001).|$|E

Models that help to describe and even predict the evolution of parasitism underground are a valuable tool for herbicide applications, and even could help in breeding programs. Legumes are heavily affected by Orobanche crenata (crenate broomrape) in the Mediterranean basin. This work presents a descriptive model based on thermal time and correlating growing <b>day-degrees</b> (GDD) with the different developmental stages of the parasite. The model was developed in three different legume crops (faba bean, grass pea and lentil) attacked by crenate broomrape. The developmental stages of the parasite strongly correlated with the GDD and differences were found depending on the host crop...|$|R
40|$|Many cestodes use copepods {{as first}} {{intermediate}} hosts, and some may infect juvenile salmonids in hatcheries that use water from sources that are inhabited by native salmonids. Little {{is known about}} their infection dynamics and development under these artificial conditions. The cestode fauna of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) was examined from February (fry) {{to the end of}} July (parr) at a hatchery in Hordaland, W Norway. Two fish groups, which followed standard rearing conditions, were studied. These groups received inlet water through filter systems with differing efficiency. Thus the fish groups were infected at different times in spring. Sampling was carried out at bi-weekly intervals, and a total of 1709 juvenile salmon were examined during the study. In addition, a total of 43 wild salmonids (salmon, rainbow trout, charr and brown trout) from the supplying watercourse were examined for the presence of cestodes. Two adult tapeworms, Eubothrium crassum (Bloch, 1779) and Proteocephalus longicollis (Zeder, 1800), and a single Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (Nitzsch, 1824) plerocercoid were found in the juvenile salmon. Eubothrium crassum and P. longicollis were first found in the juvenile salmon in late March. The principal infection with E. crassum occurred from late March to mid May, while infections with P. longicollis mainly took place in two pulses, one in March – April and one in May – June. Prevalence of E. crassum and P. longicollis reached a maximum of 42 % and 41 %, respectively. A few tapeworms were usually found in each infected salmon. The development time from larva to the gravid state was estimated to 50 days (750 <b>day-degrees)</b> and 33 days (460 <b>day-degrees)</b> for E. crassum and P. longicollis, respectively, suggesting that these cestodes may complete their life cycle in less than a year. Small fish showed higher abundance of E. crassum or P. longicollis than larger fish. Abundance and load (weight worm/weight fish) of E. crassum were negatively correlated with host condition, suggesting that E. crassum may {{have a negative effect on}} salmon growth. Proteocephalus longicollis infections appeared to be less harmful. The study highlights the importance of effective filtering of the inlet water in hatcheries, since the evidence suggest that E. crassum interfere with the production of smolts...|$|R
40|$|Amblyseius californicus was {{introduced}} into the UK in the early 1990 s as a biocontrol agent against glasshouse red spider mite Tetranychus urticae. This study investigated the effects of temperature on the establishment potential of A. californicus in the UK {{in the light of}} recent reports of their successful overwintering outside of glasshouse environments. The developmental thresholds were 9. 9 and 8. 6 degreesC respectively using simple and weighted linear regression. Using the <b>day-degree</b> requirement per generation calculated by weighted regression (143 day-degrees) in combination with climate data, it was estimated that up to seven generations would be possible annually outdoors in the UK. Non-diapausing adult females froze at - 22 degreesC, with 100 % mortality after reaching their freezing temperature. Up to 90 % of mites died before freezing after short exposures to low temperatures. Significant acclimation responses occurred; 90 % of acclimated individuals survived 26 days exposure at 0 degreesC and 11 days at - 5 degreesC (acclimated mites were reared at 19 degreesC, 6 L: 18 D followed by I week at 10 degreesC, 12 L: 12 D). Non-diapausing adult females survived over 3 months outdoors in winter under sheltered conditions and oviposition was observed. The experimental protocol used in this study is discussed as a pre-release screen for the establishment potential of other Amblyseius species, and similar non-native biocontrol agents...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying and {{simulating}} {{the relationships}} between crop growth, total-nitrogen (total-N) and nitrate-N (NO 3 ±-N) concentration can improve crop nutritional husbandry. In this study, the relationship between shoot relative growth rate (RGR) and shoot total-N, organic-N and NO 3 ±-N concentration of hydroponically-grown lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. capitata L. cv. Kennedy) was described and simulated. Plants were grown hydroponically for up to 74 d. Nitrogen was supplied throughout (control; T 1), or removed at 35 d (T 2) and 54 d (T 3), respectively, after sowing. The organic-N and NO 3 ±-N concentration declined in the shoots of control plants with growth, until commercial maturity approached when organic-N and NO 3 ±-N con-centration increased. There were sub-linear relation-ships between both total-N and organic-N concen-tration, and shoot RGR, in the N-limited treatments, i. e. shoot RGR approached an asymptote at high shoot N concentration. The proportional effects of total-N and organic-N concentration on shoot RGR were independent of plant age. A dynamic simulation model (`Nicolet'), derived previously under different conditions, was used to simulate the growth, dry mat-ter content, organic-N, and NO 3 ±-N concentration of let-tuce grown under the extreme N-stress conditions experienced by the plants. In view of the largely suc-cessful ®tting of the model to experimental data, the model was used to interpret the results. Suggestions for model improvement are made.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the summer}} of 2011 Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a Culicoides-borne orthobunyavirus, emerged in Germany and The Netherlands and {{subsequently}} spread across much of Europe. To draw inferences about the transmission of SBV we have developed two models to describe its spread within and between farms. The within-farm model was fitted to seroprevalence data for cattle and sheep farms in Belgium and The Netherlands, with parameters estimated using approximate Bayesian computation. Despite the short duration of viraemia in cattle and sheep (mean of 3 – 4 days) the within-farm seroprevalence can reach high levels (mean within-herd seroprevalence > 80 %), largely because the probability of transmission from host to vector is high (14 %) and SBV is able to replicate quickly (0. 03 per <b>day-degree)</b> and at relatively low temperatures (threshold for replication: 12. 3 °C). Parameter estimates from the within-farm model were then used in a separate between-farm model to simulate the regional spread of SBV. This showed that the rapid spread of SBV at a regional level is primarily {{a consequence of the}} high probability of transmission from host to vector and the temperature requirements for virus replication. Our results, obtained for a region of the UK in a typical year with regard to animal movements, indicate that {{there is no need to}} invoke additional transmission mechanisms to explain the observed patterns of rapid spread of SBV in Europe. Moreover, the imposition of movement restrictions, even a total movement ban, has little effect on the spread of SBV at this scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} the field and {{laboratory}} to clarify the bionomics of an armored scale, Aonidiella taxus. The results are summarized as follows: 1. This armored scale is viviparous, nymphs being laid beneath the scales. Females have two nymphal stages and adult stage, whereas males two nymphal, prepupal, pupal and winged adult stages. The duration between settling of crawlers and nymph-depositing of adult females is more than 43 days at 25 ℃. Male adults emerge about 26 days after settling of crawlers at the same temperature condition. 2. Scale coverings of females and 1 st instar males show almost circular form, while those of 2 nd instar males are somewhat elongated. Therefore, the sexes can be easily discriminated after 2 nd instar. The development of scale coverings is observed only at early few days of each instar. Size of scale covering of adult female is about 2. 5 mm in diameter. 3. The thresholds of the development of male and female are 14. 7 and 14. 8 ℃, respectively. Thermal constant for female from settling to nymph-deposition is 447 <b>day-degrees,</b> and one for male from the same stage to adult emergence is 278 <b>day-degrees.</b> 4. The adults continue nymph-deposition for about 70 days. They deposit 2 to 6 crawlers per day. Mean fecundity of adults is 158. Net reproduction rate (R_ 0) is 59, the mean length of one generation (T) is 66 days, and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) is 0. 04 per female per day at 25 ℃, respectively. 5. This species has 2 or 3 generations in Miyazaki and 2 in Fukuoka during a year. 室内及び野外における調査ならびに実験によりマキアカマルカイガラムシの生活史を調べた. 結果の概略は次のようであつた. 1. マキアカマルカイガラムシは卵胎生で,雌は 1 ・ 2 令仔虫期を経て成虫になり,雄は 1 ・ 2 令仔虫期の後さらに前蝋,蛹期を経て有翅の成虫となる. 25 ℃の条件下で雌は 1 令定着後 43 日目から産仔活動を始める. 1 令定着後雄が成虫として羽化するまでに要する発育期間は約 26 日である. 2. 雌介殻,及び 1 令の雄介殻はほぼ円形で,その成長は各ステージの初期の数日に限られており,最終的な雌成虫の介殻の大きさは直径約 2. 5 mmに達する. 雄の介殻は 2 令仔虫期に長楕円形となるため, 2 令の中期には介殻の形状で雌雄の判別が可能となる. 3. 本種の発育零点は雌で 14. 8 ℃,雄で 14. 7 ℃である. また雌の定着から産仔開始までに要する有効積算温量は 447 日度,雄の成虫羽化までのそれは 278 日度である. 4. 雌は日当たり 2 ～ 6 頭のほふく仔虫を約 70 日間にわたつて産仔し, 1 雌の平均総産仔数は 158 頭である. 本種の純繁殖率(R_ 0),世代の平均時間(T),内的自然増加率(r) はそれぞれ 59, 66 日, 0. 04 /雌/日であつた. 5. 本種は宮崎では年 2 ～ 3 世代,福岡では 2 世代を経過する...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyse growth {{differences}} in Norway lobster larvae, Nephorps norvegicus. To date very few studies have used nucleic acids and protein contents to characterize larval stages in crustaceans. DNA, RNA and protein contents were quantified and used as potential indirect measures of growth. Fed and starved larvae were reared at different temperatures (6 º, 12 º, 18 ºC) from hatching to the end of stage III (metamorphosis). During this time, larval growth was measured in samples taken every 1 - 4 days as a function of <b>day-degrees.</b> Growth was significantly higher in fed larvae compared to starved larvae at 12 º and 18 ºC, while no significant differences were observed at 6 ºC. Starved individuals did not pass through the first moult. Duration of the larval moult-cycle varied with temperature. Stage III was reached during the third week at 18 ºC, while it took five weeks at 12 ºC. The RNA:DNA ratio and the protein:DNA ratio appeared to be viable indicators of growth in Norway lobster larvae...|$|R
40|$|Some {{environmental}} factors which influence the reproductive behavior of Acacia ~ var. hawaiiensis (Rock) were studied {{on the east}} flank of Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Additionally, some factors were tested under controlled conditions. It was found that soil moisture as well as soil temperature in terms of <b>day-degrees</b> are limiting factors for koa germination. Variability among individual seeds in regard to their germination requirements is very great. This results in a functional relationship between germination rates and time. Another important factor appears to be soil aeration as i. ndicated by the stimulating effect of soil cultivation. Dry periods limit survival of germinated seeds. Vegetative suckering is a compensative reproductive behavior in drier and/or cooler areas. But suckering does not occur when the soil is covered by a dense and tall grass sward. Scalping the sward, and to a smaller degree, clipping of the vegetation, stimulates koa suckering. Initial growth in suckers and seedlings depends on temperature, soil moisture and light intensity. It was possible to show some relationships quantitatively. - i...|$|R
