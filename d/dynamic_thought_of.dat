This paper tries {{to reveal the}} modern Islamic thoughts proposed by Jamaluddin Al-Afghani in reconstructing the understanding of qadha and qadar (takdir) from fatalistic and statis <b>thoughts</b> into <b>dynamic</b> <b>thoughts.</b> The meaning <b>of</b> fana and baqa in sufism, according to Al-Afghani’s thought, is real. The faith does not mean avoiding the needs of real life, but it should empower the social welfare and improve the social life. Al-Afghani states that the confession of the faith (qadha and qadar) {{is one of the}} basic elements in theology which cannot be avoided, yet it should be understood correctly and positively to reach the happiness in this world and the life after death. </em...|$|R
30|$|Our {{focus on}} freedom of {{movement}} stems from the potential ability of this dimension to conceptually distinguish between streams <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> that are more constrained (such as ruminative or goal-directed thoughts) and spontaneously unfolding streams of thought—an experience that is often intuitively considered to occur when the mind wanders. Within the <b>Dynamic</b> Framework <b>of</b> <b>Thought</b> (Christoff et al., 2016) which emphasizes how thoughts unfold over time, different sources of constraints—for example, automatic (e.g. habits, affect, salient distractors) and deliberate constraints (e.g. goal-directed focus)—dynamically influence the way thoughts unfold over time. In this model, some thought streams are more constrained (or focused on a particular topic) while other thought patterns are more “free,” i.e. {{they are less likely}} to be focused on a particular topic and will tend towards greater content variability over time (Mills, Herrera-Bennett, Faber, & Christoff, 2018). For example, night-time dreaming is considered to have low levels of constraint and thus higher degrees of freedom that are less bound to reality, compared to creative thinking which involves spontaneity but also elements of topical constraint; however, both can be considered forms <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>thought</b> (Christoff et al., 2016). Freedom <b>of</b> movement in <b>thought</b> would vary on a continuum from high to low based on the amount of net constraints that operate on the <b>dynamic</b> flow <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> at any moment, which can come from a variety of sources including (but not limited to) conscious or latent goal pursuits, habits, as well as perceptual or emotional demands.|$|R

40|$|Critical {{theory is}} a multifarious and <b>dynamic</b> body <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> {{and it is}} hard to make general {{statements}} about its relation to practical philosophy without shoehorning it into one-size-fits-all judgments. To avoid doing this, this article indicates wherever possible whose critical theory is at issue and at what phase in its development. The Frankfurt School critical theory is a particular kind of Gesellschaftskritik or social criticism, the practical aims of which are essential to and inseparable from it. Indeed, as distinct from social theory or sociology, critical theory is, in the eyes of its architects and practitioners, a kind of practice. Yet critical theory is still very much philosophy. Furthermore, critical theory from early on had an almost entirely negative view of instrumental reasoning. This raises the question which asks about the kind of practical upshot that critical theory can have, absent of all political, moral, and prudential considerations...|$|R
40|$|My {{sense of}} {{contemporary}} moral psychology – {{a field of}} research that has been my interest for all of my scholarly career – {{is that it has}} provided rich understandings regarding the development of moral reasoning, but has been relatively impoverished in terms of its appreciation of moral personality and character. This rather barren conception of moral 1 functioning has, not surprisingly, often failed to provide effective means by which to foster children’s moral development. The basic goal of my recent research is to formulate a more balanced account of moral functioning that meaningfully integrates moral cognition with moral character and action – a research direction that I will illustrate today through the study of moral exemplarity. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that moral functioning is inherently multifaceted, involving the <b>dynamic</b> interplay <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> emotions, and behavior; and that we trivialize morality if we focus exclusively on one component. I believe that the study of exemplary moral character has the potential to encompass the various cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components of moral functioning, as well as to address the different domains of moral concern, that is, both ou...|$|R

Subconscious reactions were made visible and a complex interplay of the observed artwork, reactions to that work, reactions to reactions to that work, and the visual EEG representation itself as an artwork, combined to produce a complex and nuanced artistic experience. The attitude of 53 primary preservice arts education students to arts education was surveyed using the Teaching With the Arts Survey (TWAS) instrument pre and post use of EEG visualisations during arts education studies, and compared to two 53 student control groups in the same course.

Mohammad Hatta as {{a person}} who firstly proclaims RI was an {{initiator}} who had an idea of separated relationship between religion and politic. Hatta was someone who “responsible” for deleting seven words on Jakarta Charter 1945 as a spirit in integrating religion and politic. He lobbied many Islamic prominent figures to consider deleting “sacred” words on the Jakarta Charter, “kewajiban menjalankan syari`at Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya” (“the compulsory to obey Islamic law for the followers) that was recommended by the nine committees. Such statement had made Hatta elder statesman who tried to separate religion from state. Otherwise, as far as he lived he used to build an Islamic in the early New Order era although it fell down. There were an impression that he changed his state of mind in relation to the religion and state. He took Islam as a basis of regulating politic and government. This was showed from Hatta’s effort in establishing Indonesian Islamic Democratic Party with other muslem public figures. Looking at his background, the idea and the effort were not his phase thought, but they were crystallization of his religious attitude that Hatta applied consistently...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{turnover}} in the correctional workplace has predominately focused on investigating {{the relationship between}} job satisfaction and {{turnover in}}tent among prison staff. In an effort to broaden that level of inquiry to encompass the jail workforce, this study analyzes data from {{a national survey of}} 1, 924 line-level jail staff {{to assess the impact of}} both work-related variables and personal characteristics on the intention of employees to resign. Although not randomly gener-ated, respondents represent 46 states and are generally reflective of what is known about com-position of the national line officer jail workforce in terms of demographics. Descriptive results indicate that the majority of jail officers are satisfied with their jobs and have no intention of quit-ting. Further logistic regression modeling confirms related literature indicating that the most influ-ential variables are dynamic factors such as job satisfaction and work environment, rather than the static variables associated with individual employee characteristics, such as gender, age, or race. Since the environmental variables investigated are amenable to change, it would appear that, with greater insights into these <b>dynamic</b> precursors <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> about quitting, jail administrators can develop strategic initiatives targeted toward proactively reducing the fiscal cost and intangible impact of voluntary turnover...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between death and artistic creativity {{has always been}} an interesting and important point of view from which to understand the development of Western (but not only Western) art in its capacity to represent the spirit of the ages and of history, the {{relationship between}} subject and object, between artist and the reality around him. Within this perspective, German Romantic thought, which is at the beginning of Western aesthetic modernity, has a particularly significant meaning: in the poetics {{of one of the most}} important exponents of this tradition, Friedrich Hölderlin, the concept of “negative” represents the essential <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> i. e. tragic dialectic, the power of dissolution and of death. In the context of the artistic avant-garde of the early twentieth century, the Romantic philosophical tradition is a moment of extraordinary and often controversial symbolic meaning. The concept of abstraction is the main feature of the much-celebrated modern art revolution and in the development of the so called “post-auratic art” it is involved in a very intense dialogue with life, with its dynamics and contradictions. With regards to the theme of death and of flesh decay, the British artist Damien Hirst, one of the most celebrated in contemporary art, develops one of the most interesting and challenging phases of its production, in which the same desecration of the taboo of death becomes a powerful communicative gesture and a pure artistic transfiguration act...|$|R

AN OVERVIEW OF THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS The New Institutional Economics is a large and relatively new multidisciplinary field that includes aspects of economics, history, sociology, political science, business organization and law. Oliver Williamson coined the phrase the “New Institutional Economics ” (Coase, 2000) but it is commonly known that the New Institutional Economics emerged with Coase’s 1937 article “The Nature of the Firm”. This article and his other famous essay “The Problem of Social Cost ” (1960) started what many, including North (2000), considered to be a revolution in economics. This new direction of economics considers that the cost of transacting – determined by institutions and institutional arrangements – is the key to economic performance. It i...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Thoughts</b> <b>of</b> {{death are}} not {{regularly}} included in diagnostic instruments and rarely examined separately from <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. This exploratory study examined whether <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide affect {{the course of}} late-life depressive disorders. METHODS: In 378 depressed older persons, <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide were assessed using questions from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. After 2 [*]years, {{the presence of a}} DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of minor or major depression or dysthymia was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was administered every 6 [*]months up till 3 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression showed that <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death as well as <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide predicted double depression at follow-up (OR[*]=[*] 2. 14 [95 % CI: 1. 04 - 4. 40] and OR[*]=[*] 6. 47 [95 % CI: 2. 22 - 3. 02], respectively), compared with patients without these thoughts. Results became non-significant when adjusted for baseline depression severity (OR[*]=[*] 1. 17 [95 % CI: 0. 52 - 2. 63] and OR[*]=[*] 2. 57 [95 % CI: 0. 79 - 8. 84], respectively). Mixed linear models showed that severity of depression was lowest in the reference group, while symptoms decreased more over time in those with either <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide were more severely depressed at baseline and follow-up, with the highest risk of being depressed at follow-up for patients with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. These associations could be explained by baseline depression severity. The results suggest that <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide are important risk markers in predicting the course of depression...|$|R
