To date, studies investigating circle hooks have been primarily restricted to large marine species. We compared the injury and short-term (72 -h) mortality of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and pumpkinseeds L. gibbosus angled using number- 6 circle hooks and three other conventional <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> (aberdeen, wide-gap, and baitholder) across three water temperatures (18, 22, and 268 C). Unlike other <b>hook</b> <b>types,</b> circle <b>hooks</b> were never lodged in the gullet, but they were frequently lodged in the eye. Some fish captured on conventional hooks were hooked deeply in the gullet, necessitating line cutting for release. Incidences of bleeding were low using all <b>hook</b> <b>types,</b> and when not lodged in the gullet, all hooks were generally easy to remove. Anatomical hooking locations differed among small (, 145 -mm) and large (. 145 -mm) bluegills for all <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> but not among pumpkinseeds. Hooking depth differed between small and large fish of both species captured on circle hooks; smaller fish were hooked more deeply. Mortality in both species wa...|$|R

Interactions were compared between circle and J hooks fished on 75 trips by two user groups (charter and recreational fishermen). Hooks were affixed to three species-specific leader types most commonly fished in this region: monofilament (dolphinfish), fluorocarbon (tuna), and wire (wahoo). Numbers of fish caught per trip and three potential mechanisms that might inf luence numbers caught (i. e., number of strikes, proportion of fish hooked, and proportion retained) were modeled with generalized linear models that considered <b>hook</b> <b>type,</b> leader type, species, user (fishing) group, and wave height as main effects. <b>Hook</b> <b>type</b> was a main effect at the catch level; generally, more fish were caught on J hooks than on circle hooks. The effect of <b>hook</b> <b>type</b> on strike rates was equivocal. However, J hooks had {{a greater proportion of}} hook-ups than did circle hooks. Finally, the proportion of fish retained once hooked was generally equal between <b>hook</b> <b>types.</b> We found similar results when data from additional species were pooled as a “tuna” group and a “mackerel” group.

40|$|We {{performed}} a quantitative review to evaluate circle hook use in recreational and commercial hook-and-line fisheries that interact with billfishes (Family: Istiophoridae). Specifically, we scrutinized {{the findings of}} 11 recent empirical studies that reported, on a species-specific basis, side-by-side measures of circle vs. J-hook fishing performance: catch, mortality, deep-hooking and bleeding rates. Of the 30 total comparisons extracted from the literature that satisfied our inclusion criteria, 13 indicated significant differences between <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> for the specific metric compared. No study reported significant billfish catch rate differences between <b>hook</b> <b>types.</b> However, when significant differences between <b>hook</b> <b>types</b> were found, higher mortality rates and higher rates of deep-hooking and bleeding were associated with J-hooks relative to circle hooks. We conclude that empirical evidence is sufficient to promote circle hook use in almost all hook-and-line fishery sectors that typically interact with istiophorids. However, billfish conservation benefits will only be realized if fishers use unmodified circle hooks, commit to releasing live fish and take other appropriate measures which maximize post-release survival. While there may be fishing modes where circle hook effects are negative, for billfish conservation, we recommend managers grant exceptions to circle hook use only when experimental results support such a practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Strict harvest {{regulations}} {{and a strong}} catch-and-release ethic among recreational anglers of muskellunge Esox masquinongy have led to interest in developing strategies for reducing injury and mortality of released fish. With many anglers using live baitfish to capture muskellunge, the use of circle hooks may reduce deep hooking and hence mortality. We contrasted the performance of circle hooks and J-style aberdeen hooks when capturing juvenile muskellunge with actively fished live baitfish. The J hooks performed better than circle hooks in terms of capture efficiency. The J hooks were more efficient at hooking muskellunge than were circle hooks, but landing efficiency was similar between the two types. Interestingly, injury was judged to be low regardless of <b>hook</b> <b>type.</b> Neither anatomical <b>hooking</b> location nor hooking depth differed significantly between fish captured on J and circle hooks. No fish were hooked in potentially lethal locations (e. g., gullet or eye) during the use of either <b>hook</b> <b>type.</b> Ease of <b>hook</b> removal did not differ between <b>hook</b> <b>types,</b> and <b>hooks</b> were generally categorized as easy to remove. Bleeding was considered minor and did not differ between hooks. We observed no initial or delayed mortality for fish captured on J or circle hooks. Given that J hooks have a higher muskellunge capture efficiency and {{that the use of}} circle hooks did not provide any compelling conservation benefits, anglers will probably continue to use J hooks and avoid circle hooks. Nonetheless, use of circle hooks could be advantageous for other fishing styles (e. g., still fishing, where baitfish are often swallowed), other species, or different sizes of muskellunge.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the circle-hook on hooking injury, fish size and catch rates were {{evaluated}} for mixed-species recreational boat fisheries in the Balearic Islands (NW Mediterranean). The relationships between deep-hooking incidence (the main cause of fish mortality) and <b>hook</b> <b>type</b> (circle <b>hooks</b> vs conventional J-hooks), fish size, and angler were tested. Results demonstrated {{that the size of}} the fish was the most important predictor of deep-hooking incidence, as a larger fish size resulted in an increase in deeper wounds. <b>Hook</b> <b>type</b> also had a significant effect on the deep-hooking rate. Specifically, the deep-hooking rate of the most frequently-caught species, Diplodus annularis (L.) and Coris julis (L.), was reduced by greater than half with the circle hooks. The mean size of the fish caught and the unhooking time were not affected by the use of circle hooks. Finally, their use resulted in no change in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) compared to conventional hooks for both univariate and multivariate procedures. Hence, circle hooks are a promising conservation tool for marine resources when linked with catch-and-release strategies. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
