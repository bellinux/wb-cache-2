5|$|The Corn Store {{adjacent}} to the Chapel may originally {{have been used as}} accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp.

Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> at the site was demolished {{to make room for the}} center. A total of eight buildings were torn down to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a brownfield site.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} school {{was established in}} the 1870s and grew to 65 students by 1901. Mond's business expanded throughout {{the latter part of the}} 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise. He built a large <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston. Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall on the main road in 1883. The current weatherboard town hall dates from c1900 and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to this. At the town's height in the 19th century, just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields, the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400. It had four public houses operating two of which, Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel, remained open in 1901. As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and fortnightly livestock sales. Carrick's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston. At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water. It relied on wells, rainwater and the inconstant river.|$|E
40|$|Most {{works on}} <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> airflow {{simulation}} {{are related to}} two-dimensional or axisymmetric cases, although, this flow is usually three-dimensional. Even if the grain mass distribution is two-dimensional or axisymmetric, the airflow inlets in those <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> do not satisfy these conditions. Besides, an aeration in large <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> frequently is realized separately for different segments. In this work, based on the math model presented at [1], we developed a software written in ANSI C++ to do the three-dimensional airflow simulation on <b>grain</b> <b>stores.</b> For geometry construction, we used Blender 3 d, which is a free software tool for 3 D modeling. For mesh generation we made use of Netgen, a free software mesh generation tool. Our software imports the mesh generated by Netgen, builds the finite element global matrix, taking account the boundary conditions, and solves the obtained linear system by the Conjugate Gradients method. To take account the model’s non-linearity effects (related to the coefficient of pressure gradient permeability dependency on grain mass compression), the program executes an iterative process calculating the permeability coefficient distribution by the parameters obtained in the last iteration. To show the results graphically, we made use of the Paraview software, which is also free software. The simulations had shown good performance of the software developed, which {{can be applied to}} optimize the <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> performance and to lower the engineering costs of new <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> projects...|$|R

The shape of the {{enclosure}} {{at the end of}} this road, the presence of piles of stones and what may have been a weir fairly conclusively show this to have been the site of a mill. The 1829 Robert Aitken's survey and the 1858 OS map indicates 'stepping stones' here (the old weir) and a ford a hundred metres or so upstream. A building is indicated, which may have been the <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> on the other side of the river, the ford would have provided easy access. A track from here, the <b>grain</b> <b>store,</b> to High Chapeltoun is shown on one of Aitken's maps.

25|$|The fort was {{oriented}} {{in such a}} {{way that}} its main gate, or porta praetoria faced south-south-east, that is away from the limes but towards Nida. The central structure of the fort was a large principia, a central plaza surrounded by housing or offices for the higher officers, which was flanked by a roofed hall for assemblies of the fort's garrison. The praetentura (front part of the fort) contained the praetorium (the fort commander's residence) to the west of the via praetoria, and a large horreum (<b>grain</b> <b>store)</b> to its east. The rest of the fort's interior, today a park-like area of grass and trees, should be visualised as packed with further buildings: stables, magazines, workshops and, of course, the actual troop quarters, subdivided into contubernia. Two such troop barracks have been reconstructed in the southeast part of the fort. For the general arrangement and terminology of Roman fort architecture, see Castra.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{records of}} a mill at Ebridge date to 1537, {{when it was}} let by the Bishop of Norwich to William Hogan. The present mill was built of red brick with a slate roof, and has five storeys. It was bought by Cubitt and Walker in 1869, and was run by Cubitt and Walker Ltd until 1998. It was powered by an oil engine and by water in 1937. Most of the original machinery was dismantled in 1966, when a new provender mill was built alongside the brick building, and it was powered by electricity in 1968. The waterwheel was removed in 1972. The mill was sold to W L Duffield and Son in 1998, who moved the business to Saxlingham Thorpe, and closed Ebridge Mill. After years of negotiation, work began on converting the mill into homes in January 2015. The end of the mill building, which was covered with asbestos sheets, and the <b>grain</b> <b>store,</b> which {{was added to the}} end of the mill in the 1950s, were demolished. The granary building is being converted into three homes, and the mill building into another three, which will retain many of the original features. The restoration includes refurbishment of the mill race.|$|E

As Sena was engrossed in his prayers to Vithoba, Vithoba went to the palace in the form of Sena to serve the king, and Sena was saved. Another tale deals with a saint, Damaji, the keeper of the royal <b>grain</b> <b>store,</b> who distributed grain to the people in famine. Vithoba came as an outcaste with a bag of gold to pay for the grain. Yet another story narrates how Vithoba resurrected the child of Gora Kumbara (potter), who had been trampled into the clay by Gora while singing the name of Vithoba.|$|E
2500|$|The station {{building}} {{is similar in}} style to that at [...] Access was had through a three-arch portico entrance {{which led to a}} passageway to the up platform, a large parcels office and the booking office. The southern end of the station comprised the stationmaster's quarters and the ladies' waiting room. Twin facing platforms were provided; a general waiting room, storeroom, stationmaster's office and porter's room were located on the up platform. The platforms were initially covered by a roof which was subsequently replaced after the Second World War. A signal box was situated on the up side next to the road crossing to the north-west of the station. Behind the up platform lay a goods yard with a loading dock, goods shed capable to taking 9 wagons which also served as a <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> and a 15-ton crane.

2500|$|Macdonnell’s men next {{made off}} with the colony’s cattle. Colonists Duncan McNaughton, Alexander Mclean and John McLeod, riding near Frog Plain, {{observed}} the stolen cattle. They attempted to drive {{them back to the}} colony and were themselves driven off by several shots from Macdonnel’s men. One John Early’s gun misfired and he apologized stating he surely would have killed McNaughton, as his gun was loaded with two balls. The Métis now took matters into their own hands. Parties of Métis paraded in front of the Red River settlement day and night singing war songs to intimidate the settlers. Some settlers were abducted and their houses were dismantled or burned. Settlers continually deserted, often taking away arms and ammunition belonging to the colony. The Nor’Westers erected another battery with one piece opposite Fort Douglas. A breastwork was thrown up around it partially made from wood taken from dismantled houses. Duncan Cameron dispatched parties of armed men along various roads to capture any wandering settlers. In June, NWC forces attacked the colony no less than 4 times, often firing at the dwelling houses from hidden positions. In every case the colonists returned fire. Four colonists and Baymen were wounded by enemy fire and John Warren was nearly killed when his wall gun bursts. Eventually, the Métis entered the Red River colony and occupied several houses including that of John Pritchard which they set up as their headquarters. Several colonists were evicted and their houses burned. After the last attack on June 11 which lasted half an hour, the colonists met with Governor Macdonell and suggested that he surrender himself to end the violence. On June 15, the Nor’Westers attacked the Red River colony in force, taking a number of prisoners and throwing up a rampart with cannon around the <b>grain</b> <b>store.</b> They also let the colonists horses loose to trample their crops. The next day, the NWC’s Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Frazer arrived from Fort William and wrote to Governor Macdonell that if he surrendered himself the colony would be left in peace.

40|$|AbstractConsidering the {{importance}} of maize starch {{and the lack of}} knowledge about the effects of storage temperature on the isolated starch properties; maize <b>grains</b> were <b>stored</b> during 12 months at different temperatures (5, 15, 25 and 35 °C). The extraction yield and the physicochemical, thermal, pasting, crystallinity and morphological properties of starches were determined. The starch isolated from <b>grains</b> <b>stored</b> at 35 °C was yellowish and showed a 22. 1 % decrease in starch extraction yield compared to freshly harvested maize grains. At 35 °C, a reduction in crystallinity was observed by the end of 12 months, despite a parallel rearrangement of the starch chains which resulted in an increase in X-ray peak intensities, gelatinisation temperatures and enthalpy. The starch isolated from maize <b>grains</b> <b>stored</b> at 35 °C appears to have smaller granules, which presents some points in their surface, potentially attributed to the protein matrix compressing the granules within maize grains...|$|R

60|$|I {{went over}} one great <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> in Chicago possessed by {{gentlemen of the}} name of Sturgess and Buckenham. It was a world in itself, and the dustiest of all the worlds. It contained, when I was there, half a million bushels of wheat--or a very great many, as I might say in other language. But it was not as a {{storehouse}} that this great building was so remarkable, but as a channel or a river- course for the flooding freshets of corn. It is so built that both railway vans and vessels come immediately under its claws, as I may call the great trunks of the elevators. Out of the railway vans the corn and wheat is clawed up into the building, and down similar trunks it is at once again poured out into the vessels. I shall be at Buffalo in a page or two, and then I will endeavor to explain more minutely how this is done. At Chicago the corn is bought and does change hands; and much of it, therefore, is stored there for some space of time, shorter or longer as the case may be. When I was at Chicago, the only limit to the rapidity of its transit was set by the amount of boat accommodation. There were not bottoms enough to take the corn away from Chicago, nor, indeed, on the railway was there a sufficiency of rolling stock or locomotive power to bring it into Chicago. As I said before, the country was bursting with its own produce and smothered in its own fruits.|$|E
