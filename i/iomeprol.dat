The problem was tackled by using an extensive analysis of 13 C NMR data on the solutions of whole molecules and of simple precursors in addition to FT-IR investigation and molecular simulations. This analysis demonstrated that out of the many possible atropisomers, only a few are significantly populated, and their relative population is provided.

Methods: 110 patients were prospectively randomized into two groups. Group A received 125 mL of Iodixanol 320 and group B 100 mL of <b>Iomeprol</b> 400. Attenuation values were measured {{at the level of}} the aorta, portal vein and liver parenchyma on unenhanced, arterial, portal and equilibrium phases. A non inferiority test was performed on the differences between the two groups. An independent reader evaluated image quality. Results: The equivalence of the two CM was demonstrated in all measurements. Higher, but not statistically significant, attenuation values were obtained with <b>Iomeprol</b> 400 in the aorta during the arterial phase (305. 3 HU versus 288. 4 HU; P = 0. 32) and with Iodixanol 320 in the liver parenchyma, during both portal (59. 8 HU versus 65. 5 HU; P = 0. 78) and equilibrium (40. 4 HU versus 41. 8 HU; P = 0. 55) phases. Conclusions: Iodixanol 320 and <b>Iomeprol</b> 400 injected at the same iodine delivery rate (1. 6 gI/s) and total iodine load (40 gI) did not provide statistically significant differences in liver parenchymal and vascular contrast enhancement.

The general rule established in the department for the CA dose to be administered for multiphasic abdominal CT was to use doses proportional to the TBW, multiplying the patient body weight by a constant, which varied from 1.1 to 1.3  mL/kg, with adjustments when the CA dose was considered too high. Radiologists usually adopted their own spontaneous threshold, without any agreement among them.

Here, we report on a patient who developed immune hemolytic anemia (IHA) related to <b>iomeprol,</b> a nonionic CM. Study Design and MethodsA 34 -year-old female patient developed massive hemolysis during infusion of 50 mL of <b>iomeprol.</b> Serologic studies were performed using standard techniques. ResultsBefore hemolysis, the patient's serum was weakly positive with e+ red blood cells (RBCs; autoanti-e) and the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was negative. After hemolysis, the patient's serum samples became significantly reactive with e- RBCs in the presence of <b>iomeprol</b> but not in the presence of two other similar CM. The DAT became strongly positive only with anti-C 3 d. ConclusionInitially, an allergic reaction was suggested, and as the hemolysis became obvious, a toxic hemolysis was suspected. However, serologic reexamination revealed an iomeprol-dependent antibody. IHA related to CM has yet only been described in one patient in 1991. The hemolysis in that patient was related to Isopaque, an older ionic CM.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To date, iodinated {{contrast}} agents (ICA) {{are commonly}} used in medical imaging to improve tumor visualization by attenuating scanners X-rays. However, some adverse reactions to ICAs are still reported, and their molecular origin remains unclear. In 1983, it was proposed to visualize and treat ICA-loaded tumors by using scanners as therapy machines to enhance X-rays absorption at the iodine atoms. Theoretically, such physical conditions are optimized at 50 keV and can be easily obtained with synchrotrons. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Here, we examined the molecular and cellular responses of mammalian endothelial cells to radiation {{in the presence of}} <b>iomeprol,</b> one of the most extensively used ICAs. RESULTS: Irradiation with X-rays at 50 keV in the presence of <b>iomeprol</b> produced a strong radiosensitization effect. The same conclusion was reached with a standard medical irradiator but to a lesser extent. While such treatment did not produce additional DNA double-strand breaks, we observed a dose-dependent production of iodides due to the <b>iomeprol</b> radiolysis that inhibit double-strand break repair rate by decreasing DNA-PK kinase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the concomitant use of ICA and radiation may be toxic when radiation-produced iodide concentrations and double-strand break yields are sufficient.

The {{purpose of}} this article is to compare the {{vascular}} enhancement obtained with a low-kilovoltage pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) protocol in lean patients, using 40 mL of a moderate-concentration isoosmolar (iodixanol, 320 mg I/mL) and a high-concentration low-osmolar (<b>iomeprol,</b> 400 mg I/mL) iodinated contrast medium injected at the same iodine delivery rate. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-two lean patients (31 men and 11 women; body mass index, <= 23 kg/m(2)) with suspected pulmonary embolism and non-small cell lung carcinoma underwent pulmonary CTA with a 64 -MDCT scanner using a tube voltage of 80 kV. Twenty-three patients (54. 8 %) received 40 mL of iodixanol (320 mg I/mL) injected at a rate of 5 mL/s, and the remaining 19 patients (45. 2 %) were administered an equal volume of <b>iomeprol</b> (400 mg I/mL) at a flow rate of 4 mL/s. Intraarterial density was measured in the common pulmonary artery trunk, the main right and left pulmonary arteries, lobar arteries, and at the segmental level, for a total of 15 regions of interest per patient. Intravascular enhancement homogeneity from central to subsegmental level was also assessed visually using a semiquantitative score (1 = poor, 2 = good, and 3 = excellent). RESULTS. The overall vascular density of pulmonary arteries down to the segmental level was significantly higher with iodixanol (320 mg I/mL) than with <b>iomeprol</b> (400 mg I/mL) (p = 0. 036). Enhancement homogeneity was good with both contrast agents, with no statistically significant difference between them (p = 0. 8966). CONCLUSION.

Purpose: To evaluate if any of the measures body height (BH), body mass index (BMI), lean body mass (LBM), ideal body weight (IBW), and body surface area (BSA) correlated better than body weight (BW) with hepatic enhancement, and to compare the enhancement when using iodixanol and <b>iomeprol.</b> Material and Methods: One hundred patients referred for standard three-phase CT examination of abdomen were enrolled. Body weight and height were measured {{at the time of the}} CT examination. Forty grams of iodine (iodixanol 320 mg l/mL or <b>iomeprol</b> 400 mg l/mL) was injected at a rate of 1. 6 g-l/s, followed by a 50 mL saline flush. The late arterial phase was determined by using a semi-automatic smart prep technique with a scan delay of 20 s. The hepatic parenchymal phase started automatically 25 s after the late arterial phase. CM concentration was estimated by placement of regions of interest in aorta (native and late arterial phase) and in liver (native and parenchymal phase). Results: BW (r = - 0. 51 and - 0. 64), LBM (r = - 0. 54 and - 0. 59), and BSA (r = - 0. 54 and - 0. 65) showed the best correlation coefficients with aortic and hepatic parenchymal enhancement, respectively, without any significant differences between the measures. Comparing iodixanol and <b>iomeprol</b> there was no significant difference in aortic enhancement.

BackgroundThere is a continuous debate about the “thrombogenic potential” of nonionic contrast media. The results of both in vitro and in vivo investigations are incongruent. MethodsWe prospectively evaluated the outcomes of 2, 000 patients undergoing {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). According to a randomized, double-blind protocol, they received either <b>iomeprol</b> (nonionic; n = 1, 001) or ioxaglate (ionic; n = 999). Intracoronary thrombus before PTCA was found more often in the <b>iomeprol</b> group (4. 2 % vs 2. 7 %, p = 0. 04). No other significant differences between both groups were observed with regard to pre-PTCA clinical and angiographic characteristics. ResultsThe frequency of reocclusions necessitating repeat angioplasty occurring either in laboratory (2. 9 % with <b>iomeprol</b> and 3. 0 % with ioxaglate) or out of laboratory (3. 1 % vs 4. 1 %) was not significantly different. The rate of major ischemic complications was also comparable after both contrast media (emergency bypass surgery: 0. 8 % vs 0. 7 %, myocardial infarction: 1. 8 vs 2. 0 %, cardiac death during hospital stay: 0. 2 % vs 0. 2 %). In the <b>iomeprol</b> group, more patients had dissections post-PTCA (30. 2 % vs 25. 0 %, p = 0. 01) and more patients received intracoronary stents (31. 6 % vs 25. 7 %, p = 0. 004). Allergic reactions requiring treatment occurred only in the ioxaglate group (0. 0 % vs 0. 9 %, p = 0. 002). ConclusionsThe nonionic contrast medium was not associated with a higher rate of abrupt vessel closure requiring repeat angioplasty, or major ischemic events.

40|$|Radiation {{treatment}} is popular and the apparatus is already available in many hospitals. Conventional radiation treatment {{by itself is}} not sufficient to achieve complete cure. Therefore, radiosensitizers have been developed to enhance the therapeutic effects of the treatment. The concept of radiosensitization with high-Z-elements was first considered many decades ago.

The X-ray apparatus with copper and aluminum filters could be used for the X-ray irradiation, the apparatus is not needed for exclusive use.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} effects on heart rate (HR), on left {{ventricular}} (LV) or arterial pressures, and the general safety of a non-ionic low-osmolar contrast medium (CM) and a non-ionic iso-osmolar CM in patients undergoing cardiac angiography (CA) or peripheral intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two double-blind, randomized studies were conducted in 216 patients who underwent CA (n= 120) or peripheral IA-DSA (n= 96). Patients referred for CA received a low-osmolar monomeric CM (iomeprol- 350, n= 60) or an iso-osmolar dimeric CM (iodixanol- 320; n= 60). HR and LV peak systolic and end-diastolic pressures were determined {{before and after the}} first injection during left and right coronary arteriography and left ventriculography. Monitoring for all types of adverse event (AE) was performed for 24 h following the procedure. t-tests were performed to compare CM for effects on HR. Patients referred for IA-DSA received iomeprol- 300 (n= 49) or iodixanol- 320 (n= 47). HR and arterial blood pressure (BP) were evaluated before and after the first 4 injections. Monitoring for AE was performed for 4 h following the procedure. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare mean HR changes across the first 4 injections, whereas changes after the first injection were compared using t-tests. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between <b>iomeprol</b> and iodixanol in terms of mean changes in HR during left coronary arteriography (p= 0. 8), right coronary arteriography (p= 0. 9), and left ventriculography (p= 0. 8). In patients undergoing IA-DSA, no differences between CM were noted for effects on mean HR after the first injection (p= 0. 6) or across the first 4 injections (p= 0. 2). No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were noted in terms of effects on arterial BP in either study or on LV pressures in patients undergoing CA. Non-serious AE considered possibly CM-related (primarily headache and events affecting the cardiovascular and digestive systems) were reported more frequently by patients undergoing CA and more frequently after iodixanol (14 / 60 [23. 3 %] and 2 / 47 [4. 3 %]; CA and IA-DSA, respectively) than <b>iomeprol</b> (10 / 60 [16. 7 %] and 1 / 49 [2 %], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Iomeprol</b> and iodixanol are safe and have equally negligible effects on HR and LV pressures or arterial BP during and after selective intra-cardiac injection and peripheral IA-DSA. CLINICAL APPLICATION: <b>Iomeprol</b> and iodixanol are safe and equally well tolerated with regard to cardiac rhythm and clinical preference should be based on diagnostic image quality alone...|$|E
40|$|Background/objectives: Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) may be {{a severe}} complication to the administration of iodine-based contrast media for diagnostic or interventional procedure using radiation exposure. Whether {{there is a difference}} in nephrotoxic potential between the various agents is uncertain. We aimed to perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials on iodine-based contrast agents. Methods: Randomized trials of low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast media were searched in CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Scopus. Risk of CIN was appraised within a hierarchical Bayesian model computing absolute rates (AR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % credibility intervals, and probability of being best (Pbest) for each agent. Results: A total of 42 trials (10048 patients) were included focusing on 7 different iodine-based contrast media. Risk of CIN was similarly low with iodixanol (AR = 5. 7 % [2. 2 %- 13. 9 %], Pbest = 18. 8 %), <b>iomeprol</b> (AR = 6. 0 % [2. 2 %- 15. 4 %], Pbest = 24. 8 %), iopamidol (AR = 6. 1 % [2. 2 %- 15. 5 %], Pbest = 21. 5 %), and ioversol (AR = 6. 0 % [2. 1 %- 16. 4 %], Pbest = 31. 3 %). Conversely, CIN was twice as common with iohexol (AR = 11. 2 % [4. 1 %- 29. 5 %], Pbest = 0. 1 %) and ioxaglate (AR = 11. 0 % [4. 0 %- 26. 9 %], Pbest < 0. 1 %), with both proving less safe than iodixanol (respectively OR = 2. 18 [1. 22 - 3. 92] and 2. 05 [1. 26 - 3. 29]), <b>iomeprol</b> (OR = 2. 08 [1. 04 - 4. 17] and 1. 96 [1. 06 - 3. 48]) and iopamidol (OR = 2. 04 [1. 15 - 3. 85] and 1. 92 [1. 06 - 3. 45]). Data on iopromide were less conclusive (AR = 6. 9 % [2. 6 %- 17. 1 %], Pbest = 3. 6 %). Conclusions: Iodixanol, <b>iomeprol,</b> iopamidol and ioversol are iodine-based contrast media with a similar renal safety profile. Iohexol and ioxaglate have a poorer renal safety profile, whereas further data may be required on iopromide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The experienced heat sensation was significantly stronger with LOCM in comparison to IOCM (visual analogue scale = 36 mm and 18 mm respectively, p< 0. 05). In Study II the variation in IV CM-enhancement in Hounsfield units (HU) in the liver and the aorta in relation to different expressions of body size was studied using two different CM (LOCM <b>iomeprol</b> and IOCM iodixanol). A significant relationship was observed for all studied body size parameters. Three parameters had a stronger correlation to the CM-enhancement; Body weight (BW, r= - 0. 51 and - 0. 64), body surface area (BSA, r= - 0. 54 and - 0. 65) and lean body mass (LBM, r= - 0. 54 and - 0. 59), but there was no statistically significant difference between those. Body height (BH), body mass index (BMI) and ideal body weight (IBW) had weaker correlations to CM- enhancement of the liver and the aorta. When adjusting for differences in weight, height, age and sex between the two groups there was a significantly stronger liver enhancement with iodixanol than with <b>iomeprol</b> (mean difference 6 HU, p < 0. 01). In Study III the correlation between liver CM-enhancement and volume pitch-corrected computed tomographic dose index (CTDIvol) and BW was studied. Liver enhancement was negatively correlated to both CTDIvol (r = - 0. 60) and BW (r = - 0. 64). In Study IV the relationship between arm positioning, BW and cardiac output (CO) versus CM-enhancement /timing during CCTA was studied. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group A (n= 50) was positioned with arms resting on a pillow above their head and Group B (n= 50) with their arms resting on the front panel of the CT. Statistically significant more patients in group A compared with group B (26 versus 14) showed a higher attenuation of the left atrium in comparison to the ascending aorta indicating too early scanning after IV CM injection (p=< 0. 05). In both groups BW and CO were statistically significantly related to the attenuation of ascending aorta (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol causes less arrhythmic HB and less heat sensation than the low-osmolar contrast medium <b>iomeprol,</b> but this does not significantly influence the quality at CCTA. The positioning of the arms affects contrast media timing at CCTA. CM-enhancement of the liver and aorta is affected by body size. Several parameters can be used to adjust CM dose, but none is statistically significantly better parameter than BW. However, CTDIvol can potentially replace BW when adjusting CM dose for body size. This would make it potentially feasible to individualize CM dosage automatically by the CT scanner...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of intravenous contrast media (IV CM) {{is essential for}} detecting lesions at most computed tomography (CT) examinations. The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate different aspects of IV CM administration that may {{affect the quality of}} the CT examination. In Study I a comparison was made between a low osmolar contrast media (LOCM) iomperol and the iso osmolar contrast media (IOCM) iodixanol, focusing on how they may affect heart rate, heart rate variability, experienced patient heat sensation and image quality at coronary computed angiography (CCTA) in 100 patients. No significant difference in terms of heart rate interfering with the imaging protocol was observed. However, a greater number of arrhythmic heart beats (hb) was observed with the use of LOCM than with IOCM (P< 0. 001). There was no difference in subjective image quality between the two CM. The experienced heat sensation was stronger when receiving LOCM than when receiving IOCM (visual analogue scale = 36 mm and 18 mm respectively, P< 0. 05). In Study II the enhancement of liver and aorta was related to different measures of body size and to the use of two different CM (LOCM <b>iomeprol</b> and IOCM iodixanol) in 100 patients undergoing thoraco-abdominal CT. Three parameters had a stronger correlation to the CM enhancement in liver and aorta; Body weight (BW, r= - 0. 51 and - 0. 64), body surface area (BSA, r= - 0. 54 and - 0. 65) and lean body mass (LBM, r= - 0. 54 and - 0. 59), but there was no statistically significant difference between those. The parameters body height (BH), body mass index (BMI) and ideal body weight (IBW) had weaker correlations to CM enhancement of liver and aorta. When adjusting for differences in weight, height, age and sex between the two groups there was a stronger liver enhancement after injection of the IOCM iodixanol than after injection of the LOCM iodixanol (mean difference 6 HU, p < 0. 01). Conclusion: The iso osmolar contrast media iodixanol causes less arrhythmic hb and less heat sensation than the low osmolar contrast media <b>iomeprol,</b> but this does not significantly influence the quality at CCTA. The CM enhancement is affected by body size. There is no statistically significant better parameter than BW to adjust for, why this parameter is recommended for dose adjustments. When performing hepatic imaging the IOCM iodixanol might be preferred to the LOCM <b>iomeprol</b> due to a stronger CM enhancement, but confirming studies are required...|$|E
30|$|After the {{acquisition}} of anteroposterior abdominal scout radiographs, the patients underwent multiphasic dual-energy CT scanning comprising early arterial, late arterial and portal venous phase scans. Conventional abdominal CT scanning before the injection of contrast material were obtained in all patients, and additional scanning of the equilibrium phase were performed when clinically indicated. All patients were intravenously injected with 600 mgI/kg of total body iodine load of non-ionic contrast material by means of insertion of a 20 - or 22 -gauge IV catheter into an antecubital vein and a power injector (Dual-Shot Type D; Nemoto Kyorindo, Tokyo, Japan). Two-different injection protocols of contrast material were used: an injection of 300 -mgI/ml concentration contrast material, <b>iomeprol</b> (Iomeron 300; Bracco-Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 30  seconds for Group A, and an injection of 350 -mgI/ml concentration contrast material, <b>iomeprol</b> (Iomeron 350; Bracco-Eisai Co., Ltd.) for 26  seconds for Group B. The volumetric rate of the contrast material per patient body weight was {{the same for the}} two groups (0.067  mL/sec/kg for Group A and Group B). On the other hand, the iodine-dose rate per patient body weight was 20 mgI/sec/kg for Group A and 24 mgI/sec/kg for Group B. Scanning delay after the injection was determined with a semi-automatic computer-assisted bolus tracking program (Smart Prep; GE Healthcare), and early arterial, late arterial, and portal venous phasic CT scanning was started 8, 20 and 50  seconds respectively after the trigger (the threshold level set at an increase of 100 HU over the baseline CT number of the abdominal aorta {{at the level of the}} celiac axis by 140 -kVp CT image on the console).|$|E

30|$|All {{examinations}} {{were performed}} with a 64 -slice CT scanner (Sensation 64, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) as described elsewhere [15]. First a non-contrast-enhanced, prospectively ECG-triggered CT was performed. This CT {{was used to}} calculate the Agatston calcium score (CACS). Afterwards we performed MSCT-CA, after an intravenous injection of a bolus (80 – 100  ml at 4 – 6  ml/s) of non-ionic iodinated contrast agent (<b>iomeprol</b> 400  mg/ml, Iomeron, Bracco, Italy) followed by a saline chaser (50  ml at 4 – 6  ml/s). If the heart rate was > 65  bpm, additional intravenous beta-blockers (atenolol 5 – 10  mg) were provided when tolerated. In 308 patients (75 %) sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3  mg) was also administered immediately before the examination to optimise visualisation of small coronary vessels.|$|E

40|$|Trace organic pollutants, {{also called}} micropollutants, are {{endangering}} {{the quality of}} our drinking water resources. Pharmaceuticals such as painkillers, antibiotics and contraceptives, biocides such as insect repellants or anti-septic agents in toothpaste are just a few examples of the thousands of different substances used in medicine and personal care. Thanks to the advances in analytical technology, it is possible to detect and measure nanogram-per-liter quantities of these organic pollutants. This makes it possible to study their occurrence, effect and mitigation. In the search of mitigation technologies to remove these micropollutants before discharge into the environment, two techniques were investigated in this doctoral thesis. The first technique is an existing wastewater treatment process, nitrification, applied in an unconventional way to remove endocrine disrupting compounds. The second technique is a novel process using biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx), developed for the oxidative removal of pharmaceuticals and biocides. The concept of biogenic metals was explored further by the application of bio-palladium (Bio-Pd) for the dehalogenation of iodinated contrast media used in medical imaging. It was clearly shown that nitrifiers, more specifically ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are able to biologically degrade 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) and the process was engineered in an aerated submerged fixed bed reactor (FBR), at μg L- 1 and sub-μg L- 1 concentrations. An interesting outcome for further implementation of nitrification as a tertiary treatment is the robustness of the nitrifying community. The technological application of BioMnOx in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) showed the removal of more than 60 % of 14 out of 29 micropollutants, detected at ng-μg L- 1 : diclofenac (86 %), triclosan (> 78 %), chlorophene (> 89 %), naproxen (> 95 %), diuron (> 94 %), codeine (> 93 %), dihydrocodeine (41 %), morphine (60 %), mecoprop (> 81 %), N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (92 %), iopromide (68 %), <b>iomeprol</b> (63 %) and iohexol (72 %) and clarithromycin (75 %). Bio-Pd for the catalytic dehalogenation of the iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) <b>iomeprol,</b> iopromide, iohexol and diatrizoate was successfully applied in a Bio-Pd-MBR with in situ H 2 -production to supply the Pd-catalyst with molecular hydrogen. The novel finding here was that in situ H 2 production by anaerobic bacteria was an excellent alternative to supply the Bio-Pd catalyst with molecular hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{standard}} bolus triggering in the pulmonary trunk sometimes {{fails to}} achieve sufficient enhancement in the pulmonary arteries, the study investigates an alternative, 'delayed' {{position of the}} tracking ROI in the descending aorta. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 143 patients suspected of pulmonary embolism investigated with 3 different scanners (16 to 80 rows) in clinical routine. Bolus triggering with 120 hounsfield units (HU) was performed using the pulmonary trunk (n= 70) or descending aorta (n= 73) after application of 70 to 120 mL of contrast agent, <b>Iomeprol</b> 300. Student's t-test was applied to compare vascular enhancement. Additional factors were analysed by a regression analysis. RESULTS: Positioning of the tracking ROI in the descending aorta achieved a significantly higher contrast enhancement in the pulmonary trunk with a mean increase of 63 HU (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In CTA, delayed acquisition by using the descending aorta for bolus triggering can improve the enhancement of the pulmonary trunk to investigate a pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, the scan protocol simultaneously allows to rule out aortic pathologies as an alternative cause for a similar clinical condition...|$|E
