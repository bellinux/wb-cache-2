5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order <b>Falconiformes</b> along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to <b>Falconiformes</b> or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E
5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.

25|$|Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni), {{is a large}} Buteo hawk of the <b>Falconiformes,</b> {{sometimes}} {{separated in}} the Accipitriformes like its relatives. This species was named after William Swainson, a British naturalist. It is colloquially known as the grasshopper hawk or locust hawk, as it is very fond of Acrididae (locusts and grasshoppers) and will voraciously eat these insects whenever they are available.|$|E
25|$|There are 2 {{subspecies}} of {{the black}} sparrowhawks: Accipiter melanoleucus melanoleucus, which was named by A. Smith in 1830, and Accipiter melanoleucus temminckii, which was named by Hartlaub in 1855. As described in the next section, the 2 subspecies occur in different regions of Africa and both belong to the genus Accipiter in the family Accipitridae along with other well-known members such as hawks and eagles, {{all of which are}} part of the <b>Falconiformes</b> order.|$|E
25|$|John Ruben {{and others}} have argued that no {{evidence}} of nasal turbinates {{has been found in}} dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that were too narrow and short to accommodate nasal turbinates, so dinosaurs could not have sustained the breathing rate required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out. However, objections have been raised against this argument. Nasal turbinates are absent or very small in some birds (e.g. ratites, Procellariiformes and <b>Falconiformes)</b> and mammals (e.g. whales, anteaters, bats, elephants, and most primates), although these animals are fully endothermic and in some cases very active. Other studies conclude that nasal turbinates are fragile and seldom found in fossils. In particular none have been found in fossil birds.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between this tree and previous classifications is the separation between accipitrifomes and <b>falconiformes,</b> since, traditionally, <b>falconiformes</b> used to include al the species of these two groups.|$|E
50|$|Falconimorphae is a {{superorder}} with Raptores as {{a parent}} and which is composed of the orders <b>Falconiformes</b> and Strigiformes. However, more recent research made this clade invalid. <b>Falconiformes</b> is now placed in Eufalconimorphae, while Strigiformes is placed in Afroaves.|$|E
50|$|Masillaraptor is an extinct genus of basal falconiform {{from the}} Middle Eocene, a long-legged {{relative}} of the living falcons. Classifying the <b>Falconiformes</b> is confusing, since Europe has placed the families into two orders (for more information see the <b>Falconiformes</b> page).|$|E
50|$|These {{families}} were traditionally grouped {{together in a}} single order <b>Falconiformes</b> but are now split into two orders, the <b>Falconiformes</b> and Accipitriformes. The Cathartidae are sometimes placed separately in an enlarged stork family, Ciconiiformes, and may be raised to an order of their own, Cathartiiformes.|$|E

50|$|In {{agreement}} with the split of <b>Falconiformes</b> and Accipitriformes, comparative genome analysis published in 2008 suggested that falcons are {{more closely related to}} the parrots and passerines than to other birds including the Accipitridae, so that the traditional <b>Falconiformes</b> are paraphyletic even if the Cathartidae are excluded. Indeed, a 2011 analysis of transposable element insertions shared between the genomes of falcons, passerines, and parrots, but not present in the genomes of other birds, confirmed that falcons are a sister group of the combined parrot/passerine group, together forming the clade Eufalconimorphae.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the raptors {{were grouped}} into four {{families}} in the single order <b>Falconiformes,</b> but many thought this group to be paraphyletic and not to share a common ancestor {{to the exclusion of}} all other birds.|$|E

50|$|The typical falconets, Microhierax, are a genus of {{bird of prey}} in the Falconidae family. They {{are found}} in {{southeast}} Asia and the smallest members of <b>Falconiformes,</b> averaging about 15 cm in length and 35 g in weight. The smallest members of the genus are the relatively widespread black-thighed falconet, and the white-fronted falconet {{on the island of}} Borneo.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the genus}} {{there are at}} least 173 species, 5 {{varieties}} and 1 subspecies. Of these over 140 occur in birds, 16 in reptiles and 3 in amphibia: 14 orders and 50 families of birds are represented. These include gamebirds (Galliformes), waterfowl (Anseriformes), raptors (Accipitriformes, <b>Falconiformes,</b> Strigiformes), pigeons and doves (Columbiformes), and perching birds or songbirds (Passeriformes).|$|E

50|$|In Europe, it {{has become}} common to split the {{remaining}} raptors into two: the falcons and caracaras remain in the order <b>Falconiformes</b> (about 60 species in 4 groups), and the remaining 220-odd species (including the Accipitridae eagles, hawks, Old World vultures, etc.) are put in the separate order Accipitriformes.

50|$|The osprey differs {{in several}} respects from other diurnal birds of prey. Its toes are of equal length, its tarsi are reticulate, and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The osprey and owls {{are the only}} raptors whose outer toe is reversible, {{allowing}} them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish. It has always presented something of a riddle to taxonomists, but here it is treated as the sole living {{member of the family}} Pandionidae, and the family listed in its traditional place as part of the order <b>Falconiformes.</b> Other schemes place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae—which itself can be regarded as making up the bulk of the order Accipitriformes or else be lumped with the Falconidae into <b>Falconiformes.</b> The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy has placed it together with the other diurnal raptors in a greatly enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this results in an unnatural paraphyletic classification.|$|E
