2500|$|In {{his papers}} of 1935, Istrati {{presents}} himself exclusively {{as an enemy}} of [...] "the Jewish bourgeoisie", a class he describes as [...] "corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic" [...] and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in Cruciada Românismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, [...] "A Letter to Love", led {{to a series of}} articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: [...] "Panait Istrati, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, {{for as long as the}} Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets". Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.|$|E
