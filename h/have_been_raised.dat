5|$|The Court of Appeal's {{decision}} and the {{amendments to the}} Constitution and the ISA which followed have sparked much academic discourse. The following issues <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Antlers {{are also}} used in artwork, {{furniture}} and other novelty items. All Asian subspecies, along with other deer, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> for their antlers {{in central and eastern}} Asia by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. Elk farms are relatively common in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} entertainment, raptors {{have been used}} in falconry, while cagebirds have been kept for their song. Other birds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> for the {{traditional}} sports of cockfighting and pigeon racing. Birdwatching, too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for bullets since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. Concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment.|$|E
5|$|Policies to {{streamline}} the approval process for wind farm developments have met with some community opposition. Specific concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> by rural residents who claim that wind farms have an unacceptable impact on property values, health and the environment.|$|E
5|$|Stossel came {{to embrace}} his Jewish {{heritage}} after marrying his wife, who is Jewish, {{and their children}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> in that tradition. Stossel identified himself as an agnostic in the December 16, 2010, episode of Stossel, explaining {{that he had no}} belief in God but was open to the possibility.|$|E

5|$|Children {{were also}} {{affected}} through {{the loss of}} parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death {{of one of the}} at least ten orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen years later, {{after his}} wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the Indies. He has been hired as a {{supervisor}} at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays {{at home with their}} mother.|$|E
5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> to patrician rank {{if he had not}} steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, {{allowing}} him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular curule chair, held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from his share of the war booty.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue that}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>is</b> {{drunkenness}} and alcohol-fuelled violence amongst those attending.|$|R

5|$|Pale {{crag martin}} pairs often nest alone, {{especially}} in the Sahara, although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form. This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions, but in northwest Africa February to April is normal, and in Asia nesting is from April to June. Two broods are common, and three <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> in a season.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the main}} reasons that girls are less likely to reach optimal levels of {{education}} include the fact that girls are needed to assist their mothers at home, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> to believe that a life of domestic work is their destined occupation, have illiterate mothers who cannot educate their children, have an economic dependency on men, and are sometimes subject to child-marriage. Many poor families marry their daughters off early to get the dowry money so she is unable to complete her education.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographics}} of the Supreme Court of the United States encompass the gender, ethnicity, and religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the 113 {{people who have been}} appointed and confirmed as justices to the Supreme Court. Some of these characteristics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> as an issue since the Court was established in 1789. For its first 180 years, justices were almost always white male Protestants.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective circumcision of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision of all males or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons the procedure is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Two monuments <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{in honour of}} Harald in Oslo, {{the city}} which he is {{traditionally}} held to have founded. A bronze relief on granite by Lars Utne depicting Harald on horseback was raised on the eponymously named square Harald Hardrådes plass in 1905. In 1950, a large relief by Anne Grimdalen, also of Harald on horseback, was unveiled on the western façade of the Oslo City Hall.|$|E

5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the impactor {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature {{as the source of}} the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–Pg impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons to increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
