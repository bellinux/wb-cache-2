Our test for selection effects builds on the approach of previous U. S. studies and potentially allows the identification of selection effects to help improve inferences from decided cases. Finally, we examine patterns of settlement and plaintiff wins in pre-litigation administrative appeals in China, and do not find sufficient evidence for selection effects in this process.

Results show that probation as well as restorative justice practices reduce the transition from juvenile delinquency to adult offending. Moreover probation, paradoxically, gives better results when young offenders were perpetrators of serious crimes. This seems to happen both because serious crimes are often the first and only crime committed by young offenders and because of the emphasis of probation process on personal responsibility rather than punishment. The European Union Council request to member States to introduce restorative justice practices, is in Italy actually fulfilled only in the juvenile criminal justice system by means of probation.

40|$|According to {{the scales}} of justice, the judge, in an {{unbiased}} way and directed by law, attends {{to all of the}} available information in a case, weighs it according to its significance, and integrates it to make a decision. By contrast, research suggests that judicial decision-making departs from the cognitive balancing act depicted by {{the scales of}} justice. Nevertheless, the research is often dismissed as irrelevant, and the judiciary, legal policy-makers and the public remain largely unconvinced that the status quo needs improving. One potential rebuttal to the scientific findings is that they lack validity because researchers did not study judges making decisions on real cases. Another potential argument is that researchers have not pinpointed the psychological processes of any specific judge because they analyzed data over judges and/or used statistical models lacking in psychological plausibility.
