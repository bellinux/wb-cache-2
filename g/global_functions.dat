Left ventricular <b>global</b> <b>function</b> differed significantly between the three groups, however, suggesting impaired left ventricular <b>global</b> <b>function</b> {{even in the absence}} of left ventricular hypertrophy. Similar changes were observed in the ratio of peak velocity of atrial systole to peak velocity of early diastole during left ventricular inflow waveform (A/E), indicating that this disorder mainly reflects impaired left ventricular diastolic function. Unlike A/E, the Tei index is not affected by increasing age, and, therefore, is appropriate for evaluating left ventricular <b>global</b> <b>function</b> in hypertensive patients, most of whom are middle-aged or older.

5000|$|Mayberry’s fourth core {{doctrine}} {{is connected with}} his third. He affirms that in dealing with units and arithmoi - i.e. with things - we can unproblematically use classical logic, whereas in dealing with thoughts - such as species, <b>global</b> <b>functions,</b> general constructions properties etc. - the appropriate logic is intuitionistic. In particular if {{we know that the}} assumption [...] "All members of the arithmos a possess the property P" [...] implies an absurdity, then we can legitimately infer [...] "there exists some member of a, x, for which P(x) does not hold". However, if we make a statement using a quantifier over a species e.g. [...] "there exists some thing possessing P" [...] or [...] "P holds of all things" [...] we are no longer reporting an objective fact that must be either the case or not the case. The affirmer of such a statement has to be understood as making a claim that he has in mind a justification of it - i.e. {{in the case of a}} universal quantifier, grounds for believing that given any conceivable thing P holds of it, or in the case of an existential quantifier, he knows of an instance of the species for which P holds. Since statements incorporating unrestricted quantifiers must be understood subjectively, it is clear that Excluded Middle principle is then simply not valid. For instance if the meaning of “For all things P holds" [...] is “I have in mind a general construction to produce for each thing an argument that P holds of that thing" [...] and the meaning of [...] "there exist a thing for which P does not hold" [...] is [...] "I have in mind a construction to produce a thing for which P fails to hold.” then I cannot necessarily assert that the disjunction is true as I may, for instance, have no constructions at all in mind.
