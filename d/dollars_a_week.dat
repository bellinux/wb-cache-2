5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn had heard of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|Law {{originally}} {{found a job}} as {{a traveling}} carpet salesman. He continued until he discovered that his employer was misrepresenting domestic rugs as being imported and was also charging premium prices. His next employer, an outfitter of steamships and hotels, went out of business in the 1860s, when the American Civil War affected the business. Law struggled through unemployment, and even while working, pay was low. At one point, Law was employed at a store and was making eight <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{also found}} {{work in a}} variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood {{survivor}} in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, he began {{to attract the attention of}} major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't you s'pose I know that? But he was gettin' <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> clean money, an' it counted up in time. If {{things had}} been the other way, most likely I'd own the place to-day." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1940, aged 62, he {{was again}} uprooted by the German {{invasion}} of France, and spent {{weeks in a}} refugee camp in Mende. During this time he began attending mass at the cathedral in Mende, a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year. On 3 September 1940 Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the Nea Hellas in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for 100 <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 30, 1935, James Charles Taylor had two paper {{routes to}} help his widowed mother make ends meet. He {{delivered}} the morning and afternoon routes by bicycle for three <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> which helped to develop his leg muscles. Though he did not play football until his junior year, he was a star athlete in four sports at Baton Rouge High School, and graduated in 1954. He stayed in town and played college football at Louisiana State University for coach Paul Dietzel's LSU Tigers football team. Taylor played on LSU's freshman team in 1954, but due to struggles in the classroom, he transferred to Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi as a sophomore, where he met his future wife Dixie Grant. He then returned to LSU as a junior.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Helena {{made plans}} to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer {{to pay for the}} trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman {{threatened}} to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants. They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a seamstress, sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.|$|E
6000|$|... "But then I {{think that}} I can lay up half <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> {{of my own}} earnings, {{especially}} when Bella gets a little bigger so as to help me about the house," [...] said Mary Erskine.|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt kind of 'fraid you was swellin' too big, Joe. When a feller {{agrees to}} give five <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> month rent, an' hires a clerk for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> same's you did, he's takin' {{a pretty good}} {{contract}} on his shoulders.

6000|$|... "Crooked? Why, {{how could}} I? He'd been workin' {{for me at}} <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> an' when I hadn't any more money, he took the stand for what I owed him. If you call it crooked to sell out a {{business}} for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> an' twenty cents, when it cost pretty nigh eight times as much, you're off your base." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1939 Parker {{moved to}} New York City, {{to pursue a}} career in music. He held several other jobs as well. He worked for nine <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> as a {{dishwasher}} at Jimmie's Chicken Shack, where pianist Art Tatum performed.|$|E
25|$|After {{five months}} of work he found himself earning about 500 <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and quickly {{developing}} a fan base but, having reached one goal, financial, {{it was time to}} aim for the next one, creative, which for McMahon meant the recording of an album which he felt could only be done in Australia, the source of his musical inspiration.|$|E
25|$|She {{attended}} the University of Chicago, and later returned to Los Angeles. She came {{to love the}} subtle comedy of black theater and vaudeville entertainer and singer Bert Williams. Brooks began playing piano professionally in the early 1940s at a tap-dance studio owned by Hollywood choreographer and dancer Willie Covan. For ten <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> she played the popular tunes of the day while Covan worked with such stars as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, and Shirley Temple.|$|E
6000|$|... "No one; I {{take care}} of myself. I work for Madame, and she pays me <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> I stay with Mrs. Brown, and chore round to pay for my keep. My dollar don't get many clothes, so I can't be as neat as I'd like." [...] And the forlorn look came back to poor Lizzie's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "On Mulberry Street, jest off er Grand. You see, some feller {{built it}} against the corner store, an' 'greed to pay <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for the trouble of havin' it there. He couldn't raise the rent, an' after he'd stayed three months, the shopkeeper took it. Now, I {{happened}} to see the place, an' went in an' talked with the man. He said it cost twenty dollars, an' he'd sell it for ten if we'd 'gree to pay <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> every <b>week</b> for rent, an' fifty cents a day on what we owe him." ...|$|R
25|$|His {{father was}} a teamster, and {{struggled}} to earn enough money to support the family. In the winter, he ploughed the snow off outdoor skating rinks to earn additional money. Conacher left school after the eighth grade {{to go to work}} and help support his siblings. For ten hours a day, he hauled sod, earning <b>an</b> extra <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for his family.|$|R
25|$|In November 1935, when {{he learned}} that Walt Disney was seeking more artists for his studio, Barks decided to apply. He was {{approved}} for a try-out which entailed a move to Los Angeles, California. He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired. His starting salary was 20 <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> He started at Disney Studios in 1935, {{more than a year after}} the debut of Donald Duck on June 9, 1934 in the short animated film The Wise Little Hen.|$|E
25|$|The {{goodness}} of random strangers helped {{to keep up}} the canteen. Donations include a coffee importer who sent a twenty five pound can of coffee, a woman who consumed food and later sent a check for two hundred dollars, and others. Even a fall scrap drive donated two thirds of its income to the canteen. Even the priest of the local Roman Catholic church, after donating twelve turkeys and hearing that they were consumed, personally transported his turkey over to the canteen. Expenses for the canteen averaged about two hundred and twenty five <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
25|$|The band then {{signed to}} Warner Bros. Records in the United States. Internationally the two EPs were repackaged {{as a single}} album titled Remote Luxury. Its U.S. release was their first record there since the debut album – {{although}} The Blurred Crusade and Seance had sold well on import. Due to the interest raised in the U.S., they left Michael Chugg Management in Sydney and signed with Malibu Management's owner John Lee. They toured the USA in October and November and while venues in New York and Los Angeles saw audiences of about 1000 people, other gigs had as few as 50. In financial terms the tour went poorly and the band lost thousands of <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Toby now grew angry, and, {{not realizing}} how wholly {{he was in}} the man's power, he retorted: [...] "If you think I'm going round with a dirty face, even if it is speckled, for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> you're mistaken, that's all. How many folks would eat your candy if they knew you handled it over before you washed your hands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{his next}} visit {{the doctor told}} Lucy that he had {{arranged}} the matter with her landlady, {{and that she was}} to pay <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> as rent.

5000|$|In 1913, the {{neighborhood}} was subdivided, with lots offered for sale that same year (see advertisement). The sellers/developers were listed as [...] "John Carey and his son Hon. Dan Carey, Park Commissioner". The 1913 advertisement offers the first fifty lots for sale for $200.00 each. The terms for these first fifty lots was advertised as being $1.00 down, [...] "and one <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> until paid for, without interest or taxes." ...|$|R
25|$|After 1996, 13% of the Iraqi oil {{sales were}} {{allocated}} for Iraqi Kurdistan and {{this led to}} a relative prosperity in the region. Saddam had established an oil smuggling route through territory controlled by the KDP, with the active involvement of senior Barzani family members. The taxation of this trade at the crossing point between Saddam’s territory and Kurdish controlled territory and then into Turkey, along with associated service revenue, meant that whoever controlled Dohuk and Zakho had the potential to earn several million <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Direct United States mediation led the two parties to a formal ceasefire in what was termed the Washington Agreement in September 1998. It is also argued that the Oil-for-Food Programme from 1997 onward had an important effect on cessation of hostilities.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Johnson {{began working}} as a laborer in a Lawton {{cabinet-making}} shop, working 8 or more hours daily after school to earn four <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> At 12, he began applying his earnings to flying lessons, soloing after 5 hours and 45 minutes of instruction. He achieved his student license and logged 35 hours in four years of instruction, before suspending his flying lessons because of a newfound interest in girls. While attending Cameron Junior College, Johnson resumed flying in the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPT), and accumulated 100 hours total flight time by his second year. Johnson gave up his full-time job to allow for his varied interests, but continued to hold a series of part-time jobs, including as a firefighter with the Lawton Fire Department.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1940 Popular doubled Pohl's {{salary to}} twenty dollars per week. [...] In June 1941 Pohl visited Steeger {{to ask for a}} further raise, {{intending}} to resign and work as a free-lance writer if he was unsuccessful. [...] Steeger was unreceptive, and Pohl commented later [...] "I have never been sure whether I quit or got fired". [...] Instead of replacing Pohl, Popular assigned editor-in-chief Alden H. Norton to add the magazines to his responsibilities. The arrangement lasted for seven months, after which Norton asked Pohl to return as his assistant. [...] Norton offered Pohl thirty-five <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> as an associate editor, substantially more than the twenty <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> he had received as editor, and Pohl readily accepted.|$|E

Eliza Grant's mother, Tempie Curtis, {{was one of}} eleven {{children}} all born to slave Liza Cook and her Master Dr. Cook. After General Lee's surrender. Grant's mother became a midwife making thirty <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> month plus board, while washing and cleaning for one <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> as <b>a</b> side job.

6000|$|Miss Nellie Mason Auten, a {{graduate}} student {{of the department of}} sociology at the University of Chicago, recently made a thorough investigation of the garment trades of Chicago. Her figures were published in the American Journal of Sociology, and commented upon by the Literary Digest. She found women working ten hours a day, six days <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> for forty cents per <b>week</b> (<b>a</b> rate of two-thirds of a cent an hour). Many women earned less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and none of them worked every week. The following table will best summarize Miss Auten's investigations among a portion of the garment-workers: ...|$|R
500|$|From 1909 to 1912, Kilmer was {{employed}} by Funk and Wagnalls, which was preparing an edition of The Standard Dictionary {{that would be}} published in 1912. According to Hillis, Kilmer's job [...] "was to define ordinary words assigned to him at five cents for each word defined. This was a job at which one would ordinarily earn ten to twelve <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> but Kilmer attacked the task with such vigor and speed that it was soon thought wisest {{to put him on}} a regular salary." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1916 Lewis {{left school}} {{to take a}} job at a {{locomotive}} factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was [...] "built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents." [...] While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time, his large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, flat face are now recognized as hallmarks of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.|$|E
500|$|On September 29, 1841, the [...] "Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education" [...] was organized. The {{school was}} the most {{immediate}} (and at times the only) {{source of income for}} Brook Farm and attracted students as far away as Cuba and the Philippines. Children under twelve were charged three-and-a-half dollars per week and, at first, boys over twelve were charged four <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and girls were charged five; by August 1842, the rates were made identical, regardless of gender. Adult education was also available in the evenings. The schedule for adults included courses on moral philosophy, German language, and modern European history.|$|E
60|$|These men, the {{discouraged}} worker and the discouraged criminal, voluntarily withdraw {{themselves from the}} struggle for work. Industry does not need them. There are no factories shut down through lack of labor, no projected railroads unbuilt for want of pick-and-shovel men. Women are still glad to toil for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and men and boys to clamor and fight for work at the factory gates. No one misses these discouraged men, and in going away they have made it somewhat easier for those that remain.|$|R
25|$|In Pennsylvania, Rogers was {{introduced}} to Charles Pratt (1830–91). Born in Watertown, Massachusetts, Pratt {{had been one of}} eleven children. His father, Asa Pratt, was a carpenter. Of modest means, he spent three winters as a student at Wesleyan Academy, and is said to have lived on <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> at times. In nearby Boston, Massachusetts, Pratt joined a company specializing in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, he came to New York City, where he worked for a similar company handling paint and oil.|$|R
50|$|The Duke of Kent {{during his}} brief period as a {{resident}} Governor of Gibraltar recommended that schools {{be set up}} for the regiments. These were reorganised in 1916 by General Don into a school at Buena Vista and another on Castle Street, Gibraltar. The priority given to the schools however can be judged by their closure in 1828 when the Barrack Master was demanding the premises. This was unfortunate as examinations were in progress and the schools were open to better off civilians who could afford the <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> charges. Of the 180 children available, 70 had been attending.|$|R
