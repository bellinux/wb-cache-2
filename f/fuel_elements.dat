5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> and their {{resulting}} explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} development of nuclear reactors depends upon the integrated progress {{in the fields of}} reactor design, <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> design, reactor operation, and fuel production and separation. Broad criteria, which restrict the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> design, are determined by the mutual consideration of the problems encountered in all the above fields. Hence, no stage of reactor design or operation is independent of the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> problem, nor can the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> designer disregard the interest of any one field. As an introduction to the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> design problem, this chapter describes how the general criteria for a <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> are determined...|$|R
40|$|Irradiations {{are planned}} in the He-Loop-Mol in the BR- 2 reactor at Mol/Belgium for vented <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> bundles of {{stainless}} steel cannings and oxide fuel material for a gas-cooled fast breeder (GCFR) - at first in form of a short-time test and a long-time test. It is the aim of these tests to study the irradiation behaviour of <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> bundles, and the operation behaviour of <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> venting. Thereby should be ascertained the applicability of that reactor concept. The aim of that <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> irradiation is explained and discussed in detail.

40|$|In the thermo-elastic stress {{analysis}} of a spherically symmetric <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> as used in a pebble bed reactor the problems of a radial variation in material properties and the temperature dependence of these properties can be unified into a single analysis. Such an analysis is developed for incorporation in a computer programme and applied, as an example, to a <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> for a beryllia moderated reactor. The results give the effect of different material properties between surface and centre, a buffer layer between surface coating and centre, an increase in temperature of a <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> composed of materials with different properties, and temperature dependance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> materials...|$|R

Remote TV camera inspections revealed that twelve of the elements had fallen just over 80ft (24.4m) down the discharge well into a water filled transport flask at the bottom. The NII initiated an investigation because dropping irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> is a serious issue even when, as in this event, BNFL had advised NII that there had been no release of radiological activity.|$|E

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} about uranium carbide {{is in the form of}} pin-type <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> for liquid metal fast {{reactors}} during their intense study during the 1960s and 1970s. However, recently there has been a revived interest in uranium carbide in the form of plate fuel and most notably, micro fuel particles (such as TRISO particles).|$|E
40|$|A {{parameter}} {{survey was}} conducted on the Organic Moderated Reactor (OMR) to determine the nuclear effect of temperature, enrichment, fuel to moderator volume ratio, <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> size, ard <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> container variation. Temperatures ranged from 300 to 700 deg F; enrichments from 1. 5 to 1. 9 %; and fuel to moderator volume ratios from 0. 1333 to 0. 545. <b>Fuel</b> <b>element</b> sizes of 3. 75, 4. 5, and 5. 5 in. were considered. The stainless steel <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> container thickness was varied from 20 to 80 mils, and also 200 mil aluminum was substituted for the steel. Results were obtained as values of k/sub eff/ which ranged from 0. 927 to 1. 152 through 150 problems. It was concluded that <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> size should be at least 4. 1 inches, fuel to moderator volume ratio in the neighborhood of 0. 30, and enrichment 1. 7 % assuming 8 % excess k for poisoning, burnup, and control.

Indeed, the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> emits alpha, beta and gamma rays, that why, measurement are done in hot laboratory in order to guarantee safe conditions for users. The first approach is to {{explore the influence of}} a wide range of variables on the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> during irradiation. The currently methods used, are visual inspection, dimensional measurement, eddy current testing, x radiography and gamma scanning. With these methods, it is possible to obtain large amounts of quantitative and qualitative information about the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> behaviour during irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Current {{information}} {{relative to}} the pyrophoricity of uranium is reviewed and aspects of this troublesome phenomenon which can support further investigation are considered. Information on metallic uranium <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> fires, up to the present, provide an inadequate base for extrapolation to future operations because of existing uncertainty with respect to causative mechanisms and fire control techniques. Experience at Hanford reactors indicates conditions which tend to reduce the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> fire hazard. These include minimizing of the in-core residence time of a <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> with a cladding defect which permits uranium corrosion, employment of removal and discharge techniques which do {{not contribute to the}} deterioration of the <b>fuel</b> <b>element,</b> and minimizing of the time interval between discharge and entry into the retention basin.

25|$|Production of high purity {{austenitic}} stainless steel. High purity {{austenitic stainless}} steel was of interest as a potential cladding material for nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b> Fulmer produced high purity chromium by electro-deposition from a fluoride bath. Zone refining using induction heating was used to produce high-purity iron and nickel and to remove oxygen from chromium. Impurity levels of 1-40 parts per million were achieved.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide (UO2) {{concentrate}} from mining is {{a thousand}} or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellowcake (U3O8), then converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment {{to increase the}} U-235 content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
25|$|Not all {{reactors}} {{need to be}} {{shut down}} for refueling; for example, pebble bed reactors, RBMK reactors, molten salt reactors, Magnox, AGR and CANDU reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.|$|E
25|$|During {{refuelling}} {{operations on}} Reactor 2, an irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> failed to {{release from the}} grab (this is used to hold an element while it is withdrawn from a reactor). Routine methods were used to release the grab. However, the irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>element.</b> Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose they received was small.|$|R
40|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> {{hold-down}} device, {{which is}} an integral part of the <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> assembly, was developed to lock reactor fuel to the bottom grid plate.

25|$|Removal of fission {{products}} {{is similar to}} reprocessing of solid <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> - by chemical or physical means the highly valuable fissile fuel is separated from the waste {{fission products}}. Ideally the fertile fuel (thorium or U-238) and other fuel components (e.g. carrier salt or fuel cladding in solid fuels) can also be reused for new fuel. However, for economic reasons they may also {{end up in the}} waste.|$|E
25|$|Fuel in {{a single}} channel in Reactor 2 that was loaded with <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> under {{evaluation}} for the commercial reactor programme experienced a partial blockage, attributed {{to the presence of}} graphite debris (see fuel element failure). The fuel overheated and the Magnox cladding failed, causing contamination to be deposited in one region of the core. The reactor was restarted in 1969 after successful clean-out operations and was the final reactor to cease operation in February 2004.|$|E
25|$|RBMK reactor fuel {{was used}} in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a low-enriched uranium oxide fuel. The <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit {{back-to-back}} on each fuel channel, pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for control rod modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E

25|$|Another huge {{advantage}} of the liquid core {{is its ability to}} release xenon gas which normally acts as a neutron absorber and causes structural occlusions in solid <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> (leading to early replacement of solid fuel rods with over 98% of the nuclear fuel unburned, including many long lived actinides). In contrast Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) are capable of retaining the fuel mixture for significantly extended periods, which not only increases fuel efficiency dramatically, but also incinerates the vast majority of its own waste as part of the normal operational characteristics.|$|E
25|$|TRISO fuel {{particles}} {{were originally}} {{developed in the}} United Kingdom {{as part of the}} Dragon reactor project. The inclusion of the SiC as diffusion barrier was first suggested by D. T. Livey. The first nuclear reactor to use TRISO fuels was the Dragon reactor and the first powerplant was the THTR-300. Currently, TRISO fuel compacts are being used in the experimental reactors, the HTR-10 in China, and the HTTR in Japan. Spherical <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> utilizing a TRISO particle with a UO2 and UC solid solution kernel are being used in the Xe-100 in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Rising heat {{within the}} {{containment}} area led to increasing pressure. Electricity {{was needed for}} both the cooling water pumps and ventilation fans used to drive gases through heat exchangers within the containment. Releasing gases from the reactor is necessary if pressure becomes too high and has the benefit of cooling the reactor as water boils off, but this also means cooling water is being lost, and must be replaced if the water level is not to fall too low. If there is no damage to the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> water and water vapor from inside the reactor should be only slightly radioactive.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and kinetics of uranium corrosion and <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> ruptures were investigated {{in water and}} steam at 170 to 500 deg C and at 100 to 2800 psig. The <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> samples were coextruded Zircaloy-clad uranium-core rods and tubes which were defected prior to exposure. Uranium corrosion {{was found to be}} the sum of two processes; direct oxidation by water, and oxidation of uranium hydride intermediate. <b>Fuel</b> <b>element</b> ruptures occur in two stages; an initial induction period followed by an accelerating corrosion of the core causing the cladding to blister, swell, and fracture. Uranium corrosion and <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> ruptures were examined with respect to temperature, pressure, steam versus liquid water, heat treatment, carbon content of uranium, zirconium content of uranium, cladding thickness, fuel geometry, annular spacings, defect geometry and size, coolant flow, hydriding of Zircaloy components, and irradiation effects.

5000|$|On July 29, 1959, {{an ad hoc}} investigative {{committee}} was established to study the incident and make recommendations.

The article stated, “…a parted <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> was observed” and “The <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> damage is not an indication of unsafe reactor conditions. No release of radioactive materials to the plant or its environs occurred”. The investigative committee released “SRE <b>Fuel</b> <b>Element</b> Damage, An Interim Report” on November 15, 1959; the final report was made in 1961. The introductory material in both documents includes the statement, ”This report has been distributed according to the category ‘Reactors-Power’ as given in Standard Distribution Lists for Unclassified Scientific and Technical Reports”, also noting that a total of 700 copies were printed.

25|$|Uranium {{and some}} other {{elements}} can {{be removed from the}} salt by a process called fluorine volatility: A sparge of fluorine removes volatile high-valence fluorides as a gas. This is mainly uranium hexafluoride, containing the uranium-233 fuel, but also neptunium hexafluoride, technetium hexafluoride and selenium hexafluoride, as well as fluorides of some other fission products (e.g. iodine, molybdenum and tellurium). The volatile fluorides can be further separated by adsorption and distillation. Handling uranium hexafluoride is well established in enrichment. The higher valence fluorides are quite corrosive at high temperatures and require more resistant materials than Hastelloy. One suggestion in the MSBR program at ORNL was using solidified salt as a protective layer. At the MSRE reactor fluorine volatility was used to remove uranium from the fuel salt. Also for use with solid <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> fluorine volatility is quite well developed and tested.|$|E
25|$|CANDU fuel bundles {{are about}} a half meter long and 10cm in diameter. They consist of {{sintered}} (UO2) pellets in zirconium alloy tubes, welded to zirconium alloy end plates. Each bundle is roughly 20kg, and a typical core loading is {{on the order of}} 4500-6500 bundles, depending on the design. Modern types typically have 37 identical fuel pins radially arranged about the long axis of the bundle, but in the past several different configurations and numbers of pins have been used. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> with two element sizes. It is also about 10cm (4inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20in) long and weighs about 20kg (44lb) and replaces the 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. Current CANDU designs do not need enriched uranium to achieve criticality (due to their more efficient heavy water moderator), however, some newer concepts call for low enrichment to help reduce the size of the reactors.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid {{is used in}} some {{nuclear power}} plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the {{probability}} of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. Boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control. BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an emergency shut down system. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b> The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.|$|E
