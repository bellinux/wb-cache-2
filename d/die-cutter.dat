25|$|The 9th century saw {{the spread}} of minting beyond the south-east, which had {{dominated}} production outside Northumbria {{since the end of}} the sceattas. The West Saxon mint initiated by Beorhtric continued to operate at a relatively low level under Egbert but remained very sporadic in operation between his death and Alfred’s reign later in the 9th century. In East Anglia, coinage gradually became more substantial under the last Mercian rulers and, from c. 825, under a series of independent rulers: Æthelstan, Æthelweard and (St) Edmund. These kings mainly issued non-portrait pennies bearing a large central A, and other designs which were often particular to individual moneyers, though produced by a common <b>die-cutter.</b> When first adopted under Coenwulf, this central A probably represented part of an Alpha-Omega pair, but in East Anglia more likely signified Angli or (rex) Anglorum.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} of Beorhtwulf's coins {{were issued}} in 841–842, {{and can be}} identified {{as the work of}} a Rochester <b>die-cutter</b> who also produced coins early in the reign of Æthelwulf of Wessex. [...] After ten years without any coinage, Beorhtwulf would have had to go outside Mercia to find skilled die-cutters, and Rochester was the closest mint. [...] Hence the link to Rochester probably does not indicate that the coins were minted there; {{it is more likely that}} they were produced in London, which was under Mercian control. [...] Subsequent coins of Beorhtwulf's are very similar to Æthelwulf's. [...] One coin combines a portrait of Beorhtwulf on the reverse side with a design used by Æthelwulf on the obverse; this has been interpreted as indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms, but it is more likely to have been the work of a forger or an illiterate moneyer reusing the design of a coin of Æthelwulf's. [...] A different coinage appears later in the 840s, and was probably ended by the Viking attacks of 850–851. [...] There are also coins without portraits that are likely to have been produced at the very end of Beorhtwulf's reign.|$|E

Armed with life savings of $5,000 and a $7,500 investment by his boss, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland. There he managed the J.E. Smith Box & Printing Co. during the day, while running the Southern Box Company, a company he founded in 1936, at night. Using Smith's presses, <b>die-cutters,</b> and other box making equipment during the evening, Morris began servicing two anchor customers who knew him from his Philadelphia days.|$|R
500|$|The medium-weight coins often carry {{designs of}} high artistic quality, {{exceeding}} {{that of the}} contemporary Frankish currency. Coin portraits of Offa {{have been described as}} [...] "showing a delicacy of execution which is unique in the whole history of the Anglo-Saxon coinage". The depictions of Offa on the coins include a [...] "striking and elegant" [...] portrait showing him with his hair in voluminous curls, and another where he wears a fringe and tight curls. Some coins show him wearing a necklace with a pendant. The variety of these depictions implies that Offa's <b>die-cutters</b> were able to draw on varied artistic sources for their inspiration.|$|R

His son John carried on as printer between 1503 and 1531, was competent, but did not rank with the top {{printers}} of that time. Another son, Peter the younger, was an able <b>die-cutter</b> and printer, and conducted business in Mainz (1509-23), Worms (1512-29), Strasbourg (1530-39) and Venice (1541-42). In 1526, Peter Schöffer the younger published the first English New Testament in Worms, translated by William Tyndale.

50|$|He {{was the son}} and heir of Commius {{and succeeded}} his father around 25-20 BC. Based on coin {{distribution}} {{it is possible that}} Tincomarus ruled in collaboration with his father {{for the last few years}} of Commius's life. Little is known of his reign although numismatic evidence suggests that he was more sympathetic to Rome than his father was in later years: the coins he issued much more closely resemble Roman types, and are so much better made that they must have come from professional Roman <b>die-cutters.</b> GC Boon has suggested that this technical advance was not limited to coinage and represents wider industrial assistance from the Roman Empire. Tincomarus's successors used the term rex on their coins and this indicates that Tincomarus had begun the process of achieving client kingdom status with Rome (see Roman client kingdoms in Britain).|$|R
2500|$|Offa’s coinage {{represents}} one of the high-points of Anglo-Saxon art, and indeed they were probably the most artistically accomplished coins produced anywhere in Europe at that time: they stand in sharp contrast with the aniconic coins of contemporary Frankia. Portraits were introduced at an early stage, and were executed {{in a number of different}} styles betraying a range of artistic influences drawing on contemporary and Roman sources. Reverse designs included intricate crosses of various types, but the range of Offa's <b>die-cutters</b> encompassed other reverse designs including intertwining serpents, eels and the wolf and twins. Uniquely in Anglo-Saxon England, coins were also struck at Canterbury in the name of the queen, Cynethryth, from dies produced by the same talented individual responsible for the best of Offa’s portrait dies. This practice could have been inspired by encounters with Roman coins in the names of empresses. It is also possible, though less likely, that the appearance of Irene on Byzantine coinage led Offa’s queen to place her image on coins as well. Certainly Cynethryth emerges from surviving evidence as a formidable individual, who regularly witnessed contemporary charters immediately after her husband, was responsible for the running of his household and survived him to become a powerful abbess.|$|R
5000|$|The Italic type of the triform cult {{image of}} Diana Nemorensis was reconstructed by Alföldi from a {{sequence}} of later Republican period coins he connected with a gens from Aricia. In early examples the three goddesses stand before a sketchily indicated wood, the central goddess placing her right hand {{on the shoulder of}} one goddess and her left on the hip of the other. The three are shown to be one by a horizontal bar behind their necks that connects them. Later <b>die-cutters</b> simplified the image. Alföldi interpreted the numismatic image as the Latin Diana [...] "conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess, and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate," [...] noting that Diana montium custos nemoremque virgo ("keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi") is addressed by Horace as diva triformis ("three-form goddess"). Diana is commonly addressed as Trivia by Virgil and Catullus. [...] The votive offerings, none earlier than the fourth century BCE, found in the grove of Aricia portray her as a huntress, and further as blessing men and women with offspring, and granting expectant mothers an easy delivery. The dedicatory inscription, long disappeared, was copied for its curiosity as testimony to the political union of Latin cities, the Latin league by Cato the Elder and transmitted, perhaps incompletely, by the grammarian Priscianus:Lucum Dianium in nemore Aricino Egerius Baebius Tusculanus dedicavit dictator Latinus. hi populi communiter: Tusculanus, Aricinus, Lanuvinus, Laurens, Coranus, Tiburtis, Pometinus, Ardeatis Rutulus ...|$|R

50|$|Meybusch apprenticed under Valentin Toutin in Stockholm in the 1660s, {{and perhaps}} in Copenhagen, where from 1667 to 1674 he worked for King Frederick III of Denmark and King Christian V of Denmark. In 1675 {{he moved to the}} Swedish Royal Mint in Stockholm where he worked as a <b>die-cutter,</b> but had his license revoked in 1676 for making {{coronation}} medals without authorization. His permit was eventually renewed in 1680 and 1683. However, in 1681 he relocated to the Paris mint as Médailleur du Roi de France for Louis XIV of France. For his travel he received 400 livres, and September 1687 a further total of 2,540 livres, as well 600 livres gratuity and 3300 livres for a coin-making machine of his invention. In 1690 he returned to Copenhagen, and in 1692 received a post at the Danish court with a salary of 1000 crowns per year.|$|E
50|$|His further {{sojourn in}} Tuscany {{seems to have}} been {{rendered}} distasteful to him by intrigues. About 1623 he moved to Rome, where he became <b>die-cutter</b> at the Papal mint in place of J. A. Moro, who died in 1625. Here he made a great many coins and medals for Urban VIII (1623-44), Innocent X (1644-55), and Alexander VII (1655-57). His last works date from 1664. As it seems strange that Molo should, at the age of eighty-four, still continue working with unabated strength, it is thought that another artist of his name - perhaps his son - continued Gasparo's work. Indeed, we find in 1639 a G. D. Molo, who might have been a son of Gasparo and who apparently died young; but {{it is more likely that}} Gasparo founded a school in Rome, and that his engravers worked according to his instructions and in his style, but passed off their works under his name and with his signature.|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} {{study of the}} moneyers' names on the late Anglo- Saxon coinage by the same writer concluded {{with the death of}} Ethelred Il. This study continues the survey to the accession of Edward the Confessor. The introduction summarises the sources for the coins of this period, current research on their dating and die-cutting, and the function of double names which appear on the coins. A section on phonology discusses in detail the spellings used in the coin-legends, showing how the numerous forms are not due to carelessness or illiteracy {{on the part of the}} <b>die-cutters,</b> but reflect sound-changes and spelling conventions-which are also found in documentary sources. Several sound-changes which have hitherto been attributed to Anglo-Norman influence appear on the coins, reinforcing the evidence for their having in fact taken place in native Old English. The individual names are then examined in an Alphabetical Name List for their derivation, and in the final section this information is used towards assessing the composition of the population in the towns where mints were situated, region by region, with regard to the density of Scandinavian settlement and the presence of other non-English groups. The Scandinavian ruling dynasty had little effect on the manning of the mints, the proportions of Scandinavian to English names being very similar to those under Ethelred. There are small changes in the southern Danelaw, which it is suggested may be a legacy of Ethelred's anti-Anglo-Scandinavian policy in the early years of the eleventh century. The coin-evidence reflects the general geographical patterns of settlement to be inferred from place-name and other material., rather than suggesting that the mint towns, because of their commercial status, had attracted a more cosmopolitan population...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the middle}} of the 8th century, {{production}} of sceattas had, as with the thrymsas before them, declined considerably: the last coins of the secondary period are scarce and often debased, and a dearth of coinage is indicated in the record of several archaeological and metal-detecting sites that had been productive for the previous period. Similar problems afflicted the Frankish kingdom too, and around 754/5 King Pippin III (751-68) took the initiative and reformed the Frankish coinage, introducing a new, thinner, broader format (at least 15mm in diameter) struck in much finer silver. Importantly, these new coins all bore the king’s name and (usually) the name of the issuing mint. English rulers followed suit around the same time, and the earliest signs of reform outside Northumbria (where a substantial and relatively high quality silver coinage remained in production, albeit sporadically, over the 8th century) came in East Anglia, where the obscure ruler Beonna reformed the local coinage sometime after he came to the throne in 749. His coins bear the royal name and that of the moneyer, and in fabric are midway between the sceattas and the new Frankish pennies. Initially struck in fine silver, Beonna’s coinage later declined in standard, though one of his moneyers survived to strike some of the earliest coins known for Offa of Mercia. It was Offa who introduced the broad penny to southumbrian England on a substantial scale, and made the employment of king’s and moneyer’s names standard at least three mints: Canterbury, London and somewhere in East Anglia. His earliest coins bear an abbreviated version of the royal title influenced by that on the coinage of Pippin III, and on the reverse the moneyer’s name. Early {{in the course of his}} coinage (probably in the 760s or 770s) there were also smaller issues at Canterbury in the names of two local Kentish kings, Heaberht (of whom only one coin survives) and Ecgberht II. Production of broad silver pennies also persisted in East Anglia, commencing in Offa's name but later interrupted by a small coinage struck in the name of King Æthelberht II of East Anglia, who was executed by Offa in 794: only three specimens of his coinage survive today, probably produced in the 780s or 90s. Offa’s coinage represents one of the high-points of Anglo-Saxon art, and indeed they were probably the most artistically accomplished coins produced anywhere in Europe at that time: they stand in sharp contrast with the aniconic coins of contemporary Frankia. Portraits were introduced at an early stage, and were executed in a number of different styles betraying a range of artistic influences drawing on contemporary and Roman sources.

5000|$|The SX2 and The Extender were {{designed}} and manufactured by Mark McLaughlan (adopted surname - changed {{back to his}} birth name, Mark Grant, in 1997) between the early 1980s and early 1990s. [...] McLaughlan, a Boston area nightclub DJ {{came up with the}} design to make 7" [...] discs easier to handle when mixing. The original design (The Extender) was made up of a platter die-cut from sheets of plastic that McLaughlan would drive on the hood of his car from the supplier in Cambridge, MA to the <b>die-cutter</b> in Ipswich, MA. He would then do the final assembly (bonding a lathe cut acrylic center piece and a foam pad) and packaging by hand. The SX2 (Single Extender, Rev 2) was manufactured by plastic injection at Spirit, Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts. One of the main design revisions required for the manufacturing process was a series of 'ribs' {{on the underside of the}} platter to prevent warping from the extreme changes in temperature during the plastic injection process. McLaughlan also incorporated a raised barrier to contain the head (in the event of miscuing) and a polished surface inside the barrier to minimize damage to the stylus. Due to its limited manufacturing run the SX2 has become a sought after rarity among pro DJs.|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{a strict}} {{correlation}} between academic and industrial world {{is an important}} development direction in the engineering education field. The authors ’ first step along this path was the activation of several courses on methodical design, and the second step was the activation of a tight cooperation with industries, so that students could develop their thesis facing up to real problems. The fundamental advantages of this approach are: a) accustom the students to follow a design method; b) increase students ’ ability to find out and to consider “all ” the possible solutions for a given problem, with the scope to choose the “best ” one; c) increase students ’ ability to evaluate solutions ’ behaviour; d) possibility {{for the students to}} follow the production of the designed or modified machine.
