The Ninja pops {{out from behind a}} tree and tries to shoots him with his blowgun. The Spartan blocks the darts and throws his javelin. The javelin lands off-target, {{allowing}} the Ninja to run away. He pulls out some shurikens and turns to throw them, only to find that the Spartan has caught up. He quickly throws one, but the shield protects the Spartan as he knocks over the Ninja. The Spartan unsheathes his short sword again and swings at the Ninja, who dodges. The Ninja jumps onto a tree and prepares to leap at the Spartan with his sword, but the Spartan impales the Ninja on his sword and pins him to the tree, stabbing him to death and yelling [...] "Sparta".|$|E
50|$|This {{is exactly}} why Oglethorpe was very careful in the people he chose to settle and defend the Altamaha. Oglethorpe's {{military}} experience and training had taught him that Scottish Highlanders were among the toughest people in the world. For generations, they had forged a livelihood out of the mountainous ranges of the Highlands with its rocky, stubborn soils, and cruel weather patterns. The Scots had been united with the English into the United Kingdom since the Act of Union in 1707 however it was hardly a relationship of equals. Scottish people over many centuries had endured many cases of abuse from the English. When they weren't being exploited at home, Scottish troops were often hired mercenaries used to fight British wars abroad. With their broadswords, targes (pronounced targe, and used as a <b>hand</b> <b>shield),</b> and their dirks, they were the finest hand-to-hand combatants in the world. Though clannish, often insular, and politically unstable at home, the Scots were {{a force to be}} reckoned with on the battlefield, a perfect ingredient for frontier defense in the wildernesses along the Georgia coast where conventional warfare was not going to be the norm.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a pipe jacking project of the Wu'ai Electric Power Tunnel, funded by Shenyang Power Company and constructed under the supervision of China Railway Construction Corporation in Shenyang, China. This project involves excavation of three jacking shafts and drilling tunnels by pipe jacking technique. A 3. 5 m diameter reinforced concrete pipe was jacked below the Hunhe River over a length of 1000 m. <b>Hand</b> <b>shield</b> approach was adopted on the river bank as an alternative of operating an earth pressure balance micro tunnel boring machine under the river. The stress-strain behavior of shafts under the maximum applied jacking forces was evaluated by means of finite element analyses. Monitoring data (i. e., tunnel alignment, jacking forces, resistance at the jacking head, frictional resistance and torque of the boring machine) were collected during the jacking process and are presented here. A tunnel face collapse was experienced; the corresponding countermeasure actions adopted are described. The jacking design (i. e., pipe, jacking machine, and shafts) and remediation for tunnel failure may provide reference for future projects and assist in the development of new design guidelines...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of ultrashort pulsed laser sources with pulse durations inthe range {{of up to}} 10 picoseconds enables very precise materials processingwith negligible thermal load for the processed work pieces. While themachining quality is excellent, the comparable small productivity in termsof ablation rate is the main shortcoming that inhibits a widespread industrialapplication in many cases. Subject of this dissertation is the upscaling of USP laser ablation tohigher productivity by using average power of several hundred Watts whileincreasing the pulse repetition rates to several megahertz. Initially, theeffects that are limiting the upscaling process are identified and investigated. When using high repetition rates, these limiting effects are heataccumulation on the one <b>hand</b> and <b>shielding</b> by plasma or particle plumeson the other hand. Within the presented dissertation a theoretical model isdeveloped, which is capable of describing {{the impact of these}} two effects onthe achievable productivity. The high relevance of the two effects for theUSP laser ablation with high repetition rates is confirmed by experimentalresults. Heat accumulation is leading to the generation of melted and veryrough surfaces, which cannot be accepted for most applications. On theother <b>hand,</b> <b>shielding</b> effects lead to a decrease of the achieved productivityof up to 50 %. Therefore, these effects need to be considered when doingan upscaling by using high repetition rates. By comparing experimentalresults and the developed theoretical description, heat accumulation andshielding effects can be attributed to underlying physical quantities. On the basis of the developed process understanding, a significant increaseof the ablation rate to a value of more than 30 mm 3 /min is achieved forthe processing of Inconel 718. In addition to the approach of applyingfast scanning technology to use high repetition rates, a new approach ispresented. Based on the specific utilization of heat accumulation, it ispossible to achieve comparable high repetition rates at good surface qualityusing conventional, high flexible galvanometerscanners...|$|R

40|$|If taxpayers believe past {{rates of}} {{compliance}} {{are indicative of}} the future, traditional measures for combating tax evasion can be compromised.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described here}} examine further {{the conditions under}} which paradoxical regeneration occurs and provide support for the hypothesis that a proximal migration of Schwann cells is responsible for the phenomenon. When only the <b>hand</b> is <b>shielded</b> from irradi-tion and the limb is denervated, amputation through the forearm or upper arm sometimes results in regeneration. The effects of variation in the time interval between denervation and amputation, the level of amputation and the method and number of denervations on the incidence of regeneration were investigated. The presence or absence of viable Schwann cells at the amputation plane was deduced from the remyelination of nerves under conditions which do or do not permit paradoxical regeneration. The nerves of totally irradiated and denervated limbs remain unmyelinated following regrowth of axons and such limbs do not regenerate after amputation. When only the <b>hand</b> was <b>shielded</b> from irradiation before the limbs were denervated, the new axons became completely remyelinated and some of these limbs regenerated when amputated. It is suggested that under these conditions Schwann cells can migrate proximally and can then proliferate further to form a blastema, since they would be the only unirradiated tissue present at the amputation plane...|$|R
