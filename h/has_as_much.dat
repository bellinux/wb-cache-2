25|$|Tramadol acts on the opioid receptors {{through its}} major active {{metabolite}} desmetramadol, which <b>has</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 700-fold higher {{affinity for the}} MOR relative to tramadol. Moreover, tramadol itself {{has been found to}} possess no efficacy in activating the MOR in functional activity assays, whereas desmetramadol activates the receptor with high intrinsic activity (Emax equal to that of morphine). As such, desmetramadol is exclusively responsible for the opioid effects of tramadol. Both tramadol and desmetramadol have pronounced selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR in terms of binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|The AN/BQQ-5 {{system was}} {{replaced}} by the AN/BQQ-10 system. Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI), designated AN/BQQ-10, is a four-phase program for transforming existing submarine sonar systems (AN/BSY-1, AN/BQQ-5, and AN/BQQ-6) from legacy systems to a more capable and flexible COTS/Open System Architecture (OSA) and also provide the submarine force with a common sonar system. A single A-RCI Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP) <b>has</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> computing power as the entire Los Angeles (SSN-688/688I) submarine fleet combined and will allow the development and use of complex algorithms previously beyond the reach of legacy processors. The use of COTS/OSA technologies and systems will enable rapid periodic updates to both software and hardware. COTS-based processors will allow computer power growth at a rate commensurate with the commercial industry.|$|E

"Rock Me" [...] came {{together}} in a single-day collaboration between guitarist Peter Svensson of the Swedish band the Cardigans, Sam Hollander, and Allan 'Kool Kojak' Grigg for One Direction's second studio album, Take Me Home, which was released in November 2012. First, Grigg carried out its mid-tempo beat. [...] "If you can slow a song down to mid-tempo, the girls are just gonna lose their minds," [...] Grigg told Time magazine in 2012. Svensson reflected that Hollander [...] "had {{an idea for a}} title that's like 'rock me' instead of ‘rock you,’ and the melody just came." [...] Co-producers Lukasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald and Henry 'Circut' Walter ended up with writing credits on the finished recording too — [...] "standard operating practice, now that the sound of a song <b>has</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> to do with its identity as its lyrics or melody," [...] according to Time magazine correspondent Douglas Wolk.|$|E

500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent.

500|$|Kenyatta and his {{government}} were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that [...] "it is naive {{to think that there}} is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East <b>has</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> designs upon us as the West and would like to serve their own interests." [...] His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that [...] "Africa is ripe for revolution" [...] was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.|$|E
500|$|In Joseph's [...] Mirage [...] song {{cycle of}} 1921 (five songs with string quartet accompaniment), a Holstian {{influence}} is evident alongside her own distinctive compositional voice. Gibbs highlights {{the first in}} the cycle, [...] "Song", which initially echoes [...] "To Varuna" [...] from Holst's Rig Veda hymns, but evolves into [...] "a different creation, distinguished by its own uncluttered quartet writing in which the viola has a special part to play". The final song, [...] "Echo", <b>has</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> in common with Brahms as with Holst. Joseph's Festival Venite from 1922 is an example of her use of the Modern Dorian mode (an ascending scale from D to the next D on the white piano keys), which became a feature of some of her later works. Scowcroft and Gibbs both point to Tudor influences in the Venite in which also, says Gibbs, [...] "the congenial influence of Vaughan Williams in melody and harmony is felt". The orchestral score for this work lost, but an organ accompaniment has been devised. Joseph's unaccompanied choral Hymn for Whitsuntide [...] also uses the Dorian Mode in what Holst described as a [...] "flawless little motet"; this was first work of Joseph's to be broadcast, in 1968. A Short String Quartet in A minor was performed by the Winifred Smith Quartet in December 1922 and was accepted for publication by J.B. Cramer and Co. However, it was not published, and subsequently disappeared.|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen <b>has</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E
