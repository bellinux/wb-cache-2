5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>what</b> the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children do. This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>what</b> the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E

Tschofenig also described how victims of the experiments had trouble eating and would desperately seek out any source of water including old floor rags. Tschofenig was responsible for using the X-ray machine in the infirmary and describes how even though he had <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>what</b> was going on he was powerless to stop it.

500|$|The plot of Final Fantasy VIII was {{conceived}} by Kitase, with the stories for the characters provided by Nomura {{and the actual}} scenario written by Nojima. During the game's pre-production, Nomura suggested the game be given a [...] "school days" [...] feel. Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age; their ideas meshed, taking form as the [...] "Garden" [...] military academies. Nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (Squall's present day group and Laguna's group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another. This idea was conveyed through the age and experience of Laguna's group, versus the youth and naïveté of Squall's group. Nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players' relationships with the protagonist is important to him. Both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII feature reserved, quiet protagonists {{in the form of}} Cloud Strife and Squall. With Final Fantasy VIII, however, Nojima worked to give players actual <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>what</b> the character was thinking; a direct contrast with his handling of Final Fantasy VII, which encouraged the player to speculate.|$|E
