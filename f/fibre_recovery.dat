40|$|One type of flexor reflex, that {{recorded}} {{from the}} tibialis anterior muscle {{in response to}} electrical stimulation of the sole of the foot, was studied in normal subjects and patients with several neurological disorders. Normally this reflex consists of two components, the second of which {{is related to the}} actual withdrawal. The first component, normally of lower threshold, is difficult to evoke in patients with chronic spinal cord or discrete cerebral lesions, whereas it has an unusually low threshold and is very clearly seen in those with Parkinson's disease. In patients with spinal cord disease, the exaggerated flexor reflexes are seen at long latencies after relatively small stimuli. During the early phase of recovery from spinal transection, both components may be seen and are, therefore, spinal in origin. Studies of patients with the sensory neuropathy of Friedreich's ataxia suggest that the afferent fibres responsible for these flexor reflexes are the small myelinated <b>fibres.</b> <b>Recovery</b> curves demonstrate very long-lasting changes in flexor reflex excitability in normal subjects and patients with `spasticity' from spinal lesions. This differs in patients with `spasticity' from lesions rostral to the brain-stem.

40|$|Recovering {{value from}} carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers waste {{can help to}} address the high cost and environmental burden of producing carbon fibres, but there is limited understanding of the cost and environmental implications of potential recycling technologies. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the environmental and financial viability of mechanical recycling of carbon fibre composite waste. Life cycle costing and environmental assessment models are developed to quantify the financial and environmental impacts of alternative composite waste treatment routes, comparing landfilling, incineration with energy recovery, and mechanical recycling in a UK context. Current Landfill Tax results in incineration becoming the lowest cost composite waste treatment option; however, incineration is associated with high greenhouse gas emissions as carbon released from composite waste during combustion exceeds CO 2 emissions savings from displacing UK electricity and/or heat generation, resulting in a net greenhouse gas emissions source. Mechanical recycling and fibre reuse to displace virgin glass fibre can provide the greatest greenhouse gas emissions reductions of the treatment routes considered (− 378 kg CO 2 eq. /t composite waste), provided residual recyclates are landfilled rather than incinerated. However, this pathway is found to be unfeasible due to its high cost, which exceeds £ 2500 /t composite waste ($ 3750 /t composite waste). The financial performance of mechanical recycling is impaired by the high costs of dismantling and recycling processes; low carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>recovery</b> rate; and low value of likely markets. To be viable, carbon fibre recycling processes must achieve near- 100 % fibre recover rates and minimise the degradation of fibre mechanical properties to enable higher value applications (e. g., virgin carbon fibre displacement).

40|$|Different routes for {{recycling}} carbon fibre composites from the aircraft industry were investigated for feasibility., Literature analysis revealed little previous ·work in this area, with most composite recycling investigations concentrating on automotive industry wastes. The magnitude of disposal of carbon fibre composite {{materials from the}} aircraft industry {{is estimated to be}} in the region of 350, 000 tonnes between the years 2000 and 2050. Landfill cost investigations concluded that the corresponding disposal cost will be in the region of £ 52 million. Experimentation indicated that the material was stable in landfill conditions, whilst investigations into the health and safety aspects of composite recycling revealed that the materials were harmless unless reduced diameter fibres were released. Activation experiments concluded that the production of commercially viable active carbons was not possible - although the resins activated the carbon fibres did not. Maximum BET surface areas of 170 m 2 g- 1 were achieved, despite employing different activation methods and pre-treatments. Therefore, alternative recycling routes were investigated. Two brainstorming sessions generated over forty options. After analysis for of these options were considered most likely to succeed and were investigated in more depth.. Fragment mitigation trials showed a significant reduction in fragment velocity (- 20 %) using composite plates of 10. 5 mm thickness, liquid-holding boxes resulted in fragment velocity reductions of up to 75 %. Delamination was localised to the area of impact. Literature based investigations of <b>fibre</b> <b>recovery</b> methods identified fluidised bed and high-pressure steam as the most likely to be viable, with fluidised bed plants breaking even at throughputs under 9, 000 t/yr. Chemical digestion and resin burn off produced significantly weakened fibres, swelling resulted in the freeing of pre-preg layers. Artificial reef investigations showed that although the material did not appear to degrade in marine environments, it was unsuitable for organism growth. No organisms were attached after a period of 1 year. Pyrolysis appeared to be a viable option, with plants breaking even at throughputs of approximately 6, 000 t/yr.

A two-pulse method {{was used to}} examine recovery from desentization of junctional and extrajunctional receptors. A 'response ratio', i. e. the amplitude of response to the second (test) of a pair of glutamate pulses over to the pulses. The 'response ratio' for extrajunctional depolarizations of innervated fibres increased exponentially with pulse interval, with a time constant of 15. 6 +/- 4. 7 sec (n = 11). Recovery of extrajunctional receptor populations from desensitization was accelerated after denervation. The recovery kinetics for responses from fibres 6 - 22 days after denervation were generally described by two exponential terms, with time constants in the range 0. 5 - 10 sec which were inversely related to the glutamate sensitivity of the extrajunctional membrane. For junctional receptors on both innervated and denervated <b>fibres</b> the <b>recovery</b> kinetics were described by a single exponential with a time constant of 0. 2 - 1 sec. 3. The results suggest that the increased extrajunctional glutamate sensitivity which occurs after denervation results from the 'appearance' of glutamate receptors with properties similar to those found at the post-junctional membrane on locust muscle fibres...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma work was to {{investigate}} the problem of insufficient <b>fibre</b> <b>recovery</b> in the dissolved air flotation-cell at the new thermomechanical pulping-line at Braviken Paper Mill. An investigation of the effect of process parameters on the removal efficiency in the micro-flotation process was undertaken. The experiments were carried out for two setups at the Noss pilot plant with a small-scale flotation unit. Factorial design helped plan the experiments and four factors were controlled; temperature, fibre-size distribution, water quality and feed concentration. Three samples, feed, overflow and filtrate, were taken from each experiment and concentration measurements were made. The results were analyzed using the software MODDE. The results from showed an influence from the fibre-size distribution. To see if the fibre-size distribution really had an effect on the results, follow-up experiments were carried out. These experiments showed no influence from temperature, fibre-size distribution or water quality. This concludes that none of those three factors influenced the results significantly.

The underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. In addition, {{little is known about the}} recovery of muscle mass and strength following disuse. In the present study, we report an extensive dataset describing, in detail,the functional and protein content adaptations of skeletal muscle in response to both disuse and re-training. Eight young healthy subjects were subjected to 3 weeks of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), a widely used human model of disuse skeletal muscle atrophy. Needle biopsies samples were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle Pre-ULLS, Post-ULLS and after 3 weeks of recovery during which heavy resistance training was performed. After disuse, cross-sectional area (CSA), PO/CSA and myosin concentration (MC) decreased in both type 1 and 2 A skinned muscle <b>fibres.</b> After <b>recovery,</b> CSA and MC returned to levels comparable to those observed before disuse, whereas Po/CSA and unloaded shortening velocity reached a higher level. Myosin heavy chain isoform composition of muscle samples did not differ among the experimental groups.

ULLS induced a reduction of myofibrillar, metabolic (glycolytic and oxidative) and anti-oxidant defence system protein content. Resistance training was very effective in counteracting ULLS-induced alterations, indicating that long-term ULLS did not prevent the positive effect of exercise on human muscle...|$|R

In the present study we determined whether specific biochemical or immunochemical modulation of one major component of the scar, the basal membrane (BM), would provide a means to stimulate axon regeneration in the mechanically transected postcommissural fornix of the adult rat. Basal membrane developed within the first 2 weeks after transection in spatiotemporal coincidence with the abrupt growth arrest of spontaneously regrowing axons. Local injection of anticollagen IV antibodies or α, α�-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of collagen triple helix formation and synthesis, significantly reduced lesioninduced BM deposition. This treatment allowed massive axon elongation across the lesion site. Anterograde tracing provided unequivocal evidence that regenerating axons follow their original pathway, reinnervate the appropriate target, the mammillary body, and become remyelinated with compact myelin. Presynaptic electrophysiological recordings of regenerated <b>fibre</b> tracts showed <b>recovery</b> to nearly normal conduction properties.

40|$|When a {{suspension}} of cellulose fibres in water is shaken or stirred with sufficient violence {{to produce a}} uniform dispersion and allowed to come to rest, {{it is observed that}} the dispersion tends to become less uniform in distribution of fibres. This important but little understood phenomenon is termed “flocculation” by analogy to the coagulation of a colloidal dispersion. Flocculation is usually undesirable during certain stages in the process of paper making. If it occurs during or just prior to the forming of the sheet on the wire of the paper machine, the pulp fibres are distributed unevenly and a non-uniform sheet results. When a sheet has a very poor “formation”, the ink is not distributed uniformly over the surface of the paper during the printing process. This prohibits the use of the paper in services where good reproduction is required. The strength and general appearance of paper are also determined, in large measure, by the formation. It is therefore of extreme importance that the principles of cellulose fibre flocculation be determined so that they may be available to the paper maker. There are other instances in which a more thorough knowledge of the principles of flocculation would be of value. In <b>fibre</b> <b>recovery</b> systems it is desirable to promote flocculation. In producing dissolving-grade pulps of uniform permeability and swelling properties it is of considerable importance to have the fibres uniformly dispersed when the pulp sheets are formed.

Also some medical interventions such as endovascular catheterization {{have the potential to}} damage blood vessels. This study reports the use of porcine aorta as a model system for studying the physical impact of catheters on vasculature, in conjunction with non-invasive imaging techniques to analyse collagen and elastin fibre organization and assess load-induced changes. Porcine aorta was exposed to frictional trauma and elastin and collagen fibre orientation evaluated by destructive, histochemical methods and non-invasive imaging. The latter allowed the immediate impact of force on fibre orientation and <b>fibre</b> <b>recovery</b> to be evaluated longitudinally. In normal aorta, elastin fibres are aligned at the surface, but become less aligned with increasing depth, showing no alignment by 30 µm. Collagen fibres meanwhile appear aligned down to a depth of 35 µm. Changes in collagen and elastin fibre orientation in healthy pig aorta were detected by conventional destructive histology within 5 minutes of application of a sliding 10 N load, while lesser loads had less impact. Good recovery of fibre orientation was observed within 20 minutes. Non-invasive imaging of ex vivo aorta tissue provides a good indication of the extent of fibre re-organization following frictional stress, at loads similar to those encountered during medical interventions such as catheterization. These results indicate that tissue deformation can occur from these procedures, even in healthy tissue, and highlight the potential for the development of an in vivo probe capable of monitoring vascular changes in patients...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic performance, muscle {{characteristics}} and acute and chronic response to sprint exercise were studied in physically active healthy women (n= 35; age 24) and men (n= 38; age 25). The {{aims of the}} present study were to: 1) Establish if women possess lower oxidative and glycolytic capacity, higher proportion of type I fibres and smaller type II fibre areas in relation to type I fibre areas in thigh musculature than men. 2) Investigate if the same muscle variables predict anaerobic performance in women and men. 3) Identify muscle variables explaining gender differences in anaerobic performance. 4) Investigate if the effect of anaerobic training on muscle {{characteristics and}} maximal power output differ between women and men. 5) Study if there is a gender difference in metabolic activation of type I and type II muscle fibres and in sympathoadrenergic activation, during 30 -s cycle sprints. Methods: Sprint exercise or sprint training were performed using a 30 -s Wingate-test. Muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis were obtained before and immediately after sprint exercise or before and after 4 weeks of sprint training. Biopsies were analysed for fibre types, fibre areas, enzyme activities, glycogen and total creatine content. Content of glycogen, lactate, creatine phosphate, creatine, ATP, inosine monophosphate (IMP), inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine were also analysed in pools of type I and type II fibres. Venous blood was sampled and analysed for lactate, ammonia, catecholamines and breakdown products of ATP before, during and after sprint exercise. Results: Cross-sectional fibre areas of type I, IIA and IIB fibres were smaller and type II/I area ratio, relative area of fibre type 11, and activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and M-subunit of LD were lower in women than in men, but not citrate synthase activity. Low proportion of type II fibres, phosphofructokinase activity and low relative M-subunit activity, seemed to reduce anaerobic performance in both genders. Lower M-subunit activity may contribute to the lower capacity of women than of men to perform anaerobic exercise. Sprint training decreased gender differences in mean power output, type 11 fibre cross-sectional area, but did not reduce gender difference in LD activity. Exercise-induced glycogen degradation was smaller in women than in men in type I fibres, but not in type Il fibres. This was also supported by lower lactate content in women's type I fibres after exercise. Reduction in ATP content and accumulation of IMP during bouts of sprint exercise was similar in men and women in both type I and 11 <b>fibres.</b> After <b>recovery</b> between bouts of sprint exercise, women showed lower muscle IMP and inosine than did men, especially in type II fibres. At systemic level, women as compared to men showed lower accumulation of ammonia, inosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid and catecholamines in plasma, and of lactate in blood, following repeated sprint exercise. Conclusion: Knowledge about fibre-type-specific and gender related differences in the metabolic response to sprint exercise may, besides being of basic scientific value, have implications for response to sprint training and therefore also for the planning of gender-specific training programs, including the recovery period between bouts of sprint exercise...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects were}} {{compared}} of {{exercise in the}} fasted state and exercise with {{a high rate of}} carbohydrate intake on intramyocellular triglyceride (IMTG) and glycogen content of human muscle. Using a randomized crossover study design, nine young healthy volunteers participated in two experimental sessions with an interval of 3 weeks. In each session subjects performed 2 h of constant-load bicycle exercise (∼ 75 % V O 2 max), followed by 4 h of controlled recovery. On one occasion they exercised after an overnight fast (F), and on the other (CHO) they received carbohydrates before (∼ 150 g) and during (1 g (kg bw) − 1 h − 1) exercise. In both conditions, subjects ingested 5 g carbohydrates per kg body weight during <b>recovery.</b> <b>Fibre</b> type-specific relative IMTG content was determined by Oil red O staining in needle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis before, immediately after and 4 h after exercise. During F but not during CHO, the exercise bout decreased IMTG content in type I fibres from 18 ± 2 % to 6 ± 2 % (P= 0. 007) area lipid staining. Conversely, during recovery, IMTG in type I fibres decreased from 15 ± 2 % to 10 ± 2 % in CHO, but did not change in F. Neither exercise nor recovery changed IMTG in type IIa fibres in any experimental condition. Exercise-induced net glycogen breakdown was similar in F and CHO. However, compared with CHO (11. 0 ± 7. 8 mmol kg − 1 h − 1), mean rate of postexercise muscle glycogen resynthesis was 3 -fold greater in F (32. 9 ± 2. 7 mmol kg− 1 h− 1, P = 0. 01). Furthermore, oral glucose loading during recovery increased plasma insulin markedly more in F (+ 46. 80 μU ml − 1) than in CHO (+ 14. 63 μU ml − 1, P = 0. 02). We conclude that IMTG breakdown during prolonged submaximal exercise in the fasted state takes place predominantly in type I fibres and that this breakdown is prevented in the CHO-fed state. Furthermore, facilitated glucose-induced insulin secretion may contribute to enhanced muscle glycogen resynthesis following exercise in the fasted state. <br /...|$|R

Glass reinforced plastics commonly include thermosetting polymers. These cannot be re-moulded, unlike thermoplastics, thus thermoset scrap is currently disposed of in landfill. This is increasingly targeted by legislation(14) and {{is becoming more}} expensive. This thesis describes work to maximise resource recovery from scrap thermoset composites. A review of relevant literature identified thermal processes for treating scrap thermoset composites. Combustion is particularly suitable for the mixed and contaminated materials arising from end of life vehicles. The literature showed that heating glass fibres reduced their properties, which is a concern for any thermal recycling process. The methodology of this work is to recover energy from the composite polymer and reuse the incombustible residues. Two experimental processes are reported: Fluidised Bed Co-combustion of Thermoset Composites with Coal. The common composite filler of calcium carbonate captures the sulphur emissions from the coal combustion. Results show that scrap composites can successfully be burned in a commercial scale fluidised bed. Retention of the sulphur from the coal by the composite filler was up to 75 % of the input. Although a technical success, economic analysis shows this disposal to be unviable compared with similar desulphurisation via crushed limestone. Fluidised Bed Thermal Processing Rig for Recovering Glass Fibres. The incombustible constituents of a crushed Sheet Moulding Compound were released from processing above 400 ° C in the fluidised bed test rig. The reinforcing glass fibres were elutriated as monofilaments, suitable {{for use in a}} veil product, and recovered from the flue gases. Scanning Electron Microscopy showed that the fibres were intact. The tensile strength of fibres from 450 °C processing was reduced by approximately 50 % and by 90 % from 650 °C(73). Strength was also found to reduce with increasing time at a temperature(76). Flue gas analysis showed that carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were present. This indicated that full combustion did not take place and the associated heat energy lost. Measured nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide concentrations were low. After initial testing, the test rig was refined by the incorporation of a Rotating Screen Collector to separate the fillers and fibres. The fibre contamination was reduced by 50 % via this novel equipment. <b>Fibre</b> <b>recovery</b> rates of up to 57 % were achieved. Resin Decomposition Model. Results indicate that the resin endothermic energy of decomposition maintained the temperature of the Sheet Moulding Compound significantly below the bed temperature...|$|E
