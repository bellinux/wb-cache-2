The shorter duration runs show a melting front advancing from the vertical granite-peridotite boundary, where water is released from serpentine dehydration in the peridotite. The rate of advance of the melt front decreases from over 10 ^(- 4) cm/s in the first minutes to less than 10 ^(- 5) cm/s after 1 hour, suggesting that water diffusion to the melting <b>front</b> <b>controls</b> the melting rate.

40|$|Up-to-date {{regional}} and local Granite Wash data of any form is either too scarce to reference or highly privatized by exploration and production companies operating in the region. The objective {{of this research is}} to correlate horizontal production data with mapped depositional trends from Upper Pennsylvanian (Missourian Stage) Granite Wash reservoirs in the Western Anadarko Basin in northeastern Wheeler County, Texas. The correlation of raster logs to define various trap type and geometries in Missourian Granite Wash reservoirs of Wheeler County, Texas is used to understand the geologic controls on oil and gas accumulation and production. The analysis includes detailed stratigraphic mapping of individual Wash reservoir units and the linking of these maps to oil and gas production data. The majority of the Hogshooter Wash produces from intervals of relatively clean sandstones defined by the gamma ray signatures and porosity values. Isolith mapping of the Lower Hogshooter Wash interval strongly suggest that the production comes from the central area of Wheeler County adjacent to the faulted zone. Production from the upper interval appears to be located in the northwestern and southeastern areas of the Lower Cottage Grove Wash isopach displays a thinning of the interval from south to north. Production from the Lower Cottage Grove Wash appears to come from an area that trends south-north from the southern margin of the study area.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) And the alpha-actinin- 3 (Actn 3) Genes {{are two of}} {{the most}} studied "Performance genes" And both have been associated with sprint/power phenotypes and elite performance. Purpose: To investigate the association between the ace and the actn 3 genotypes and sprint athlete status in elite jamaican and us african american sprinters. Methods: The actn 3 r 577 x and the ace i/d and a 22982 g (Rs 4363) Genotype distributions of elite jamaican (J-a: N = 116) And us sprinters (Us-a: N = 114) Were compared with controls from the jamaican (J-c n = 311) And us african american (Us-c; N = 191) Populations. Frequency differences between groups were assessed by exact test. Results: For actn 3, the xx genotype was found to be at very low frequency in both athlete and control cohorts (J-c = 2 %, j-a = 3 %. Us-c = 4 %, us-a = 2 %). Athletes did not differ <b>front</b> <b>controls</b> in actn 3 genotype distribution (J, p = 0. 87; Us, p = 0. 58). Similarly, neither us nor jamaican athletes differed from controls in genotype at ace i/d (J, p = 0. 44; Us, p = 0. 37). Jamaican athletes did not differ from controls for a 22982 g genotype (P = 0. 28), Although us sprinters did (P = 0. 029), Displaying all excess of heterozygotes relative to controls but no excess of gg homozygotes (Us-c 22 %, us-a = 18 %). Conclusions: Given that actn 3 xx genotype is negatively associated with elite sprint athlete status, the underlying low frequency in these populations eliminates the possibility of replicating this association in jamaican and us african american sprinters. The finding of no excess in ace dd or gg genotypes in elite sprint athletes relative to controls suggests that ace genotype is not a determinant of elite sprint athlete status...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA type {{example of}} Vulcanian eruptive {{dynamics}} is {{the series of}} 88 explosions that occurred between August and October 1997 at Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat Island. These explosions are interpreted {{to be caused by}} the pressurization of a conduit by a shallow highly crystalline and degassed magma plug. We test such an interpretation by combining the pressures and porosities of the pre-explosive magma column proposed by Burgisser et al. (2010, doi: 10. 1016 /j. jvolgeores. 2010. 04. 008) into a physical model that reconstructs a depth-referenced density profile of the column for four mechanisms of pressure buildup. Each mechanism yields a different overpressure profile: 1) gas accumulation, 2) conduit wall elasticity, 3) microlite crystallization, and 4) magma flowage. For the first three mechanisms, the three-part vertical layering of the conduit prior to explosion was spatially distributed as a dense cap atop the conduit with a thickness of a few tens of meters, a transition zone of 400 – 700 m with heterogeneous vesicularities, and, at greater depth, a more homogeneous, low-porosity zone that brings the total column length to ~ 3. 5 km. A shorter column can be obtained with mechanism 4 : a dense cap of less than a few meters, a heterogeneous zone of 200 – 500 m, and a total column length as low as 2. 5 km. Inflation/deflation cycles linked to a periodic overpressure source offer a dataset that we use to constrain the four overpressure mechanisms. Magma flowage is sufficient to cause periodic edifice deformation through semi-rigid conduit walls and build overpressures able to trigger explosions. Gas accumulation below a shallow plug is also able to build such overpressures and can occur regardless of magma flowage. The concurrence of these three mechanisms offers the highest likelihood of building overpressures leading to the 1997 explosion series. We also explore the consequences of sudden (eruptive) overpressure release on our magmatic columns to assess the role of syn-explosive vesiculation and pre-fragmentation column expansion. We find that large shallow overpressures and efficient syn-explosive vesiculation cause the most dramatic pre-fragmentation expansion. This leads us to depict two end-member pictures of a Vulcanian explosion. The first case corresponds to the widely accepted view that the downward motion of a fragmentation <b>front</b> <b>controls</b> column evacuation. In the second case, syn-explosive column expansion just after overpressure release brings foamed-up magma up towards an essentially stationary and shallow fragmentation front...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{tribology}} of thermal sprayed WC-Co based coatings and covers the high energy air-sand erosion resistance and slurry jet impingement erosion performance, dry and wet sliding tribology of thermal spray WC-Co based coatings {{as well as the}} abrasion and abrasion-corrosion of these coatings. The tribological and tribo-corrosion performance of the coatings will be related to their mechanical and corrosion properties as well as deposition parameters, microstructure and actual composition. For example, the anisotropic microstructure of thermally sprayed WC–Co–Cr coatings, in particular the low fracture toughness in a direction parallel to the substrate, has been observed to affect the nature of crack formation under 200 ?J air-solid particle erosion conditions. Voids and occasionally other microstructural features (i. e. cobalt lakes, splat boundaries, interfacial inclusions) in the coating act as crack initiation sites. The erosion rate was dominated by cracks within 5 ?m of the surface and was relatively insensitive to total length of cracks, showing a near-surface damage <b>front</b> <b>controls</b> the erosion rate and this region is coincident with the region of maximum shear stress induced by erodent impacts. Optimisation of the deposition parameters of HVOF 86 WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coatings show an improvement in erosion resistance of more than 50 % over the conventional D-gun applied coating of identical nominal composition. The variation in the slurry erosion performance of the thermally sprayed coatings is also linked to directional fracture toughness and crack propagation paths which are influenced by the presence of pores, inhomogeneous carbide distributions and substrate grit blast remnants. The influence of slurry jet angle is more pronounced under 0. 4 ?J energy conditions where maximum erosion occurred at 90 ° and the minimum at 30 ° in contrast to 7 ?J slurry erosion rates which were independent of jet angle. This reflects the lower levels of fluctuating stresses imparted to the coating during low energy slurry impacts leading to the impact angle having a greater effect on sub critical crack growth rate than for higher energy conditions. The abrasion resistance of these coatings was found comparable to sintered cermets of the same composition. The synergistic effects between micro and macro abrasion and corrosion for detonation gun (D-gun) sprayed WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coatings are shown to be significant and depend on the environment. The size effect of the abradant relative to the microstructure and splat size is important as well as the propensity for the various phases to passivate to control corrosion levels. Comparisons between exposed and freshly polished coating surfaces in strong NaOH solutions (pH 11) show that significantly lower wear rates were seen for the exposed surface due to a negative wear–corrosion synergy due to selective phase removal and the effects of localised passivation. Dry and wet sliding wear resistance of these coatings is shown to be high (wear rates of 10 - 16 to 10 - 18 m 3 /Nm) with modest coefficient of friction levels between 0. 2 and 0. 5. The presence of oxides on the binder phases appears to influence the friction and wear levels. Wear appears to be by carbide ejection and/or by tribo-chemical processes...|$|E
