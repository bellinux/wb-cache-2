40|$|We {{consider}} a non-repetitive manufacturing environment {{where the first}} stage will successively process different types of items that require different set up modes. Optimal sublot sizes are determined by studying the trade-off between the cost and time spent in restoration and rework. In addition, we discuss the resulting economical batch sizes, number of sublots, and processing rates. Finally, we provide recommendations on how to design the material handling flow system to implement our suggested inspection policies. Some of the managerial implications we found is that quality improves significantly when Stage 2 is more responsive (has faster processing times) than Stage 1 and when large batch sizes are divided into more sublots. Depending on the relative magnitude of poor quality and rework costs, we {{show that there is}} a threshold for the batch size under which sublot formation becomes inefficient. ]Received 17 July 2007; Revised 30 September 2007; Accepted 12 October 2007]lot splitting; quality inspection; finite production rates; two-stage production; multi-product; applied optimisation; non-repetitive manufacturing; materials handling; material flow; <b>inspection</b> policies; <b>batch</b> size; sublot formation. ...|$|R
40|$|Mini-batch {{stochastic}} {{gradient descent}} and variants thereof have become standard for large-scale empirical risk minimization like {{the training of}} neural networks. These methods are usually used with a constant batch size chosen by simple empirical <b>inspection.</b> The <b>batch</b> size significantly influences {{the behavior of the}} stochastic optimization algorithm, though, since it determines the variance of the gradient estimates. This variance also changes over the optimization process; when using a constant batch size, stability and convergence is thus often enforced by means of a (manually tuned) decreasing learning rate schedule. We propose a practical method for dynamic batch size adaptation. It estimates the variance of the stochastic gradients and adapts the batch size to decrease the variance proportionally to the value of the objective function, removing the need for the aforementioned learning rate decrease. In contrast to recent related work, our algorithm couples the batch size to the learning rate, directly reflecting the known relationship between the two. On popular image classification benchmarks, our batch size adaptation yields faster optimization convergence, while simultaneously simplifying learning rate tuning. A TensorFlow implementation is available. Comment: Thirty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), 2017, (accepted...|$|R

40|$|Repeated {{screening}} is a 100 % sampling <b>inspection</b> of a <b>batch</b> {{of items}} followed by {{removal of the}} defective items and further iterations of inspection and removal. The reason for repeating the inspection is that the detection of a defective item happens with probability "p"> 1. A missed defective item is a false negative result. The no false positive result is contemplated in this paper, which is motivated by a problem coming from the production of pharmaceutical pills. Bayesian posterior distributions {{for the quality of}} the lot are obtained for the case of both "p" known and "p" unknown. Batch rejection and batch acceptance control limits for the number of defective items at subsequent iterations can then be calculated. Theoretical connections to the problem of estimating the number-of-trials parameter of a binomial distribution are drawn. Copyright 2004 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R
3000|$|Ordering Cost (OC) is {{the costs}} of {{ordering}} a new batch of raw materials. These include cost of placing a purchase order, costs of <b>inspection</b> of received <b>batches,</b> documentation costs, etc. Ordering costs vary inversely with carrying costs. It means that the more orders a business places with its suppliers, the higher will be the ordering costs. However, more orders mean smaller average inventory levels and hence lower carrying costs. It is important for a business to minimize the sum of these costs which it does by applying the economic order quantity model. All the aforementioned integrated vendor–buyer inventory systems treat the ordering cost and/or lead time as constants. However, in the practical market, ordering cost and lead time can be controlled and reduced in various ways. For example, lead time can be reduced at an added crashing cost; ordering cost reduction can be attained through worker training, procedural changes, and specialized equipment acquisitions; in other words, the lead time is controllable, and the ordering cost can be reduced through further investment. It has been a trend by shortening the lead time and reducing ordering cost; we can lower the safety stock, reduce the stockout loss, and improve the service level to the customer.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Europe, {{the stem}} and bulb {{nematode}} Ditylenchus dipsaci has been {{listed as a}} quarantine pest by EPPO: without any control, it may cause complete failure of alfalfa crops. Movement of nematodes associated with seeds is considered to be the highest-risk pathway for the spread of this pest. Since the 2010 official withdrawal of methyl bromide in Europe, {{and in the absence of}} any alternative chemical, fumigation of contaminated seed batches is no longer possible, which makes the production of nematode-free alfalfa seeds difficult to achieve and leads to unmarketable seed batches. Thermotherapy is being considered as a realistic alternative strategy, but its efficiency still remains to be validated. The combination of the currently available methods (i. e. use of resistant cultivars, seed production according to a certification scheme, mechanical sieving, seed <b>batch</b> <b>inspection)</b> could significantly reduce the likelihood of seed contamination. However, it does not guarantee a total eradication of the nematode. Although it is already widely distributed all over Europe, reclassification of D. dipsaci as a regulated non-quarantine pest to reduce the possibility of further introductions and the rate of spread of this pest appears to be a risky strategy because of the lack of up-to-date documented data to evaluate damage thresholds and determine acceptable tolerance levels...|$|R
40|$|Case {{hardening}} is a {{metallurgical process}} typically {{to increase the}} fatigue and wear resistance of steel components. The case refers to the hardened layer that is formed in this process, {{and the depth of}} the case is critical to the components’ performance. Currently, to inspect the quality of a batch of material that has gone through the hardening process, {{one or more of the}} parts are sectioned with an abrasive wheel, polished flat and the hardness profile measured using a microhardness indenter. This method of inspection can take several hours, often with the production line stopped, until the results are known. It does have the advantage of measuring directly the desired material properties but has the obvious disadvantages of costly manufacturing down-time, unnecessary scrappage of a production item and assumes that the material properties of other samples in the batch are similar to the one inspected. As a promising alternative approach, nondestructive inspection (NDI) permits a 100 % <b>inspection</b> of the <b>batch</b> which is not economically viable using destructive inspection methods. Generally, NDI methods are based on inferring case depth indirectly through measuring electromagnetic or mechanical properties of the part using eddy current or ultrasonic probes [1 – 4]. Eddy current systems are commonly used for case depth measurements and are known to be reliable for many applications [4]. However, they lack sensitivity if the case depth is deep (e. g. greater than 5 mm in steel parts) and custom probes are required for inspection of components with different geometries...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to present the {{environmental}} quality of building materials after mid 1998, and to evaluate: - The applicability of building materials under conditions of the Building Material Decree, -The impact of the standards in the Decree on the (re) use of building materials. - The critical components and the extent to which they can be influenced. - Quality improvements compared to the ex-ante evaluation in 1997. - Problems encountered in practice. For this purpose, data on composition and leaching were collected and evaluated. The environmental quality was tested against the standards of the Building Material Decree. In general, data were evaluated for three heights: 0. 2, 0. 7, and 2. 0 meter. 98 - 99 % of the materials is in compliance with the Building Material Decree. The total reuse of building materials of about 141 Mton in 1997 has increased to 155 Mton in 2001. This is caused by a doubling of the reuse of granular secondary building materials, especially slightly polluted soils and aggregates of construction and demolition waste. 76 % of the total use of building materials are primary and 24 % are secondary building materials. There are considerable problems to meet the requirements of the Building Material Decree for the following materials: cleaned soil (antimony); MSWI bottom ash (copper, molybdenum); mine stone (antimony, selenium); aggregates of construction- and demolition waste (sulphate); dredge spoil (fluoride, sulphate); tare soil (mineral oil, DDD/DDE/DDT, aldrin/dieldrin/endrin) and clay (DDD/DDE/DDT, drins).
