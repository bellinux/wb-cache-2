40|$|Different {{preparations}} of the methylreductase {{were tested}} in a simplified methylcoenzyme M methylreductase assay with artificial electron donors under a nitrogen atmosphere. ATP and Mg 2 + stimulated the reaction. Tris(2, 2 '-bipyridine) ruthenium (II), chromous chloride, chromous acetate, titanium III citrate, 2, 8 -diaminoacridine, <b>formamidinesulfinic</b> <b>acid,</b> cob(I) alamin (B 12 s), and dithiothreitol were tested as electron donors; the most effective donor was titanium III citrate. Methylreductase (component C) was prepared by 80 % ammonium sulfate precipitation, 70 % ammonium sulfate precipitation, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, Mono Q column chromatography, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, or tetrahydromethanopterin affinity column chromatography. Methylreductase preparations which were able to catalyze methanogenesis in the simplified reaction mixture contained contaminating proteins. Homogeneous component C obtained from a tetrahydromethanopterin affinity column was not active in the simplified assay but was active in a methylreductase assay that contained additional protein components...|$|E
