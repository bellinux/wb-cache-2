40|$|ABSTRACT: Rigid, fused-ring {{molecules}} {{were investigated}} as nano-sized reinforce-ments for <b>engineering</b> <b>polymers.</b> Because {{of the high}} specific surface area associated with their small size, {{it was expected that}} they would provide greater enhancement of modulus than equally stiff reinforcements of millimeter and micron dimensions. The expected enhancement was not realized, a result attributed to the bulky alkyl substituents on the rings, placed there to make the fused-ring molecules soluble and dispersible at the molecular level in <b>engineering</b> <b>polymers.</b> It was concluded that the free volume introduced to the nanocomposites by these substituents counteracted the stiffening effect of the fused-ring structure in the molecules. The results point out the inherent trade-off with fused-ring molecules as reinforcements; the types of substituents required to make the molecules dispersible in a polymer matrix are also those that reduce its modulus.

50|$|Novel {{polymeric}} alloy, {{also known}} as Neoloy, is a polymeric alloy composed of polyolefin and thermoplastic <b>engineering</b> <b>polymer.</b> It was developed specifically for use in high-strength geosynthetics. The first commercial application was in the manufacturer of polymeric strips used to form cellular confinement systems (geocells). Novel polymeric alloy was developed to replace high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in geosynthetics. Although HDPE is widely used due to its low cost, ease of manufacturing and flexibility, its relatively high creep, low tensile strength and sensitivity to elevated temperatures limit its use, for example, in long-term, critical geocell applications. Used {{in the manufacture of}} geosynthetics, such as the Neoweb cellular confinement system, novel polymeric alloy provides geocells with a higher tensile strength and stiffness, and are more durable over dynamic loading and under elevated temperatures than those made from HDPE (Han, 2011). The lifespan of novel polymeric alloy geosynthetics, such as geocells, makes them suitable for long-term design in infrastructure, such as highways, railways, container yards and high retaining walls.|$|E
