The proportion of isolates with antifungal activity determined in in vitro assay against V. dahliae was higher for the Garden Strawberry than for the Greenish Strawberry. From 300 isolates, 20 isolates with strong antifungal activity were selected characterized by physiological profiling and molecular fingerprinting methods. Diversity among the isolates was characterized with molecular fingerprints using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and the more discriminating BOX-PCR fingerprint method. The physiological profiles were well correlated with molecular fingerprinting pattern analysis. Significant reduction of Verticillium wilt by bacterial <b>dipping</b> <b>bath</b> treatment was shown in the greenhouse and in fields naturally infested by V. dahliae.

40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy {{hot dip coating}} of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to hot <b>dip</b> <b>bath</b> management practices are set forth. Background The coating of iron and steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. Hot dip practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of hot dip) processes precede the coating step. Moreover, hot dip coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating. Although traditional galvanized coatings with small (0. 1 %) aluminum compositions are the most popular, the most rapidly growing hot dip coating is made with the Galfan ® process, wherein a Zn- 5 % Al coating is applied by hot dipping (all composition data in this paper are in % by weight).

40|$|AbstractAluminum allay A 6061 is {{commonly}} applied T 6 heat treatment and {{ultimate tensile strength}} above 300 MPa is obtained by solid solution strengthening. The T 6 treatment consists of solution treatment, water quenching and artificial aging. Lower cooling rate during quenching is very important because impurity phase deposition in solution phasedue to longer quenching delay results in growth of grains in the aging process and less strengthening. The quenching delay time strongly depends on boiling transition from film boiling to nucleate boiling as well as heat capacity of the solid. Stable wetted situation hardly occurs in the film boiling region and film boiling heat transfer coefficient is one or two digit {{lower than that of}} the nucleate boilingheat transfer. In this research, <b>dip</b> (<b>bath)</b> and spray quenches were applied to thick A 6061 hollow cylinders to get comparable spray cooling rate with the conventional dip quenching. Temperature histories in the cylinder were measured during quenching and inside temperature distribution was estimated with inverse heat conduction analysis. After the T 6 treatment, tensile test pieces were cut away from the cylinder and effectiveness of the spray quench was accessed. The spray quenchingtests were done for water temperature of 10 - 22 oC and the maximum total spray flow rate of 20 L/min with four or eight spray nozzles around the cylinder. For the dip quenching, test piece was soaked into well stirred water pool at a fixed temperature of 18 oC. From the spray quenchtests, the quenching delay time was difficult to keep within the allowable maximum delay time requested from existing metallurgical studies. It was found that higher water flow rate or larger number of nozzle arrangement will be required to obtain comparable cooling rate with the dip quenching result. However, each tensile test showed that the strength of spray quenched materials is almost equivalent to that of dip quenching and satisfied the minimum tensile strength of A 6061 -T 6 regulated by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) B 8270...|$|R

Potential market uses and requirements are reported, along {{with a discussion of}} the technical properties required of vegetable-based solvents for comparison with conventional organic solvents. This report examines the opportunities as well as the constraints and barriers affecting uptake and further development of bio-solvents. There is increasing legislative pressure encouraging change and these driving forces such as legislation to reduce use of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) and measures to control the use of hazardous substances in the workplace are reviewed and discussed. Estimates of market costs, and, where available, costs of commercially available products are used for comparison with conventional organic solvents. Vegetable oil derived fatty acid esters have a number of characteristics which suit their use in the solvent sector. Rape methyl ester has a high solvating capacity, due to its small ester group, but conversely, its long carbon chain length (predominantly C 18) leads to relatively high viscosity and its high levels of unsaturation restricts the natural life of the oil through oxidative degradation. The latter is only of concern where long term recycling and re-use are considerations (i. e. in cleaning <b>dip</b> <b>baths).</b> In the solvent market, there appears to be limited opportunity for use of rape fatty acid esters in the surface coating sector, which is increasingly converting to use of water-based formulations. Other vegetable oils predominate in this sector because of technical advantages in terms of drying time or ability to cost effectively produce alkyl resins. The second most important industrial user of solvents in the UK is the printing industry, both in ink formulations and in wash down solutions.

Regardless of the concentrations and duration of exposure, survival of fish in NaCl treatment differed significantly (P < 0. 05) from the untreated controls. Effective concentration ranges of NaCl were 0. 2 – 0. 8 g/L and 0. 2 – 1. 0 g/L in the yolk sac and swim-up fry respectively at exposure duration of 15 min. No fry survival was recorded at a concentration of 10. 0 g/L for either stage of development. The mean 24 h LC 50 values for the yolk sac and swim-up fry were 0. 61 and 0. 70 g/L NaCl respectively. Sodium chloride may be used as prophylactic treatment in early stages of C. gariepinus but could be toxic at longer exposure times. However, empirical tests on efficacy of NaCl on pathogens are recommended...|$|R
