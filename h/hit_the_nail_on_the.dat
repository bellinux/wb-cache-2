500|$|Tucson, Arizona based Big Splash Games {{was formed}} in late 2005 by three {{veterans}} of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this {{for a few months}} when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co-founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, [...] "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they [...] "had <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head".|$|E

The music video leaked onto the Internet on April 4, 2007, after briefly being available for digital download on iTunes Store. It initially premiered on Yahoo! Music on April 5. The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] really <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're all a little insane, but it's so clear now that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it. She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E

[...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations.

2500|$|Cato Uticensis (95–46). His mother's {{brother was}} the {{reformer}} Livius Drusus. His father's grandfather was the famous censor, Cato the Elder (234–149). Here, Cato (also called 'the Younger') {{was a rare}} man among the aristocracy, [...] "a man of the best intentions and of rare devotedness", yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached [...] "to country and to its hereditary constitution" [...] he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, [...] "dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion", might have made [...] "a tolerable state accountant." [...] Walking [...] "in the sinful capital as a model citizen and mirror of virtue" [...] he would 'scold' those out of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics [...] "his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head." [...] The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a [...] "strange caricature" [...] of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the Stoa, the younger Cato would speak in [...] "scholastic wisdom" [...] and appeared as [...] "this cloud-walker {{in the realm of}} abstract morals." [...] Yet like his ancestor, he began [...] "to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no interest, to decline badges of distinction as a soldier", and like the legendary king Romulus to appear shirtless. In [...] "an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude." [...] As [...] "the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the Optimate party." [...] He never missed a senate meeting, and [...] "as long as he lived he checked the details of the public budget." [...] Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato's tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than [...] "setting his face against every one who deviated" [...] from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this [...] "Don Quixote of the aristocracy" [...] proved the exhaustion of senate politics.|$|E
