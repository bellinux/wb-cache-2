40|$|To {{establish}} a fisheries particular La- 11 k, a national-wide fisheries economic survey concerning fisheries finance and management {{was conducted in}} 1905. Based on the survey document for Nagasaki prefecture, this paper describes fisheries finance, {{the necessity of a}} fisheries bank, fisheries capital investment and its components as well as income and expenditures, We will also compare it to the national average. The fisheries of that time including the fish processing industry corresponded to the final stage of the non-motorized era and required much more convenient fisheries finance for further industrial development. Due to a weak economic basis, the fisheries finance was finally subsidized by state bank finance instead of the establishing a separate fisheries bank. This process was legislated by means of the amendment of the fisheries law and the governmental ba. l 1 k law in 1910. Fisheries finance wa. s characterized in pre-capitalistic ways such as short-time loans with high interest, liquidated debt from fish jobbers or leeches with marine products. On the other hand, bank finance was rare even in a <b>documentary</b> <b>bill</b> and especially for canning factories and modern industry. The capital investment of Nagasaki which was composed of equity capital, jobber loans, bank loans, and leech loans was almost equal to that of other prefectures. However a number of Nagasaki fisheries had the advantage of whaling, coral collection, canning, and fishing in Korea. By district, Tsushima Island tended to carry a loan of floating capital from outsiders because fishermen came from other districts. By commodity, export items like dried squid producers relied on loans from traders in Nagasaki port and coral collection from jobbers in other prefectures. This paper also analyzes the capital, income and expenditures of representative fisheries in Nagasaki prefecture such as the beach-seine and lift-net for sardine, set-net for tuna, gill-net for yellowtail, pole and line for skipjack as well as dried skipjack processing, canning, and dried squid processmg...|$|E
