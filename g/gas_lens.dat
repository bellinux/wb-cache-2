40|$|We {{document}} a gas lensing {{technique that}} generates a converging shock wave in a two-dimensional wedge geometry. A successful design must satisfy three criteria at the contact point between the <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> and the wedge leading edge to minimize nonlinear reflected and other wave effects. The {{result is a}} single-point solution in a multidimensional parameter space. The <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> shape is computed using shock-polar analysis for regular refraction of the incident shock at the <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> interface. For the range of parameters investigated, the required gas-lens interface is closely matched by an ellipse or hyperbola. Nonlinear Euler simulations confirm the analysis and that the transmitted shock is circular. As the converging transmitted shock propagates down the wedge, its shape remains nearly uniform with less than 0. 1 % peak departures from a perfect circular cylinder segment. Departure from the design criteria leads to converging shocks that depart from the required shape. The sensitivity to incident shock Mach number, {{as well as the}} qualitative effects of the presence of boundary layers are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|When {{the walls}} of an {{open-ended}} horizontal steel pipe are heated before the pipe is rotated along its axis, the exchange of the expelled heated air with the incoming cooler air, sucked in along the axis, results in a medium capable of focusing a laser beam propagating along the pipes axis a spinning pipe <b>gas</b> <b>lens.</b> However, {{the interaction of the}} heated and cooler air generates local density fluctuations which generate aberrations on the laser beam wavefront. We present results for the characterisation of these aberrations using a Shack- Hartmann wavefront sensor. The measurements show that along the axis, rotating the pipe decreasesy-tilt {{as a result of the}} removal of distortions caused by gravity, although there is an increase in higher-order aberrations. However, in the boundary layer, the dominant aberration isx-astigmatism which increases with rotation speed. The results are confirmed by the measurement of the beam quality factor which increases as a result of the increase in the size of the higher-order aberrations. The spinning pipe <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> is a device which can be used to focus laser beams using air only, but, in the process, the air introduces distortions which reduce the quality of the beam...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhen a {{shock wave}} crosses an {{interface}} between two materials, this interface becomes unstable and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability develops. Such instability {{has been extensively}} studied in the planar case, and numerous results were presented during the previous workshops. But the Richtmyer-Meshkov (Richtmyer, 1960, ``Taylor Instability in Shock Acceleration of Compressible Fluids,'' Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 13 (2), pp. 297 - 319; Meshkov, 1969, ``Interface of Two Gases Accelerated by a Shock Wave,''Fluid Dyn., 4 (5), pp. 101 - 104) instability also occurs in a spherical case where the convergence effects {{must be taken into}} account. As far as we know, no conventional (straight section) shock tube facility has been used to experimentally study the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in spherical geometry. The idea originally proposed by Dimotakis and Samtaney (2006,'' Planar Shock Cylindrical Focusing by a Perfect-Gas Lens,'' Phys. Fluid., 18 (3), pp. 031705 - 031708) and later generalized by Vandenboomgaerde and Aymard (2011, ``Analytical Theory for Planar Shock Focusing Through Perfect <b>Gas</b> <b>Lens</b> and Shock Tube Experiment Designs,'' Phys. Fluid., 23 (1), pp. 016101 - 016113) was to retain the flexibility of a conventional shock tube to convert a planar shock wave into a cylindrical one through a perfect <b>gas</b> <b>lens.</b> This can be done when a planar shock wave passes through a shaped interface between two gases. By coupling the shape with the impedance mismatch at the interface, it is possible to generate a circular transmitted shock wave. In order to experimentally check the feasibility of this approach, we have implemented the <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> technique on a conventional shock tube {{with the help of a}} convergent test section, an elliptic stereolithographed grid, and a nitrocellulose membrane. First experimental sequences of schlieren images have been obtained for an incident shock wave Mach number equal to 1. 15 and an air/SF 6 -shaped interface. Experimental results indicate that the shock that moves in the converging part has a circular shape. Moreover, pressure histories that were recorded during the experiments show pressure increase behind the accelerating converging shock wave...|$|E

By employing the specular microscope, the corneal epithelia of 60 patients who had worn contact lenses for more than 1 year were re-examined along with 15 myopic controls. The morphological changes in aphakic patients who changed from extended wear soft to extended wear rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> were also studied. The mean cell area of the corneal epithelium was 621. 5 (SD 92. 5) microns 2 for daily wear rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> (n = 15), 645. 8 (98. 1) microns 2 for daily wear soft lenses (n = 15), and 634. 7 (88. 6) microns 2 for extended wear rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> (n = 15), none of which differed significantly from the control value of 610. 5 (98. 1) microns 2.

40|$|Gas lenses work on {{the basis}} that {{aerodynamic}} media can be used to generate a graded refractive index distribution which can be used to focus a laser beam. An example is a spinning pipe <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> (SPGL). It is a steel pipe whose walls are heated to a preselected temperature and then rotated along the axis to any desired speed to generate a cooler core of incoming air. A laser beam propagating through these lenses is focussed in space. However, experimental observation has shown that distortions are generated in the beam. We provide a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the lens and experimental results of the Zernike aberrations measured using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor which show that the aerodynamic medium in the lens have a deleterious effect on laser beam quality (M 2). The effect on the SPGL is that the beam deterioration increases with rotation speed and temperature though the worst M 2 measured at speed 20 Hz and temperature 155 °C was ∼ 3. 5 which is fairly good. © 2010 SPIE.

40|$|When {{a heated}} pipe is axially rotated, the {{dynamics}} of the gas inside exhibit properties reminiscent of a positive lens. These are the result of a parabolic distribution of refractive index in the pipe, which is caused by a special mixing of hot and cold gases. When a laser beam was propagated, along the pipeâ€™s axis, a focal spot was observed. In this report, results of a numerical model are presented using the basic equations of a graded refractive index (GRIN) lens provided a tool to visualize a Gaussian beam propagating through such a lens. Experimental data are presented to demonstrate how the lensing properties depend on the rotation rate and pipe temperature. The lens is essentially a graded refractive index (GRIN) lens whose power is a result of both of these variables. The data show that, if either is increased, the power of the lens increases. An empirical formula relating focal length, temperature and rotation rate is derived. Future research, which could not be done in time, can look at measuring aberrations generated by the <b>gas</b> <b>lens,</b> the beam quality factor and analyzing the intensity profile of its output beam.

40|$|When a metal {{horizontal}} pipe {{is heated}} and spun along its axis, a graded refractive index distribution is generated which is {{can be used}} as a lens, thus its name, the spinning pipe <b>gas</b> <b>lens</b> (SPGL). Experimental results showed that though increase in rotation speed and/or temperature resulted in a stronger lens and removed distortions due to gravity, it also increased the size of higher order aberrations resulting in an increase in the beam quality factor (M 2). A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was prepared to simulate the aerodynamics that show how it operates and, in the process shed some light on the optical results. The results of the model consist of velocity profiles and the resultant density data and profiles. At rest the cross-sectional density profile has a vertical symmetry due to gravity but becomes rotationally symmetric with a higher value of density at the core as rotation speed increases. The longitudinal density distribution is shown to be parabolic towards the ends but is fairly uniform at the centre.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of computerized corneal topography in (1) fitting cosmetic rigid <b>gas</b> permeable contact <b>lenses</b> on normal corneas and (2) patients who have keratoconus.

In 13 patients, the first rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lens</b> was chosen {{on the basis of}} corneal topography using the EyeSys videokeratoscope and contact lens software version 2. 11 w. Thirteen control patients were fitted with rigid <b>gas</b> permeable contact <b>lenses</b> by means of diagnostic contact lenses. The number of parameter changes required in each group to reach the best fit were compared. In study 2, the records of 28 patients (41 eyes) with keratoconus who had been successfully fit with rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> were reviewed. Topographic analysis using the EyeSys videokeratoscope was conducted. The following 8 data points were analyzed: maximum dioptric curvature with respect to the central visual axis, the power at the visual axis (VK), the average keratometry readings within the 3 -mm zone, the average flat K at 3 -mm central and 5 -mm paracentral regions, and the K reading at 1. 5, 2. 0, and 2. 5 mm superior to the visual axis. RESULTS: Study 1 : In 10 eyes (38 %) fitted with cosmetic contact lenses utilizing corneal topography and the EyeSys contact lens program, the first lens chosen by the computer program was correct with no additional changes in lens parameters required. In the other 16 eyes, 21 parameter changes were required. In the control group, 14 eyes (53 %) required no additional change in parameters from the original contact lens that was fitted using diagnostic lenses. In the other 12 eyes, 12 parameter changes were required. Study 2 : In the keratoconus group, of the 9 measurements analyzed, the final base curve of patients' rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> was correlated most closely with the average flat corneal curvature at the 3 -mm central zone.

40|$|What {{is meant}} by the term ‘specialist contact lens fitting’? Or put another way, what would be {{considered}} non-specialist contact lens fitting? Is {{there such a thing}} as routine contact lens fitting? Soft or silicone hydrogel fitting for daily wear would probably be considered as routine contact lens fitting, but would extended or flexible wear remain in the same category or would they be considered a specialist fit? Different eras will classify different products as being ‘specialist’. Certainly twenty years ago soft toric contact lenses were considered as being speciality lenses but today would be thought of as routine <b>lenses.</b> Conversely, <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> were thought of as mainstream twenty years ago but now are considered as speciality lenses. Although this would not be the same globally, as in some countries (such as Netherlands, France and Japan) <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lens</b> fitting remains popular and is not on the decline as in other countries (Canada, Australia and Sweden) [1]. Bandage soft lenses applied after surface laser refractive procedures would be considered as therapeutic lenses but in reality they are just plano thin hydrogel lenses worn constantly for 3 – 4 days to allow the underlying epithelium to convalesce and are then removed [2]. Some patients find that wearing hydrogel lenses during periods when they suffer from seasonal allergies actually improves their ocular comfort as the contact lens acts as a barrier to the allergen [3] and [4]. Scleral lenses have long been considered speciality lenses, apart from a time when they were the only lenses available but at that time all contact lens work would have been considered speciality practice! Nowadays we see the advent of mini-scleral designs and we see large diameter <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> too. It is possible that these lenses increase the popularity of <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lenses</b> again and they become more main stream. So it would seem that the lines between routine and speciality contact lens fitting are not clear. Whether a lens is classed a specialist fit or not would depend on the lens type, why it was fitted, where in the world the fitting was being done and even the era in which it was fitted. This begs the question as to what would be considered entry level knowledge in contact lens fitting. This may not be an issue for most BCLA members or CLAE readers but certainly would be for bodies such as the College of Optometrists (UK) or the Association of British Dispensing Opticians when they are planning the final registration examinations for budding practitioners or when planning the level of higher level qualifications such as College Certificates or Diplomas. Similarly for training institutions when they are planning their course content. This becomes even trickier when trying to devise a qualification that spans across many countries, like the European Diploma in Optometry and Optics. How do we know if the training and examination level is correct? One way would be to analyse things when they go wrong and if patterns of malpractice are seen then maybe that could be used as an indicator to more training being needed. There were 162 Fitness to Practice Hearing at the General Optical Council between 2001 and 2010. Forty-seven of these were clinically related case, 39 fraud related, and 76 others. Of the clinical ones only 3 were contact lens related.

Thinnest, steepest, and maximum elevation corneal locations were evaluated from topographies collected with Pentacam Eye Scanner. RESULTS:: In the entire sample and in N-CL and CL-W, the thinnest location does not overlap with the steepest or maximum elevation corneal locations (all P > 0. 05). The thinnest and maximum tangential curvature locations were found to be located further away from the geometric center of the cornea in CL-W versus N-CL (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION:: The thinnest corneal location does not overlap with maximum axial and tangential curvatures or with the front and back elevation locations in keratoconus subjects. Contact lens wear does not affect this lack of overlapping. Menicon Co., Ltd. Center of Physics, University of Minho, Braga, PortugalClinical & Experimental Optometry Research La...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} standing wave and ultrasound devices for cleaning contact lenses, the extent of coverage of an arbitrary soilant (mascara) {{on the surface of}} a high-water and a low-water content soft lens and a rigid <b>gas</b> permeable <b>lens</b> was evaluated before and after use of the Soft MateR professional Cleaning Unit (standing wave) and the SonaseptTM Ultrasonic Contact lens Cleaner and Disinfector (ultrasound). The standing wave unit removed all the mascara, but some mascara remained following ultrasound treatment. The antimicrobial efficacy of the two units was investigated by challenge with three bacteria (S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) and two fungi (C. albicans and A. fumigatus). Although the viable counts of some organisms were significantly reduced, the overall data does not support the use of either device as being clinically efficacious for disinfection...|$|R
