One of her principal stipulations was the films be shot in Britain with an all-British cast, {{which has been}} generally adhered to. Rowling also demanded that Coca-Cola, the victor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> tie in their products to the film series, donate US$18million to the American charity Reading is Fundamental, {{as well as several}} community charity programs.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, {{physicist}} and atomic scientist Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Hume Cronyn) praises {{the discovery of}} atomic energy, but also warns of its dangers. American scientists such as Matt Cochran (Tom Drake), working {{under the guidance of}} Dr. Enrico Fermi (Joseph Calleia) and Dr. Marré (Victor Francen), have split the atom, and essentially beaten the Germans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> create an atomic bomb. With the assistance of Albert Einstein (Ludwig Stössel), they inform President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Godfrey Tearle) that a monumental discovery has been made.|$|E
5|$|She was {{acutely aware}} of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E

5|$|The current IIHF rules differ {{slightly}} from the rules used in the NHL. One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is standard rink dimensions: the NHL rink is narrower, measuring 61m×26m (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft) The larger international size allows for a faster and less physical style of play. Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icing is called. In the NHL, a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) is not behind an attacking player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> the end-zone faceoff dots in his defensive zone, {{in contrast to the}} IIHF rules in which play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line. The NHL and IIHF also differ in penalty rules. The NHL calls five-minute major penalties for more dangerous infractions of the rules, such as fighting, in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games. This is in contrast to the IIHF rule, by which players who fight are ejected from the game. Beginning with the 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some were already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and the two-line pass. Others were not picked up by the IIHF, such as those requiring smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding, and interference penalties.|$|E
25|$|Pigeon {{racing is}} {{the sport of}} {{releasing}} specially trained racing pigeons, which then {{return to their homes}} over a carefully measured distance.

25|$|The {{division}} was mobilized as the 8th Infantry Division in August 1914 {{and sent to}} the west for the opening campaigns of the war.

The division then spent time in the trenches, and fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. During the German Spring Offensive of 1918, the division fought in the Battle of the Lys. The {{division was}} rated a first-class division with high morale by Allied intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Santorum, who had {{previously}} run an essentially one-state campaign in Iowa, was able to organize a national campaign after his surprising victory there. He unexpectedly carried three states in a row on February 7 and overtook Romney in nationwide opinion polls, becoming the only candidate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> effectively challenge the notion that Romney was the inevitable nominee. However, Romney won {{all of the other}} contests between South Carolina and the Super Tuesday primaries, and regained his first-place status in nationwide opinion polls by the end of February.|$|E
25|$|The key {{challenge}} in the work was finding a pure piece of RNA to sequence.

He was beaten <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> be the first to sequence a tRNA molecule by a group led by Robert Holley from Cornell University, who published the sequence of the 77 ribonucleotides of alanine tRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1965.

25|$|When the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) {{came into}} power in 2004, Mukherjee won a Lok Sabha (the popularly elected {{lower house of}} Parliament) seat for the first time. From then until his {{resignation}} in 2012, Mukherjee was practically number-two in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government. He held {{a number of key}} cabinet portfolios—Defence (2004–06), External Affairs (2006–09) and Finance (2009–12)—apart from heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha. After securing the UPA's nomination for the country's presidency in July 2012, Mukherjee comfortably defeated P. A.

25|$|In July 1954, the AERE was reorganised {{into the}} United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Modifications to Harwell's Hangar 7 {{in order to}} house the machine began that year. Despite its {{advanced}} design, the price tag was modest: about US$1million. By late 1956 {{it was clear that}} ZETA was going to come online in mid-1957, beating the Model C stellarator and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> produce a working machine.|$|E
25|$|The 26th Reserve Division spent World War I on the Western Front.

It was relieved from the Somme in October 1916 and spent the winter of 1916-1917 in the Artois. In 1917, it {{fought in the}} Battle of Arras. In 1918, it fought in the German Spring Offensive and against the subsequent Allied offensives and counteroffensives. Allied intelligence rated the division as first class.|$|E

Bob Barr, a former U.S. Congressman, was considered an early frontrunner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> <b>to</b> replace Isakson, but Barr withdrew his candidacy for personal reasons, shortly before Price entered the race. Price went onto run against two fellow state senators, Chuck Clay and Robert Lamutt, as well as two state representatives, Roger Hines and Mark Burkhalter. Also taking part in the race was John McCallum, a former aid to U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division {{fought in}} the opening phases {{of the war in}} the Battle of the Frontiers. It then participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Race</b> <b>to</b> the Sea, {{including}} the Battle of Arras in October 1914. It remained in the trenchlines in Flanders until 1916, when it entered the Battle of the Somme in August 1916. In April 1917 the division, now redeployed to the Vimy sector, participated in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. In late 1917, it participated in the Battle of Passchendaele. In 1918, the division {{fought in the}} Battle of the Lys. The division ended the war still fighting in the Lys region. Allied intelligence rated the division as a good division in 1917, but third class in 1918.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, the {{division}} {{served on the}} Western Front.

The Infantry Life Regiment was transferred from {{the division}} in 1915 to become part of a provisional German mountain division, the Alpenkorps, sent to the Italian Front. In 1916, the division went into the Battle of Verdun. After Verdun, it went to the Somme in that battle's later stages. 1917 was spent mainly occupying the trench lines.
