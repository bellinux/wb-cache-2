5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when <b>he</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although <b>he</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When <b>he</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

Grabbing two spears, he attacked the daytime head. As the head began to die and fall, the opposite head woke from its slumber, angry and distressed.

Then the serpent dove underwater towards a tunnel deep in the lake to escape, but Xwechtáal took the last spear and nailed the serpent head before he got away.|$|E

Vijaya and Kuveni had two children: Jivahatta and Disala. Vijaya established a kingdom, which was named Tambapanni ("copper-red hands"), because the men's hands were redenned by the red soil of the area.

25|$|Lavalle and Paz {{move their}} armies to Santa Fe and Córdoba each one. López managed to force Lavalle {{to send his}} troops to a region rich in mío mío, a toxic grass: five hundred horses died, half of his cavalry. Lavalle {{attempted}} to return to Buenos Aires, and met Rosas and López {{at the battle of}} Márquez Bridge, where he was defeated. López returned to Santa Fe, because Paz had successfully conquered Córdoba and feared that his province may be next. Completely defeated, Lavalle headed unescorted to Rosas’ base of operations and requested to parley with him. It was late and Rosas was not there at the time, so he was allowed to sleep at Rosas’ bedroom. When <b>he</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> Rosas was next to his bed and invited him with a mate. Lavalle, regretful of the execution of Dorrego, agreed to step down from power. They signed the Cañuelas Pact, calling for elections of members of a new legislature. Lavalle would stay as governor during the transition. They proposed an unified ballot, with both federal and unitarian candidates.|$|E

25|$|In {{that stage}} thirteen, the {{temperature}} was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, Marcel Molinès and Abdel-Kader Zaaf, broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks. Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molinès rode through alone. Zaaf {{did not agree with}} the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree. When <b>he</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> he realized that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he was not used to the alcohol. Behind the two North-African cyclists, Kübler had attacked, and left his rivals Raphaël Géminiani and Louison Bobet minutes behind. Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with Kübler.|$|E

25|$|Two convicts—pianist Susumu Yamaji, {{arrested for}} murder, and card shark Shinpei Konta, a five-time convict—are handcuffed {{together}} while being escorted on a train. An avalanche causes {{the train to}} derail, trapping their escorting officer, and the two run into the mountains. They find a forest ranger's hut and wait, failing to break the handcuff chain with a rock. Susumu proceeds {{to tell the story}} of how he was arrested for murder: After his orchestra was disbanded, Susumu became depressed, drinking and ceasing to compose music until he met Saeko Ozora, the star singer of a traveling circus, and he started writing songs for her. When it was time for the circus to change locations, Susumu made an offer for her to stay and study music, but he received a letter of rejection. Susumu, drunk and angry, confronted the ringmaster for oppressing her, and when <b>he</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> found a bloody knife in his hand and the ringmaster dead. In the mountains, the police find them, so the two hide in a nearby town while evading officers. Left with no choice but to escape the handcuffs, Shinpei proposes a game of chance to decide whose hand would be cut off, and in a doctor's office they choose from a cup laced with sleeping pills. However, Shinpei had put powder in both cups and did not swallow his, amputating his own hand instead. When Susumu wakes up, the officer who arrested him explains that Shinpei was Saeko's father and a member of her circus, and had realized that Susumu was framed by the deputy ringmaster, who ended up confessing. Susumu reunites with Saeko with new songs for her to sing.|$|E
