5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and <b>her</b> <b>dinner</b> companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} composed in the key of B major and set in common time signature, with it having a dance pop tempo of 110 beats per minute. Lo's vocals span from the low note of B3 to the high note of C5. The song has a minimal and upbeat electronic instrumentation which consists of drums, bass, backup vocals and Lo's voice. The song starts with the words [...] "oh oh", which repeat after every sentence of the verses. The chorus contains the millennial whoop, a vocal melody repeating on the fifth and third notes in a major scale. Some critics noted a contrast between the track's lyrics and production. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork stated that the song [...] "contrasts a giant hook and chorus with snappy verses filled with quietly distinct, often strange imagery: of [...] eating <b>her</b> <b>dinner</b> in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, seducing dads on playgrounds". Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press described [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] as a [...] "synth-based pop song with a sweeping chorus", but noted that the lyrical content of the track {{was similar to that}} of rock 'n' roll music. The singer herself stated that: [...] "You can feel the lyrics and the dark and sad but if you combine it with, brings a little to the dark humor as well. I like the thing of dancing along and then listening to what I'm actually saying." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{final section}} is [...] "The Pain" [...] which explores the {{difficulty}} piecing together one's {{life after the}} destruction and demise of a relationship through [...] "distraught" [...] lyricism and melancholic pop. The section opens with the [...] "thunderous" [...] electropop power-ballad [...] "Thousand Miles", which lyrically depicts Lo's obsession with reuniting with her lost love at all costs, {{even if it means}} running [...] "a thousand miles". Musically, the mid-tempo track tells a story of a girl [...] "struggling to forget a rocky relationship with an ex," [...] and is sonically amped up by the singer’s [...] "emotionally distraught" [...] vocals and [...] "thundering" [...] drum rhythms. The following song, [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] sees her emotionally unravel even more, as she talks about self-medicating by smoking marijuana to cope to live without her lover. It's [...] "snappy" [...] verses are filled with [...] "quietly distinct, often strange imagery", including Lo eating <b>her</b> <b>dinner</b> in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, and seducing dads on the playground. Musically, it is a Purity Ring-inspired song, and creates a calming atmosphere compared to that of morphine. [...] "This Time Around" [...] is a dark Charli XCX-inspired track which reflects on the lessons learned from a heartbreak. Lo's vocal performance on the song has been described as particularly yearning and broken. The final song of the section and album is [...] "Run on Love", an [...] "easy-going" [...] reworked nu-disco dance collaboration with EDM producer Lucas Nord. Lyrically, Lo sings of picking up her heart and choosing to no longer be a victim by living in the moment enjoy time with her lover before it runs out.|$|E
