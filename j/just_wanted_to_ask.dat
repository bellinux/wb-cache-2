30|$|Assessing {{outcomes}} of educational efforts {{in terms of}} competence {{has a long tradition}} in fields of general education and gained particular recognition through international large-scale assessments such as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). However, respective efforts to measure domain-specific vocational and professional competences are still rare. In 2011, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched the research initiative ‘Technology-Based Assessment of Skills and Competencies in Vocational Education and Training (ASCOT)’. The initiative aimed at the development of computer-based instruments for the assessment of domain-specific competences in selected vocations in Germany on the basis of authentic work and business processes. The work presented in this paper is part of a research project entitled ‘Modelling and measuring domain-specific problem-solving competence of industrial clerks (DomPL-IK)’. 1 In the following, we want to highlight two innovative features of our competence measurement in the business domain: (1) With problem-solving competence we address higher-order competences instead of just knowledge reproduction. Therefore, we did not only develop complex problem scenarios within an authentic office simulation but also provided an open-ended and authentic problem space for working on these problems rather than apply highly structured items (e.g., multiple choice items). The analysis of the participants’ complex behavior patterns was based on a theoretically driven competence model and on item response theory (IRT). (2) As an alternative to relying on detached self-report questionnaires, we implemented an integrated measurement of non-cognitive facets of competence (i.e., facets of self-concept and interest) that we refer to as ‘Embedded Experience Sampling’ (EES): Test-takers in a complex problem-solving task are requested to stop at certain times during the test and spontaneously answer short prompts regarding their actual experience of the problem situation (e.g., ‘Your colleague Julian visits your office: Hi, how are you? I heard {{you have to deal with}} a rather large task. Well, I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how you are doing.’; answers were to be given on a four-point Likert scale, e.g. from ‘At the moment, I feel not at all confident’ =  1 to ‘… very confident’ =  4). The project is located in commercial vocational education and training (VET). Nevertheless, the approach is applicable in other domains as well.|$|E

[...] The singer recognizes that he is not a [...] "handsome Dan" [...] or a [...] "sweet talking Romeo" [...] and admits that he has [...] "been around a time or two". [...] He is not bothered with the {{possibility}} that the woman may have [...] "been around too." [...] Although the singer knows how messy and rough love can be, he claims that he is ready for it, but insists that the woman must also be equally tough and willing to take chances. [...] The song is in some ways reminiscent of Springsteen's earlier song [...] "Thunder Road", in which the singer <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> take the woman away, even though he tells her that [...] "you ain't a beauty but hey you're alright". But unlike the earlier song, in this song the singer's goals are more realistic — rather than looking to run away with the woman, here he <b>just</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the woman <b>to</b> dance.In the context of this song the phrase, 'There's another dance, {{all you have to do}} is say yes,' is an allusion to taking a chance and falling in love.This is echoed in the song 'Girls in their Summer Clothes' which includes the line 'Love's a fools' dance, I ain't got no sense, but I've still got my feet.' ...|$|R

40|$|Communication has an {{important}} role in our life. According to Gartside communication is the art of sharing anything. In its vital sense it means a sharing of ideas and feelings in a mood mutual understanding (1986 : 1). Thus, people can cooperate with each other when they communicate just as they do in any other shared activity. Communication is usually defined as conversation, namely for sending and receiving message. If the message cannot be received it means that communication does not work well. In order to make communication run in harmony, the hearer should know the speaker’s aim. Moreover, everyday we adapt our conversation to different situations. Among our friends for instance, we can easily say something that would be seen discourteous among strangers and we avoid over formally with our friends. In both situations above we try to avoid making the hearer embarrassed and uncomfortable. People generally behave in accordance with their expectation concerning their public self-image or face <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be respected. Face means public self- image of a person; it refers to the emotional and social sense of self that everyone has and expects everyone to recognize (Yule, 1996 : 60). Face has two aspects, positive and negative. An individual’s positive face is reflected in his or her desires to be liked, approved of, respected of and appreciated by others. While an individual’s negative face is reflected in the desire not be impeded or put upon, to have the freedom to act as one chooses (Thomas, 1995 : 169). Therefore, people in their relationship need to preserve both kinds of faces for themselves and the people they interact with the politeness utterances. According to Brown and Levinson (1987 : 65), certain kinds of acts intrinsically threaten face, namely those acts that by their nature run contrary <b>to</b> the face <b>wants</b> of the hearer and / or of the speaker. For example, the hearer’s positive face will damage when the speaker insulting the hearer, and also the vi hearer’s negative face will damage when the speaker order the hearer. It also could damage the speaker’s own positive and negative face for example, when the speaker admits that he has failed in his job and when the speaker offers help to the hearer. FTAs are acts that infringe on the hearer’s need to maintain his or her self- esteem and be respected, [URL] In order to avoid or minimize to reduce the possibility of damage to the hearer’s face or to the speaker’s own face, he or she may adopt certain strategies. Brown and Levinson sum up human politeness behavior in four strategies among them are the bald on record strategy, the positive politeness strategy, the negative politeness strategy, and bald off record strategy. For example: a. Put your jacket away. b. You must be hungry, it’s a long time since breakfast. How about some lunch? c. I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you if I could use your computer? d. It’s bit cold in here. The example (a) is the example of bald on-record strategy, it shows that the speaker does nothing to minimize threats to the hearer’s face. The example (b) is the positive politeness strategy. It shows that the speaker recognizes the hearer’s desire to be respected. It also confirms that the relationship is friendly and expresses group reprocity. The example (c) is negative politeness. It shows that the speaker actually recognizes the hearer’s face but it also shows that the speaker in someway imposes the hearer to borrow the computer. The last example (d) is bald off record strategy, the speaker is trying to avoid FTAs by <b>asking</b> the hearer <b>to</b> close the window. Instead the speaker expects the hearer to close the window. Considering the phenomena above, the speaker should be able to produce the appropriate politeness strategy for being considered as a polite person. Furthermore, the researcher is interested to analyze the politeness strategies based on Brown and Levinson’s politeness strategy in a film. The film entitled “In Good vii Company” has a good solid story of a middle-aged man dealing with both supporting his family and keeping his job (bordering on a mid-life crisis), and a young man dealing with a new job, being alone, and finding what he actually <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the rest of}} his life. The story puts the situation most in a workplace, where the different statuses such as friend, client, boss or the superior interact as the result there are many politeness strategy employed in this movie. Since there are many employment of positive politeness strategy found in the dialogue in the film entitled “In Good Company”. The researcher tries to analyse them. To clarify the research background, the following example will give clear understanding about it. Alex Foreman : Dad, I’m not gonna be a professional tennis player. Dan Foreman : Well, look, sweetheart, being a writer is just as tough. (Taken from “In Good Company”) The example above shows that Dan as the speaker employs positive politeness strategy 4, namely uses in-group identity markers. Actually, Dan disagrees with Alex because he <b>wants</b> Alex <b>to</b> be a professional tennis player not a writer. Dan uses the word ‘sweetheart’ to address Alex in order to minimize the FTAs (advise). It is not only to consider the relative power or status difference between father and daughter to be small but also to soft the imperative by indicating that it is not a power back command. Thus, Alex positive face is saved because she has been appreciated by her father. In order to understand more about positive politeness strategy and what factors influence the characters to employ the politeness strategy, the researcher viii intends to conduct a research entitled An Analysis of Positive Politeness Strategy in the Film Entitled “In Good Company...|$|R
