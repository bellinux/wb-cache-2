30|$|Under the “Kind of goods” criterion, {{logistics}} {{facilities are}} first {{broken down into}} two categories {{depending on whether the}} nature of the goods processed in the facility is specific (for example, fresh food or industrial goods) or generic (as pallets, or parcels). Some generic-goods facilities are distinguished according to the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> the goods: parcels (CLASS C), other less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments (CLASS D) or all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> (CLASS E). Other specific-goods facilities are distinguished according {{to the nature of the}} goods: equipment, food, or beverages. Some facilities cannot be described by the nature of the goods processed, or by the <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> the goods processed, either because this information is not available, or because the goods processed are too specific and do not justify a single category (for example, transport terminals specialized in high value goods, or goods that require a special handling – CLASS A), or because the facility can process different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> goods at the same time or at different times. For example, when observing a warehouse operated by the logistic branch of an industrial company, or by a logistics provider serving industrial companies, or by an industrial wholesaler, it is difficult to say whether the goods stored in the facility are intermediate goods (stored before being transformed), capital goods (stored before being used as a production factor), or even finished goods (stored before being commercialized – except for the industrial wholesaler).|$|R
