25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

She felt less emotionally connected to Italy than with Greece and southern France and found the writing [...] "uncommonly troublesome", although [...] "as recipe after recipe came out... <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> much I was learning, and how enormously these dishes were enlarging my own scope and enjoyment".

We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on.

500|$|With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto {{wanted to}} take the idea of a game [...] "world" [...] even further, giving players a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it.

Ne-Yo told MTV: [...] "Apparently Beyoncé {{was at a}} show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on...The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement {{and that makes it}} a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." [...] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but thought {{that it would be better}} suited for Beyoncé, and later regretted giving the song to her. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, [...] "I said I originally wrote the song for me....Once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friday the 13th was Nelson's {{first feature}} film, {{and when he}} went in for his first {{audition}} {{the only thing he}} was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, [...] "It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> much blood was in it." [...] Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the [...] "practical joker victim" [...] of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter's Halloween, or Bob Clark's Black Christmas before that. He served {{as a model for the}} slasher films that would follow Friday the 13th.|$|E

2500|$|As Nintendo {{released}} its first home video game console, the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System), Miyamoto made {{two of the}} most momentous titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: Super Mario Bros. (a sequel to Mario Bros.) and The Legend of Zelda (an entirely original title). In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores, unlike many games of the time. Super Mario Bros. largely took a linear approach, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. By contrast, Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda, forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was expansive and seemingly endless, offering [...] "an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game." [...] With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto sought to make an in-game world that players would identify with, a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each Zelda title embodies this sense of exploration. [...] "When I was a child," [...] Miyamoto said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in Zeldas labyrinthine dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System peripheral.|$|E
