For a reasonable parameterization of the mass loss, there may be convergence of all WR stars, both single and in binaries, to a narrow band of small <b>final</b> <b>masses.</b> Our representative model, a 4. 25 solar-mass WR presupernova derived from a 60 solar mass star, is followed through a simulated explosion, and its explosive nucleosynthesis and light curve are determined. Its properties are similar to those observed in Type Ib supernovae. The effects of the initial mass and mass loss on the presupernova structure of small mass WR models is also explored. Important properties of the presupernova star and its explosion can only be obtained by following the complete evolution starting on the main sequence...|$|R
5|$|The <b>final</b> <b>mass</b> test session {{before the}} new season {{took place at the}} track over 1–3 April. On the first day, in hot weather conditions, Mitch Evans set the fastest lap of the morning session with a time of 1:42.479, with Jordan King setting the quickest lap of the day in the {{afternoon}} session with a 1:41.494. An overnight sandstorm caused the second day's running to be delayed for one hour while circuit officials cleaned the track. Sergey Sirotkin was the fastest driver in the morning session with a lap of 1:41.797, and Nobuharu Matsushita recorded the quickest lap of the afternoon session with a time of 1:40.191. Pierre Gasly recorded the fastest lap time of the three days, a 1:39.632 in the morning session, and Nigel Melker was the quickest driver in the afternoon session with a lap of 1:41.566.

40|$|Recently the observationally derived stellar-wind mass-loss {{rates for}} Wolf-Rayet stars, or massive naked helium stars, have been revised {{downwards}} by a substantial amount. We present evolutionary calculations of helium stars incorporating such revised mass-loss rates, {{as well as}} mass transfer to a close compact binary companion.

Alexander Rossi set the quickest lap of the day in the afternoon session with a one-minute and 40.604 seconds lap. Rio Haryanto recorded the fastest lap of the three days, a one-minute and 39.129 seconds in the second day's morning session, and Daniël de Jong paced the afternoon session with a time of one minute and 40.508 seconds.

25|$|With all {{photosynthetic}} organisms gone, {{atmospheric oxygen}} {{can no longer}} be replenished, and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter in about a billion years, Earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away, while the Earth's liquid outer core cools due to the inner core's expansion and causes the Earth's magnetic field to shut down. In the absence of a magnetic field, charged particles from the Sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the Earth's temperature to an average of ~420 K (147°C, 296°F) in 2.8 billion years, causing the last remaining life on Earth to die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun's life, such will cause the <b>final</b> <b>mass</b> extinction in Earth's history (albeit a very long extinction event).|$|E
25|$|The <b>final</b> <b>mass</b> test session {{before the}} new season {{took place at the}} Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, just north of Barcelona over 25 February–27. All the teams, with the {{exception}} of Super Aguri attended this three-day test which was affected by rain on the first day. On day one, Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was fastest having recorded a lap of 1:22.276, followed closely by the Ferraris of Räikkönen and former seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. Hamilton continued to top the charts on the second day, with new teammate, Kovalainen second. Räikkönen was third on a 1:21.722, having been joined at the track by his teammate Felipe Massa. Massa's best lap of 1:22.513 was only good enough for fifth place, with Kazuki Nakajima's Williams splitting the Ferraris. On the final day, the Toyota of Jarno Trulli topped the timesheets with the fastest lap of the test, recording a lap of 1:20.801 during a qualifying run. Second was the Red Bull mount of David Coulthard, having missed the previous day's running due to requiring treatment on a trapped nerve.|$|E

500|$|The {{next stage}} is called oligarchic accretion. It is {{characterized}} by the dominance of several hundred of the largest bodies—oligarchs, which continue to slowly accrete planetesimals. No body other than the oligarchs can grow. At this stage the rate of accretion is proportional to R2, which is derived from the geometrical cross-section of an oligarch. The specific accretion rate is proportional to and it declines with the mass of the body. This allows smaller oligarchs to catch up to larger ones. The oligarchs are kept at the distance of about [...] (= is the Hill radius, where a is the semimajor axis, e is the orbital eccentricity, and Ms is the mass of the central star) from each other by the influence of the remaining planetesimals. Their orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain small. The oligarchs continue to accrete until planetesimals are exhausted in the disk around them. Sometimes nearby oligarchs merge. The <b>final</b> <b>mass</b> of an oligarch depends on the distance from the star and surface density of planetesimals and is called the isolation mass.

40|$|GKH 94] 41 and IRAS 04191 + 1523 B were {{previously}} identified to be proto-brown dwarf candidates in Taurus. [GKH 94] 41 was classified to be a class I object. The dereddened spectral energy {{distribution of the}} source was later found to be suggestive of a class II object. IRAS 04191 + 1523 B is a class I object that is the secondary component of a binary. We determine the evolutionary stage of [GKH 94] 41 and estimate the <b>final</b> <b>masses</b> of the two proto-brown dwarf candidates. We used archive millimeter observations to produce continuum maps and collected data from the literature to construct the spectral energy distribution of the targets. Our continuum maps revealed that both [GKH 94] 41 and IRAS 04191 + 1523 B are surrounded by envelopes. This provides direct evidence that [GKH 94] 41 is a class I object, not class II, as previously classified. For IRAS 04191 + 1523 B, our continuum map spatially resolved the binary. Our estimated <b>final</b> <b>masses</b> are below 49 ^+ 56 _- 27 M_ J and 75 ^+ 40 _- 26 M_ J for [GKH 94] 41 and IRAS 04191 + 1523 B, respectively.
