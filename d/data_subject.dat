40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increasing}} need for sharing data repositories containing personal information across multiple distributed and private databases. However, such <b>data</b> sharing is <b>subject</b> to constraints imposed by privacy of individuals or <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> as well as data confidentiality of institutions or data providers. Concretely, given a query spanning multiple databases, query results should not contain individually identifiable information. In addition, institutions should not reveal their databases to each other apart from the query results. In this paper, we develop a set of decentralized protocols that enable data sharing for horizontally partitioned databases given these constraints. Our approach includes a new notion, l-site-diversity, for data anonymization to ensure anonymity of data providers {{in addition to that}} of <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> and a distributed anonymization protocol that allows independent data providers to build a virtual anonymized database while maintaining privacy for both <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> and <b>data</b> providers. ...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} <b>data</b> <b>subject’s</b> consent as a legal basis due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The research method of this master’s thesis is legal dogmatic. The provisions of the GDPR are analyzed against {{the provisions of the}} Data Protection Directive (DPD). The focus of the research is on defining whether the GDPR will change <b>data</b> <b>subject’s</b> consent as a legal basis for processing personal data in comparison to the situation under the DPD. The requirements for a valid consent provided for in the GDPR have previously to a quite large extent existed in the opinions of the Article 29 Working Party, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and legal literature. Nevertheless, the GDPR changes <b>data</b> <b>subject’s</b> consent as a legal basis through at least two mechanisms. Firstly, {{the context in which the}} requirements for a valid consent are interpret has changed, inter alia, as the GDPR emphasizes protection of <b>data</b> <b>subject’s</b> rights and sets forth strong accountability and transparency principles. Secondly, the GDPR clarifies and makes legally binding more requirements for a valid consent in comparison to the DPD. For example, it explicitly forbids the use of opt-out based consents and provides <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> with the right to withdraw consent at any time. Thus, the GDPR tightens the requirements for a valid consent and data controllers need to ensure that all consents they base their processing on meet these GDPR’s requirements...|$|R

Data users claim that significant benefits from free information exchange are passed on to <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> and that these benefits outweigh any potential privacy violations. A central issue in this ongoing debate is answering the question, “who owns and who controls personal information”. Using the theory of property rights, we argue that personal information is a public good. We analyze responses from 459 New Zealanders to a contingent valuation survey to estimate the economic value <b>data</b> <b>subject’s</b> place on a hypothetical change to data protection laws that gives <b>data</b> <b>subject’s</b> an enforceable, property right in their personal information.

40|$|Transparency {{is a key}} {{principle}} of EU data protection law and the obligation to inform is key to ensuring transparency. The purpose of this obligation is to provide <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> with information {{that allows them to}} assess the compliance and trustworthiness of the data controller. Despite the benefits of categorising personal data for this purpose, a coherent and consistent approach to doing so under the obligation to inform has not emerged. It is unclear what a ‘category’ of personal data is and when this information must be provided. This results in reduced transparency for <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> and uncertainty for data controllers regarding their legal obligations, defeating the purpose of this obligation. This article highlights these issues and calls for clarification on them. It also posits that in clarifying the law, a new approach to categorising personal data is required, to achieve the benefits of categorisation and increase the transparency of personal data processing for <b>data</b> <b>subjects...</b>|$|R
