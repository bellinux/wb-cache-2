Architect William Pereira designed the new building which was completed in 1972. The murals were rolled up and removed to storage.|$|E

25|$|The common {{mountain}} or {{forest pasture}} used for transhumance in summer is called seter or bod / bua. The same term {{is used for}} a related mountain cabin, which {{was used as a}} summer residence. In summer (usually late June), livestock is moved to a mountain farm, often quite distant <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> farm, in order to preserve meadows in valleys for producing hay. Livestock were typically tended for summer by girls and younger women, who also milked and made cheese. Bulls usually remained at the home farm. As autumn approached and grazing became in short supply, livestock are returned to a home farm.|$|E
25|$|Cattle drives had {{to strike}} a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as 25 miles in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they would be hard to sell when they reached the end of the trail. Usually they were taken shorter {{distances}} each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night. On average, a herd could maintain a healthy weight moving about 15 miles per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was 1,000 miles long.|$|E
25|$|In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), a {{unanimous}} Court {{held that the}} Fourth Amendment normally requires law enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a dwelling. Today’s opinion holds that evidence seized <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> following a violation of this requirement need not be suppressed. As a result, the Court destroys the strongest legal incentive {{to comply with the}} Constitution’s knock-and-announce requirement. And the Court does so without significant support in precedent. At least I can find no such support in the many Fourth Amendment cases the Court has decided in the near century since it first set forth the exclusionary principle in Weeks v. United States.|$|E

25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>home.</b> The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E
25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure fentanyl powder was seized by Border Patrol agents in California from a vehicle that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit fentanyl for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic fentanyl lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing fentanyl instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk fentanyl and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China.|$|E

Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune was [...] "annoyed" [...] at {{the destruction of the}} Roadhouse in the second season finale, as she [...] "really loved Ellen". Diana Steenbergen of IGN also favored Ellen from the beginning, believing her to be [...] "a great addition to the show". She deemed Ellen [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't have a lot of in their lives right now".|$|E
500|$|Questions about Farmer's use of {{taxpayer}} funds continued to dog him throughout {{the general election}} campaign. Democrats demanded that Farmer reimburse the state for hotel expenses charged to the state while Farmer was conducting outreach activities at the KHSAA state basketball tournament and the Kentucky State Fair, both located fewer than [...] from his home. In May, the office of Democratic State Auditor Crit Luallen notified the Internal Revenue Service that Farmer had failed to report personal use of his state vehicle as income. A spokesman for Farmer's office said that the personal mileage had been tracked, but a department employee had failed to forward it to the state Personnel Cabinet for reporting; he added that Farmer would file amended tax documents and have deductions taken from his wages to settle the tax liability. The state Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint against Farmer in September based on an anonymous email sent to the Personnel Cabinet claiming that, after work hours, Farmer directed an agriculture department employee to purchase a small refrigerator with state funds and deliver it to Farmer's house. A department spokesman said Farmer spent {{a substantial amount of}} time working <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> office in 2010 due to a back injury and that the refrigerator had been moved to department offices in 2011.|$|E
