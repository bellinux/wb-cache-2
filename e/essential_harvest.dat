5000|$|Plantation of grape's own rooted saplings {{used for}} making wines are {{normally}} planted on hill slopes with good drainage conditions in a plot spacing of 8.5 x 4.5 ft or 9 x 5 ft {{to have a}} planting of 2,000 to 3,000 plants per ha. Other methods of planting practices are to adopt [...] "in-situ grafting on dog ridge" [...] or from other root stocks. Plantation is done from middle of December to end of January. Harvesting is done from January end to middle of April. Plantations are protected by trellising. Irrigation is an essential requirement except during the rainy season. Harvesting is done by manual labour. Fertilizers such as Nitrogen, Phosphate, and Potash of appropriate dosages are added as nutrients at specified intervals. Intercultural operations such as rising green manure crops to control soil erosion, conserve moisture by organic mulching and clearing grasses by mowing on the borders at regular intervals are also essentially practiced. Pesticides or insecticides {{are not to be}} applied; however, fungicides are sprayed and the last such spraying is to be done 45 days before harvesting. Pruning, training the plants to maintain appropriate positions are <b>essential.</b> <b>Harvesting</b> is done during the winter months when the temperature is below 20 C. Harvesting is done by manual labour by collecting best bunches of grapes for crushing.|$|R

40|$|Effect {{of water}} stress on growth and yield {{performance}} of four wheat cultivars viz. Pasban- 90, Barani- 83, Punjab- 85 and Rohtas- 90 was studied at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. Water stress during reproductive development decreased grain yield ha - 1 of wheat compared with control through reduction {{in number of}} fertile tillers m - 2 and grains per spike and 1000 -grain weight but {{did not differ significantly}} from water stress during the vegetative development. Rohtas- 90 produced higher grain yield than Barani- 83 both under normal and water stress conditions but was statistically at par with Pasban- 90 and Punjab- 85. The result suggested that water stress during vegetative and reproductive development is equally injurious to wheat and adequate water supply throughout crop development is <b>essential</b> to <b>harvest</b> its maximum biological potential. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Piezoelectric {{materials}} are <b>essential</b> for <b>harvesting</b> energy from mechanical vibrations. Thin films of piezoelectric materials including AlN and binary perovskite compounds PZT are widely studied for a fabrication of energy harvesting MEMS. The piezoelectric materials have held a key {{position in the}} energy harvesting devices. Varieties of bulk piezoelectric ceramic {{materials are}} studied and used in practice for the piezoelectric sensors and/or actuators. However, piezoelectric properties of the thin film materials are different from bulk properties due to their structural differences. The characters of the thin film piezoelectric materials are not fully understood yet. For making a better energy harvesting device, a fundamental discussion will be necessary for the thin film piezoelectric materials. In this paper, first the fundamentals of thin film piezoelectric materials and the process design are discussed, and then novel piezoelectric thin films of PZT-based ternary perovskite compounds are proposed as an example for making the improved energy harvesting MEMS...|$|R
40|$|Exploitation {{of marine}} living {{resources}} for food is an age-old practice but this exploitation was largely restricted to near shore {{regions in the}} sea. The improvements in the capabilities of exploitation during the past half a century have helped in increasing harvests of living resources from the coastal waters as well as deeper regions of the sea. The rapid increase in the human population and the consequent increased demand for protein-rich seafood, {{have led to the}} exploitation of marine fisheries resources to their optimum levels in most cases. Fisheries resources being renewable, managing them on a sound scientific basis is <b>essential</b> to <b>harvest</b> maximum sustainable economic yields on a continual basis, year after year. The basis for such a management is knowledge of the dynamics of every species that contribute to the fishery. The tropical seas, however, unlike their counterparts in the temperate regions, are inhabited by a large number of species. In many cases the species live together sharing the same habitat and food. Several families are represented by several genera and several closely resembling species and any non-selective (or the least selective) gear exploits a large number of species in one haul...|$|R

5000|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} {{to develop a}} genetic cross {{that will make the}} plant more tolerant to colder temperatures and to unravel the drought tolerance mechanisms, since it is native to tropical climates [...] In the United States, this is important because the cost of corn was steadily increasing due to its usage in ethanol production for addition to gasoline.

The plants need to be harvested during the time when the plant's total moisture content is between 63 and 68 percent, to prevent lodging. Approximately, this is when the grain reaches the [...] "soft dough" [...] stage. More research has found that sorghum has higher nutritional value compared to corn when feeding dairy cattle. And the type of processing is also <b>essential</b> in <b>harvesting</b> the grain's maximum nutrition.

40|$|Background The hydatid disease {{parasite}} Echinococcus granulosus has {{a restricted}} lipid metabolism, {{and needs to}} <b>harvest</b> <b>essential</b> lipids from the host. Antigen B (EgAgB), an abundant lipo-protein of the larval stage (hydatid cyst), {{is thought to be}} important in lipid storage and trans-port. It contains a wide variety of lipid classes, from highly hydrophobic compounds to phospholipids. Its protein component belongs to the cestode-specific Hydrophobic Ligand Binding Protein family, which includes five 8 -kDa isoforms encoded by a multigene family (EgAgB 1 -EgAgB 5). How lipid and protein components are assembled into EgAgB particles remains unknown. EgAgB apolipoproteins self-associate into large oligomers, but the func-tional contribution of lipids to oligomerization is uncertain. Furthermore, binding of fatty acids to some EgAgB subunits has been reported, but their ability to bind other lipids and transfer them to acceptor membranes has not been studied.

40|$|Artificial photosynthesis, an {{important}} route towards future supply of renewable energy, seeks to convert sunlight into storable chemical energy such as fuels. Building upon {{the principles of}} biological solar energy conversion, artificial photosynthesis {{can be broken down}} into four <b>essential</b> processes: <b>harvesting</b> of visible light, charge (electron-hole) separation, oxidation of water to dioxygen, and fuel formation. Importantly, unlike natural photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis is solely dedicated to efficient formation of fuels and is not restricted by the availability of arable land. Both water oxidation and fuel formation require efficient and selective catalysts. This work utilises certain metalloenzymes, which have evolved to catalyse fuel-generating reactions such as the formation of H 2 or the reductive activation of CO 2 to carbon-based fuels with unmatched efficiencies. In contrast to most artificial catalysts, these enzymes are composed solely of abundant elements and operate efficiently at neutral pH. Thus, although not suitable for scale-up, they can be used to mimic conditions under which future devices will have to operate and provide design criteria for the components of applied technologies. In this thesis, physico-chemical techniques are used to study the mechanism of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, the most proficient H 2 evolving catalysts that rival platinum in activity, by investigating how reversible inhibitors intercept transient enzyme states. The interaction of fuel-forming enzymes with light-absorbing semiconductor electrodes is also explored, leading to the construction of a photoelectrochemical cell for the selective, light-driven reduction of CO 2. Furthermore, this thesis demonstrates that metalloenzymes can be used to establish new directions in artificial photosynthesis research, driving endergonic organic reactions such as specific C=C hydrogenation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{storage of}} sweetpotato roots {{is a great}} {{challenge}} for smallholder farmers in Mozambique. Piecemeal harvesting allows several months supply of roots for household consumption provided weevil infestation is avoided. The objectives of the present studies were to determine yield and changes in key macro- and micronutrients associated with early or late harvesting of orange-fleshed sweetpotato cultivars in Mozambique. Four trials representing harvesting periods of 3, 4, 5 or 6 months after planting were established at Gurue in 2015.

However, thin film silicon solar cells are suffering from a problem of weak absorption of incident light and hence, light trapping mechanism is <b>essential</b> for the <b>harvesting</b> of maximum solar radiation. In this paper, we present the performance of solar cell using an efficient back reflector composed of multilayer thin film (SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4) and a diffraction grating. The use of a back reflector showed enhanced light absorption due to the folding of unabsorbed light coming to it after crossing the active region in a wide wavelength range. Further, the effect of active layer thickness and grating height were also discussed for the optimal performance of the solar cell. In the case of magnetic transverse mode, a relative enhancement in cell efficiency about 79 and 21 % respectively have been observed with respect to a planar and SC 4 solar cells.

40|$|AbstractFresh water {{resources}} {{are the major}} natural resources of Georgia. Despite of 810 000 m 3 of water produced annually per one km 2 of {{the country on the}} average, water supply of population at its Eastern part is an acute issue. Under more or less equal conditions in the Western and the Eastern parts of Georgia with nearly the same population the annual fresh water volume per capita is nearly four times less in Eastern Georgia. Moreover the annual runoff distribution per month for irrigation purposes is irregular here. The development of agriculture requires the proper use of land and {{water resources}}. This is especially true in dry and semi- dry regions, where due to the hard natural conditions the water is <b>essential</b> for <b>harvesting.</b> The purpose of study was creation of geographical information system (GIS) of water resources. Kakheti region has been selected to carry out the research. Region is reach in fertile and pasture lands. It is the country's leading viticulture region. The major part of the population are engaged in agricultural activities. It is notable for its deficit of water resources in the country. Areas of non-irrigated land in the region is 90 385 ha. Water resources of the region are used irrationally. Depreciated and emergency state of irrigation schemes is the main headache of nearly all municipalities. Poor repair of network is a reason of high water losses. So the existing water consumptions problems hinder development of agriculture considerably. Due to the global warming and progression of the process of desertification, will aggravate fresh water problem even more and presumably may lead to migration of local population from the area. To mitigate and adjust the above said processes is to proceed to the controlled water consumption with a view to use water resources more rationally...|$|R
40|$|In organic agriculture, soil {{fertility}} is <b>essential</b> for <b>harvesting</b> high quality crop yields. Plant nutrient cycles {{should be kept}} short and as closed as possible. Therefore, {{it is important to}} have sustainable growing systems that have rotations with appropriate crops and cover crops. In organic farming green manures and cattle manure are also used to ensure fertile and biologically active soil and to enhance biodiversity. Green manures offer supporting services, such as nutrient cycling, promotion of beneficial insects for pest control and soil formation. Also the catch crops on winter period are essential to reduce nutrient leaching (Stark and Porter, 2005). Growing system does not only influence the {{soil fertility}}, but through that also the quality parameters of crops (Olesen et al, 2009; Mäder et al, 2002). In recent years food metabolomics has been used as a novel method for `fingerprinting` or for ´profiling´ food samples (Hajšlova et al, 2011). `Fingerprinting` of food samples enables to perform comparative analyses aimed at detection of differences. ´Profiling´ is used for identification individual, differential sample components (both primary and secondary metabolites). Production system and interaction among the microbial population are important factors that also affect food safety and shelf life (Guerzoni et al., 1996). Among the microorganisms, some moulds, yeasts, bacteria, and viruses have both desirable and undesirable roles in our food. Most bacteria, moulds, and yeasts, because of their ability to grow in foods, can potentially cause food spoilage, however mere microbial presence does not reduce the quality of food, except in the case of some pathogens (Ray, 2005). The aim of present study was to investigate the influence of green manures as intercrops and these combined with composted cattle manure on microbiological quality and metabolomic fingerprinting of winter wheat in a crop rotation experiment in three organic systems at the Estonian University of Life Sciences in 2012. ...|$|R
