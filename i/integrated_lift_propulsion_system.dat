25|$|The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, {{together}} with the F135 engine, is an aircraft <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> designed {{for use in the}} STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II.

50|$|There are 3 F-135 variants: the -100 engine, -400 engine, and the -600 engine.  The -400 {{is similar}} to the -100, the major {{difference}} being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials. The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering.

40|$|Supersonic capable STOVL fighter/attack {{aircraft}} {{can provide}} capabilities for close support and air superiority {{which will be}} highly desirable in the future. Previous papers in this session described the historical aspects, trade-offs, and requirements for powered <b>lift</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems,</b> and it is shown that propulsion technology is more key {{to the success of}} this type of aircraft than for any previous fighter/attack aircraft. The NASA Lewis Research Center program activities which address required propulsion technology development are discussed.

2500|$|The team {{responsible}} {{for developing the}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, {{under the leadership of}} the United States Department of Defense Joint Strike Fighter Program Office. Paul Bevilaqua, Chief Engineer of Lockheed Martin Advanced Development Projects (Skunk Works), invented the <b>lift</b> fan <b>propulsion</b> <b>system.</b> The concept of a shaft-driven lift-fan dates back to the mid-1950s.

40|$|The <b>lifting</b> and <b>propulsion</b> {{mechanism}} {{of a novel}} biped robot inspired by the basilisk lizard's water-walking function has been developed. The movement trajectories of the Watt-I planar linkage are brought out by combining the movement equations of the four-bar mechanism and the coordinate transformation equations, which are used to simulate the foot trajectories of the basilisk lizard, and the <b>lifting</b> and <b>propulsion</b> {{mechanism of}} the biped robot walking on water is carried out. The links' parameters are optimized by taking the trajectories overlap ratio as the objective function. The prototype of the biped robot walking on water is manufactured {{by the results of}} the kinematic analysis on the robot. And the <b>lifting</b> and <b>propulsion</b> force curve on the robot from water is measured. The experiment results show that the <b>lifting</b> and <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> can satisfy the function requirement of the biped robot walking on water...|$|R
50|$|The diver lockout {{system was}} removed in 1984 {{in favour of}} longer {{durability}} and possibilities to rescue a full Swedish submarine crew of 35 in one <b>lift.</b> The original <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> with thrusters {{at the sides of}} the URF was also removed in favour of a more conventional propeller in the aft, providing more power and a reduced risk of damaging the thrusters during operation. The original trailer was replaced with on which has more axles. This, together with some minor changes of the fin, allowed transportability by air beginning in 2000.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} RSRA {{fuselage}} configurations on rotor performance and loads have been quantified analytically {{by means of}} currently available potential flow and rotor analysis. Four configurations of the Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA) were considered in this study. They were: (1) fuselage alone (conventional helicopter); (2) fuselage with auxiliary propulsion; (3) fuselage with wings (auxiliary lift); and (4) fuselage with both auxiliary <b>lift</b> <b>propulsion.</b> The rotor <b>system</b> investigated was identical to a CH- 47 D front rotor except that it had four instead of three blades. Two scaled-down {{versions of the same}} rotor were also analyzed to determine the effect of rotor scale on the fuselage upwash effects. The flight conditions considered for the upwash study are discussed. The potential flow models for the RSRA configuration, with and without the wings and the auxiliary <b>propulsion</b> <b>system,</b> are presented. The results of fuselage/wing/propulsion system upwash on performance and loads are also presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept for}} {{automatic}} terminal area guidance, comprising two modes of operation, {{was developed and}} evaluated in flight tests. In the predictive mode, fuel efficient approach trajectories are synthesized in fast time. In the tracking mode, the synthesized trajectories are reconstructed and tracked automatically. An energy rate performance model derived from the <b>lift,</b> drag, and <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> characteristics of the aircraft {{is used in the}} synthesis algorithm.

5000|$|Guests {{are seated}} two per seat (toboggan-style, with the taller person {{sitting in the}} rear and the shorter person sitting in front) and fasten their seatbelts. The train is {{dispatched}} from the station and quickly engages with an electrified center rail at that base of the lift that provides power to an electric motor beneath each of the train’s four cars. Riders {{make their way to}} the top of the 70 ft spiral lift where the train disengages the electrified rail and allows gravity to take over. The <b>lift</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> is identical to those found on Anton Schwarzkopf’s various [...] "Jet Star" [...] models. After leaving the lift, the train slowly picks up speed as it travels down the first drop at a shallow angle. At the bottom of the first drop, the track banks sharply to the right and turns around 200 degrees before beginning to ascend the second hill. There, riders have a chance to catch their breath as the train slowly makes a 220-degree turn to the left. Before long the train is accelerating rapidly down a swooping turn to the right where riders are treated to the most exhilarating portion of the ride - a 270-degree turn through the trees and within feet from the ground. After re-emerging from the foliage, the train ascends to the midcourse brake run, where the train could be stopped if the need arose. After passing through the brakes, the track banks to the right and the speeding train hugs the spiral lift with a 200-degree turn (during the late 1970s, when the Whizzer ran more than three trains, riders would pass right by the next train full of riders making their way up the spiral lift). Next, the train dips down over a small pond and up into a few more dips and turns before completing the ride with a large 585-degree helix. Riders finally exit the woods and head into the brake run before returning to the station.|$|R
