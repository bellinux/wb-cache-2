500|$|A British {{parliamentary}} motion {{put forward}} by Labour MP Kate Hoey in February 2013 to retrospectively condemn the Viscount attacks and memorialise the victims {{on the anniversary of}} the second shootdown prompted outcry in the Zimbabwean press, with the Herald branding it a racist [...] "Rhodie motion" [...] intended to antagonise the Mugabe administration and its supporters. Dumiso Dabengwa, a former ZIPRA commander, described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher Mutsvangwa, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration [...] "a provocation... means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> sons and daughters in and outside the country." [...] ZAPU's official response to Hoey's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts [...] "civilians get caught up in cross-fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors", and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi.|$|E

2500|$|For {{us to live}} in an oil-dependent {{society is}} to live in fear. [...] The fear of {{terrorism}} funded with the very dollars we spend at the gas pump. [...] The fear of war to defend or defeat oil-fueled regimes in the Mideast.

Citing Father Bezdikian, an Armenian priest living in Venice, Italy whose grandfather served and fought during the siege: [...] "Franz Werfel is the national hero of the Armenian people. His great book {{is a kind of}} consolation to us— no, not a consolation, there is no such thing— but it is of eminent importance to us that this book exists.

2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard I had to work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family.

40|$|Security is {{cultivated}} and mobilized by enacting exclusionary practices, {{and exclusion}} is cultivated and realized on security grounds. This article explores the political dangers that lie in this connection, dangers which {{open the door}} to a fascist mobilization in the name of security. To do so the article first asks: what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> understanding of fascism if we view it through the lens of security? But then a far more interesting question emerges: what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> understanding of security if we view it through the lens of fascism? Out of these questions it is suggested that the central issue might be less a question of "security and exclusion" and much more a question of "security and extermination. ...|$|R
2500|$|On 10 April 2005, Thaksin Shinawatra {{presided over}} a merit-making {{ceremony}} at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which is {{within the walls of}} the Grand Palace and contains the most revered Buddha figure in Thailand. Starting October 2005, the website of Manager newspaper ran an article alleging that the Prime Minister had usurped a royal function of the King by presiding over the ceremony. [...] This led Sondhi to start using [...] "We Love the King", [...] "We Will Fight for the King", and [...] "Return Power to the King" [...] as his key anti-Thaksin rallying slogans. [...] This allegation has been repeated in Sondhi's [...] "Thailand Weekly" [...] live tapings. It also became a staple of the thaiinsider.com website of Ekkayuth Anchanbutr, operator of the Charter pyramid scheme. A widely circulated anonymous spam email showed a picture of Thaksin sitting on a chair normally used by the King and asking, [...] "People are familiar with images only of the King and members of the Royal Family, all dressed in royal uniforms and decorated with full regalia, presiding over grand ceremonies in the temple’s main chapel.

60|$|On {{the evening}} I cannot dwell. All the horses {{got out of}} the paddock, went across, and smashed my neighbour's garden into a big hole.

I went out at once with a lantern, staked up a gap in the hedge, was kicked at by a {{chestnut}} mare, who straightway took to the bush; and came back. A little after, they had found another gap, and the crowd were all abroad again. What has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own garden nobody yet knows.|$|E

This I knew nothing about, not being in the habit of inquiring into cargoes. Well, in some way or other, which I don't understand, not being a scientific man myself, a magnetic connection was formed between these boxes, and also, if I got the story straight, between them and the iron hull of our vessel, so that it became, in fact, an enormous floating magnet, one of the biggest things of the kind on record. I have an idea that this magnetic condition was the cause of the trouble to our machinery; every separate part of it was probably turned to a magnet, and they all stuck together." ...|$|E

60|$|The fair {{account of}} the matter is this. Our trade had, as we have just seen, {{increased}} to so astonishing a degree in 1761, as to employ British and foreign ships to the amount of 707,659 tons, which is 149,500 more than we employed {{in the last year of}} the peace.--Thus our trade increased more than a fifth; our British navigation had increased likewise with this astonishing increase of trade, but was not able to keep pace with it; and we added about 120,000 tons of foreign shipping to the 60,000, which had been employed in the last year of the peace. Whatever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> shipping in the former years of the war, this would be no true state of the case at the time of the treaty. If we had lost something in the beginning, we had then recovered, and more than recovered, all our losses. Such is the ground of the doleful complaints of the author, that the carrying trade was wholly engrossed by the neutral nations.|$|E
6000|$|These {{attacks were}} {{generally}} {{spread over a}} year and a half. On the first occasion the god which always accompanied the priest to the garden and back again, would show animosity by roaring at him. On the second he would seize his hand and bite off one of the fingers, as <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Kalubi, a wound that generally caused death from blood poisoning. If, however, the priest survived, on the third visit it killed him, for the most part by crushing his head in its mighty jaws. When making these visits the Kalubi was accompanied by certain dedicated youths, some of whom the god always put to death. Those who had made the journey six times without molestation were selected for further special trials, until at last only two remained who were declared to have [...] "passed" [...] or [...] "been accepted by" [...] the god. These youths were treated with great honour, as in the instance of Komba and on the destruction of the Kalubi, one of them took his office, which he generally filled without much accident, for a minimum of ten years, and perhaps much longer.|$|E
60|$|The smith's shop was, of course, in open space: {{the large}} bellows were carried {{to and from}} the rock every tide, for the {{serviceable}} condition of which, together with the tinder-box, fuel, and embers of the former fire, the smith was held responsible. Those who have been placed in situations to feel the inconveniency and want of this useful artisan, will be able to appreciate his value in a case like the present. It often <b>happened,</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> annoyance and disappointment, in the early state of the work, when the smith {{was in the middle of}} a favourite heat in making some useful article, or in sharpening the tools, after the flood-tide had obliged the pickmen to strike work, a sea would come rolling over the rocks, dash out the fire, and endanger his indispensable implement, the bellows. If the sea was smooth, while the smith often stood at work knee-deep in water, the tide rose by imperceptible degrees, first cooling the exterior of the fireplace, or hearth, and then quietly blackening and extinguishing the fire from below. The writer has frequently been amused at the perplexing anxiety of the blacksmith when coaxing his fire and endeavouring to avert the effects of the rising tide.|$|E
