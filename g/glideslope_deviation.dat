40|$|Introduction: The goal of {{this thesis}} is to test the {{flyability}} of a display system that uses a King Radio KEAO- 346 altimeter and Micrologic ML- 3000 LORAN-C receiver for final approach guidance and to model {{the dynamics of the}} altimeter and the Micrologic ML- 3000 LORAN-C tracking loop. The altimeter and LORAN-C receiver provide position information that provides navigation in the vertical and horizontal planes, respectively, and that is displayed as <b>glideslope</b> <b>deviation</b> and XTK deviation to the pilot. The display system will be subject to flight tests that will have the twofold purpose of testing the flyability of the display system and of determining the dynamics of the navigation equipment. The flight tests will be a set of missed approaches to a runway with an ILS. The testing of the flyability of the display system will be a qualitative analysis of a pilot's reaction to the display form. The analysis will consist of comments from the pilot who flies the flight tests. The flight tests will be simply a set of missed approaches to a runway with an ILS. The system dynamics will be determined by comparing the recorded altimeter and LORAN-C navigation data with the simultaneously-recorded ILS navigation data. The glideslope angle from the ILS data will be compared to that of the arctangent of the altitude divided by the range. The localizer angle from the ILS data will be compared to that of the arctangent of the XTK error divided by the range. By also modeling the altimeter and Micrologic LORAN-C receiver dynamics, the data comparisons will provide information on not only system dynamics but also individual component dynamics. The flight tests will have the aim to excite the dynamics of the LORAN-C receiver by doing zig-zag patterns during the approach. The comparisons between the ILS and display system data will be done under the assumption that ILS dynamics are negligible with respect to the system dynamics. LORAN-C is a hyperbolic line-of-position (LOP) system by which a receiver can be located at the intersection of two hyperbolas. This is accomplished by measuring the difference in arrival times between two pairs of pulses emitted from three fixed transmitting sites as ground waves. The transmitting stations may be designated as Master M, Slave X, and Slave Y. One hyperbola is determined by the X minus M pair of stations, the other hyperbola by the Y minus M pair of stations. Through the use of cesium clocks, each station transmits precisely-timed, pulsed RF signals. A pulse transmitted by the Master is received by Slave X, which will synchronize itself to the Master and then transmit its own pulse a fixed time later. The Slave Y station, also synchronized to the Master, will transmit a fixed time after it receives the Slave X signal, in order to avoid ambiguities. LORAN-C pulses are transmitted on a 100 kHz carrier in groups of eight pulses and with a group repetition (Master-Slave X-Slave Y) rate ranging from 10 groups per second to 25 groups per second. The pulses in a group are spaced 1000 pus apart. A LORAN-C chain, which is a group of stations with one master and at least two slave stations, is distinguished from others by its group repetition interval (GRI), which is the time (in tens of microseconds) that the chain cycles through its master-slave transmission sequence. Currently, there are sixteen LORAN-C chains throughout the world. For the New England area, the common LORAN-C chain is the 9960 chain or the chain that has the GRI of 99600 pis. In practice, {{there are a number of}} ways that are used to locate oneself using LORAN-C. One method is to locate the actual time differences (TD's) given by a LORAN-C receiver on a special LORAN-C map. For modern receivers, the TD's can be displayed as latitude and longitude so that a special LORAN-C map is not required. Other methods that come as options on most modern receivers are to have the receiver display numerically the receiver's range and bearing to a recorded waypoint or to have the receiver display graphically cross-track error from a path determined by two waypoints (starting point and destination). Since LORAN-C can only provide navigation in the local horizontal plane because pulses are transmitted as ground waves, other means such as a barometric altimeter are necessary to provide vertical navigation data for final approach guidance. Over the past two decades, because of the increase in processing power and the corresponding decrease in cost, LORAN-C has become a viable option for aircraft navigation. The increase in processing power has increased the speed by which LORAN-C signals can be locked onto and has decreased the volume of the receiver so that it can be considered as an optional piece of equipment for the cockpit panel. Airborne units can be purchased for as little as $ 400 per unit, exclusive of antenna and installation costs. Errors in TD measurement are set by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and by the dynamic response of the tracking loop of the user's receiver. Errors in position determination can result from warpage in the local line-of-position (LOP) or from coordinate conversions such as from TD's to lat-long. Reference 9 shows that for static tests, the repeatability accuracy in over 90 % of the average area in the Northeast and Southeast United States is better than 80 meters, and that in 50 % of the same coverage area, the accuracy is better than 40 meters. The dynamic response of LORAN-C is limited by the response of the receiver's tracking loops to noise and vehicle accelerations. Studies by the Department of Transportation and the State of Vermont showed that LORAN-C accuracy met FAA AC 90 - 45 A specifications (Reference 3 : 'Approval of Area Navigation Systems for Use in the US National Airspace System ') for enroute, terminal area,and non-precision approach use. Non-precision approaches using LORAN-C have become more acceptable to FAA approval, as exemplified by their approvals in the recent past for LORANC non-precision approaches at Burlington, Vt. airport and at Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts. The thesis will follow the methodology of the following outline. Chapter 2 will introduce the display form and the manner in which it displays the navigation information. Chapter 3 will look in detail at the flight test data-taking equipment and methodology. Chapter 4 will explain how the altimeter and LORAN-C tracking loop were modeled. Chapter 5 will show the flight test results and the analysis that was done on the results using the modeling from Chapter 4. Chapter 6 will then provide a discussion of the display's flyability and the data analysis. Appendix A will explain an experiment that was used to test the static accuracy of the altimeter; Appendix B will explain in detail the construction and certification of the flight test pallet; and Appendix C will provide the computer documentation for the computer programs used in the display and for data analysis.

40|$|During today’s {{aircraft}} descents, Air Traf?c Control (ATC) commands {{aircraft to}} descend to specific altitudes and directions to maintain separation and spacing from other aircraft. When the aircraft is instructed {{to maintain an}} intermediate descent altitude, it requires engine thrust to maintain speed, leading to increased fuel burn and noise being produced. By eliminating these level ?ight segments, fuel consumption, noise and gaseous emissions can be reduced as aircraft can perform the descent at an engine-idle thrust setting. The aircraft will then ?y a continuous descent, or Continuous Descent Operations (CDO), which {{at the same time}} raises the altitude pro?le, reducing the experienced noise levels at ground level. Today, CDO’s are operationally in use at various major airports, such as Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow. Due to dif?culties in predicting aircraft trajectories and time of arrival when performing CDOs, ATC needs to add additional spacing buffers to assure proper spacing between aircraft. As a result, airport capacity is reduced, limiting the use of CDOs to hours of low capacity demand. Researchers investigated various concepts in an aim to improve the predictability of CDOs to maintain airport capacity during CDOs. However, many of these concepts require additional thrust to correct for deviations. Therefore, this research developed a new CDO concept, named Time and Energy Managed Operations (TEMO), that allows an aircraft to perform accurate 4 D engine-idle descents using energy principles. TEMO uses the principles of energy to correct deviations (replanning) without the need for additional thrust and simultaneously adhering to time constraints for spacing and sequencing. The concept uses an optimization algorithm to minimize thrust and speedbrake use and to calculate accurate trajectories. The algorithm uses energy management by exchanging kinetic and potential energy by controlling the elevator to correct deviations. Sustained deviations are corrected for through either strategic replanning, when deviations exceed a prede?ned boundary, or using tactical replanning, which instantaneously corrects deviations. To improve ?ight accuracy and maintain acceptable workload levels, a TEMO descent is ?own using the autopilot and auto-thrust systems. However, selection of ?aps and gear, and commanding the autopilot are examples of actions that are still performed by the pilot. The TEMO concept should be validated for different conditions to verify whether CDOs can be ?own using energy management and whether the concept can cope with various disturbances. A study should verify whether environmental impact is reduced while the various replanning methods should be compared. Various errors could be arti?cially introduced to evaluate to what extent energy management alone can correct errors and in what scenarios thrust or speedbrakes are required. Moreover, the role of the human pilot in the TEMO concept should be evaluated. The human pilot introduces additional uncertainties that affect the ?own descent. Another uncertainty during descent is wind and affects the trajectory accuracy greatly. Hence, can we improve wind estimation to enhance trajectory prediction? This thesis addresses these topics and questions. A ?rst experiment involved a fast-time batch simulation performed in MATLAB and aimed at identifying TEMO’s environmental bene?ts and ability to correct deviations and errors using strategic replanning. Deviations result from modeling errors in the Trajectory Predictor (TP) and algorithm to simplify trajectory prediction. A comparison of baseline scenarios between TEMO descents and current step-down descents showed that TEMO reduces the 65 dB and 75 dB Sound Exposure Level (SEL) contour areas by 20 % and 13 %, respectively. Moreover, a reduction in fuel used was achieved between 11 % and 20 % for the descent. When considering fuel use per ?ight time, the reduction is slightly reduced to values between 9 % and 16 %. Gaseous emissions were effectively reduced by approximately 33 – 47 %. The comparison also showed that without additional errors, no replanning was required to correct deviations that result from modeling errors. Next, descents were simulated with introduced time, energy and wind estimation errors to evaluate how strategic replanning corrects such errors during descent. Without using additional thrust, a time error window of 8 – 16 seconds was achieved using energy management only. The actual dimensions of this time window depends on the wind estimation error. By allowing TEMO to command minimized amounts of thrust and speedbrakes, the algorithm was able to calculate a new trajectory that allowed the aircraft to arrive 30 seconds earlier and later than originally planned. In some extreme scenarios, the time deviation at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) exceeded the 5 seconds required accuracy prescribed by the Required Time Performance (RTP). These larger time deviations primarily result from wind estimation errors that negatively affect time and energy performance. This continuous wind error resulted in multiple trajectory recalculations to correct for time and energy deviations. This experiment also compared results of descents ?own using strategic replanning with descents ?own using hybrid replanning under wind conditions. This hybrid replanning method used a 4 D-speed controller to continuously (tactically) correct for time deviations and used a strategic replan before Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) entry to correct for energy deviations. The results showed that the 4 D-controller effectively minimizes time deviations at the IAF with minimum cost to fuel use and noise contours, even when a wind estimation error is present. Hence, the tactical controller is ef?cient at correcting deviations resulting from a continuous disturbance. However, hybrid replanning showed larger energy deviations at localizer intercept which were not corrected using a replan but corrected upon glideslope intercept by the autopilot. Therefore, hybrid replanning should use stricter energy boundaries to reduce energy (and altitude) deviations when the aircraft approaches the localizer. The fast-time simulations on TEMO performance included a zero-delay pilot response model that executed pilot tasks, such as con?guration changes, perfectly. Hence, the question remained how variations in pilot response to manual actions affect TEMO performance. This question was addressed in a real-time experiment with pilots in the loop. This experiment also evaluated what information support pilots best to perform accurate TEMO descents and minimize variations in pilot response. Three Human-Machine Interface (HMI) ’s were developed that provide support information during TEMO descents and differed in level of information displayed. Pilots preferred the HMI variant that included a timer to support accurate selection of ?aps and gear, and responded that workload was acceptable. This con?guration timer, however, did not signi?cantly reduce time deviations at the runway threshold but reduced the variance in delay of setting con?gurations. For comparison the pilot ?own scenarios were also ?own using a zero-delay pilot response model to investigate investigation of the effects of variations in pilot response on environmental impact and TEMO performance. A comparison of these simulations showed that human response had little effect on noise contour levels and Nitrogen Oxide emissions of a TEMO descent, while the difference in time deviation with respect to the automated runs was small. Consequently, pilots were suf?ciently informed to perform their actions. The comparison also indicated that without delays in performing pilot actions, the aircraft did not arrive exactly on time either. This resulted from simpli?cations in modeling of aircraft dynamics in the TEMO algorithm and TP and guidance errors while following the prescribed speed-pro?le. In general, the aircraft arrived early and close to the early boundary of the RTP at the runway threshold for pilot ?own scenarios. This raises the question whether an RTP of 2 seconds is achievable in real life. The guidance and planning functions should be improved to reduce this offset to be able to obtain similar time accuracies in less favorable wind conditions. The analysis of all results showed that the energy deviation at the moment of intercepting the glideslope signi?cantly in?uences the time of arrival for the automated runs, while for the human runs this effect was slightly smaller. This implies that to arrive exactly on time at the runway threshold, the energy <b>deviation</b> at <b>glideslope</b> intercept should be reduced and corrections during glideslope descent should be made possible. The results from both experiments showed that TEMO is sensitive to disturbances and errors. The batch study showed that wind estimation errors contribute greatly to time and energy deviations. For this reason, it is expected that using accurate wind estimation data in the TEMO algorithm will reduce trajectory deviations. Today, aircraft primarily rely on coarse and slowly updated wind estimates resulting in gross estimates of the prevailing wind when predicting the own trajectory. Therefore, a novel method for real-time estimation of a wind pro?le was developed, named Airborne Wind Estimation Algorithm (AWEA) that increases the temporal and spatial resolution of wind estimates. AWEA uses data transmitted by nearby aircraft to construct high resolution real-time wind pro?le estimates. The AWEA algorithm uses a Kalman ?lter to relate all received measurements to the own trajectory and reduce measurement noise. The wind estimation algorithm performance was evaluated using Mode-S derived meteorological data from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Using these wind observations, the AWEA algorithm showed an Root Mean Square (RMS) in the wind estimation error of 1. 35 KTS along the own trajectory, which is lower than the observed RMS measurement error of 1. 94 KTS. Relating the measurements to the own trajectory also proved bene?cial in reducing wind estimation errors. In another experiment, estimated wind pro?les along the own trajectory constructed by AWEA showed to improve spacing performance during approach. The TEMO experiments showed promising results as clear bene?ts to the environment have been identi?ed whilst the aircraft adheres to time constraints accurately. However, some issues require further investigation before TEMO could be used in real-life. TEMO was designed for the Airbus A 320 ?ying straight-in descents and evaluated in a single aircraft environment. Future work should investigate TEMO’s use in other aircraft types, include turn dynamics, and realistic wind and turbulence conditions. AWEA should be integrated with TEMO to reduce deviations resulting from wind. Next, an experiment should investigate capacity, and spacing and separation between multiple aircraft performing TEMO descents. To improve TEMO time performance at the runway, TEMO should be able to perform replans while on the glideslope. Since energy management cannot be performed while the aircraft descents down the <b>glideslope,</b> <b>deviations</b> could be corrected using ?ap-scheduling such that engine-thrust remains idle, or a tactical component could use thrust and speedbrakes to simultaneously control time and energy. Trajectory prediction will always include modeling errors as we cannot model the world explicitly, hence, effort should be put into reducing these errors to a minimum. Since strategic replanning can be considered as an open-loop (or slow, intermittent) control system, modeling errors will always result in deviations from the planned trajectory. To improve time performance by minimizing time deviations due to modeling errors and unknown disturbances, a closed-loop system should be used. Hybrid replanning augments strategic replanning with a fast closed-loop speed controller. Hence, research should investigate how hybrid replanning can be further improved and evaluate the human factors aspects of hybrid replanning in a real-time experiment with pilots in control.
