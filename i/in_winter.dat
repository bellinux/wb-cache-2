Most species migrate to warmer regions <b>in</b> <b>winter,</b> although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. <b>In</b> <b>winter,</b> the mule deer, cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations.

5|$|Most {{populations are}} sedentary, apart from some post-breeding {{dispersal}} of young birds, {{and there is}} a reluctance to cross even short stretches of open water. Northern and eastern breeders are dependent on the cones of the Siberian stone pine, and if the crop fails many birds of the S.e.asiatica subspecies may move west into northern Sweden and Finland in autumn, sometimes staying to breed. Siberian S.e.arctica may make more limited movements south and east <b>in</b> <b>winter,</b> and S.e.amurensis, from southeast Russia, is regular <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures <b>in</b> <b>winter,</b> resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even <b>in</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows <b>in</b> <b>winter,</b> high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E
