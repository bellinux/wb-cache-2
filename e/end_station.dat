5|$|The station {{functions}} as a major bus terminal for Søndre Nordstrand. Ruter operates feeder bus services to Dal, Brenna, Kantarellen (all no.72) and Bjørndal (no.71). The station is the <b>end</b> <b>station</b> of route74 to the city center, and an intermediate stop on route76 to Helsfyr and Hvervenbukta. Routes71E and 73 to the city center also serve the station during rush hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{building}} land at North End to conservationists to form the Hampstead Heath extension in 1904, meant {{a reduction in the}} number of residents who might use the station there. Work continued below ground at a reduced pace, and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated, but North <b>End</b> <b>station</b> was abandoned in 1906 before the lift and stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed.|$|E
5|$|From 1 July 1965, Oslo Sporveier {{took over}} the {{operation}} of the Ekeberg Line, which was numbered Line 16. Oslo Sporveier took over all employees and rolling stock, but Ekebergbanen remained a holding and real estate company. Immediately following the take-over, Oslo Sporveier introduced a 20-minute headway and suggested that the line be closed and replaced by buses from 29 October 1967, when the Østensjø Line of the metro opened. Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced the frequency and moved the <b>end</b> <b>station</b> out of the core of the city center. When the proposal to close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbråten Line was to be closed.|$|E

5000|$|Some base <b>end</b> <b>stations</b> {{were located}} in tall fire control towers (FCTs) Sometimes, the terms [...] "base end station" [...] and [...] "fire control tower" [...] were used interchangeably. In general, however, a fire control tower (FCT) was a {{structure}} built to raise one or more base end, spotting, or observation stations high above ground level. Some fire control towers contained several base <b>end</b> <b>stations,</b> {{one on top of}} another on different stories of the tower, with each station being at one end of a different baseline and being assigned primarily to a different gun battery in a harbor's defensive scheme. Other base <b>end</b> <b>stations</b> resembled pillboxes or small bunkers dug into the ground or on the surface overlooking coastal waters. Still others were camouflaged to resemble seaside homes or cottages. Some base <b>end</b> <b>stations</b> had anti-aircraft observation positions on their top levels, or harbor observation radar antennas on platforms above their roofs.|$|R

5|$|Filming {{took place}} between 27 February and 25 April 1967. The budget was £275,000. At this time, Hammer was {{operating}} out of the Associated British Studios in Elstree, Borehamwood. However, a lack of space meant that production was relocated to the nearby MGM Borehamwood studio. There were no other productions working at the MGM Studios at this time so the Quatermass crew had full {{access to all the}} facilities of the studio. Roy Ward Baker was particularly pleased {{to be able to use}} MGM's extensive backlot for the exteriors of the Underground station. The production team included many Hammer regulars, including production designer Bernard Robinson who, as an in-joke, incorporated a poster for Hammer's The Witches (1966) into the dressing of his set for the Hobbs <b>End</b> <b>station.</b> Another Hammer regular was special effects supervisor Les Bowie. Roy Ward Baker recalled he had a row with Bowie, who believed the film was entirely a special effects picture, when he tried to run the first pre-production conference. Bowie's contribution to the film included the Martian massacre scene, which was achieved with a mixture of puppets and live locusts, and model sequences of London's destruction, including the climactic scene of the crane swinging into the Martian apparition.|$|E

25|$|The {{off-peak}} service is one train per hour {{in each direction}} between Maidenhead and Marlow. During morning and evening peak times a two trains per hour service is achieved by using two trains: one shuttling between Marlow and Bourne End, and another between Bourne End and Maidenhead/London Paddington.

2500|$|Proposals for an {{extension}} from Grundset to Åmot {{was made in}} 1864, which would allow the railway to connect to the steamships operating on Storsjøen, by placing the <b>end</b> <b>station</b> at Rena where the river Renaelva empties into Glomma. This part of the line was less controversial than later parts and was approved by Parliament with 80 against 21 votes. The [...] segment was initially named the Grundset–Aamot Line. Construction started soon after the parliamentary decision and was easy due to the flat valley the line was built through. Grundset Station was dismantled and the station building moved to Rena Station, the new terminus. The depot and turntable were moved to Elverum Station, which received an upgrade. The line was operational in September 1871 and officially opened on 19 October.|$|E
50|$|Base <b>end</b> <b>stations</b> {{were often}} {{assigned}} to particular batteries of guns or mine fields in a harbor defense system. In some U.S. harbors during WW2 there were 20 {{or more of}} these base <b>end</b> <b>stations,</b> often from 10,000 to 15,000 yards apart, and tied together by telephone lines running through switchboards. These stations could be used flexibly in different combinations or by different gun batteries as ships moved through the area, or in case a given station was damaged by enemy action.|$|R

5000|$|A {{fire control}} tower usually {{contained}} several fire control stations, known variously as observation posts (OPs), base <b>end</b> <b>stations,</b> or spotting stations from which observers searched for enemy ships, fed data on target location to a plotting room, or spotted {{the fall of}} fire from their battery, so {{the aim of the}} guns could be adjusted. For example, the fire control tower at Site 131-1A contained one OP, two base <b>end</b> <b>stations,</b> and two spotting stations. A shorthand notation was used to identify the stations.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tragedy of}} the Halifax Explosion on December 6, 1917, played havoc {{with much of the}} ICR's {{infrastructure}} in the Richmond neighbourhood of north-end Halifax. The ICR's North Street station was heavily damaged and its Richmond Yard and shipping terminals were destroyed or rendered unusable. Hundreds of freight cars were destroyed and dozens of passenger and military hospital cars were heavily damaged. Many ICR employees, most notably train dispatcher Vincent Coleman, responded with heroism and desperate determination to evacuate wounded and summon relief. The explosion severely but only briefly hampered war-time operations at the port. The railway mobilized repair crews from across Eastern Canada to clear debris with remarkable speed and resumed its full schedule five days after the explosion, albeit it with diminished passengers cars as many were severely damaged. Wharves and freight facilities were rebuilt for wartime service within a month. Construction that had begun on a second route using a vast rock cut through {{the south end of the}} Halifax peninsula to a new [...] "Ocean Terminal" [...] was accelerated. The ICR repaired the North Street Station to serve for another year but switched passenger service to a new south <b>end</b> <b>station</b> near the present day Halifax railway station in January 1919.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} {{setting-out}} {{of the city}} is half the game. Then you devise incidents. As I wanted to photograph the particular set-out for the purpose of illustrating this account, I took a larger share in the arrangement than I usually do. It was necessary to get everything into the picture, to ensure a light background that would throw up some of the trees, prevent too much overlapping, and things like that. When the photographing was over, matters became more normal. I left the schoolroom, and when I returned I found that the group of riflemen which had been converging on the publichouse had been sharply recalled to duty, and were trotting in a disciplined, cheerless way towards the railway station. The elephant had escaped from the zoo into the Blue Ward, and was being marched along by a military patrol. The originally scattered boy scouts were being paraded. G. P. W. had demolished the shop of the Jokil Company, and was building a Red <b>End</b> <b>station</b> near the bend. The stock of the Jokil Company had passed {{into the hands of the}} adjacent storekeepers. Then the town hall ceremonies came to an end and the guard marched off. Then G. P. W. demolished the rifle-range, and ran a small branch of the urban railway uphill to the town hall door, and on into the zoological gardens. This was only the beginning of a period of enterprise in transit, a small railway boom. A number of halts of simple construction sprang up. There was much making of railway tickets, of a size that enabled passengers to stick their heads through the middle and wear them as a Mexican does his blanket. Then a battery of artillery turned up in the High Street and there was talk of fortifications. Suppose wild Indians were to turn up across the plains to the left and attack the town! Fate still has toy drawers untouched...|$|E

In addition, some base <b>end</b> <b>stations</b> held a depression position finder (DPF) or a coincidence range finder (CRF) that could be used by itself (without reference to another station) to produce fire control data for the gun(s). Sometimes a space holding one of these instruments (if not located on a baseline and paired with a second station) was referred to simply as an observation station.|$|R
