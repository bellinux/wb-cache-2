40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{there has been a}} {{significant}} progress in numerical algorithms for the simulation of physical processes and a growing demand for efficient and powerful numerical codes for the industrial design and engineering. Therefore, the development of a fully automated, robust and fast parallel mesh generator has become a very important issue. Traditionally, two main techniques have been implemented to generate meshes in parallel. The first is based on the parallelisation of the Delaunay kernel while the second is based on the partitioning of the domain to be generated. Unstructured mesh generation methods have a large variation in the number of operations required during each generation process, therefore, domain partitioning, which allows <b>independent</b> <b>triangulation</b> of the individual sub-domains, provides a natural route to a successful parallelization of the mesh generation techniques.

As robots {{are getting more}} advanced, smaller and cheaper, their sensors need to decrease in size and cost, while increasing their reliability and accuracy. Current laser-based sensors have difficulty to meet these properties. They are either large, expensive, contain moving parts or provide insufficient amounts of information. This thesis introduces an integrated approach {{for the development of}} an eye-safe, low-cost, solid-state, wide-angle line-laser distance sensor, tackling these challenges. A prototype is derived by constructing a generic, camera <b>independent,</b> <b>triangulation</b> model. The model, combined with a set of pre-defined requirements, is used to select hardware components and predict the sensor limits. A unified calibration step is proposed to estimate both camera intrinsics as well as misalignment errors with the same set of data. Additionally, a microsecond-accurate open loop synchronization system for laser activation and imager exposure is presented. Tests show that the prototyped sensor is able to measure distances up to 3 meters with an error of 4 %. At 2 meter, the error is just under 2 %. Additionally, the solid-state prototype has a field-of-view of 105 degrees, an angular resolution of 0. 8 degrees, an update rate of 10 Hz and an estimated cost of just below $ 35...|$|E
40|$|Super {{resolution}} of the horizon at both Viking landing sites has revealed "new" features we use for triangulation, similar to the approach used during the Mars Pathfinder Mission. We propose alternative landing site locations for both landers for which we believe the confidence is very high. Super {{resolution of}} VL- 1 images also reveals some of the drift material at the site to consist of gravel-size deposits. Since our proposed location for VL- 2 is NOT on the Mie ejecta blanket, the blocky surface around the lander may represent the meter-scale texture of "smooth palins" in the region. The Viking Lander panchromatic images typically offer more repeat coverage than does the IMP on Mars Pathfinder, due to the longer duration of these landed missions. Sub-pixel offsets, necessary for super resolution to work, appear to be attributable to thermal effects on the lander and settling of the lander over time. Due to the greater repeat coverage (particularly in the near and mid-fields) and all-panchromatic images, the gain in resolution by super resolution processing is better for Viking than it is with most IMP image sequences. This enhances the study of textural details near the lander and enables the identification rock and surface textures at greater distances from the lander. Discernment of stereo in super resolution im-ages is possible to great distances from the lander, but {{is limited by the}} non-rotating baseline between the two cameras and the shorter height of the cameras above the ground compared to IMP. With super resolution, details of horizon features, such as blockiness and crater rim shapes, may be better correlated with Orbiter images. A number of horizon features - craters and ridges - were identified at VL- 1 during the misison, and a few hils and subtle ridges were identified at VL- 2. We have added a few "new" horizon features for triangulation at the VL- 2 landing site in Utopia Planitia. These features were used for <b>independent</b> <b>triangulation</b> with features visible in Viking Orbiter and MGS MOC images, though the actual location of VL- 1 lies in a data dropout in the MOC image of the area.

For regular meshes, we provide closed forms expressions for the three coefficients of this polynomial.

Methods: To determine the way people with neck pain would describe a recovered state a descriptive thematic approach was used. A nominal focus group technique, written reflections, and one-on-one semi-structured interviews were used to collect sufficient data. Data from the focus groups were analyzed both through vote tallying and thematic analysis. Reflections and interviews were analyzed thematically by two <b>independent</b> researchers. <b>Triangulation</b> and memberchecking were employed to establish trustworthiness of results. Results: A total of 35 people, primarily females with neck pain of traumatic origin, participated in this study.

First the derivation of the spin foam model of the BF theory from the discrete BF theory action in n dimensions is reviewed briefly.

Then it is shown that spin network functionals arise naturally on the foliations. The graphs of these spin network functionals are dual to the triangulations of the foliating hypersurfaces.

To this end we develop a technique to evaluate the linearized Regge action associated to Pachner moves in 3 D and 4 D and show {{that it has a}} simple, factorized structure. We succeed in finding a local measure for 3 D (linearized) Regge calculus that leads to triangulation independence. This measure factor coincides with the asymptotics of the Ponzano Regge Model, a 3 D spin foam model for gravity.

40|$|The Virgo {{project is}} one of the ground based interferometers on the earth surface that aim to detect {{gravitational}} waves. This thesis work concerns the data analysis for the coalescing binaries stars, that are among the most promising gravitational waves sources, since the shape of their signal is well known. The gravitational waves emission from a binary system of compact stars acts like a sort of feedback: the system radiates loosing its orbital energy, so the orbit shrinks and the emission becomes stronger. The signal is therefore called a chirp, due to this characteristic amplitude and frequency increasing with time. The expectation rate for the double neutron stars merging is 3. 4 · 10 − 5 per year. Translated in detection expectation rate this corresponds to a detected event every 125 years for the LIGO detectors, and one every 148 years for the Virgo one. For the advanced new generation of detectors, that will be working within the next years, the expectation rate with the 2004 proposed configuration of advanced detectors is definitely better: 6 events per year for the so called Enhanced LIGO, and 3 every two years for the Advanced Virgo (updated scenarios for detection rates, with a more recent Advanced Virgo configuration are under development). The technique that suites at best the analysis of this kind of signal is the matched filter, that consists in computing the correlation between the data stream (output of the gravitational waves interferometer) and a set of theoretical tem- plates. From this analysis, using a single detector, it is possible to determine the masses of the two stars, and the so called optimal orientation distance, that is the source distance provided that the orbit has the best inclination with respect to the interferometer line of sight. Reconstructing the source position, so as to draw a gravitational waves sources sky map, requires at least three non-coincident detectors, {{in order to make a}} triangula- tion. Another very good reason to use a network of gravitational waves interferometers is that the detection rate can be improved considering a network of three detectors (Virgo, Hanford and Livingston) and operating a coherent analysis, since in this case the expected rate corresponds to one event each 26 years. There are two different methods used for the network analysis: the coincident method, and the coherent one. The first is the most intuitive one, and simply consists in a separate single detec- tor analysis performed by each interferometer, and a successive comparison between the single detector candidates, searching for compatible events. After that process, only the coincidences remain as candidate events, and they can be used for the source position reconstruction, using the time delays between detectors. The basic idea of the coherent method is to construct an ideal detector equivalent to the network, to which each real interferometer coherently contributes with its sensitivity, location, orientation. For this purpose a so called network statistic to maximize in order to extrapolate the source pa- rameters is constructed, first, and maximized then. For this thesis we have worked on coalescing binaries network analysis, trying to determine the best strategy for source position reconstruction. We have developed a pipeline that implements a fully coherent method, in a few different variations, and we have compared them with the classical time- of-light coincidence analysis. The coincident method has been optimized in order to make a fair comparison; in particular we have adopted the reference time, for implementing the coincidence, and we have further improved the arrival time accuracy by fitting the shape of the matched filter response. Among the coherent techniques tested, the sim- plest has been a direct maximization of the network likelihood. A fit of the likelihood to improve the determination of the likelihood maximum has also been attempted but the fitting procedure resulted unstable; instead, we have found most effective to define the most likely declination and right ascension by means of an average procedure weighted by the corresponding network likelihood. This procedure allows to remove the discretization effect due to the finite sampling rate of the analysis, and provides results compatible with the ones obtained with the time-of-light technique, and in a relatively automatic way. The study of the accuracy problem, comparing the two methods of analysis gives in a certain way two important consequences: first of all the determination of the best coherent strategy for reconstructing the source position among all the alternatives, both in terms of efficiency, and in term of computational costs; and as a secondary effect it gives us the incipit for push the coincident method to its best, provided that one uses all the correlators information. If we give a glance to the future, since new interferometric gravitational waves detectors are under construction and under project, another important feature of the coherent method is its exibility to be adapted to a larger number of detectors. The coherent method can tell us how to combine them in order to obtain with the best accuracy the source position, instead of analyzing all the possible <b>independent</b> <b>triangulations,</b> and loosing in that way part of the event astrophysical information...|$|R
