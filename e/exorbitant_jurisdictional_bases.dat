40|$|A brief {{examination}} of various criminal jurisprudences {{in the world}} reveals that nationality is taken {{as one of the}} main bases for extending the judicial jurisdiction of states. In such cases, the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> for prosecution are in turn the personal and the passive personality principles. Yet, despite their widespread acceptance, regulating these two <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> has not proven to be an easy task, if only for the encroachments that a wholesale resort to the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> in question may make into the sovereignty of other states. In this regard, the Iranian experience marks out many of the difficulties that law-makers around the world may face, when purporting to legislate on the bases for exercising extra-territorial jurisdiction. Another reason for viewing the Iranian encounter with the personal and the passive personality principles as a case of special interest is the mode in which the Iranian legislature has sought to adjust the application of the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> in question against the requirements of sharia law. By taking these factors into consideration, this essay will map out the successes and failures of the Iranian legislature in conceiving these two <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> in the 2013 Code...|$|R

40|$|Ancillary federal {{district}} court powers embody more than adjudicatory authority over "factually interdependent" civil claims initially presented within cases or controversies. Ancillary powers are used to facilitate civil case settlement agreements encompassing claims never presented for adjudication, {{as well as to}} adjudicate some disputes over settlement agreements long after final judgments. While certain ancillary powers are now recognized in the "supplemental jurisdiction" statute, 28 U. S. C. ý 1367, the range of the statute is quite limited. It chiefly codifies earlier precedents on pendent and ancillary jurisdiction that primarily address initial ancillary adjudicatory authority over state law civil claims without independent <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> that arise from the same "common nucleus of operative facts" as the civil claims having independent subject matter <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases.</b> Section 1367 should provide clarity for all federal court ancillary powers, eliminating much uncertainty and confusion.

40|$|Abstract The 1952 Arrest Convention {{was created}} in order to unify the rules {{relating}} to arrest of ships around the world. Before the Convention, the rules relating to arrest of ship were governed by the different countries national rules of law. This created problems for the shipping industry as a ship could be arrested in relation to any claim whatsoever if it was permitted by the domestic law {{of the country where}} the ship was. Also considering that many countries have <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdictional</b> rules and sometimes on very loose grounds claim jurisdiction, this was a problem. Shipping is a very special kind of business as it involves movable property that often has a great value and suddenly can enter jurisdictional territory and a claimant can get hold of security he could not have counted on. These <b>exorbitant</b> <b>jurisdictional</b> rules made the shipping business insecure and something needed to be done about it. Therefore the Arrest Convention was created. The Convention regulates for what claims a ship can be arrested and therefore gives the claimant and the defendant an ability to foresee when there is a claim in relation to which it is possible to get an arrest. If the Convention had had the effects one wanted one would only have to know about the rules in the Convention and not about the numerous other national jurisdictional rules in the ports or the territorial waters that the ship may enter on its journey. However, the Convention, even though probably having made some applications of law easier, it has not been a pervading effect. Firstly, as with many international conventions the Arrest Convention has not been ratified by all countries although it has been ratified by many in comparison {{with a lot of other}} international conventions. Secondly, there are some questions on when the Convention shall apply before national rules and when it shall not. This has been especially clear in relation to the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgements. Even though the Arrest Convention prevails there is still confusion in reality when applying the Conventions. Within the EU the uncertainty becomes even greater as one has to consider both the jurisdictional rules in the Arrest Convention, the rules in the Brussels Convention and the national rules relating to arrest. This makes the possibility to foresee what rules will govern a case even more difficult. However, these uncertainties can be used by forum shoppers that are trying to find loopholes through which to avoid one jurisdiction and get the case taken on by another, more favourable, jurisdiction. The Arrest Convention’s rules on jurisdiction can be used by a claimant to claim jurisdiction in a country where he might not have had jurisdiction if the Convention had not been in force. The same goes for the Brussels Convention. There being uncertainties in the relation between the Conventions and the Conventions and national law is a great incentive for a plaintiff or a defendant to try and stretch the rules in his favour. Sometimes the outcome of a case can be completely different from one jurisdiction to another. Forum shopping, which is the common term when choosing jurisdiction because of more favourable law rules, is used within all types of law having some kind of international connection and there are different opinions about it. The reason behind it is always to get the best outcome possible in a lawsuit, but what is the best possible outcome? In order to shop you also need to know what you are shopping for and where to find it. In international maritime law, being governed by many international conventions not always being signed by the same countries and sometimes having different application depending on if other relating conventions have been signed by the same countries, the best country in which to sue is not always obvious at a first glance. Consequently in order to make a sound decision on where to sue in order to get the most out of a lawsuit you have to look at the jurisdictional rules in order to find out where you can sue and you have to look at the procedural and substantial rules in order to see where you will get the decision you are looking for...|$|R
40|$|In 2015, {{frustrated}} by {{the slow pace of}} the International Maritime Organisation negotiations, the EU issued Regulation 2015 / 757 on the monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport. Echoing the controversial Aviation Directive, the Regulation is intended to support a unilateral market-based measure, and includes emissions from outside EU territory. This raises the question whether, according to international law, the EU has jurisdiction to regulate such ‘extraterritorial’ circumstances. In exploring the appropriate <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases,</b> we argue that neither the Law of the Sea Convention, nor world trade law definitively decide this issue. We therefore devote more detailed attention to the customary international law of state jurisdiction supplementing these regimes.

40|$|The law of {{jurisdiction}} {{and of the}} recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is confused. So is the debate about it. Basic concepts, even that {{of jurisdiction}}, have ambiguous meaning. Misunderstandings, most prominent in the failure to conclude a worldwide judgments convention at the Hague, are the consequence. This article tries to bring conceptual clarity to the field through an analysis of concepts and relations. The article first shows that jurisdiction as a requirement for the rendering of a decision (direct jurisdiction) and jurisdiction as a requirement for the decision 2 ̆ 7 s enforceability elsewhere (indirect jurisdiction), are logically independent from each other. It goes on {{to show that the}} three possible values of deontic logic - obligatory, optional, and impermissible conduct - are reflected in three possible statuses that <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> can have: such bases may be required, excluded, or permitted. A combination of both distinctions leads to nine different possible combinations of direct and indirect jurisdiction. The article analyzes each of these nine in detail. Such an analysis is crucial for the drafting of judgment conventions. Traditionally, a distinction existed between so-called single conventions that regulate only enforcement of foreign judgments, and double conventions that regulate also direct jurisdiction. Arthur von Mehren, for whose memorial volume this article is written, developed a third category, the so-called mixed convention. Although it represented a considerable improvement, the exact structure of mixed convention never became fully clear. This article proposes a new typology that is both richer and more exact. Although the article draws on rich comparative material from existing conventions, and although it emphasizes repeatedly the normative implications both of different values for <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> and of different types of conventions, the article 2 ̆ 7 s prime aim is analytical, not normative. However, far from being a mere formalist exercise, such an analysis lays the indispensable prerequisites for a proper normative analysis. The definition of clear concepts does not guarantee proper policy debates, but without clear concepts policy debate is impossible. In this sense, the paper hopes to help provide new foundations for such debates...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{international}} tax {{rules have}} been continuously analyzed since its origin under the spotlight of international tax planning, {{little or no}} {{attention has been paid}} to connecting factors as the basis of applicability of taxes.

As a consequence, current connecting factors were developed as a new set of rules and residence and source role was moved to its current function of general principles. Thus, our hypothesis is that the non-analytical way under which those rules were developed leads to current flaws and failures of international tax law. Secondly, international tax law jurisdictional principles were developed in a time were territorial and personal jurisdictions were predominant, while nowadays other principles such as protective and universal principles are accepted by international law.

The assertion of jurisdiction by the FCC over {{any aspect of}} the Internet ecosystem has raised populist, congressional, and even judicial rhetoric to a crescendo and resulted in a recent vote to defund the FCC’s efforts. This Article places the current crisis squarely {{in the context of}} the long-standing jurisdictional struggle between regulation and antitrust law. These two regimes are often at jurisdictional cross-purposes because, even though they both purport to maximize the social good, they do so by inapposite means. Indeed, there is a policy choice inherent in the very jurisdictional authority permitted each regime—a choice that the FCC’s <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> for net neutrality may actually circumvent and obfuscate. Focusing on the Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP and the D. C. Circuit’s decision in Comcast Corp. v.

In analyzing the jurisdictional limits of each through the lens of the net neutrality debate, this Article reveals opportunities for congressional reforms beyond mere rhetoric. To identify problematic uses of regulatory authority, this Article: (1) creates an innovative grouping of possible bases for regulatory authority labeled “satellite jurisdiction” and (2) proposes a new framework to classify possible jurisdictional overreach in what the author brands as either “procedural opportunism” or “substantive opportunism. ” Finally, this Article recommends a new standard by which both procedural and substantive jurisdictional opportunism may be tempered and antitrust authority maximized where most salutary and appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background What {{constitutes}} a "clinical trial" is inconsistently {{defined in the}} medical literature. With an initiative by Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) to report institutional clinical trials activity across the province of Ontario, Canada, we sought to investigate the variability {{in the interpretation of}} the term by local oncology professionals. Methods A survey amongst the physicians and nurses at the Juravinski Cancer Centre at Hamilton Health Sciences, Ontario was conducted. The survey included 12 summaries of local clinical research studies, and respondents were asked which they believed represented a clinical trial. Subsequently, they were asked which of the same 12 studies they believed should be labeled as clinical trials when considering separate definitions provided by CCO and by the Ontario Cancer Research Network (OCRN). Results A total of 66 (54 %) of 123 surveys were completed; 32 / 46 (70 %) by physicians, 21 / 59 (36 %) by primary care nurses, and 13 / 18 (72 %) by clinical trial nurses. Without a standardized definition, all studies, 12 / 12, were considered to be clinical trials by at least 50 % of respondents. When provided with the CCO definition only 6 / 12 studies were considered to be clinical trials by the majority of respondents, while with the OCRN definition it was 9 / 12 studies. Studies evaluating natural health products, non-traditional medical interventions, and non-randomized studies with standard interventions consistently ranked the lowest, regardless of the definition used. Conclusion Oncology professionals appear to have a broadly inclusive baseline definition of what {{constitutes a}} clinical trial.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, a global trend of {{extending}} the reach of domestic penal power can be observed, namely driven by {{the changing face of}} crime as it becomes increasingly transnational in nature. It is demonstrated in this article that the Swiss legislature has clearly followed this global trend of broadening the extraterritorial reach of domestic criminal law, most notably since the 1980 s. It has acted with particular resolve in the last decade, adding <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> to the Swiss Criminal Code by virtue of which Swiss criminal law can be applied to many instances of conduct taking place abroad. Certain offences – specified crimes against minors and female genital mutilation – have even been subjected to an absolute and unrestricted universality principle. The Swiss legislature is not indifferent to the problems that such an expansive approach to jurisdiction may create, notably in terms of conflicts of jurisdiction. Yet, the rules it adopted to temper the effects of applying Swiss criminal law to extraterritorial conduct only partially remedy the situation. This development in Swiss law begs the question whether such an expansive approach towards jurisdiction is permissible – or even encouraged or requested by international law. Hence, this article explores to what extent international law informs the reach of domestic penal power and concludes that international law is Janus-faced with regard {{to the question of the}} geographical scope of domestic criminal law. While some of its rules push for long-arm jurisdiction, others put limits on the domestic legislature’s endeavour to expand the reach of its domestic criminal law. In light of this, the idea of adopting, on an international level, general principles governing the definition of the scope of domestic prescriptive and adjudicative jurisdiction for transnational cases is tempting, albeit difficult to realize...|$|R
40|$|During the Vietnam War, in Son Thang hamlet, a five-man American patrol murdered sixteen Vietnamese noncombatant {{women and}} children. The crime was {{discovered}} {{and the five}} apprehended. International treaties define much {{of the law of}} war. That law requires apprehension and trial of those committing "grave breaches. " The manner of their prosecution is undefined. The research question, resolved through examination of the Son Thang incident and its subsequent prosecutions, is whether the United States, through its military justice system, meets its obligations under customary law of war. The study is unique in illustrating the law of war from treaty, to application, through appeal. Also examined are <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases,</b> the vitality of the defense of obedience to orders, and whether a good faith effort was made to prosecute the suspects - and whether good faith translated into effective prosecutions. The case offers a unique opportunity to observe U. S. military criminal process. A grave breach was committed at Son Thang, although the victims' status, citizens of a co-belligerent, placed even that in issue. But prosecution clearly was required. Before those prosecutions are detailed, the sources and history of law of war are noted, their translation into military law traced. Application of the law of war at Nuremberg is related, as it is in Vietnam. Employing interviews and trial records, the Son Thang events are described and juxtaposed with aspects of today's law of war and U. S. military law embodied in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In assessing that Code's effectiveness, its procedural aspects are briefly compared with civilian models. Appellate resolutions of the Son Thang cases are discussed, their results compared to similar prosecutions and sentences.

It {{examines the}} two-dimensional homogenous space as it has been increasingly used in 'mapping' the international system as an area of mutually exclusive zones of jurisdiction. This way of mapping has reinforced the notion of 'sovereignty' as exclusion, despite the growth of competing <b>jurisdictional</b> claims <b>based</b> on a variety of principles, which the emergence of private international law attempted to mediate during the heydays of the nation state. It also placed international regimes and international organizations 'above' the state where they became 'invisible', thereby again reinforcing the territorial conception of law and politics. The new systems theory of Niklas Luhmann and Gunther Teubner claims to provide a better representation of contemporary social and political reality, as it no longer uses the part/whole distinction as its main conceptual tool and is thus more open to 'legal pluralism' both domestically and internationally. Nevertheless, the conceptualization of autonomous functional systems does not do justice to the special role that law plays in constituting and transforming these supposedly autonomous 'auto-poietic' systems.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to ratify the Kampala Amendments without actually implementing them, {{and it is also}} possible to ratify the amendments now and implement them later. Nevertheless, a large number of countries, when they ratify an international treaty, try to implement it within domestic law. In particular, in relation to the Kampala Amendments, countries have legislated domestic implementation laws at the time of ratification, in order to properly apply the principle of complementarity included in the ICC Statute. When determining domestic implementation methods for the Kampala Amendments, countries may wish to partially adjust the definition of crime of aggression in accordance with the conditions of domestic law. However, when applying the Kampala Amendments to domestic legislation, it is recommended to incorporate the whole phrase that was adopted at the Kampala Conference. This is because if the definition of acts of aggression is narrowed or broadened compared to the Kampala Amendments’ definition, there is a risk of legal validity issues from the perspective of international law. The definition of crime of aggression in the Kampala Amendments can be considered as the product of developments in customary international law to date, and therefore, in particular when the range of this crime is broadened, doubts about international legal validity may arise. Looking at the early actions of countries following the Kampala Conference, domestic implementation of Article 8 bis mostly follows the verbatim definition of crimes of aggression provided by the text of the Kampala Amendments. Of course, if the expanded domestic law applies only to the residents of the ratifying country (the prosecuting country), there will be no issue of legal validity. However, when the country intends to prosecute a resident of another country for actions outside the definition of crime of aggression agreed at Kampala, there may be difficulties in gaining the cooperation of the other country, and, above all, <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> under customary international law will not be available. According to the jurisdictional system chosen by Korea, in some cases, Korea’s domestic legal system may even criminalize acts of aggression committed by leaders of other countries. This is particularly true when the acts of aggression are perpetrated against Korea, and Korea asserts its jurisdiction {{on the basis of the}} territoriality principle. However, in this case, Korea should be aware that only a very limited number of defendants may be punished due to the nature of crime of aggression as leadership crime, and that state immunity could be applied in relation to the crime of aggression committed by foreign leaders. Therefore, Korea’s domestic criminal jurisdiction for foreign leaders in its domestic courts may not be achievable in certain real cases. If Korea asserts criminal jurisdiction only for crimes of aggression perpetrated by their own people, it is able to avoid the major international political and legal issues accompanying prosecution of foreign leaders. ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ?, ??? ????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??. ??? ????? ???? ??, ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ?????. ??? ????? ? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ? ???? ????? ???? ?? ????? ????? ??? ? ?? ????. ??? ???? ????? ??? ??? ???? ? ?????? ??? ? ? ?? ???, ?? ??? ? ?? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ? ??. ????? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??, ? 8 ? bis? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ???? ??? ??? ??. ??? ??? ??? ????? ????, ??? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ? ??. ?? ?? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ????? ???? ???? ???? ??? ?? ????. ??? ? ?? ??? ????? ??? ???????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???? ??? ?? ? ?? ?????? ????? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ?? ????? ??. ??? ?????? ?? ????? ???????? ???? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???? ?? ????? ???? ?????? ????? ??, ????? ???? ??? ???? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ? ?? ???...|$|R
40|$|Recent Supreme Court {{decisions}} confirm for {{the first}} time in over six decades that federal regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause truly is limited. These decisions coincide with an increasing appreciation among scholars and jurists for the concept of competitive federalism. This paper derives the implications of competitive federalism for the evolution of federal jurisdiction over trade restraints under the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890). It provides a clear and substantively reasoned <b>jurisdictional</b> test <b>based</b> on the analysis of geographic market power familiar to antitrust scholars, practitioners, and regulators in evaluating horizontal mergers. To be subject to federal antitrust jurisdiction under this test, Sherman Act defendants must control a sufficiently large share of the geographic antitrust market that their trade restraint could plausibly affect prices “in more states than one. ” This test resolves a number of troubling inconsistencies in the case law on federal antitrust jurisdiction and provides a useful roadmap for how the Court can constructively realign its approach to general Commerce Clause jurisdiction. As the Court’s economic understanding of the market failure underlying a regulatory statute advances, general Commerce Clause jurisdiction should evolve to require a closer substantive nexus between the market failure and the effect on interstate commerce necessary to justify federal jurisdiction This approach will allow the Court to iterate toward an appropriate and workable balance of dual sovereignty that takes seriously the concept of competitive federalism without requiring a dramatic departure from existing constitutional precedent...|$|R

That innovation isalso a consequence of the proposed abolition of national exorbitant fora. The paper describes the general characteristics of the mechanism, that can be used only on a subsidiary and exceptional basis, i. e. when no provision would otherwise confer jurisdiction on a Member State. Accordingly, such a mechanism departs from the principles of predictability and proximity of the head of jurisdiction, because it applies when the dispute is closely connected to a third State. In that context the use of forum necessitatis is required in order to prevent or to remedy a denial of justice that could take place (or has already taken place) in the third State. When the denial of justice would affect procedural or substantive fundamental human rights of the claimant, the forum necessitatis mechanism allows him/her to bring his/her action before the courts of the Member States. More detailed requirements as to the existence of a denial of justice are envisaged in the proposal to revise EC regulation No. 44 / 2001. In addition, the dispute must have a «sufficient connection» to the Member State of the forum; such a requirement is needed in order to provide the allocation of jurisdictional competence between Member States...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{negative}} consequences of crime, {{it should come as no}} surprise that states will endeavor to make their dominions less hospitable to potential criminal actors. This predisposition, when played out on a national stage, would appear ripe for a dynamic in which states will seek to 2 ̆ 2 out-tough 2 ̆ 2 one another, leading to a spiral of detrimental competitiveness. Doran Teichman, in an article recently appearing in these pages, advances just such a view. Teichman posits that the decentralized structure of America 2 ̆ 7 s federalist system provides states with 2 ̆ 2 an incentive to increasingly harshen 2 ̆ 2 their crime control efforts, with the net result being excessive penalties and inefficient over-expenditures in state crime control efforts. He reaches this conclusion by wedding two distinct literatures: <b>jurisdictional</b> competition, <b>based</b> on the seminal work of Charles Tiebout, and crime displacement and spillover, a focus of theoretical criminology. Even more provocative is Teichman 2 ̆ 7 s prescription for change. Running against a heavy tide of commentary condemning increased federal involvement in criminal justice, Teichman urges that the federal government serve as a 2 ̆ 2 regulator 2 ̆ 2 of the states so that they can 2 ̆ 2 achieve uniformity 2 ̆ 2 and thereby avoid 2 ̆ 2 inefficient harshening. 2 ̆ 2 Although not the first commentator to tie crime spillover effects to race-to-the-bottom concerns, Teichman provides perhaps the most developed treatment of the thesis to date. In the limited space available here, I will not seek to dispute the theoretical verity of Teichman 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional competition model more generally and the largely anecdotal evidence he advances in support. Rather, I wish to highlight two specific areas of criminal justice policy where such competition is absent-sex offender registration and recidivist enhancement laws-and discuss the effects of state-state interconnection...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} and enforcement of foreign judgments is an aspect of private international law, and concerns situations where a successful party to litigation seeks {{to rely on a}} judgment obtained in one court, in a court in another jurisdiction. The most common example where the {{recognition and}} enforcement of foreign judgments may arise is where a party who has obtained a favourable judgment in one state or country may seek to recognise and enforce the judgment in another state or country. This occurs because there is no sufficient asset in the state or country where the judgment was rendered to satisfy that judgment. As technological advancements in communications over vast geographical distances have improved exponentially in recent years, there has been an increase in cross-border transactions, as well as litigation arising from these transactions. As a result, the {{recognition and enforcement}} of foreign judgments is of increasing importance, since a party who has obtained a judgment in cross-border litigation may wish to recognise and enforce the judgment in another state or country, where the defendant’s assets may be located without having to re-litigate substantive issues that have already been resolved in another court. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the current state of laws for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in Australia, the United States and the European Community are in line with modern-commercial needs. The study is conducted by weighing two competing objectives between the notion of finality of litigation, which encourages courts to recognise and enforce judgments foreign to them, on the one hand, and the adequacy of protection to safeguard the recognition and enforcement proceedings, so {{that there would be no}} injustice or unfairness if a foreign judgment is recognised and enforced, on the other. The findings of the study are as follows. In both Australia and the United States, there is a different approach concerning the recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by courts interstate or in a foreign country. In order to maintain a single and integrated nation, there are constitutional and legislative requirements authorising courts to give conclusive effects to interstate judgments. In contrast, if the recognition and enforcement actions involve judgments rendered by a foreign country’s court, an Australian or a United States court will not recognise and enforce the foreign judgment unless the judgment has satisfied a number of requirements and does not fall under any of the exceptions to justify its non-recognition and non-enforcement. In the European Community, the Brussels I Regulation which governs the recognition and enforcement of judgments among European Union Member States has created a scheme, whereby there is only a minimal requirement that needs to be satisfied for the purposes of recognition and enforcement. Moreover, a judgment that is rendered by a Member State and based on any of the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bases</b> set forth in the Brussels I Regulation is entitled to be recognised and enforced in another Member State without further review of its underlying jurisdictional basis. However, there are concerns as to the adequacy of protection available under the Brussels I Regulation to safeguard the judgment-enforcing Member States, as well as those against whom recognition or enforcement is sought. This dissertation concludes by making two recommendations aimed at improving the means by which foreign judgments are recognised and enforced in the selected jurisdictions. The first is for the law in both Australia and the United States to undergo reform, including: adopting the real and substantial connection test as the new jurisdictional basis for the purposes of recognition and enforcement; liberalising the existing defences to safeguard the application of the real and substantial connection test; extending the application of the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) in Australia to include at least its important trading partners; and implementing a federal statutory scheme in the United States to govern the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. The second recommendation is to introduce a convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. The convention will be a convention double, which provides uniform standards for the rules of jurisdiction a court in a contracting state must exercise when rendering a judgment and a set of provisions for the recognition and enforcement of resulting judgments...|$|R
