50|$|Paperboard is a thick paper-based material. While {{there is}} no rigid {{differentiation}} between paper and paperboard, paperboard is generally thicker (usually over 0.25 mm, 0.010 in, or 10 points) than paper. According to ISO standards, paperboard is a paper with a grammage above 224 g/m2, but there are exceptions. Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply. Paperboard can be easily cut and formed, is lightweight, {{and because it is}} strong, is used in packaging. Another end-use would be <b>graphic</b> <b>printing,</b> such as book and magazine covers or postcards. Sometimes it is referred to as cardboard, which is a generic, lay term used to refer to any heavy paper pulp-based board. Paperboard is also used in fine arts for creating sculptures.|$|E
50|$|Consideration {{was also}} given to {{optimising}} <b>graphic</b> <b>printing</b> {{by changing the}} glyphs on the daisy wheel to a set that {{would be able to}} print all the required bitmap combinations more quickly, without requiring an impact for every single dot. This would have the advantage that vertical dot combinations could be printed in a single impact, without requiring fine rotation control of the platen roller. However it would require a specialised daisy wheel so printing of a letter and letterhead would require a two-step process with a manual wheel change in-between. As the development of this technique post-dated the widespread availability of 24-pin dot matrix printers and coincided with the arrival of affordable laser printers in offices, it was never a popular approach.|$|E

40|$|Paperboard {{is widely}} used in {{different}} applications, such as packaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>printing,</b> among others. Consumption of recycled paper is growing, which has led the paper-mill packaging industry to apply strict quality controls. This means {{that it is very}} important to develop methods to test the quality of recycled products. In this article, we focus on determining the recoveredfiber content of paperboard samples by applying Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical methods. To this end, two very fast, nondestructive approaches were applied: classification and quantification. The first approach is based on classifying unknown paperboard samples into two groups: high and low recovered-fiber content. Conversely, under the quantification approach, the content of recovered fiber in the incoming paperboard samples is determined. The experimental results presented in this article show that the classification approach, which classifies unknown incoming paperboard samples, is highly accurate and that the quantification approach has a root mean square error of prediction of about 4. 1 Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E

40|$|Printing {{has become}} a mature industry, forcing {{printers}} to create new applications for their manufacturing process. One such application is printed electronics. The gravure printing process allows for incredible speed and exceptional quality for tra-ditional <b>graphic</b> <b>printing.</b> Theoretically, {{this would be an}} ideal method for the com-mercial production of printed electronics. This study analyzes gravure’s capabilities to produce a uniform conductive ink line and what to expect in the future of gravure printed electronics. Printed line properties such as line widening and scalloped edges were determined to impede gravure’s ability to lay down a conductive ink line. Best results were achieved with high viscosity inks, high pressure, and a slow printing speed. Ink surface uniformity was also a problem due to ink dots created from the electromechanically engraved cells, thus increasing line resistance. In gen-eral, the gravure process needs to be substantially modified before a mass production of printed electronics can take place.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2015. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisors: C. Daniel Frisbie, Lorraine F. Francis. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 161 pages. In printed electronics, electronic inks are patterned onto flexible substrates using roll-to-roll (R 2 R) compatible <b>graphic</b> <b>printing</b> methods. For applications where large-area, conformal electronics are necessary, printed electronics holds {{a competitive advantage}} over rigid, semiconductor circuitry, which does not scale efficiently to large areas. However, in order to fully realize the true potential of printed electronics, several manufacturing hurdles need to be overcome. Firstly, minimum feature sizes produced by <b>graphic</b> <b>printing</b> methods are typically greater than 25 µm, which is at least {{an order of magnitude}} higher for dense, high performing electronics. In this thesis, conductive features down to 1. 5 µm are demonstrated using a novel inkjet printing-based process. Secondly, high-resolution printed conductors usually have poor current-carrying capacity, especially for longer wires in large-area applications. This thesis explores the fundamentals of aerosol-jet printing and reveals the regime for printing high-resolution lines with excellent current carrying capacity. Additionally, a novel manufacturing process is demonstrated, which can process 2. 5 µm wide conductive wires with linear resistances as small as 5 Ω mm- 1. Another challenge for printed electronics manufacturing is to deal with topography produced on the substrate surface by printed features. Besides complicating the subsequent use of contact-printing methods, surface topography is a source of poor device yields as well. This thesis describes two novel methodologies of creating topography-free printed surfaces. In the first method, nanometer-level smooth, planarized silver lines are obtained using a transfer printing approach. In the second method, open microchannels, imprinted in plastic substrates, are filled with a controlled amount of metal using liquid-based additive processes, to obtain conductive wires flush with the substrate surface. Finally, this thesis addresses the issue of overlay alignment, which is the most significant challenge of printed electronics manufacturing. Multi-layered electronic devices require alignment of multiple layers of different materials with micron-level tolerances, which is a daunting task to accomplish on deformable, moving substrates in R 2 R production formats. This thesis describes a novel, self-aligned manufacturing strategy for printed electronics that relies on capillary flow of inkjet-printed inks within open micro-channels. Multi-level trench networks, pre-engineered on the substrate surface, are sequentially filled with different inks which, upon drying, form stacked layers of electronic materials. Using this approach, fully self-aligned fabrication of all the major building blocks of an integrated circuit is demonstrated. Overall, this thesis presents several new manufacturing avenues for realizing high-performing and dense electronics on plastic by R 2 R processing...|$|E
40|$|William Addison Dwiggins {{first used}} the term ‘graphic design ’ in 1922, devising it to address issues {{surrounding}} the seeming lack of professionalism of commercial art. (Meggs, 1998 : xii) In particular, the title was meant to signify that his work had gone beyond mere <b>graphic</b> <b>printing</b> and employed professional rules of design and principles of visual styling. However, the applications and circumstance of graphic design have undergone much evolution and change since Dwiggins distinguished graphic design’s need for professional recognition. From its beginnings in printing and commercial promotion, graphic design has morphed into a range of specialties, creating new terminology as it changed as diverse as brand mark, communication, identity, interface, and information design. The objective of this research, however, is not to argue terminology but to open discussion and offer a critique {{with regard to the}} classification methods and focus of mainstream design history, especially as it reflects on the past, present and future circumstances of Taiwanese graphic design. Yet the comparative newness of the term ‘graphic design ’ has had some important ramifications for the construction of graphic design history.

40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} is {{a nascent}} {{technology that is}} evolving from text and <b>graphic</b> <b>printing</b> into a major topic of scientific research and R&D, {{where it can be}} used as a highly reproducible non-contact patterning technique to deposit liquid functional materials at high speed on either small or large areas of flexible and non-flexile substrates. It is a low cost technique because minimizes the waste products and reduces the process steps. Nevertheless, the inkjet printing technology has some intrinsic limits, mainly related to the drying process of the printed droplet. In detail, during the drying process the fast evaporation of the solvent at the contact line induces an outward convective flow of the solute to compensate the evaporation losses and, in turn, transports the suspending solute to the edge region. This effect is known as “coffee-stain effect”. Objective of this PhD thesis was to analyze the critical states of this deposition method and to identify the working parameters for optimizing the deposition conditions. The study on the ink formulation through the definition of its chemico-physical properties, on the wetting of the ink/substrate system through the employment of surface treatments, on the ink processing through the definition of the printing parameters supplies the fundamental elements for controlling the droplet drying and, hence, the quality of the printed material. The printing parameters act differently on different ink/substrate systems. Therefore, studying the optimization of the deposition for different applications allows to understand how the printing conditions differently affect the working of different devices. In particular, the research activity pertains the employment of the inkjet printing (IJP) technology for optical and electronic applications, specifically focusing on the realization of optical structures, like microstructuring and microlenses, and organic electronic devices, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sensors, organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic solar cells (PSC) ...|$|E

40|$|Clay minerals, {{both natural}} and synthetic, have {{a wide range of}} applications. Smectite clays are not true insulators, their slight {{conductivity}} has been utilized by the paper industry in the development of mildly conducting paper. In particular, the synthetic hectorite clay, laponite, is employed to produce paper which is used in automated drawing offices where electro <b>graphic</b> <b>printing</b> is common. The primary objective of this thesis was to modify smectite clays, particularly laponite, to achieve enhanced conductivity. The primary objective was more readily achieved if the subsidiary objective of understanding the mechanism of conductivity was defined. The cyclic voltammograms of some cobalt complexes were studied in free solution and as clay modified electrodes to investigate the origin of electroactivity in clay modified electrodes. The electroactivity of clay modified electrodes prepared using our method can be attributed to ion pairs sorbed {{to the surface of the}} electrode, in excess of the cationic exchange capacity. However, some new observations were made concerning the co-ordination chemistry of the tri- 2 -pyridylamine complexes used which needed clarification. The a. c. conductivity of pressed discs of laponite RD was studied over the frequency range 12 Hz- 100 kHz using three electrode systems namely silver-loaded epoxy resin (paste), stainless-steel and aluminium. The a. c. conductivity of laponite consists of two components, reactive (minor) and ionic (major) which can be observed almost independently by utilizing the different electrode systems. When the temperature is increased the conductivity of laponite increases and the activation energy for conductivity can be calculated. Measurement of the conductivity of thin films of laponite RD in two crystal planes shows a degree of anisotropy in the a. c. conductivity. Powder X-ray diffraction and 119 Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy studies have shown that attempts to intercalate some phenyltin compounds into laponite RD under ambient conditions result in the formation of tin(IV) oxide pillars. 119 Sn Mossbauer data indicate that the order of effectiveness of conversion to pillars is in the order: Ph 3 SnCl > (Ph 3 Sn) 2 O, Ph 2 SnCl 2 The organic product of the pillaring process was identified by 13 C m. a. s. n. m. r. spectroscopy as trapped in the pillared lattice. This pillaring reaction is much more rapid when carried out in Teflon containers in a simple domestic microwave oven. These pillared clays are novel materials since the pillaring is achieved via neutral precursors rather than sacrificial reaction of the exchangeable cation. The pillaring reaction depends on electrophilic attack on the aryl tin bond by Brønsted acid sites within the clay. Two methods of interlamellar modification were identified which lead to enhanced conductivity of laponite, namely ion exchange and tin(IV) oxide pillaring. A monoionic potassium exchanged laponite shows a four fold increase in a. c. conductivity compared to sodium exchanged laponite RD. The increased conductivity is due to the appearence of an ionic component. The conductivity is independent of relative humidity and increases with temperature. Tin(IV) oxide pillared laponite RD samples show a significant increase in conductivity. Samples prepared from Ph 2 SnCl 2 show an increase in excess of an order of magnitude. The conductivity of tin(IV) oxide pillared laponite samples is dominated by an ionic component...|$|E
