50|$|The Printing Unit {{consists}} {{of many different}} systems. The dampening system is used to apply dampening solution to the plates with water rollers. The inking system uses rollers to deliver ink {{to the plate and}} blanket cylinders to be transferred to the substrate. The plate cylinder is where the plates containing all of the imaging are mounted. Finally the blanket and <b>impression</b> <b>cylinders</b> are used to transfer the image to the substrate running through the press.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{consisted}} of a large vertical cylinder, 200 inches in circumference. Ordinary type was used in columns to produce a polygonal printing surface. It had eight <b>impression</b> <b>cylinders</b> and needed eight people to feed the paper. It could produce 8,000 impressions per hour (on {{one side of the}} paper) and eventually up to 10,000 depending on the skill of those feeding it.

50|$|In {{order to}} extend the working life of type, and {{to account for the}} finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating {{subsequent}} printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an <b>impression</b> <b>cylinder</b> rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called stereotyping, the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier mâché called a flong to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of type metal.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. PrintingA flexographic {{print is}} made by {{creating}} a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymer material. Flexographic plates can be created with analog and digital platemaking processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the ink roll which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll (or meter roll) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can {{vary according to the}} type of print job and the quality required). To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the <b>impression</b> <b>cylinder</b> to transfer the image. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet {{does not have to be}} dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{marginal}} fit of crowns on the Straumann (ITI) ® Dental Implant System with special consideration of different casting dental materials. Material and methods: Sixty porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns were fabricated: 18 crowns on standard cone abutments with an <b>impression</b> <b>cylinder,</b> partially prefabricated analogs, no coping and screw-retained (A); 18 crowns on solid abutments without an impression device, no analogs, no coping and cemented (B); and 18 crowns on solid abutments using an impression transfer cap, an analog with a shoulder, no coping and cemented (C). In each group, six crowns were made on epoxy mastercasts (Bluestar®), six on synthetic plaster (Moldasynt ®) and six on super hard stone (Fujirock®). Six additional crowns were fabricated with the transversal screw retention system onto the Octa® system with impression transfer caps, metal analogs, gold copings and screw-retained (D). Impregum® was used as impression material. Crowns of B and C were cemented with KetacCem ®. Crowns of A and D were fixed with an occlusal screw torqued at 15 N cm. Crowns were embedded, cut and polished. Under a light microscope using a magnification of × 100, the distance between the crown margin (CM) and the shoulder (marginal gap, MG) and the distance between the CM and the end of the shoulder (crown length, CL) was measured. Results: MGs were 15. 4 ± 13. 2 μm (A), 21. 2 ± 23. 1 μm (B), 11 ± 12. 1 μm (C) and 10. 4 ± 9. 3 μm (D). No statistically significantly differences using either of the casting materials were observed. CLs were - 21. 3 ± 24. 8 μm (A), 3 ± 28. 9 μm (B), 0. 5 ± 22 μm (C) and 0. 1 ± 15. 8 μm (D). Crowns were shorter on synthetic casting materials compared with stone casts (P< 0. 005). Conclusions: CMs fit precisely with both cemented and screw-retained versions as well as when using no, partial or full analogs. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{movement}} of material which accumulates on the image printing blanket of a web offset press printing newsprint. A theory is advanced to explain this movement. It {{is based on the}} differences in velocities of the paper and blanket surfaces entering and exiting the printing nip. The designed experiment run uses three factors to test the changes in direction and rate of movement. These are: (1) the compressibility of blanket sets, (2) the relative image printing and impression blanket diameters, and (3) the printing squeeze. No other factors involved in the nip area are tested. The movement of material on the blanket surface is recorded using stroboscopic photography on 35 mm transparency film. The photographs record the positions of material on the blanket every 150 impressions. Analysis of the recorded movement is made by projection of the successive images. Results of statistical tests indicate that the relative diameters of the image printing and <b>impression</b> <b>cylinders</b> can influence the direction of movement. Movement is forward when the image printing blanket is less than the impression blanket and backwards when the image printing blanket is greater than the impression blanket. When printing with unequal diameters, the compressible blanket set produces less movement than the non-compressible set. These results support the theory advanced...|$|R

40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to {{identify}} the most important variables affecting the internal product integrity in the case of coated grades for coldset web offset printing. Internal product integrity was experimentally identified to mean in this work printing runnability and visual print quality. Printing runnability was experimentally defined to mean build-up formation tendency on the surface of the common <b>impression</b> <b>cylinder</b> (CIC) at satellite type coldset printing machines. Visual print quality was defined to mean set-off, print-through, contrast, dot-gain, evenness of printed surface and reproducibility of colors. The objectives {{of this study}} had significant commercial value and therefore the entire experimental part was carried out on industrial scale. This experimental set-up was aiming to speed-up the application of potential findings to industrial scale and to facilitate the exploitation of the results since the time consuming and risky step of scaling the laboratory results to industrial scale could be skipped over. The experimental part of this work consists of four parts: Pilot coating of industrial base papers, printing tests in commercial coldset printing process, comparison of print quality potential of different printing methods (coldset, waterless coldset and heatset) and laboratory analyses of base paper, unprinted and printed coldset samples. Laboratory analyses included structural tests, absorption tests, various microscopic methods, permeability tests, confocal Raman analyses and various printability tests. The results of the print quality testing showed that matt LWC printed in coldset reaches such a qualitative level that it allows the printer to exceed the technical obstacles by which the new business models are often confronted. It was further identified that coating pigments and base paper properties have influence on internal product integrity of matt LWC paper in coldset printing. The influence of coating pigments as a single variable in the fine tuning of the internal product integrity was smaller than expected. The influence of coating pigments on the internal product integrity is most likely depending on the base paper properties. A natural area for future studies would be to identify the most important paper technological variables influencing the internal product integrity via base paper properties. Latex properties as single variables did not have clear influence on internal product integrity. Latex coverage had some influence to the internal product integrity. Therefore, experimental designs profiting latex properties as multivariable parameters could bring new knowledge to the fine tuning of the internal product integrity. Printing paper manufacturers should shift the technical testing of product prototypes to industrial scale from laboratory scale. Creation of a new product in printing paper industry should approach the standard concurrent engineering processes, where new product is widely tested in industrial scale after the innovation phase, but before market launch. reviewe...|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the <b>impressions</b> of <b>cylinder</b> seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and zinc (spelter).

50|$|The {{threshing}} boards {{must have}} been important in the protohistory of Mesopotamia, since they already appear {{in some of the}} oldest written documents discovered: specifically, several sandstone tablets from the early town of Kish (Iraq), engraved with cuneiform pictograms, which could be the world's oldest surviving written record, dating {{to the middle of the}} 4th millennium BC (Early Uruk period). One of these tablets, preserved in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford University, appears to have pictures of threshing boards on both faces, next to some numeric symbols and other pictograms. These presumed threshing boards (which might instead be sledges) have a shape similar to threshing carts that were used until recently in parts of the Middle East where non-industrial agriculture survived. Descriptions also appear in numerous cuneiform clay tablets as early as the third millennium BC.There are another representation, in this case without writing, in central Turkey. It is an <b>impression</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> seal from the archaeological site of Arslantepe-Malatya, which appeared near of the named «Temple B». The archaeological layers were dated to 3374 BC using dendrochronology. The stamp shows a figure seated on a threshing board, with a clear image of the lithic flakes inlaid in the bottom of the board. The main figure is sitting (possibly on a throne) under a dossal. In front is a driver or oxherd, and there are peasants with pitchforks nearby. According to M. A. Frangipane, that the seal may illustrate a religious scene:It closely resembles another scene, painted on the walls of the same site (a ceremonial procession of a person of high rank, painted in an archaic lineal style in the colours red and black), although the current condition of the wall obscures the exact nature of the vehicle in which he is seated, it is indeed possible to see that it is pulled by a pair of oxen. Professor Sherratt interprets both scenes as presenting manifestations of civil or religious power. In that era, the threshing board was a sophisticated and expensive implement, built by specialized artisans, using pieces of flint or obsidian; in the case of Lower Mesopotamia, these were imported from far away: in the alluvial plateau of Sumer, as in all south of Mesopotamia, it was impossible to find stone, not even a pebble.|$|R
