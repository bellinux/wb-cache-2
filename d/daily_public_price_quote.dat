Rather than {{a central}} provider directing investors choices, an information exchange takes place between all investors, whereby the best performing strategies by all are {{made available to}} all. The first completely P2P provider is Darwinex (UK). Darwinex describe themselves as an exchange pairing providers with buyers of investment strategies, without intermediaries. Buyers pay providers with a share in their investment profits, with Darwinex acting as a central counter-party that independently lists the strategies for a <b>public</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>price</b> based off the underlying assets, rates strategy quality and manages investor risk.|$|R
