50|$|With the new antenna, {{the tower}} became capable of {{broadcasting}} <b>high-definition</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> signals using the DVB-T standard (which is the European counterpart to the ATSC digital standard {{used in the}} United States). It is capable of broadcasting four channels per transmitter, {{for a total of}} twenty-four channels, at 100 kilowatts per channel. It is capable of receiving satellite broadcasts and redistributing them via cable or terrestrial broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, {{plans for}} a FM radio station to {{complement}} the existing AM station became realized. On November 14, 1996, SBS Power FM began broadcasting on 107.7 MHz as a music-centric station. On January 4, 1999, the original SBS Radio on AM 792 kHz began broadcasting on FM as well. The station rebranded as SBS Love FM on 103.5 MHz, simultaneously airing on both AM and FM frequencies. <b>High-definition</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> was introduced in 2001. Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) was introduced in 2005.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is the specification of the Dirac video decoder and stream syntax. Dirac is a royalty-free video compression system {{developed by the}} BBC utilising wavelet transforms and motion compensation. It {{is designed to be}} simple, flexible, yet highly effective. It can operate across a wide range of resolutions and application domains, including: internet and mobile streaming, delivery of standard-definition and <b>high-definition</b> <b>television,</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> and cinema production and distribution, and low-power devices and embedded applications. The system offers several key features: • lossy and lossless coding using a common tool set • intra-coded modes for professional production applications • a special low delay mode for link adaption applications, such as the carriage of HDTV over SDTV infrastructure • motion-compensated (‘long-GOP’) modes for distribution application...|$|R

50|$|Video {{shot with}} a {{standard}} video camera format such as S-VHS or Mini-DV is often interlaced when created, whereas video {{shot with a}} film-based camera is almost always progressive. Free-to-air analog TV was mostly broadcast as interlaced material because the trade-off of spatial resolution for frame-rate reduced flickering on Cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions. <b>High-definition</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> (see: HDTV) today can be broadcast terrestrially or distributed through cable system in either interlaced (1080i) or progressive scan formats (720p or 1080p). Most prosumer camcorders can record in progressive scan formats.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the PPM {{can be traced}} to a brainstorming session at Arbitron in November 1988. Concerns over the forthcoming move from analog video to <b>high-definition</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> had engineers concerned that the technology then in use would become obsolete overnight. Drawing upon his experience in testing laboratories, Dr. Gerald Cohen proposed embedding an identifying signal in the audio and later decoding it. The rationale was simple. Dr. Cohen argued that audio was less likely to undergo as drastic a change in content and technology as would video, hence any technology developed would not likely to become obsolete in a few years.|$|E

50|$|Widescreen {{televisions}} {{are typically}} {{used in conjunction}} with <b>Digital,</b> <b>High-Definition</b> <b>Television</b> (HDTV) receivers, or Standard-Definition (SD) DVD players and other <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> sources. <b>Digital</b> material is provided to widescreen TVs either in high-definition format, which is natively 16:9 (1.78:1), or as an anamorphically-compressed standard-definition picture. Typically, devices decoding Digital Standard-Definition pictures can be programmed to provide anamorphic widescreen formatting, for 16:9 sets, and formatting for 4:3 sets. Pan-and-scan mode can be used on 4:3 if the producers of the material have included the necessary panning data; if this data is absent, letterboxing or centre cut-out is used.|$|R

50|$|Bush chose Sikes to be {{chairperson}} over attorney Sherrie P.

Digital video sharing digital format all functions, including lossless transmission, lossless storage, easy to edit. Currently in many applications, including video conferencing, video games entertainment, DVD discs, digital video broadcasting. As digital video compression format storage requirements prohibitive, lossy digital video compression technology commonly used as the data transmission rate and a compromise between quality. In this paper, we compare and analyze the MPEG- 2, H. 261 and H. 264 video compression standards. After the Compression, We get the result that the compression of H. 264 is better than other two but it take much time as compare to H. 261 on higher cost...|$|R
