5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

[...] He commented that the [...] "steam room" [...] trap was the [...] "best looking" [...] of them all. [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam.

Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert explained the origin of his word as: [...] "Truthiness is a word <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> right out of my [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
500|$|The play had Nagesh {{himself in}} the title role, along with Major Sundarrajan and S. N. Lakshmi who reprised their roles in the film. Balachander {{recalled}} in 2009 that when he wrote Server Sundaram with Nagesh in mind, he suffered anxious moments: [...] "I was convinced of the story, {{but there was a}} risk in promoting Nagesh, but <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it off". A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, acquired the rights to the play and also shared Krishnan–Panju's wish to make a film based on it. The film adaptation was produced by Guhan Films, a subsidiary of AVM. Balachander was recruited as the film's screenplay and dialogue writer. Krishnan–Panju directed the film, although Balachander had shown a keen interest in directing it himself. Meiyappan accepted the inclusion of Nagesh in the film after watching the latter's performance in the play. Nagesh, who in turn was impressed with S. N. Lakshmi's performance in the play, asked Balachander to have Meiyappan include her in the film. K. R. Vijaya was cast as Sundaram's love interest Radha, and R. Muthuraman was cast as his friend Raghavan. Singer T. M. Soundararajan made a guest appearance in the song [...] "Avalukkena", as did poet Vaali's wife Ramani Thilagam. Goundamani, who later became a successful comedian in Tamil cinema, made his acting debut with this film in an uncredited, non-speaking role.|$|E

500|$|Philip thus {{brought an}} army into Thessaly, {{probably}} {{with the intention}} of attacking Pherae. Under the terms of their alliance, Lycophron of Pherae requested aid from the Phocians, and Onomarchus dispatched his brother, Phayllos with 7000 men; however, Philip repulsed this force before it could join up with the Pheraeans. Onomarchus then abandoned the siege he was currently prosecuting, and brought his whole force into Thessaly to attack Philip. It is possible that Onomarchus hoped to conquer Thessaly in the process, which would both leave the Thebans isolated (Locris and Doris having already fallen to the Phocians), and give the Phocians a majority in the Amphictyonic council, thus enabling them to have the war declared over. Onomarchus probably brought with him 20,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and a large number of catapults, and outnumbered Philip's army. The exact details of the campaign that followed are unclear, but Onomarchus seems to have inflicted two defeats on Philip, with many Macedonians killed in the process. Polyaenus suggests that the first of Onomarchus' victories was aided by the use of the catapults to throw stones into the Macedonian phalanx, as they climbed a slope to attack the Phocians. After these defeats, Philip retreated to Macedon for the winter. He is said to have commented that he [...] "did not run away but, like a ram, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> back to butt again harder".|$|E

[...] The aircraft then lost height rapidly. Prchal closed the four throttles and warned the others through the intercom [...] "Attention, crash". The aircraft crashed into the sea.|$|E
