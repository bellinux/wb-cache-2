5|$|Pardee Hall was {{completed}} in 1873 and {{remains one of the}} earliest buildings at Lafayette College. When initially constructed {{it was one of the}} largest academic buildings of its era. Pardee was first <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> all of the science programs; currently it holds most of Lafayette's humanities and social science departments.|$|E
5|$|The West and East Wing {{date from}} the 1860s and are built from brick and stone. They had a lines of gun {{positions}}, each <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a heavy gun and a crew of up to 12 men. The positions were protected by granite-fronted casemates and wrought-iron shields, and, with removable window screens, doubled as living accommodation for the crews. Small magazines were positioned behind the lines of casemates.|$|E
5|$|Climbié's {{death was}} largely {{responsible}} for various changes in child protection in England, including {{the formation of the}} Every Child Matters programme, an initiative designed {{to improve the lives of}} children; the introduction of the Children Act 2004, an Act of Parliament that provides the legislative base for many of the reforms; the creation of ContactPoint, a database <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> information on all children in England and Wales (now no longer in operation); and the creation of the post of children's commissioner, who heads the Office of the Children's Commissioner, a national agency serving children and families.|$|E

50|$|Combat {{shotguns}} {{typically have}} much shorter barrels than shotguns used for hunting and usually, though not always, have magazines of modified <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{more than the}} 3 to 5 shots normal with sporting or hunting shotguns. Most combat shotguns have tubular magazines <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the cartridges, mounted underneath the barrel, identical to those of hunting shotguns except for being longer <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> more ammunition, though some recent designs have detachable box magazines.|$|R
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 13th century Henry III began to {{redesign}} his favourite castles, including Winchester and Windsor, building larger halls, grander chapels, installing glass windows and decorating the palaces with painted walls and furniture. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the development of grand castles designed for elaborate, elite living. Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall, with privacy for the owner's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation. By the 14th century nobles were travelling less, bringing much larger households with them when they did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues. Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and comfort for the ruling family, while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity to hold over 130 residents at the castle. The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built, in the 1380s, it was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up to eight different noble households, each with their own facilities. Royal castles such as Beaumaris, although designed with defence in mind, were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up to eleven different households at any one time.|$|E
5|$|In the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the walls is God's House tower. This is architecturally important as {{it was one of}} the first urban buildings to be built to hold gunpowder artillery – in this respect, it closely resembles Cow Tower in Norwich. The tower was built alongside God's House Gate and is three storeys high. The gunports designed for handcannon can be seen on the outside, and the roof was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> larger cannon. Adjacent to the tower is God's House Gate, a two-storey building also equipped with a gun-port.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
50|$|Dayton Sure-Grip & Shore {{was founded}} in 1924 by Art & Carl Kinnenger with help from Charles Danis and Fred Kramer.

5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, which was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> seven men.|$|E
5|$|The Cow Tower is an {{artillery}} tower by the River Wensum in Norwich, Norfolk, England. Built between 1398 and 1399 {{by the city}} authorities {{in response to the}} threat from France and indigenous English rebels, the tower was intended to defend the north-eastern approach to Norwich with hand cannons and bombards. It stood apart from the main city walls, close to the river where its height would have allowed it to fire onto the higher ground opposite the city. The tower was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a garrison when required and was well furnished, probably using different floors for dining and sleeping.|$|E
5|$|The {{land was}} officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 {{in honour of}} Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville (who at the time had just been {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a multi-storey building was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> officers. As no exchange system was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the prison at this time.|$|E

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Boston was {{the site}} of the National Peace Jubilee, a massive gala to honor {{veterans}} and to celebrate the return of peace. Conceived by composer Patrick Gilmore, who had served in an army band, the celebration was held in a colossal arena in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 100,000 attendees and specifically built for the occasion. A new hymn was commissioned for the occasion, written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and set to American Hymn by Matthais Keller. Spanning five days, the event featured a chorus of nearly 11,000 and an orchestra of more than 500 musicians. It was the largest musical gathering on the continent up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Tower {{houses were}} a common feature of British and Irish castle {{building}} in the late medieval period: over 3,000 were constructed in Ireland, around 800 in Scotland and over 250 in England. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn, a walled courtyard <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> valuable animals securely, but not necessarily intended for serious defence. Many of the gateways in these buildings were guarded with yetts, grill-like doors made out of metal bars. Smaller versions of tower houses in northern England and southern Scotland were known as Peel towers, or pele houses, and were built along {{both sides of the}} border regions. In Scotland a number were built in Scottish towns. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time that the No. 3 {{locomotive}} was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale in New Jersey, and after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad in New Jersey, and that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> diesel fuel. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E
5|$|In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{in charge}} of {{improving}} the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive strongpoints <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete-reinforced coastal artillery emplacements (a battery of four 122mm guns at Mont Fleury and the Longues-sur-Mer battery, with four 150mm guns) were only partially completed by D-Day. Rommel ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high tide mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.|$|E
40|$|Retention {{registers}} are {{utilized in}} power gating <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>design</b> state during power down {{and to allow}} safe and fast system reactivation. Since a retention register consumes more power and costs more area than a non-retention regis-ter, it is desirable to minimize the use of retention registers. However, relaxing retention requirement to a minimal sub-set of registers can be computationally challenging. In this paper, we adopt satisfiability solving for scalable selection of registers whose retention is unnecessary and exploit input sequence constraints {{to increase the number}} of non-retention registers. Empirical results on industrial benchmarks show that our proposed methods are efficient and effective in iden-tifying non-retention registers...|$|R
