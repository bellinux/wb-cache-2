[...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
500|$|Since Dexter {{producers}} try {{to shield}} the child actors {{as much as possible}} from the show's dark subject matter, executive producer Daniel Cerone urged the mother of his son's friend not to let her son audition to play a young Dexter, who is filmed sitting in a pool of blood. Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as [...] "very uncomfortable to watch, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know it's not real and you know these kids are actors." [...] Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them [...] "feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background. You don't see all the details of the environment." [...] Series director Keith Gordon found these flashbacks [...] "incredible" [...] because he thought they were [...] "like a Stanley Kubrick movie".|$|E

When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist.

She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided!

Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{felt it was a}} [...] "cheeky" [...] song, also writing that it touched on themes Madonna would go on to explore more explicitly later in the 1990s. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a [...] "big-band blues [...] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] as [...] "naughty", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that [...] "one aspect of Madonna remains constant <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> push her back in time. 'Hanky Panky' {{is one of the few}} pop tunes to explore the erotic entertainment value in a good spanking." [...] Writing for The Pittsburgh Press, Peter B.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's techno soundtrack and {{recognised}} {{that it was}} {{an important part of the}} Wipeout series. Sanchez opined that the soundtrack from the previous Wipeout games—as well as Wipeout Fusion—are [...] "good enough" [...] to buy separately. Sanchez also commended the game's sound effects and music, stating that both aspects are [...] "dead on for a member of the Wipeout family". Bedigan enjoyed the soundtrack, saying that every song was [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "suits the game's 'extreme' feel". Kauderer thought that the game had an exceptional soundtrack, stating that since the use of licensed music in Wipeout 2097, the franchise had [...] "changed the face of the industry forever", although he opined that Wipeout Fusion had lost [...] "that cool edge". Davis praised the [...] "hard hitting" [...] techno soundtrack; saying that it was a type of music [...] "you'd want to listen to <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> weren't playing the game". Bramwell, on the other hand, criticised the game's choice of music, stating that the soundtrack feels [...] "like a practical joke" [...] and admitted to muting the music. A reviewer from Edge lauded the soundtrack, describing it as [...] "excellent, trance-inducing", but also said that the gameplay [...] "has failed to keep up with the times".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Deep Throat {{has been well}} received by critics and fans. Entertainment Weekly described Hardin's performance as [...] "world-weary and heavyhearted", and listed his appearance in the character's eponymous début episode as the 37th greatest television moment of the 1990s. However, they felt at times that his presence in episodes such as [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] seemed [...] "gratuitous". Reviewing the character's début episode, the San Jose Mercury News called Deep Throat [...] "the most interesting new character on television". Chris Carter has stated that Hardin's performance gave the series an element of [...] "believability" [...] that it needed; and felt that the episode [...] "E.B.E." [...] was {{a great opportunity to}} expand the character's role. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen called Deep Throat's death [...] "a shocking moment, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know it's coming", praising the [...] "desperation" [...] evident in Hardin's performance, although lamenting the [...] "curse of continuity" [...] that led to the character being quickly replaced with Steven Williams' X. Ben Rawson-Jones, writing for Digital Spy, felt that Deep Throat's tenure on The X-Files was [...] "arguably the show's peak", and praised Hardin's acting in the role. Brian Lowry, in his book The Truth Is Out There, has noted that the character [...] "helped establish a tone and undercurrent of gravity on The X-Files that was to provide the spine of the series".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince yourself you know what's going on, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{combination}} of Pink Floyd's partial breakup and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. [...] The personal quality assigned to the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also {{the loss of his}} father during the Second World War. [...] Gilmour's guitar solos on [...] "Your Possible Pasts" [...] and [...] "The Fletcher Memorial Home" [...] are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. [...] More recent reviews of the album have weighed its importance alongside the band's breakup. [...] Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said [...] "with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. [...] And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction...", [...] Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "It's about pursuing something greater <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have all the money that you could ever want. [...] And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. [...] It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time." [...] Rachel Mann of The Quietus said [...] "flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album" [...] and [...] "still has something fresh to say". [...] Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: [...] "Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen. [...] Q Magazine once compiled a top ten list of depressing records, and this was on it. [...] Enough said, I think." ...|$|E

According to Juan Carlos a monarch must not take his position for granted but work for the people's welfare, be kind, attentive and helpful, and [...] "appear animated <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are tired; kind <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't feel like it; attentive <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are not interested; helpful even when it takes an effort [...] You need to appear natural, but not vulgar; cultivated and aware of problems, but not pedantic or conceited".|$|E

2500|$|The {{completed}} version contained 334 {{poems and}} {{was published in}} Buenos Aires. [...] Amongst the new poems are ten very long ones that exemplify Guillén’s search for clarity and cohesion. [...] "A vista de hombre", for example, was begun in a New York hotel and deals {{with a view of}} an unnamed metropolis from a skyscraper. [...] It develops the poet’s thoughts on his relationship with the mass of people living and working in this city until it closes with the poet retiring to his bed. [...] Unlike García Lorca in Poeta en Nueva York or countless other poets, the city is not inhuman, cold, abstract. [...] The emphasis is on the mass of humanity it holds. The city is a mix of good and evil, man’s heroic endeavours and barbarity – a reality that has to be embraced in totality <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> cannot understand it.
