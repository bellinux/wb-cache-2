40|$|Authorities offer {{conflicting}} viewpoints {{on whether}} animal foods {{are essential to}} the health of young children or whether they can ingest the nutrients they need from plant sources. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) contends that because of the small capacity of young children's stomachs, **hey are not likely to consume all of the calories they would need to get enough protein, iron, and calcium from plant foots. The USDA also maintains that cow's milk is essential to a healthy diet. However, recent studies have implicated meat, eggs, and dairy products in atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and cancer. Milk and dairy products have been linked to severe respiratory problems, diabetes mellitus, and intestinal blood loss. Regardless, most schools and day care centers still teach and abide by the four food groups, which emphasize meat and dairy foods. Whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruit can provide children with the protein, fiber, calcium, iron, and vitamin 812 that they need. However, for children to get enough nutrients from a vegetarian diet, they must limit their intake of <b>empty</b> <b>calorie</b> foods such as potato chips, sodas, and candy.

Secondary outcome measures were gastric <b>emptying,</b> postoperative oral <b>calorie</b> intake, time to functional recovery and length of hospital stay. Results: Sixty-eight patients completed the trial. The laxative group had a significantly reduced time to passage of stool: median (interquartile range) 4 (3 – 5) versus 5 (4 – 6) days (P = 0 · 034). The ONS group showed a trend towards a shorter time to passage of stool (P = 0 · 076) {{but there was no}} evidence of interaction in patients randomized to the combination regimen.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Enteral feed {{intolerance}} occurs {{frequently in}} critically ill patients {{and can be}} associated with adverse outcomes. "Energy-dense formulae" (ie, > 1 kcal/mL) are often prescribed to critically ill patients to reduce administered volume and are presumed to maintain or increase calorie delivery. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare gastric emptying of standard and energy-dense formulae in critically ill patients. METHODS: In a retrospective comparison of 2 studies, data were analyzed from 2 groups of patients that received a radiolabeled 100 -mL "meal" containing either standard calories (1 kcal/mL) or concentrated calories (energy-dense formulae; 2 kcal/mL). Gastric emptying was measured using a scintigraphic technique. Radioisotope data were collected for 4 hours and gastric emptying quantified. Data are presented as mean ± SE or median [interquartile range] as appropriate. RESULTS: Forty patients were studied (n = 18, energy-dense formulae; n = 22, standard). Groups were well matched in terms of demographics. However, patients in the energy-dense formula group were studied earlier in their intensive care unit admission (P =. 02) and had a greater proportion requiring inotropes (P =. 002). A similar amount of <b>calories</b> <b>emptied</b> out of the stomach per unit time (P =. 57), but in patients receiving energy-dense formulae, a greater volume of meal was retained in the stomach (P =. 045), consistent with slower gastric emptying. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients, the administration of the same volume of a concentrated enteral nutrition formula may not result in the delivery of more calories to the small intestine over time because gastric emptying is slowed.
