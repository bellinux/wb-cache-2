500|$|In {{contrast}} to his success on the football field, Taylor's personal life has been marred by drug usage and controversy. When Taylor was once asked what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> no outside linebacker could, his answer was, [...] "Drink". However, alcohol abuse was not the largest of his substance abuse problems. After admitting to and testing positive for cocaine in 1987, he was suspended from football for 30 days in 1988 after failing a second drug test. After his second positive test he gave up drugs for five years as a third positive test would have ended his career. As he approached retirement, however, {{he looked forward to}} picking up the habit again, saying in his second autobiography, [...] "I saw blow as the only bright spot in my future." [...] After his retirement, he began abusing drugs on a regular basis. He went through drug rehab twice in 1995, only to later be arrested twice over a three-year span for attempting to buy cocaine from undercover police officers. During this period, he lived almost exclusively in his home with white sheets covering his windows and only associated with other drug users. Taylor later said, [...] "I had gotten really bad. I mean my place was almost like a crack house." [...] In his second autobiography, Taylor admitted that he had begun using drugs as early as his rookie season in the NFL. He has also stated that his first wife, Linda, mother to his three children, once had to come pick him up from a crack house during his playing career.|$|E
2500|$|... "While Mosaddegh {{dealt with}} {{political}} challenge, he faced another that most Iranians considered far more urgent. The British blockade of Iranian seaports meant that Iran was left {{without access to}} markets where it could sell its oil. The embargo {{had the effect of}} causing Iran to spiral into bankruptcy. Tens of thousands had lost their jobs at the Abadan refinery, and although most understood and passionately supported the idea of nationalisation, they naturally hoped that Mosaddegh {{would find a way to}} put them back to work. The only way <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was to sell oil." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he {{was asked}} about his {{involvement}} in the AHF in a 2004 interview, Vikernes stated that it was Antifa groups who [...] "repeatedly wrote" [...] that the NHF was a neo-Nazi group and that he was their leader, claims which he describes as [...] "persecution". He also said that [...] "the [...] secret police claimed adamantly" [...] that he was the leader of the Heathen Front. Vikernes then continued by stating that, {{as a result of these}} claims, he left the Heathen Front, to see what [...] "the Antifa/Monitor morons and the secret police would do". In practice, Vikernes stated, he never was a member of the group, since, being in prison, he could not participate in their activities and he had never [...] "met half of them". He also stated that if he wanted to write articles for their magazine, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> regardless of whether he was a member or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ford {{has cleared}} out," [...] said Cooper, [...] "gone down to Summerside {{to go into}} Tobe Meekins's factory there. Best thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that's</b> what. Folks here hadn't no use for him after letting that death trap to them two men--even if they was Lib'rals. The Cockawee druv ashore on Little Bear, and there she's going to remain, I guess. D'ye want a berth in my {{mackerel}} boat this summer, Natty?" ...|$|R
60|$|Joe ran on ahead, to {{show what}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in <b>that</b> line, and Plums walked painfully {{by the side of}} aunt Dorcas towards the house.|$|R
60|$|Then young Alboin {{asked his}} father to let him {{sit at the table}} with him. No, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> by Lombard custom, till he has become son-at- arms to some {{neighbouring}} king.|$|R
2500|$|Hajibeyov's second opera Sheikh Sanan {{was written}} in 1909 {{in a form that}} was entirely {{opposite}} to the first. This time Hajibeyov employed a purely European style. Sheikh Sanan received raves as a musical composition, but the content was too progressive for the period. In this opera, Hajibeyov advocated that marriage should not be bound by nationality or religion - in essence, it was another form of integration. But this time, it backfired. The story line follows a religious sheikh on his way to Mecca who meets a very beautiful Georgian lady. To his horror, the lovely creature's father {{turns out to be a}} swineherd, caring for what, to him, was a forbidden animal. In the end, the sheikh denounces his religion to win the woman. It is said that when the opera was performed, many people were offended and walked out, leaving Hajibeyov with the realization that he had outpaced his generation too much this time. As a result, he made a drastic decision and burned the score. When asked by Ramazan Khalilov, his assistant, how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> Hajibeyov replied: [...] "I didn't destroy my opera. It's my own creation so it's always in my head." [...] Khalilov said that Hajibeyov went on to use this same magnificent music 27 years later to create Koroğlu, an opera that many acclaim to be his finest.|$|E
60|$|THE SERPENT. Because if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} do without Eve.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. Hang it, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for himself, anyway. He must think of {{something}} to fortify his position against that woman. And he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{after the}} way he has brought me up, and what we have been taught all our lives about liberty of the individual, absence of control, and the like jargon.' ...|$|R
25|$|Hassett {{played to}} win, {{to the last}} inch and the last second. If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> set out to prevent the other fellows from winning. Yet, if defeat was inevitable, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take {{it as well as}} anybody.|$|R
60|$|He said drily <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{manage to}} <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> {{not without some}} {{contempt}} {{for the state of}} her knowledge.|$|R
6000|$|And then Highsmith {{played his}} trump. The part of [...] "Sol Haytosser" [...] called for pathos {{as well as}} comedy. Miss Carrington should see that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> as well.|$|E
60|$|As for his work, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{as well in}} {{the woods}} as in New York. And, anyhow, he had earned a vacation. For days Mr. Penway had been hinting that the time had arrived for a folding of the hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'd {{have got}} wet, too," [...] he replied, {{wondering}} {{if it were possible}} to make her laugh or even smile. If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to-day, even in the smallest degree, he would be assured that happiness might come back to her.|$|E
60|$|Leaping, as he thought, to {{the exact}} centre of the tunnel, he held his sword point ready on a line with the beast's chest. It was all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> hoping <b>that</b> chance might send the point into the savage heart as he went down beneath the great body.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, without actual proofs <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Arnould Fabrice {{is not a}} man {{against whom}} a mere {{denunciation}} would suffice. He has the grudging respect of every faction in the National Assembly. Nothing but irrefutable proof would prevail against him--and bring him to the guillotine." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{hated to}} dash all their new found joy by the {{announcement}} {{that he was not}} the king. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for the moment he did Peter would step forward and demand that his own coronation continue. How was he to save the throne for Leopold? ...|$|R
60|$|After the mid-day dinner Phil Matlack, {{in a pair}} of high hunting-boots and an oil-skin coat, came to Mr. Archibald {{and said}} that as there was nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> afternoon, he would walk over to Sadler's and attend to some {{business}} he had there.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} {{he arrived at}} the land of the Turks. He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves, and then walked into the town. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> quite well, for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers.|$|E
60|$|The old squire's funeral {{had taken}} place that morning, the will had been read, and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur Donnithorne had come out for a lonely walk, that he might look fixedly at the new future before him and confirm himself in a sad resolution. He thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> best in the Grove.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} to tour and record through the 1950s {{into the early}} 1960s, {{despite the fact that}} Western swing's popularity, even in the Southwest, had greatly diminished. Bob could draw [...] "a thousand people on Monday night between 1950 and 1952, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that</b> by 1956. Entertainment habits had changed." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{he tipped}} the {{wheelbarrow}} back, which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>do</b> now <b>that</b> the load was half out, {{and thought he}} would wheel those along, and take the rest next time.|$|R
60|$|There were, however, so {{many little}} sticks and old {{leaves in the}} sand, that it kept getting {{continually}} clogged up, and at last Rollo began to get discouraged. He tried {{to pick out the}} little sticks; but <b>he</b> found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and at last {{it occurred to him that}} probably Dorothy had some sand in the house that was cleaner.|$|R
60|$|Sam's discomposure vanished. In {{the first}} place, this {{was much more}} the sort of {{conversation}} which he felt the situation indicated. In the second place he had remembered {{that there was no}} need for him to sing at all. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> imitation of Frank Tinney which had been such a hit at the Trinity smoker. He was on safe ground there. He knew he was good. He clasped the girl to him and kissed her sixteen times.|$|E
60|$|For the Squire was {{of all men}} {{the most}} regular, and began to get his horses into {{condition}} {{on the first of}} September as regularly as he began to shoot partridges. The Vicar went home and then made up his mind that he would go up to London after his friend. He must provide for his next Sunday's duty, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> out of a neighbouring parish, and he would start on the morrow. He arranged the matter with his wife and with his friend's curate, and on the Friday he started.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps she was," [...] he said. [...] "Who knows? The gallant colonel had {{to swear}} to his friend's innocence. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in all conscience--after that his duty was accomplished. No {{innocent}} man was suffering for the guilty. The knife which {{had belonged to}} Lord Arthur would always save George Higgins. For a time it had pointed to the husband; fortunately never to the wife. Poor thing, she died probably of a broken heart, but women when they love, think only of one object on earth--the one who is beloved.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{stood still}} and listened {{a moment or}} two while the hoarse roar of a river which he knew was {{swirling}} in fierce flood among the boulders far down in the hollow came up in deep reverberations across the pines. It was a significant hint of what was likely to happen when the pent-up water poured down upon the mine. Still, there was nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in <b>that</b> thick darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, isn't that {{a trifle}} unreasonable? What <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> he hasn't <b>done?</b> He was ill and worn out, but he wouldn't even stay {{a day after}} he got the money." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{minister}} Edwin Paxton Hood, who {{during his}} years held several pastorates, began to liven up his temperance meetings with his own songs, including “As I 'woke one morning” and “It was in dark December" [...] and others, James Rewcastle decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> too <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and penned several tunes, the best known being [...] "Jackey and Jenny". His songs {{appear to have been}} sung by a co-worker at the movement, Fenwick Pickup.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a foolish}} {{way of putting}} it; but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh; and, though I was playing Providence {{at the cost of}} my horse, I could not tell her in as many words what Saumarez had told me. I thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> better himself. All her pretence about being tired and wanting to go home broke down, and she rocked herself to and fro in the saddle as she sobbed, and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward. I am not going to repeat what she said, because she was utterly unstrung.|$|E
60|$|In {{this house}} of his there was writing on every wall. His business-like {{temperament}} protested against a mysterious warning {{that she was}} not made for him. He had married this woman, conquered her, made her his own, and it seemed to him contrary to the most fundamental of all laws, the law of possession, that he could do no more than own her body--if indeed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> which he was beginning to doubt. If any one had asked him if he wanted to own her soul, the question would have seemed to him both ridiculous and sentimental. But he did so want, and the writing said he never would.|$|E
60|$|If Worry {{had picked}} any more players for the varsity, Ken {{could not tell}} who they were. Of course Graves would make the team, and Weir and Raymond were pretty sure of places. There were sixteen players for the other five positions, and picking them was only guesswork. It seemed to Ken {{that some of the}} players showed streaks of fast playing at times, and then {{as soon as they were}} opposed to one another in the {{practice}} game they became erratic. His own progress was slow. One thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> brought warm praise from the coach--he could line the ball home from deep outfield with wonderful speed and accuracy.|$|E
50|$|After {{he retired}} as a player, Wilson became coach of Westar Rules club Swan Districts for the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Late in the 1999 season as Swan Districts’ {{administration}} was undergoing numerous personnel changes, feeling the black and whites needed a fully professional coach and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that</b> job, Wilson resigned his coaching position after having led Swans to seventh and sixth in a nine-club competition.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} have him do so even were he willing. He is great, with a greatness I cannot even understand. He is not the man for these times. In old days, I should have married him, knowing he would climb to greatness by sheer {{strength}} of manhood. But now men do not climb; they crawl to greatness. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I have <b>done</b> right, Paul." ...|$|R
60|$|Lew Flapp {{was not a}} {{particularly}} bright pupil, {{but there was one}} thing, outside of bag punching, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> well, and <b>that</b> was to drill. He took to military tactics naturally, and knew nearly every rule that the book of instructions contained.|$|R
