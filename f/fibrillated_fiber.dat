Sherif Aggour, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering 	In recent years, {{earthquakes}} {{have caused}} heavy {{damage to buildings}} and infrastructure. One {{of the causes of}} heavy damage due to earthquake motions is the role of soft clay in amplifying bedrock ground motions. Improving the soil conditions at a site in order to mitigate earthquake damage {{can be one of the}} methods of modifying site conditions and thus reduce its effects on the seismic site response. The inclusion of randomly distributed short virgin polypropylene fibers (C 3 H 6) in clay has proven to significantly improve the static geotechnical properties of clay such as shear, compression, tensile strengths, and so on. These improvements have triggered great interest in the possibility of mixing fibers with clay to improve the clay's dynamic properties. Because the percentage of fibers is currently arbitrarily chosen by users, a procedure was set up in this study to determine the optimum fiber content for a fiber-clay composite. Experimental testing was performed using the Resonant Column Method to obtain both the shear modulus and the material damping for a clay and the fiber-clay composite to determine the effect of fiber inclusion on the dynamic properties of clayey soil. The research showed that the inclusion of fiber at optimum fiber content as a ground improvement technique can improve the dynamic properties of soft clayey soils at low shear strain. Test results indicated that both the shear modulus and damping increased. Hence, the inclusion of fiber in clay can provide a double benefit for the dynamic response of a site by increasing the stiffness of the site and reducing its amplitude of vibration. General formulas for shear modulus and damping were developed as functions of the shear strain amplitude for the clay and for fiber reinforced clay. The effect of fiber inclusion on the seismic site response using two different earthquake motions was also studied. One-dimensional wave propagation analysis was performed to investigate the effect of the modification of the clay dynamic properties using <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforcements on the site response. The results indicated that by modifying the clayey soil using fiber, the seismic site response can be improved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} {{preliminary}} laboratory tests on a clay and a sand rein-forcedwith randomly distributed <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibers</b> are presented. The results of compac-tion, direct shear, unconfined compression and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests are described. The influence of test parameters such as normal stress, {{the amount of}} re-inforcement, specimen size, and moisture content is addressed. The tests show that fi-bers significantly increase the peak compressive strength of clay and sand. The addition of fiber reinforcement {{in the sand and}} clay specimens resulted in substantial increases in the peak friction angle and cohesion values. The increase in strength is a function of fiber content and moisture content. The Mohr-Coulomb failure envelopes for the clay specimens are described by a combination of curvilinear and linear sections. The CBR values for the clay and sand specimens were also significantly improved using fiber re-inforcement. This preliminary study suggests that for the soils tested and reinforced with 25 mm long polypropylene <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibers,</b> the optimum fiber content is approxi...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to clarify the role of {{external}} fibrillation in pulp and paper properties. If the degree of external fibrillation could be controlled {{and the role of}} external fibrillation were known, this would provide better possibilities for utilizing the full potential of fibrous material. External fibrillation caused by refining is inevitable, but its role has not been clearly explained, because conventional refiners produce a variety of simultaneous effects, such as internal fibrillation, external fibrillation, straightening or curling of fibers and fines formation. Therefore, a special type of refiner was required for evaluating the specific role of external fibrillation. An ultra-fine friction grinder consisting of two grinding stones was found to overcome the limitation related to conventional refiners. Using the grinder, it was possible to promote external fibrillation while keeping the internal fibrillation and curl constant. An increase in external fibrils attached to fibers was found to increase the retention of filler during sheet forming in a high-vacuum dewatering device. Promoting the degree of external fibrillation contributed to strengthening the bonding layer between fibers, resulting in improved tensile strength and internal bond strength. Recycling reduced fiber swelling and paper strength, but for externally <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibers</b> this loss was restored by refining more than for internally <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibers,</b> even beyond the swelling and strength of the nonrecycled fibers. Increasing external fibrillation alone was found {{to play an important role}} in fiber and paper properties, so it can be used as means to control those properties more effectively. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{description of the}} mechanical behavior of High-Performance Concrete in fire still requires further efforts to fully understand the tricky phenomenon of spalling, whose complexity comes from the interaction among different phenomena, namely: the microstructural changes occurring in concrete at high temperature, the pressure rising in the pores, and the stress induced by both thermal gradients and external loads. To what extent these different aspects influence each other is still not completely clear, and within this context a comprehensive experimental campaign has been launched at the Politecnico di Milano, focusing on {{the role played by}} concrete grade, aggregate type, and fiber type and content.

40|$|Sisal (Agave sisalana) as a {{perennial}} tropical plant grows abundantly in Indonesia. Its fibers {{can be used}} as the reinforcement agent of biocomposite products. Utilization of sisal as natural fiber has some notable benefits compared to synthetic fibers, such as renewable, light in weight, and low in cost. Manufacture of biocomposite requires the use of matrix such as thermoplastic polymer, e. g. polypropylene (PP) and polylactic acid (PLA) to bond together with the reinforcement agent (e. g. sisal fibers). In relevant, experiment was conducted on biocomposites manufacture that comprised sisal fibers and PP as well as PLA. Sisal fibers were converted into pulp, then refined to micro-size <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibers</b> such that their diameter reduced to about 10 μm, and dried in an oven. The dry microfibrillated sisal pulp fibers cellulose (MSFC) were thoroughly mixed with either PP or PLA with varying ratios of MSFC/PP as well as MSFC/PLA, and then shaped into the mat (i. e. MSFC-PP and MSFC-PLA biocomposites). Two kinds of shaping was employed, i. e. hot-press molding and injection molding. In the hot-press molding, the ratio of MSFC/PP as well as MSFC/PLA ranged about 30 / 70 - 50 / 50. Meanwhile in the injection (employed only on assembling the MSFC-PLA biocomposite), the ratio of MSFC/PLA varied about 10 / 90 - 30 / 70. The resulting shaped MSFC-PP and MSFC-PLA biocomposites were then tested of its physical and mechanical properties. With the hot-press molding device, the physical and mechanical (strength) properties of MSFC-PLA biocomposite were higher than those of MSFC-PP biocomposite. The optimum ratio of MSFC/PP as well as MSFC/PLA reached concurrently at 40 / 60. The strengths of MSFC-PP as well as MSFC-PLA biocomposites were greater than those of individual polymer (PP and PLA). With the injection molding device, only the MSFC-PLA biocomposite was formed and its strengths reached maximum at 30 / 70 ratio. The particular strengths (MOR and MOE) of MSFC-PLA biocomposite shaped with injection molding were lower than those with hot-press molding, both at 30 / 70 ratio. The overall MOR of such MSFC- PLA biocomposite was lower than that of pure PLA, while its MOE was still mostly higher...|$|R
40|$|This study {{approaches}} the phenomena of thermomechanical defibration of wood by examining single fiber properties. A hypothesis was formed based on literature: The defibration patterns due to impacts during fiber separation and high-consistency refining {{are related to}} the morphological properties of fibers. This is because: The effects caused by the action of defibration vary in morphologically different fibers, and The defibration action in the plate gap is influenced by the properties of the fiber material in the plate gap and changes as the properties of the fiber material in the plate gap change. In other words: the character of the fiber material affects the defibration result through two routes: firstly the defibration patterns of fibers {{are related to the}}ir properties, and secondly the character of the fiber bed in the plate gap influences the defibration action. The defibration patterns of fiber shortening, fiber wall thickness reduction and changing of fiber wall internal structure are discussed. The experimental part focuses on the defibration effects which are the measurable deformations in the fibers as a result of defibration actions. Defibration patterns are a set of defibration effects that develop the stiff wood fibers into papermaking fibers and fines particles. These concepts can be applied to all mechanical pulping processes, but this thesis focuses on their application to the TMP process and spruce as raw material. Fiber shortening was the result of cutting of fibers during the fiber separation stage. Fast-grown and thinner-walled fibers were more resistant than thick walled slow growth fibers towards the harsh conditions prevailing during fiber separation. Faster warming up of the fiber wall as a result of compression and relaxation of the material as well as encountering fewer shear forces than thick-walled incompressible fiber material were suggested as explanations for the different response of these fibers. The gradual peeling off of layers from the fiber surface resulted in reduction of fiber wall thickness. Different types of fibers produced different types of fines. The fibrillar fines were formed mainly from thick-walled fibers, and 50 - 100 % of the <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibers</b> originated from latewood. The flake-like fines originated both from outer layers of latewood and earlywood fibers during fiber separation stage but also from pieces of the thinwalled earlywood fibers during the later stages of the whole defibration process. Only half of the fines fraction was formed as a result of peeling off of fiber wall. The rest consisted of ray cells, pieces of fibers and fiber wall formed as a result of fiber cutting or splitting. The differences in the fiber wall thickness did not explain the flexibility differences between initially refined and highly refined samples. From this was concluded that the fiber wall flexibility increased and fiber wall structure loosened during the defibration. Local swelling of the fiber wall was revealed using optical sectioning by confocal laser scanning microscopy. As a result of this inhomogeneity both fiber wall swelling and fiber conformability varied along the fiber length. Removal of the outer fiber layers increased fiber flexibility by decreasing fiber elastic properties and lowering the moment of inertia...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, fully ?green? {{composites}} using nonwoven kenaf {{mats and}} modified soy protein isolate (SPI) resin were fabricated. Moreover, <b>fibrillated</b> bamboo <b>fiber</b> (FBF) sheets were also incorporated into some kenaf mat composites to obtain engineered hybrid green composites. Potential mechanical properties of these cutting-edge materials have been proposed. Initially, an appropriate SPI resin composition for optimal composite properties {{was determined by}} varying pH values and the amounts of glycerol, used as plasticizer. The final composition contained 10 % glycerol (by wt. of SPI) and 11 pH. The effects of a self cross-linking Phytagel? on the tensile properties of the modified SPI resins were evaluated. The tensile strength and Young?s modulus of SPI resins showed a significant improvement by adding Phytagel?. The kenaf fiber/modified SPI resin interface was characterized using the single fiber fragmentation technique. The mechanical properties of these green composites fabricated with SPI modified with various percentages (0, 10, 20 and 40 %) of Phytagel? (by wt. of SPI) were characterized. The tensile properties of the green composites didn?t increase significantly with the Phytagel? content. The flexural strength and chord modulus of the composites containing 20 % Phytagel? in SPI resin were, however, 1. 6 and 1. 4 {{times higher than the}} composites with 0 % Phytagel?, respectively. The composites with 40 % Phytagel? in SPI resin possessed the highest impact strength. The tensile strength and modulus of the hybrid composites using FBF sheets and SPI resin modified with 20 % Phytagel? were 37. 1 MPa and 2187 MPa, respectively, which represent a 10 % and 20 % improvement over the kenaf mat composites using the same resin. The impact strength of the kenaf mat composites improved 116 % after incorporating FBF sheets...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} {{contribution of}} utilizing locally available waste materials to replace conventional concrete materials gained considerable attention {{during the past}} two decades in the realization of sustainable building materials. One such industrial waste material available abound in South East Asia is lightweight oil palm shell (OPS). Earlier researches on OPS showed that OPS could be considered as an ideal replacement of granite aggregates to produce a sustainable lightweight concrete called oil palm shell concrete (OPSC). The development of OPSC has the advantage as a lightweight concrete in addition to environmental benefits. However, the application of OPSC in structural members is less convincing due to its low tensile strength and the addition of fibers has been effective to solve this weakness. The initial challenge in the development of oil palm shell fiber reinforced concrete (OPSFRC) lies in selection of appropriate fibers. In this study, <b>fibrillated</b> and monofilament <b>fibers,</b> nylon fibers and steel fibers of aspect ratio 55, 65 and 80 were added in the OPSC to investigate the effects of different fibers on the mechanical properties of OPSFRC and thereby to select the suitable type of fiber.

In addition, by using a high volume fraction of 3...|$|R

It is highly recommended as a prime reference for people in the nonwovens industry. This book culminates a productive career in the field and impressively lives up to the author’s aim, as stated in the “Preface,” “to provide the reader with a fundamental understanding of nonwoven filter media. ” Gas, liquid, and engine filtration are discussed in a way as to identify the types of filter media used in these applications. The theoretical presentation based on flow through porous media, which is rather useful as applied to liquid filtration, is developed around a nonwovens or engineered fabrics orientation. In addition, for aerosol filtration, the author has presented in detail “single fiber theory” developed for the filtration of particles from an air stream. Those properties that identify filter and separation media are reviewed. This includes electrostatic media (electrets), coalescing media, adsorptive media, and antimicrobial media. The author describes several mechanisms for imparting an electrostatic charge to a medium; such as electrostatically spun <b>fibers,</b> <b>fibrillated</b> electret film, triboelectric effects, and corona discharge. Four categories of raw materials are identified: polymers, fibers, binders, and additives. The discussion of raw materials is the most extensive chapter in the book.

The primary goal of this MODOT-sponsored investigation is to characterize the flexural shear response, fatigue behavior, and performance of fiber reinforced concrete flexural sections with fiber reinforced polymer tensile reinforcement for use in bridge deck applications. Results from a series of flexural fatigue tests, on plain and fiber reinforced concrete flexural specimens, are reported and discussed. First, to establish the compressive response of concrete with differing fractions of polypropylene fibers by volume, individual compressive tests were performed on both lab-mix and ready mix concrete specimens. In the lab, concrete mixes with 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, and 1. 0 % by volume, <b>fibrillated</b> polypropylene <b>fibers</b> were produced. Along with these, specimens from the various beam castings that were part of the Steel Free Bridge Deck project were also taken. These concrete ready-mix batches were either plain concrete or contained 0. 5 % fibers. Tests on both 6 " standard cylinders and 4 " cylinders were performed. The compression tests on the 6 " cylinders were performed in standard open-loop testing apparatus and provided load and deflection data up to ultimate strength. The 4 " cylinders were tested in closed-loop testing apparatus and provided post-peak load deflection data as well as pre-peak data. After the compressive response of the fiber reinforced concrete was established, four point bending tests were performed on 36 lab cast beam specimens. The beam specimens had cross-sectional dimensions of 6 "x 9. 5 " (width x height). The span was 48 " and the loading points were 8 " apart (4 " each side of the mid-point). The depth of reinforcement was 8 ". There were two castings of beams; one with plain concrete and one with 0. 5 % by volume polypropylene fibers, both using ready mix concrete. For each casting there were 18 beams; 6 with # 8 GFRP, 6 with # 4 GFRP, and 6 with # 4 CFRP tensile reinforcement. For each set of 6 beams, two were tested under quasi-static loading until failure to determine ultimate load capacity and ultimate deflection, two were tested at low fatigue, and two were tested at high fatigue. The low fatigue tests varied the applied loading cyclically from approximately 30 %- 60 % of maximum load capacity and the high fatigue tests varied the loading from approximately 40 %- 80 % of maximum load capacity. The fatigue cycles were continued until beam failure or 1. 2 million cycles. A LabView® program was used to enable test-control and data-acquisition for the specialized type of flexural fatigue testing. The fiber mixes performed similarly to the plain concrete control specimens except that the fiber reinforced beams failed in a more ductile manner. The rate of flexural stiffness degradation was slightly greater in the fiber reinforced specimens. The more rapid degradation may have been caused by lower strength concrete in the fiber reinforced beams instead of the addition of the fibers...|$|R
