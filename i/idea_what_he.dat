He {{is one of two}} candidates who did not respond to The Press about his top issues, thus not giving readers and voters an <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> stands for.|$|E

500|$|Adelina Poerio {{was cast}} as the {{fleeting}} red-coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome. Standing at only 4'2" [...] tall, she had {{a career as a}} singer. Renato Scarpa was cast as Inspector Longhi, despite not being able to speak English and so he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying in the film.|$|E

500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but you had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was or {{what he was going}} to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Miller had a classically high arm action, {{moving the}} ball sharply either way {{and able to}} make the ball rise from a good length. His action caused {{opposition}} batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching. He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner, Lindwall. He was always willing to try something new if the batsman were set, varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa. A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket, surprising the batsman. Compton said that Miller [...] "often had no preconceived <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> intended to bowl even as he turned to start his run". Miller often mixed slow leg breaks when he was bowling off a run. He once bowled English opening batsman David Sheppard with a googly during a Test. Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark, and said that he [...] "never felt physically safe against him". His use of bouncers at Trent Bridge during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd, who booed him. Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. He was often required to bowl through pain, pressing a disk into place {{at the base of his}} spine before sending down the next delivery.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{returned}} to his parents' home in Harlem in 1923 with no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to do}} next. He considered returning to music, but an old school friend suggested that he try boxing. At one amateur match, fight announcer Joe Humphries saw the name [...] "Canagata, Lee" [...] on the card he was using. He tossed the card aside and instead announced [...] "Canada Lee"—a name that Lee liked and adopted. In the amateur ring he won 90 out of 100 bouts and the national amateur lightweight title.|$|E

Although he knows {{a great deal about}} sports statistics, he knows very little about anything else. This of course doesn't stop Rynoh from acting like an authority on everything under the Sun, though once he opens his mouth, it's clear <b>he</b> has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about. He is voiced by Cory Doran.|$|R
2500|$|In 1977 Chappell {{signed to}} play for World Series Cricket along with his brothers. He had {{failed to make the}} first team for WA for the 1977–78 season when Dennis Lillee {{approached}} him. Chappell later recalled, [...] "Lillee said to me, [...] "Bad luck about not making it in the WA team. Don't worry, something better might come along." [...] I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. And a few days later [...] Robinson, Dennis' manager, rang and said, [...] "Do you want to join World Series Cricket" [...] and I said, [...] "Yeah, where do I sign?"" ...|$|E
2500|$|Aaron {{surmised that}} this setting would also return the Apollo 12 {{telemetry}} to normal. When {{he made the}} recommendation to the Flight Director, [...] "Flight, try SCE to Aux", most of his mission control colleagues had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was talking about. Both the flight director and the Capcom asked him to repeat the recommendation. Pete Conrad's response to the order was, [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] Fortunately Alan Bean {{was familiar with the}} location of the SCE switch inside the capsule, and flipped it to auxiliary. Telemetry was immediately restored, allowing the mission to continue. This earned Aaron the lasting respect of his colleagues, who declared that he was a [...] "steely-eyed missile man".|$|E

Horses and all, they are placed in a Time Transfer chamber for return to their own time, {{but at the last}} minute Mendoza sees the cyborg Lewis enter the building. [...] Lewis had befriended Mendoza at the facility New World One and she suspected {{he was in love with}} her. [...] Lewis makes an attempt to talk to Mendoza, and tries to warn her [...] "Don't go with him!". She has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means, and in any case, the transfer takes place before any more can be said.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{websites}} start {{popping up}} with conspiracies about the 4400, including one regarding Orson. Shawn walks in while {{his brother and}} his girlfriend are viewing this website. Shawn is also confronted by his brother regarding the fight, and claims <b>he</b> has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about. However, he visits his cousin {{in the hospital and}} briefly wakes him from his coma by grabbing on to him, thus realizing that he has some sort of supernatural ability.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't say {{anything}} if it wasn't {{that you were}} like brothers," [...] she said. [...] "But he did begin to have dreadful drinking bouts. You know it was always spirits, and generally brandy:—and that makes such work with them. You've no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> like when he's evil-drunk.

2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|According to David Thomson, Rivette was [...] "famous {{for having}} {{little or no}} home life, {{certainly}} not a private life that overlaps with his work. On his own, he would rather sit in the dark with another movie"; in 1956, he was described as [...] "too aloof and forbiddingly intellectual". Bulle Ogier described Rivette as very secretive about his life: [...] "I've no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does. I only see him when we're filming" [...] or when she bumped into him in public, although she felt close to him. According to Ogier, he had neuroses and anxiety which often prevented him from answering the phone, and talking about his personal life would be indiscreet and a betrayal. Laurence Côte said that joining Rivette's inner circle of trusted friends was difficult and required [...] "a number of hurdles to overcome and to respect codes." [...] Martine Marignac said that Rivette was very modest and shy, and that his circle of close friends grew used to not hearing from him for prolonged periods of time. Marignac also said that [...] "He spends his life going to the movies, but also reading, listening to music. It {{is clear that the}} world of reality assaults him." [...] Jonathan Romney reported that in the 1970s [...] "Rivette sometimes went AWOL from his own shoots, he would invariably be found watching some rarity in one of the Left Bank art cinemas." [...] Jean-Pierre Léaud, who described Rivette as a close friend, said that he [...] "was the only person who saw everything in a film. And he transmitted everything he saw to us, setting in march our own aesthetic ideas". The director {{was the subject of a}} 1990 documentary, Jacques Rivette, the Night Watchman, directed by Claire Denis and Serge Daney. Travis Mackenzie Hoover wrote that the documentary portrays Rivette with [...] "lonerish tendencies" [...] and as [...] "a sort of transient with no home or country, wandering about or loitering in public space instead of staking out some personal terra firma." ...|$|E

Justin tells her he doesn't, but if that's what she needs to go to prom with him, then he'll get her weed. He then divulges to the Narrator that <b>he</b> has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing, but he just cares too much about Naomi to have told her no ("One School").|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} I am {{much better off}} up here," [...] he muttered, grimly, as he walked {{cautiously}} along without any very good <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> expected to find.|$|R
