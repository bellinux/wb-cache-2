40|$|Scurvy {{is caused}} by {{prolonged}} severe dietary deficiency of ascorbic acid, in which the breakdown of intercellular cement substances leads to capillary hemorrhages and defective growth of fibroblasts, osteoblasts and odontoblasts, resulting in impaired synthesis of collagen, osteoid and dentine.

People with abnormal dietary habits, mental illness or physical disability are prone to develop this disease. <b>Epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> is known to occur in scurvy but is rarely seen now. <b>Epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> from the metaphysis is always through the zone of calcified cartilage, known as &#x 201 C;scorbutic lattice&#x 201 D;, which in the radiographs is represented as &#x 201 C;the white line of Frenkel&#x 201 D;.

The total of nine epiphyseal injuries made up 5.3 % of all fractures. Of the other 161 fractures, 55 (34.2 %) could be associated with cast immobilization, and therefore damage to the epiphyseal plate was found more often after cast immobilization.|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Osseous injuries {{are a major}} facet {{of child abuse and}} in most patients radiographic imaging {{plays a major role in}} diagnosis. While some injuries are typically produced as a result of excessive and inappropriate force other injuries are nonspecific in terms of their causation, but become suspicious when the history provided by the caretakers is inconsistent with the type of injury produced. Questions/purposes I detail the radiographic imaging of the more characteristic of the highly specific injuries, discuss the major issues that relate to some moderate- or lowspecificity injuries, and describe several diseases that mimic abuse. Methods A review of the current and recent literature focused on the radiographic imaging of child abuse was performed by searching the National Library of Medicine database at pubmed. gov. Keywords used included: radiology, fracture, child abuse, and/or nonaccidental trauma. Results Injuries that are highly specific for the diagnosis of abuse include metaphyseal corner fractures, posteromedial rib fractures, and sternal, scapular, and spinous process fractures. Lesions of moderate specificity include, among other injuries, multiple fractures of various ages and <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separations.</b> Long-bone fractures and clavicular The author certifies that he has no commercial associations (eg, consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangements, etc) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article...|$|R

Types 1 and 2 were subclassified into avulsion, split and split-depression. Surgery is recommended for unstable type- 1 avulsion fractures, type- 2 avulsions which may develop buttonhole deformities, and all fractures which displace articular cartilage surfaces.

The fractured distal humerus was treated by internal fixation with percutaneous Kirschner wires. A follow-up observation revealed a good recovery.

40|$|From a {{study of}} a series of rabbits inoculated with two old strains of Treponema pallidum, it was found that {{localized}} infection of bones and tendons was of frequent occurrence and {{led to the formation of}} a variety of lesions. The bones usually involved were those of the face and the feet and legs. Most often the lesions arose from the periosteum but developed also within the bone or marrow cavities and at lines of epiphyseal union. Grossly, the periosteal lesions were of two types—one being a circumscribed, indurated, and nodular mass and the other a process of a more diffuse character. Histologically, the lesions presented the typical appearance of syphilitic granulomata composed of more or less distinct layers which corresponded roughly with structural divisions of the periosteum. The composition of lesions of membrane and of cartilage bones differed somewhat in this respect, especially in the development of an osteoclastic layer. Invasion of the bone with absorption and necrosis were constant features of periosteal affections and were most marked in the case of the facial bones and the small bones of the feet. Lesions in the bone and marrow cavities were detected chiefly by radiographs or by the occurrence of bone destruction in the absence of periosteal involvement. They were characterized by a loss of structural detail in the bone, rarefication, increased fragility, necrosis, pathological fracture, and <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> associated with more or less granulomatous reaction. Histologically, the bone lesions presented essentially the same picture as those of the periosteum, while the lesions which arose from the marrow cavities were composed chiefly of polyblastic infiltrations. In this group of affections, the most important were those which developed at the epiphyses. The destructive effects produced by all classes of lesions varied from a slight surface erosion or rarefication to extensive necrosis resulting in the formation of bony defects or in disintegration or fracture of the bone. These conditions differed very decidedly with the particular bones involved. Of especial importance in this connection was the occurrence of a peculiar form of mass necrosis which at times resulted in the destruction of considerable areas of bone even in parts where the granulomatous type of lesion was comparatively slight. The most characteristic injuries were the saddle-nose deformities and the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> in the small bones of the tarsus and hind feet. The marks of permanent injury were, on the whole, comparatively slight, but they also differed both with the degree of the original injury and with the bone affected. Granulomatous lesions of tendons or tendon sheaths were occasionally seen, and in a few instances, lesions of synovial cavities were demonstrated microscopically...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Nutritional {{deficiencies}} {{are rarely}} reported in developed countries. We report {{a child of}} Pakistani origin brought up in Dubai who developed skeletal manifestations of scurvy due to peculiar dietary habits. Case Presentation. A 4. 5 year old boy presented with pain and swelling of multiple joints for three months and inability to walk for two months. Dietary history was significant for exclusive meat intake for the preceding two years. On examination the child’s height and weight were below the 5 th percentile for his age. He was pale and tachycardic. There was significant swelling and tenderness over the wrist, knee and ankle joints, along with painful restriction of motion. Basic blood workup was unremarkable except for anemia. However, X-rays showed delayed bone age, severe osteopenia of the long bones, <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation,</b> cortical thinning and dense zone of provisional calcification, suggesting a radiological diagnosis of scurvy. The child was started on vitamin C replacement therapy. Over the following two months, the pain and swelling substantially reduced and the child became able to walk. Repeat X-rays showed improvement in the bony abnormalities. Conclusion. Although scurvy {{is not a very}} commonly encountered entity in the modern era, inappropriate dietary intake can lead to skeletal abnormalities which may be confused with rickets. A high index of suspicion is thus required for prompt diagnosis of scurvy in patients with bone and joint symptoms...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with myelomeningocele (MMC), {{a high number}} of fractures occur in the paralyzed extremities, affecting mobility and independence. The aims of this retrospective cross-sectional study are to determine the frequency of fractures in our patient cohort and to identify trends and risk factors relevant for such fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1988 and June 2005, 862 {{patients with}} MMC were treated at our hospital. The medical records, surgery reports, and X-rays from these patients were evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, 11 % of the patients (n =  92) suffered one or more fractures. Risk analysis showed that patients with MMC and thoracic-level paralysis had a sixfold higher risk of fracture compared with those with sacral-level paralysis. Femoral-neck z-scores measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) differed significantly according to the level of neurological impairment, with lower z-scores in children with a higher level of lesion. Furthermore, the rate of <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> increased noticeably after cast immobilization. Mainly patients who could walk relatively well were affected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thoracic-level paralysis represent a group with high fracture risk. According to these results, fracture and epiphyseal injury in patients with MMC should be treated by plaster immobilization. The duration of immobilization should be kept to a minimum (< 4  weeks) because of increased risk of secondary fractures. Alternatively, patients with refractures can be treated by surgery, when nonoperative treatment has failed...|$|E
40|$|Age related {{changes and}} {{osteochondrosis}} in swine were studied using light microscopy and electron microscopy in articular cartilage and light microscopy and epiphyseal cartilage of swine from {{three days to}} 30 weeks of age. Thickness, cellularity and vascularity of both the epiphyseal and articular cartilage, decreased as the swine aged. Osteochondrotic changes included formation of "plugs" of cartilage indicating localized failure of ossification and separation and space formation in epiphyseal cartilage. Eosinophilic streaks and space formation in epiphyseal cartilage was observed in relation to <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation.</b> Electron microscopy showed a continuous fibrillar layer {{on the surface of}} the cartilage corresponding to the lamina splendens of light microscopy. This layer increased in the thickness and showed accumulation of amorphous material between the fibrils with aging. In the matrix, the orientation and distribution of the collagen fibers changed with growth and thicker fibers with clear sub banding were more common in older age groups. Also, necrotic cells, glycogen containing bodies and cellular debris were noticed in the matrix of normal cartilage in old animals. Chondrocytes in the younger cartilage showed accumulation of organelles responsible for protein synthesis; while Golgi bodies, vesicles, lysosomes, well developed foot processes and other inclusions were noticed in older cartilage. Cartilage erosions had a clumped and disrupted lamina splendens on the surface and electron lucent patches in the ground substances of the matrix and chondrocyte cytoplasm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProximal humerus {{fractures}} {{are rare}} in paediatric traumatology. Metaphyseal fractures {{account for about}} 70 % of cases and <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> for the remaining 30 %. The development and anatomy of the proximal humerus explain the various fracture types, displacements, and potential complications; and also help in interpreting the radiographic findings, most notably in young children. Physicians should be alert {{to the possibility of}} an underlying lesion or pathological fracture requiring appropriate diagnostic investigations, and they should consider child abuse in very young paediatric patients. Although the management of proximal humerus fractures remains controversial, the extraordinary remodelling potential of the proximal humerus in skeletally immature patients often allows non-operative treatment without prior reduction. When the displacement exceeds the remodelling potential suggested by the extent of impaction, angulation, and patient age, retrograde elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) provides effective stabilisation. As a result, the thoraco-brachial abduction cast is less often used, although this method remains a valid option. Retrograde ESIN must be performed by a surgeon who is thoroughly conversant with the fundamental underlying principles. Direct percutaneous pinning is a fall-back option when the surgeon's experience with ESIN is insufficient. Finally, open reduction is very rarely required and should be reserved for severely displaced fractures after failure of closed reduction. When these indications are followed, long-term outcomes are usually excellent, with prompt resumption of previous activities and a low rate of residual abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} ten common {{surgical}} conditions {{seen by the}} author over a 3 years period at the Muhimbili Medical Centre is presented. A cri ticaJ review of the relevant literature follows each condition studied. In general surgery, the conditions studied were peptic ulcer perfora 1 rectal carcinoma, splenic rupture, appendicitis and endemic goitre. Pepti ulcer perforation {{was found to be}} the commonest complication of' peptic ulc disease demanding surgical intervention. It accounted for 70 % of peptic ulcer patients requiring surgery. This greatly contrasts with a figure of about rJ%, in most Western series. The rarity of this complication in the female sex was very remarkable in this study; not a single case was seen. ' in the female population. Utilizing simple closure as the initial surgica; trea tment in all pa. tients resulted in 17 % and 3 d/o of acute ulcers and chronio u 1 ~ers respectively requiring subsquent definitive surgery. A mortali ty of 15 % was experienced and this was related to delay in surgical intervention. Rectal cancer constituted ao% of all the colorectal cancers seen by the author at Muhimbili. Only 42 % of these tumours were reseotable. Compared to European patients, the author's patients were relatively young with a median age of 46 years~ Although the clinical presentation was classical from onset in over acf/o of these patients, 64 % of the patient!: were referred to hospital from the dispensaries only after one or more ~, years have elapsed. However, a shorter symptom duration was found no. Jda! be associated with a favourable stage of tumour. Acute appendicitis, the commonest surgical emergency in developed countries and believed to be rare in Africans, was found to be not so I uacommon at the Muhimbili Medical Centre. In one of the 3 surgical firms, IS the average rate of acute appendicitis (confinued surgically or histopath~, logically) was one case per month while the rate of appendicectomy was 1. 7 cases per month. Despite the high diagnostic error (32 %) experienced,; the rate of perforation was also high (6 qt). This was mainly due to delay in making diagnosis at the dispensaries. There was no mortality from acute appendicitis but the morbidity from perforated appendix was 	- 	- ~~ [...] [...] -~ [...] - very high and this could only be significantly reduced by training the dispensary staff in early recognition of this condition. The classical clinical presentation was observed in only 60 % of the author's patients. Laparatamy for traumatic rupture of the spleen, ranked as the fourth major emergency procedure in one of the general surgical firms at Muhimbi Road Traffic Accidents were the cause of 5 d'fo of the ruptured spleens wbil urban violence and falling from coeonut trees were the second major cause Inefficient facilities for evacuation of trauma victims from the scene' of accident to hospital resulted in many patients with serious injuries dying before reaching hospital. The author extensively reviews the rationale and trend towards spleen conserving operations. Many regions of Tanzania are endemic of goitre but only few patients come to require surgical intervention at the Muhimbili Medical Centre. FOllicular carcinoma of the thyroid was observed to be the commonest type Of thyroid cancer at Muhimbili. This was a reflection of the prevalence. of endemic goitre in the country. Mass prophylaxis by salt iodinization, rather than the surgeon's knife, is the only rational cheap solution to this nutritional disorder of the thyroid which the government should undertake. ThI'ee common paediAo tric surgical conditions were also studied. Thes included Burkitt's lymphoma, infantile hydrocephalus and crytorchidism.. Burki tt' s lymphoma was the cOIIlnonest cancer which cansti tuted 70 '/ 0 of all the cancers seen by the author in the paediatric surgical ward. The abdOJ form of Burk 1 tt lymphoma was the cOIIlnonest manifestation found in the wa: It accounted for ~ of the total cases of Burkitt's Lymphoma. A hospi ta: mortality of 4 % was observed and this was attributed mainly to chemo- theraupetic complications. Patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and hydrocepJ mostly came from far upcountry stations. These patients were usually los' to follow up after the initial treatment at Muhimbili. The long term benef 1 t of the therapy offered from Muhimbili was therefore not mown. I" is a known fact that devices for shunts in hydrocephalus are very expensi but are useless, if not dangerous, when close expert follow up is not posr 	 [...] - 	~ - 	- Even in the Dest medical centres in the world, the current available treatment procedures for hydrocephalus are often attended by a multitude of late complications and appear not to affect much the natural course of the disease in the long run. The author ends the paediatric section by looking at the presently rather controversial subject of cryptorchidism. At the Muh 1 mbili Medical Centre, these children were usually operated on as they came. The age for operation was mainly ini"luenced by the parents or the referring doc to: This situation resulted in only 33 % of the patients being operated before the age of 5 years. An extensive up to date review of this currently evolving problem is presented. Finally, the author ends the dissertation by studying two cammon orthopaedic conditions, namely distal femoral epiphyseal plate injuries and traumatic meniscal tears. The special diagnostic and management; problems presented by epiphyseal plate injuries are high-lighted. Closed reduction of displaced distal femoral <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>separation</b> failed in all the author's 7 patients. This occurred despite the fact that 28. ~ of the patients reported for treatment within 5 days of the injury and 57. 1 % reported within 10 days. Trauma. tic meniscal tears mainly affected young adults; 7 "Sfo of the patients were aged 30 years or below. Sports activities were the major causes which accounted for 6 ~ of the cases. Both sexes were equally affected. Associated tears of knee ligaments were present in 18 % of the cases. Total menieectomy, with repair of knee ligaments where indicated, resulted in good results in all patients studied at a ~onth follow up. Partial menisectamy for traumatic menieca tears is becoming popular, though it was not utilized in the author's patients. The merits and demerits of partial menisectomy is extensively reviewed...|$|E
