According to Bradbury, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> not the state, who are the culprit in Fahrenheit 451. Nevertheless, the role on censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.|$|E

Even {{after the death of}} Sun Yat-sen in 1925, for sixty years, the KMT controlled all five branches of the government; none were independent. Yan Jiaqi, founder of the Federation for a Democratic China, has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be credited as founding China's first republic in 1912, and the second republic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the region.|$|E

500|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22. The people {{discussed}} if Cisneros should stay in power and, in the case he was removed from office, which type of government should be established. Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting his turn to speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that confers the authority or command." [...] This statement was in line with the Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, a political concept formulated by Castelli, stating that {{in the absence of the}} rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples, who had then the power to give it to someone else. Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra's, becoming the common position which was eventually passed with 87 votes.|$|E
500|$|After {{successfully}} rehabilitating {{his knee}} in the offseason, Rivera announced on March9, 2013, {{that he would}} retire after the 2013 season, his 19th in the major leagues. Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: [...] "It was {{important for me to}} meet the people who make baseball what it <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who work in the game every day. They have given me far more than I have given them." [...] Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city: in Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song [...] "Enter Sandman"; the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the [...] "Chair of Broken Dreams"; the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher's charitable organization. Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well; Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with Rivera's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior, while Hard Rock Cafe retired [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.|$|E

Therefore infallibility is [...] "a doctrine and order rooted in and reflecting the sensus fidelium." [...] Rahner insists that a Pope's statements depend essentially on his knowledge of what the living tradition maintains. There is no question of revelation but of preservation from error {{in the exercise of}} this oversight. This living tradition was gathered from communication with all the Bishops in the two instances where the Pope defined dogmas apart from a Council, the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1983, {{the term}} {{homeless}} implied that economic conditions caused homelessness. However, after 1983 more associations {{were made with}} the term. Alcoholism and mental illness became associated with the term in the media. Claims were often backed up with testimony made by high-ranking officials. For example, Ronald Reagan stated that one problem that we’ve had, {{even in the best}} of times, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who are sleeping on the grates, those who are homeless by choice. [...] This claim made the homelessness problem one of personal choice and mental condition, not of the neoliberal reforms sweeping through the economic system. This made homelessness something that would exist even under the best economic conditions, and therefore economic reforms would be unnecessary.|$|E

The President's answer has become famous in Mexican history textbooks: [...] "It causes me great pain, Madame, {{to see you}} like that on your knees; but even if every king and queen were in your place, I couldn't spare his life.

2500|$|Ascetic practices, shrine {{rituals and}} ceremonies, and Japanese festivals {{are the most}} public ways that Shinto devotees {{celebrate}} and offer adoration for the kami. Kami are celebrated during their distinct festivals that usually {{take place at the}} shrines dedicated to their worship. Many festivals involve believers, who are usually intoxicated, parading, sometimes running, toward the shrine while carrying mikoshi (portable shrines) as the community gathers for the festival ceremony. Yamamoto Guji, the high priest at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine, explains that this practice honors the kami because [...] "it is in the festival, the matsuri, the greatest celebration of life {{can be seen in the}} world of Shinto and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of the community who attend festivals as groups, as a whole village who are seeking to unlock the human potential as children of kami." [...] During the New Year Festival, families purify and clean their houses in preparation for the upcoming year. Offerings are also made to the ancestors so that they will bless the family in the future year.|$|E
2500|$|For Ryerson, an {{understanding}} of social relations was paramount if one was to garner {{an understanding}} of history; his encounter with Innis's materialism led Ryerson to the charge that equated Marxism and economic determinism. He wrote [...] "Marxism holds that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who make history-their labor and their struggles and their dreams; and that these are understandable and have meaning when seen in their real setting…." [...] He added, [...] "Labor, production, the real relationships of living society: {{this is the point}} of departure for historical materialism….Thought and feelings, ideas and passion and imagination have their being in a material world, are conditioned by it, work upon it." [...] Ryerson's approach to history is that of a man who sees the struggles and ideas of people as the driving force behind history. He did not believe they operate within a vacuum but within a given social system. Ryerson recognised the interplay of freedom and necessity within the development of history [...] "as it is in the best Marxist historical writing." ...|$|E
