5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
25|$|The Coast Guard's task {{over the}} ensuing years {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of war in the Pacific was to supply these isolated way-stations along the transpacific air routes and to relieve the colonists at stated intervals. Taney performed these supply missions into 1940. Meanwhile, tension continued to rise in the Far East as Japan cast covetous <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the American, British, Dutch, and French colonial possessions and marched deeper into embattled China.|$|E
25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E

60|$|Silas Wegg <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the kettle, <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the shelves, <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the French gentleman {{behind the}} door, and shrank {{a little as}} he <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Mr Venus winking his red eyes, and feeling in his {{waistcoat}} pocket--as for a lancet, say--with his unoccupied hand. He and Venus were necessarily seated close together, as each held {{a corner of the}} document, which was but a common sheet of paper.|$|R
60|$|The Marquis <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> a silver-framed {{calendar}} {{which stood}} upon the table. He had <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> it {{about a hundred}} times {{during the last few}} days.|$|R
500|$|The {{game against}} Detroit was {{a battle for}} first place, but the {{suspension}} unsettled the Canadiens. Goaltender Jacques Plante later recalled that the game seemed secondary, and players and officials were [...] "casting worried <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the sullen crowd". Likewise, Dick Irvin said later, [...] "The people didn't care if we got licked 100–1 that night." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Sukanya Verma has {{described}} Kajol as a [...] "contrasting personality". She wrote, [...] "Think Kajol, think emotions. Either {{she is the}} firebrand or the emotional sensitive types. [...] she is pure, wicked fun." [...] Initially termed by journalists as [...] "an impulsive and impetuous brat", Kajol has defied the stereotypical image of a Hindi film heroine in several ways. Journalist Kaveree Bamzai elaborated, [...] "She hardly looks into the mirror, barely even <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the set monitor, usually the crutch of every insecure actor, puts on make-up only under extreme duress, and [...] never watches her old movies." ...|$|E
500|$|In Franklin, Pennsylvania, {{postal worker}} Edward Funsch (William Sanderson) is {{informed}} {{that he will}} be fired {{at the end of the}} week due to budget cuts. Afterwards, Funsch sees the words [...] "Kill 'Em All" [...] on his machine's digital display. At Franklin's civic center, a middle-aged man in a crowded elevator sees [...] "No Air" [...] displayed on the elevator's LED display, and is the only one who can see the message. Sweating and obviously claustrophobic, he again <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the LED display. This time it flashes the words [...] "Can't Breathe" [...] and then [...] "Kill 'Em All." ...|$|E
60|$|Richard <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> that ominous glitter in Crawshay's right hand, <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Brightman, and at {{the giant}} who was {{standing}} barely a yard away, and shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Edwin <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his face, {{uncertain}} whether or no he seriously {{objected to the}} appellation. But Edwin {{might as well have}} <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the face of a clock.|$|R

500|$|In [...] "The Man Who Knew Too Much", Castiel tricks Crowley and Raphael, {{eventually}} {{absorbing the}} souls from Purgatory. He demonstrates his new power by killing Raphael {{with a simple}} snap of his fingers. While talking to Dean, who unsuccessfully begs him {{to give up the}} power, Sam sneaks up behind them and attempts to kill him with an angelic blade by stabbing Castiel in the back, but it has no effect. Castiel removes the blade, explains that he is no longer an angel, declaring himself their new God. He then <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the three hunters before delivering an ultimatum: to profess their own loyalty and love unto him, or be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Critics heavily {{compared}} the storyline {{of the music}} video {{to that of the}} 2005 film, Brokeback Mountain. Birmingham Mails Luke Beardsworth described it as a [...] "lighthearted parody" [...] of the film and according to him the visual depicts Williams and Barlow as young cowboys who are in love secretly. Cragg noted that the video features [...] "the two men gaze lovingly into each other's eyes, strip to the waist and fall in love all over again." [...] Thompson thought that it is [...] "a tongue-in cheek nod" [...] to Brokeback Mountain, and wrote that [...] "they are seen stealing admiring <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> each other" [...] just like actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger in the film. According to The Sun the video likens the love-hate relationship that Williams and Barlow experienced to the film's [...] "tormented" [...] gay cowboys.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the music video, Fernández turns on the car radio where a radio personality woman named Veronica is on air and he immediately gets flashbacks of her. Once he arrives at his house, he turns on the radio where Veronica plays [...] "No Sé Olvidar" [...] on the radio station. Fernández <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the photos of him and Veronica and burns them at the fireplace. He steps outside but still cannot forget the time he spent with her and imagines Veronica next to him. He exercises as another attempt to forget but to no avail. Fernández takes a shower and hallucinates Veronica being next to him and holding him. Fernández begins to lose his mind and breaks the house furniture. He picks up another photo of him and Veronica, lits it on fire, and proceeds to set the house on fire. At the end of the song, Veronica asks Fernández for forgiveness on the radio. [...] "The video ends with a quote in Spanish, translating to [...] "Not even fire can consume the soul...". It received a nomination for Video of the Year at the 10th Annual Lo Nuesro Awards in 1998, but lost to [...] "Ella y Él" [...] by Ricardo Arjona.|$|E

5000|$|Glancing - Glancing {{can show}} a person's true desires. For instance, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> a door might mean that {{someone wants to}} leave. <b>Glancing</b> <b>at</b> {{a glass of water}} might mean that a person is thirsty.|$|R
6000|$|With another <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> me, and a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the door, {{he rubbed}} {{it out and}} turned an [...] "a" [...] in its place (not a capital letter this time), and said, [...] "What's that?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The girls' plan is leave Hanna {{waiting for}} 'Uber A' {{to arrive at}} Lost Woods Resort, while Aria and the boys are out hiding, but when Hanna goes missing they find out that 'Uber A' used a secret passage and kidnapped her. Looking over footage from cameras outside, they all are shocked to see what looks to be Mrs. D, asking {{themselves}} how this is possible. At Alison's house, [...] "Wilden" [...] rips off his mask revealing himself to be Elliott, and Mary Drake, who is revealed to be Jessica's twin, joins him. They succeeded in committing Alison, and with Ali hospitalized, he has her money and the house as her husband, which is their revenge {{for what happened to}} Charlotte, as {{he was in love with}} her and Mary always felt an attachment as her birth mother. She <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> a photograph of Charlotte and says it is what she would've wanted. In the last scene, we see Hanna's unconscious body being dragged by 'Uber A' in the church's bell tower.|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} on the theory, HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer {{stated that}} the conversation is a [...] "legitimate" [...] hint. Also, Butchie DeConcini (the presumed successor of Phil Leotardo) was last seen saddled with reparations following the mob war. He had expressed ideas about killing Tony before ("Kaisha"), and Tony was, in the end, the very last DiMeo man left standing out of the three original Lupertazzi targets, who, Phil believed, if killed, would totally cripple the Jersey family. Hence, Tony {{would have been a}} tempting target of a hit. The final scene showing a man who <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> Tony (credited as [...] "Man in Members Only Jacket") and who later goes to the bathroom, has been interpreted as a nod to the famous scene in The Godfather in which Michael Corleone retrieves a gun from the bathroom before shooting his enemies to death (Tony's favorite scene from the film, as revealed in the episode [...] "Johnny Cakes"). Speculation has also linked the jacket of the man to the title of the opening episode of the season, [...] "Members Only", in which Tony is shot, and also as a symbolic reference to the mysterious man's membership of the Mafia. Actor Matt Servitto said that in the script, the scene continued with the man in the Members Only jacket emerging from the bathroom and starting to walk towards Tony's table. Servitto later clarified this statement, saying that he did not mean to imply that there was a completely different scripted ending, only that the [...] "genius" [...] editing was not what he had expected.|$|E

60|$|MacIan put {{his hand}} to his head and found that his bonnet was not there. Turnbull gave one <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the crucifix--a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> once {{sympathetic}} and bitter, in which was concentrated the whole of Swinburne's poem on the same occasion.|$|R
60|$|Margaret Maxwell <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him sharply, for she fancied that {{he spoke}} with sincerity, as indeed he did; but Dane, having given his promise, {{intended}} to keep it. She also <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> Lilian, and decided that Miss Chatterton was not wholly pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I believe not," [...] he {{said with}} a <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the frock-coat, which was buttoned across his chest and was quite intact; and still he strode on, with a quick <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> every {{threshold}} which did not openly declare a Newfoundland dog.|$|R
