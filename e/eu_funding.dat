40|$|We {{provide an}} {{empirical}} study analysing {{the distribution of}} <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> among 2478 Polish municipalities {{in the period of}} the multiannual financial framework 2007 - 2013. We find <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> to be concentrated in smaller municipalities and economically weak sub-regions. Expenditures of <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> per capita do not decrease in the municipalities' fiscal capacity. This indicates that co-funding restrictions imposed by the EU did not prevent fiscally weak municipalities from attracting <b>EU</b> <b>funds.</b> Our primary focus rests on the question whether regional governments use their prominent role in the allocation process for <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> to support their own political self-interest. Difference-in-difference estimations show that the answer is affirmative: Municipalities aligned with the regional government spend more <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> per capita than nonaligned municipalities. Furthermore, we find support for the swing-district hypothesis: <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> per capita decrease in the vote-share differential between the two leading parties...|$|R

40|$|<b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> {{assistance}} can {{be evaluated}} {{as an important}} contribution to the development of Latvian economics. Successful <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> utilization is one of the pre – requisites {{to the development of the}} country. One of the main steps to effective <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> utilisation is effective project selection and evaluation mechanism. In previous <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> programming period 2004 – 2006 ineffective project appraisal scheme that led to various problems was in force. It consisted of two separate consecutive parts – administrative appraisal and quality and specific appraisal. Analysing this scheme and its operation it can be concluded that it was ineffective and resource taking. Therefore an author developed a new appraisal scheme. The sense of this system is that projects are first of all evaluated according specific criteria – their content, effectiveness and their correspondence to the aims of the programme. After that only those projects best in the project contest are put in order according administrative requirements. This scheme was later approved by Managing authority of <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> in Latvia and introduced in regulations determining the operation of the <b>EU</b> <b>funds</b> in Latvia...|$|R

The universities are tested against up to 30 separate indicators and rated in five performance groups, from 'A' (very good) through 'E' (weak). The {{results show that}} while over 95% of institutions achieve an 'A' score {{on at least one}} measure, only 12% have more than 10 top scores. Of the 850 universities in the ranking, 62% are from Europe, 17% from North America, 14% from Asia and 7% from Oceania, Latin America and Africa. U-Multirank received €2 million in <b>EU</b> <b>funding</b> from the former Lifelong Learning Programme (now Erasmus) for the years 2013-2015, with the possibility of a further two years of funding in 2015-2017.

25|$|High-speed rail is {{emerging}} in Europe as an increasingly popular and efficient means of transport. The first high-speed rail lines in Europe, {{built in the}} 1980s and 1990s, improved travel times on intra-national corridors. Since then, several countries have built extensive high-speed networks, and there are now several cross-border high-speed rail links. Railway operators frequently run international services, and tracks are continuously being built and upgraded to international standards on the emerging European high-speed rail network. In 2007, a consortium of European railway operators, Railteam, emerged to co-ordinate and boost cross-border high-speed rail travel. Developing a Trans-European high-speed rail network is a stated goal of the European Union, and most cross-border railway lines receive <b>EU</b> <b>funding.</b> Several countries — France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia and the United Kingdom — are connected to a cross-border high-speed railway network. More {{are expected to be}} connected in the coming years as Europe invests heavily in tunnels, bridges and other infrastructure and development projects across the continent, many of which are under construction now. Alstom was the first manufacturer to design and deliver a high speed train or HS-Train, which ended up in service with TGV in France. Currently, {{there are a number of}} high-level manufacturers designing and building HSR in Europe, with criss-crossed alliances and partnerships, including Canadian company Bombardier, Alstom itself, the Spanish Talgo and the German Siemens.|$|E

500|$|The State Election Committee {{defined the}} polling stations's {{appearance}} and their immediate surroundings up to [...] away, prohibiting campaigning and displaying of promotional materials there as with elections in Croatia. Unlike Croatian elections, {{there is no}} mandatory halt to campaigning before a referendum. GONG appointed approximately 300 observers to monitor the referendum voting. The Election Committee {{announced that it would}} start publishing voting results on its web site two hours after the polling stations in Croatia closed, and it would expect to determine the referendum's outcome by midnight. If a proposed question was supported by a simple majority of those voting, the proposal would be considered passed and the result binding on the Croatian Parliament pursuant to §87, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Croatian Constitution. Since the referendum passed, the Croatian Parliament was required to ratify the Croatian EU accession treaty. Amendments (from 2010) to the constitution provide that referendums are valid regardless of actual turnout. If the referendum proposal were to have failed, it could have been repeated in six months or a year. It is estimated that a referendum rejection would have cost Croatia approximately €1.6billion in lost <b>EU</b> <b>funding</b> until 2014.|$|E
