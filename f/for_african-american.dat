5|$|Born in Mayesville, South Carolina, {{to parents}} who had been slaves, she started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early {{interest}} in becoming educated; {{with the help of}} benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a missionary in Africa. She started a school <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> girls in Daytona Beach, Florida. It later merged with a private institute <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> boys, and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained high standards and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947. She {{was one of the few}} women in the world to serve as a college president at that time.|$|E
5|$|Green {{entered the}} School of Business as an {{economics}} major, {{and planned to}} become a certified public accountant, until an adviser told him {{that there were no}} jobs available <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> accountants in Philadelphia. Green decided to pursue a career in law, something his father had dreamed of doing himself.|$|E
5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people. This is also the case <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
30|$|By contrast, Mexicans’ {{presence}} in an occupation {{according to the}} IV estimate coincides with depressing wages <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans</b> who are high school graduates (in intermediate-skill-range occupations) and corresponds with increased wages <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans</b> with college education (in high-skill-range occupations).|$|R
25|$|Little Rock {{previously}} had a Catholic high school <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans,</b> St. Bartholomew High School; it closed in 1964. The Catholic grade school St. Bartholomew School, also established <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans,</b> closed in 1974. The Our Lady of Good Counsel School closed in 2006.|$|R
30|$|<b>For</b> <b>African-Americans</b> in “Hispanic occupations”, a 1 {{percentage}} point {{increase in the}} share of Mexican immigrants in the PUMA {{is associated with a}} decrease in wages of 2.1  %. By contrast, <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans</b> in integrated, non-Hispanic-dominated occupations, a 1 {{percentage point}} increase in the share of Mexican immigrants in the PUMA corresponds to a stronger decrease in wages of 3.8  %. Similarly, <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans</b> in “Hispanic occupations”, a 1 percentage point increase in the density of Hispanic immigrants in those occupations corresponds to a decrease in wages <b>for</b> <b>African-Americans</b> of 2.9  %. <b>For</b> <b>African-Americans</b> in more integrated occupations, a 1 percentage point increase in the density of Hispanic immigrants in those occupations is associated with an 8.2  % decrease in wages. These results suggest that, contrary to what intuition might dictate, there is stronger pressure on wages of African-Americans in the more integrated occupations than there is in occupations with a strong Hispanic immigrant niche. In other words, African-Americans compete, to a lesser degree, in “Hispanic occupations” with strong market segmentation, while the more relevant “competition” between African-Americans and Hispanic immigrants may be in more integrated, possibly semi-skilled occupations, such as production and transportation, or even more-skilled professional occupations.|$|R
5|$|Du Bois {{was married}} twice, first to Nina Gomer (m. 1896, d. 1950), {{with whom he}} had two children, a son Burghardt (who died as an infant) and a {{daughter}} Yolande, who married Countee Cullen. As a widower, he married Shirley Graham (m. 1951, d. 1977), an author, playwright, composer and activist. She brought her son David Graham to the marriage. David grew close to Du Bois and took his stepfather's name; he also worked <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> causes. The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that Du Bois engaged in several extramarital relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{sorority}} {{was founded}} on January 15, 1908, at the historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C., {{by a group of}} sixteen students led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle. Forming a sorority broke barriers <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> women in areas where they had little power or authority, {{due to a lack of}} opportunities for minorities and women in the early 20th century. Alpha Kappa Alpha was incorporated on January 29, 1913.|$|E
5|$|The Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E

5|$|Thurman {{played an}} active role in {{establishing}} international student organizations to help prevent foreign students feeling isolated while studying abroad. She organized one of the first international scholarship programs <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> women. She studied racism and the effects of prejudice on various people throughout the world, making two round-the-world trips in her lifetime. She wrote books and newspaper articles to preserve black heritage, and initiated the publishing efforts of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) by founding the Aframerican Women’s Journal. In addition to writing the second ever history of black Californians, in 1958 Thurman published a cookbook laced with historical information about black professional women at a time when African Americans had few civil rights. Recognizing that there was little academic interest in black women's history at the time, Thurman used the marketing ploy of food to report on the lives of black women who were not domestics. She participated in international peace and feminist conferences, and in 1945 attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. Thurman also established museums such as the Museum of Afro-American History in Boston in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The AFT {{was one of}} {{the first}} trade unions to allow African-Americans and {{minorities}} to become full members of their trade union. In 1918, the AFT called for equal pay <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> teachers, the election of African Americans to local school boards and compulsory school attendance <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> children. In 1919, the AFT called for equal educational opportunities <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> children, and in 1928 called for the social, political, economic, and cultural contributions of African Americans to be taught in the public schools.|$|E
25|$|The Kaplan Day Star Guide to Colleges <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> Students named Elon one of {{the hundred}} best schools in the US <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> students.

25|$|In 1898, Clifford won a {{landmark}} {{civil rights and}} education case before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. In Williams v. Board of Education, Clifford argued against the Tucker County Board of Education's decision to shorten the school year <b>for</b> <b>African-American</b> school children from nine months to five months, keeping a full term for white students. Mrs. Carrie Williams, the colored school's teacher, approached Clifford. He encouraged her to continue teaching for the full nine months, regardless of funding. Clifford then {{filed a lawsuit against}} the school board for Williams' back pay. Clifford won the case at a jury trial, and then won again before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.
