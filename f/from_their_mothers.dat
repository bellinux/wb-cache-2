5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they {{do not seem to}} have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> between four and six months of age.|$|E

5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E
5|$|Members are {{assigned}} {{positions in the}} order of precedence, coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> or wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when the office was held by a layman who was not necessarily a member of the Order, this precedence has been purely theoretical. As a member of the Order, the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached to the office, and when the office was filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England, the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

25|$|Calf-weaning nose rings or nosebands {{provide an}} {{alternative}} to separating calves <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> during the weaning period.

Species which exhibit this behavior often have significantly flattened and expanded abdomens.|$|E

5000|$|Djungarian hamsters {{reproduce}} at {{a faster}} rate than Syrian hamsters. Phodopus are able to become pregnant again {{on the same day that}} they have given birth. This can all happen within a thirty-six-day period. This is done as a survival strategy to produce large numbers of offspring in a short period of time. This places tremendous demands on the mother. Research suggests biparental care in Campbell's hamsters (Phodopus campbelli) but not in Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). [...] Frequent fighting can occur between the pups and as soon as they are weaned <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> they are separated <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother.</b> They should not be separated <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> before three weeks of age. Most Djungarian hamster dwarf hamsters grow to 3 to 4" [...] long. Djungarian hamsters breed all year round as there is no specific breeding season.|$|R
25|$|By 1860 Maryland's free black {{population}} comprised 49.1% {{of the total}} number of African Americans in the state. The vast majority of blacks in Baltimore were free, and it had the largest {{black population}} of any southern city. As in Virginia and Delaware, many planters in Maryland had freed their slaves in the years following the Revolutionary War. In addition, families of free people of color had been formed during colonial times from unions between white women and African men. As children took their status <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> these mixed-race children were born free.|$|E
25|$|In a mouse FOXP2 {{knockout}} study, loss of both {{copies of}} the gene caused severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of ultrasonic vocalisations normally elicited when pups are removed <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> These vocalizations have important communicative roles in mother-offspring interactions. Loss of one copy was associated with impairment of ultrasonic vocalisations and a modest developmental delay. Male mice on encountering female mice produce complex ultrasonic vocalisations that have characteristics of song. Mice that have the R552H point mutation carried by the KE family show cerebellar reduction and abnormal synaptic plasticity in striatal and cerebellar circuits.|$|E

He found that the child showed separation distress in both situations but, when reunited, children were significantly more attached to their mothers than to the metapelet. The children protested subsequent separation <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> when the metapelet was reintroduced to them. However, kibbutzim children shared high bonding with their parents as {{compared to those who}} were sent to boarding schools, because children in a kibbutz spent three to four hours with their parents every day.|$|E

25|$|The main {{difference}} between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them {{on the premise that}} their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.|$|E
25|$|Numerous 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century {{contemporaneous}} documents {{indicate that the}} policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> related to an assumption that the Aborigines were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact (population shrank from 1,250,000 in 1788 to 50,000 in 1930), whites assumed that the full-blood tribal Aboriginal population {{would be unable to}} sustain itself, and was doomed to extinction. The idea expressed by A. O. Neville, the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.|$|E
