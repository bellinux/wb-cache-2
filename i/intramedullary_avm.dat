40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} rare {{situation}} in which a lipo-myelomeningocele and an intramedullary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) occurred together at the T 11 –L 1 level in a 44 -year-old man. MR images showed a hyper-vascular lesion intradurally and a fatty component ex-tradurally. Spinal angiography revealed this lesion to be an <b>intramedullary</b> <b>AVM</b> with multiple feeding arteries from the right T 12 and left T 10 intercostal artery and the left L 1 lumbar artery, drained by tortuous, dilated, per-imedullary veins. Among the arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the spinal cord, an intramedullary mal-formation with the nidus of the fistula in the cord parenchyma is uncommon. Intramedullary AVMs are congenital abnormalities, and patients are gen...|$|E
40|$|Object: Radiosurgery for spinal AVM’s is {{becoming}} a practical therapeutic option as methodology improves, but no comparative study has yet been published of focal fractionated radiotherapy. We report here our experience with conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy for spinal AVM. Methods: Candidates {{for this study were}} patients who had symptoms due to an <b>intramedullary</b> <b>AVM</b> but were ineligible for embolization or surgery. Of 21 patients with spinal AVMs, there were 10 such cases in the past 10 years. Angiography and enhanced computed tomography (CT) were used for treatment planning in all cases. Fractionated radiotherapy with a linear accelerator, extra-cranial immobilization system and frequent orthogonal linacographic verification were used. The starting dose was 32 Gy in 2, 36 Gy in 3, 40 Gy in 2 patients, using a regime of 1. 8 - 2. 0 Gy daily which was recently changed t...|$|E
40|$|Object. Radiosurgical {{treatment}} of spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) {{is becoming a}} practical therapeutic option as methodology improves, but no comparative study has yet been published on focal fractionated radiotherapy. The authors report their experience with conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy for spinal AVM. Methods. Candidates {{for this study were}} patients who experienced symptoms due to an <b>intramedullary</b> <b>AVM</b> but were ineligible for embolization or surgery. Of 21 patients with spinal AVMs, 10 cases in a 10 -year period met this criterion. Angiography and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scanning were used for treatment planning in all cases. Fractionated radiotherapy was performed using a linear accelerator, extracranial immobilization system, and frequent orthogonal linacographic verification. The starting radiation dose was 32 Gy in two, 36 Gy in three, and 40 Gy in two patients, in a regimen involving 1. 8 to 2 –Gy daily fractions; this was recently changed to a hypofractionation schedule of 30 Gy (in eight sessions) in one and 20 Gy (in four sessions) in two patients. Results. The follow-up period ranged from 26 to 124 months (median of 49 months). There were no hemorrhages nor any adverse reactions attributable to irradiation. Of the seven patients who consented to undergo follow-up angiography, the nidus size decreased in five, but complete obliteration did not occur in any patient. Conclusions. Because no patient experienced adverse effects, the maximum tolerable radiation dose for the spinal cord associated with an AVM could not be identified, although it presumably is higher than those administered. The lack of rebleeding in patients in whom complete angiographic occlusion was absent suggests that the natural history of spinal AVMs may be less aggressive than previously reported...|$|E
40|$|During a 3 year period, 21 {{patients}} with spinal cord vascular malformations involving the {{anterior spinal artery}} were treated by embol ization through this artery. Of four cases of extramed-ullary arteriovenous fistula, two patients embolized {{at an early stage}} showed excellent results, whereas results were mediocre in two patients who were paraplegic at embolization. Of 17 cases of <b>intramedullary</b> arteriovenous malformation (<b>AVM),</b> nine pa-tients showed clinical improvement either with or without radio-logic evidence of residual malformation; three patients had com-plications that led to clinical worsening; in the other five patients, results were mixed or inconclusive. Angiomyelotomography is recommended to diagnose extramedullary arteriovenous fistulae involving the anterior spinal artery. Pretherapeutic evaluation of <b>intramedullary</b> <b>AVMs</b> must consider the spinal cord level at which the malformation occurs. Angiotomography and temporary oc-clusion tests permit identification of collateral anastomoses be-fore embolization. Respective criteria for surgery and emboliza-tion are defined. In cases where embolization is indicated, short-term results can generally be predicted. Spinal cord vascular malformations fed by the anterior spinal artery are of two types: extramedu llary arteriovenous fistulae with anterior spinal artery part ic ipat ion. which are usually located around the conus terminalis and comprise a direct shunt between the anterior spinal artery and the medullary vein; and <b>intramedullary</b> arteriovenous malformations (<b>AVMs),</b> which are usually multipe-diculated but always involve the anterior spinal artery. Embolization via the anterior spinal artery has always been regarded as a dan-gerous procedure because serious neurologic defic its result from its occ lusion. However. recent advances in neuroradiologic tech-nology have allowed us to embolize 21 cases of spinal cord AVM through this artery. Among the new techniques, ang iotomography and angiomyelography playa major role in mapping these malfor-mation s in order to identify and minimize potential risks in treatment. Innovations involving the use of coaxial catheters and temporary occlusion and detachable balloons have also helped to make em-boliza tion a sa fer procedure [1]...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} a cervical congenital paraspinal ar-teriovenous malformation (AVM) drained by paraspinal and epidural ectatic veins, which caused massive {{erosion of the}} C 6 and C 7 vertebral bodies, threatening the cervical stability and necessitating treatment. During the first ses-sion, six arterial embolizations were performed {{to reduce the size}} and the flow of the AVM. Two months later, a venous approach was used to occlude the remnant venous exit of the AVM and achieve a complete cure. All embolizations were performed using N-butylcyanoacrylate. Spinal vascular malformations can be classified {{on the basis of their}} location and angioarchitecture (1, 2) : <b>intramedullary</b> arteriovenous malformations (<b>AVMs),</b> intradural AVFs, dural AVFs, epidural AVFs and AVMs, paravertebral AVFs and AVMs, intraosseous vertebral AVMs, and Cobb syndrome. Paravertebral malformations are rare, but the cer-vical location is reported to be the most common (3). In most of the cases, paravertebral malforma-tions are congenital (3). We report a congenital cer-vical paravertebral AVM consisting of several AVFs associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome of the left arm. The lesion drained into multiple ectatic veins, some of which were inside the spinal canal, causing C 5 and C 6 vertebral body erosion and shifting of the spinal cord. Case Report In 1997, a 48 -year-old woman with a congenital Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome of the left arm with cutaneous and sub-cutaneous angiodysplasia of the left hemithorax associated with a paravertebral cervical AVM was referred to our insti-tution. The appearance was in keeping with a metameric vas-cular malformation. No neurologic deficit was ever noted. the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was diagnosed at birth. The par-aspinal AVM was angiographically documented in 1990 after a thrill was palpated in the neck. Treatment was not proposed to the patient at that time. In December 1996, plain X-rays of the cervical spine showed progressive erosion of C 6 and C...|$|R
