40|$|PURPOSE: To {{document}} contact lens prescribing {{trends in}} the United Kingdom {{over the past decade}} (between 1996 and 2005). METHODS: An annual survey of contact lens prescribing trends was conducted each year by asking a random selection of optometrists and dispensing opticians to provide information relating to 10 consecutive contact lens fits between January and March. RESULTS: Over the 10 -year survey period, 1251 practitioners returned survey forms representing a total of 12, 050 contact lens fits. The mean (+/-standard deviation) age of lens wearers was 33 +/- 13 years of which 64 % were female. Over the survey period, rigid lens new fits decreased from 22 % to 4 %. Low water content lenses reduced from 20 % to 2 % of new soft lens fits. Soft toric lenses gradually increased {{to the point where they}} accounted for the expected proportion of patients with astigmatism>or= 1. 00 DC (i. e. > 20 % of soft lens fits). Monthly and daily disposable lenses accounted for > 90 % of all soft lens fits between 2003 and 2005. The proportion of new soft <b>fits</b> <b>and</b> <b>refits</b> prescribed as extended wear has gradually increased, stabilizing at about 5 % of new fits and 12 % of refits. Multi-purpose lens care solutions increased from 60 % of all care systems in 1997 to 91 % in 2005. Rigid lenses and monthly replacement soft lenses are predominantly worn on a full time basis, whereas daily disposable soft lenses are mainly worn part time. CONCLUSIONS: This survey indicates that technological advancements such as the development of new lens materials, manufacturing methods and lens designs have had a significant impact on the contact lens market over a relatively short period of time...|$|E
60|$|He consoled {{himself by}} {{playing for a}} while on a cheap flageolet, {{which was one of}} his diversions, and to which I owed many {{intervals}} of peace. When he first produced it, in the joints, from his pocket, he had the duplicity to ask me if I played upon it. I answered, no; and he put the instrument away with a sigh and the remark that he had thought I might. For some while he resisted the unspeakable temptation, his fingers visibly itching and twittering about his pocket, even his interest in the landscape and in sporadic anecdote entirely lost. Presently the pipe was in his hands again; he <b>fitted,</b> unfitted, <b>refitted,</b> <b>and</b> played upon it in dumb show for some time.|$|R

40|$|Background/AimsThe {{modification}} of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system (<b>Refit</b> MELD) <b>and</b> the {{modification of}} MELD-Na (Refit MELDNa), which optimized the MELD coefficients, were published in 2011. We aimed to validate {{the superiority of the}} Refit MELDNa over the Refit MELD for the prediction of 3 -month mortality in Korean patients with cirrhosis and ascites. MethodsWe reviewed the medical records of patients admitted with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites to the Konkuk University Hospital between January 2006 and December 2011. The <b>Refit</b> MELD <b>and</b> <b>Refit</b> MELDNa were compared using the predictive value of the 3 -month mortality, as assessed by the Child-Pugh score. ResultsIn total, 530 patients were enrolled, 87 of whom died within 3 months. Alcohol was the most common etiology of their cirrhosis (n= 271, 51. 1 %), and {{the most common cause of}} death was variceal bleeding (n= 20, 23 %). The areas under the receiver operating curve (AUROCs) for the Child-Pugh, <b>Refit</b> MELD, <b>and</b> <b>Refit</b> MELDNa scores were 0. 754, 0. 791, and 0. 764 respectively; the corresponding values when the analysis was performed only in patients with persistent ascites (n= 115) were 0. 725, 0. 804, and 0. 796, respectively. The significant difference found among the Child-Pugh, <b>Refit</b> MELD, <b>and</b> <b>Refit</b> MELDNa scores was between the Child-Pugh score <b>and</b> <b>Refit</b> MELD in patients with persistent ascites (P= 0. 039). ConclusionsRefit MELD <b>and</b> <b>Refit</b> MELDNa exhibited good predictability for 3 -month mortality in patients with cirrhosis <b>and</b> ascites. However, <b>Refit</b> MELDNa was not found to be a better predictor than Refit MELD, despite the known relationship between hyponatremia and mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites...|$|R
