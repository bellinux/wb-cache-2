40|$|Integration of side inlet and/or <b>side</b> <b>outlet</b> {{expansion}} chambers {{into the}} rest of the muffler system for prediction of overall transmission loss (TL) or insertion loss requires knowledge of the four-pole parameters of these elements for propagation of plane waves in a moving medium.

These are validated against the 3 -D model existing in the literature for a stationary medium and for acoustically long chambers.

In order to {{race in the}} Sports Car Club of America's Trans American Sedan Championship Trans Am, Dodge built a street version of its race car (just like Plymouth with its Plymouth 'Cuda AAR) which it called the Dodge Challenger T/A (Trans Am). Although the race cars ran a destroked version of the 340, street versions took the 340 and added a trio of two-barrel carburetors atop an aluminum intake manifold, creating the 340 Six Pack. Dodge rated the 340 Six Pack at , only [...] more than the original 340 engine (which also had the same rating as the Camaro Z/28 and Ford Boss 302 Mustang).

Low-restriction dual exhaust ran to the stock muffler location, then reversed direction to exit in chrome tipped [...] "megaphone" [...] outlets {{in front of the}} rear wheels. Options included a TorqueFlite automatic or pistol-grip Hurst-shifted four-speed transmission, 3.55:1 or 3.90:1 gears, as well as manual or power steering. Front disc brakes were standard. The special Rallye suspension used heavy duty parts and increased the rate of the rear springs. The T/A {{was one of the first}} U.S. muscle car to fit different size tires front and rear: E60x15 Goodyear Polyglas in the front, and G60x15 on the rear axle. The modified chamber elevated the tail enough to clear the rear tires and its <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets.</b> Thick dual <b>side</b> stripes, bold ID graphics, a fiberglass ducktail rear spoiler, and a fiberglass front spoiler were also included.

40|$|Abstract This study {{presents}} a prediction method for heat transfer {{performance of a}} gas cooler of CO 2 heat pump using -NTU method, and compared the results with the experimental data from the open literature. The heat transfer rate, refrigerant <b>side</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature and water <b>side</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature were calculated by using EES(Engineering Equation Solver) program in multi-tube-in-tube type CO 2 heat pump gas cooler. Analysis was performed in two methods: The first method performed without dividing into the test section by applying {{an analysis of the}} mean properties(mean analysis). The second method, tube length divided into 50 sections, was applied to the local properties(local analysis).

50|$|Before {{the exhaust}} phase is quite complete, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>side</b> of the valve closes, {{shutting}} {{a portion of}} the exhaust steam inside the cylinder.

50|$|Atlas is a {{name for}} a family of modern inline piston engines for trucks from General Motors, used in the GMT 355 and GMT360 platforms. The series debuted in 2002 with the Oldsmobile Bravada, and is also used in the Buick Rainier, the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and Colorado, the GMC Envoy and Canyon, the Hummer H3, Isuzu Ascender and i-370, and the Saab 9-7X. The engines use GM's Vortec name, and I4, I5, and I6 engines {{are all part of the}} same family, sharing the same {{manufacturing}} equipment, rods, pistons, valves, and other parts. They feature variable valve timing on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>side,</b> electronic throttle control, and a special oil pan with a pass-through for the half shafts in four-wheel drive vehicles. The inclusion of VVT on the <b>exhaust</b> camshaft <b>side</b> allows the Atlas series to meet emissions standards without the use of EGR, simplifying the engine design and increasing power for a broad power curve. The LL8 shares 75% of its components with the LK5 and L52; while the LK5 and L52 share 89% of their components.|$|R
40|$|This study numerically {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of a sickbed with a semiopened hood on bacteria removal in a negative-pressure isolation room. The parameters include air change rate, lying style, the length and height of hood, flow rate allotments, and the positions of outlets. The results show that the hood has excellent effect on the removal of contaminated air, which is much better than the case without hood. The flow field of patient's face up cough is very different from face side cough, and the contaminated air cannot be removed properly through one air outlet. There are three outlets on the hood, set straight above the patient's face and at both sides. The allotment of the exhaust flow rate of the upper outlet to that of <b>side</b> <b>outlets</b> is suggested to be 4 : 6. When the total air change rate is above 6 ACH, the hood length has slight influence on pollutant removal. The increase of hood height has a negative impact when the patient coughs lying on back. When the <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> flow rate is high, the hood height has a slight impact for face side cough.

50|$|As {{popularity}} and marketing {{value of the}} VTEC system grew, Honda applied the system to SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off was that Honda's SOHC engines benefitted from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center rocker arm and cam lobe (for each intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>side),</b> and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust rocker arms, leaving no room for the VTEC rocker arm. Additionally, the center lobe on the camshaft cannot be utilized by both the intake and the exhaust, limiting the VTEC feature to one side.|$|R
50|$|In a {{momentum}} transfer pump, gas molecules are accelerated from the vacuum <b>side</b> to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>side</b> (which is usually maintained at a reduced pressure by a positive displacement pump). Momentum transfer pumping is only possible below pressures of about 0.1 kPa. Matter flows differently at different pressures {{based on the}} laws of fluid dynamics. At atmospheric pressure and mild vacuums, molecules {{interact with each other}} and push on their neighboring molecules in what is known as viscous flow. When the distance between the molecules increases, the molecules interact with the walls of the chamber more often than with the other molecules, and molecular pumping becomes more effective than positive displacement pumping. This regime is generally called high vacuum.|$|R
