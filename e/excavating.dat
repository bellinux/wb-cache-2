5|$|While {{preparing}} to dig her nest, the female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior. She presses her throat {{against the ground}} of different potential sites, perhaps sensing moisture, warmth, texture, or smell, although her exact motivation is unknown. She may further temporize by <b>excavating</b> several false nests as the wood turtles also do.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} – The Classics Department sponsors an excavation at Castel Viscardo, a city near Orvieto in Italy. Faculty {{and students}} from the college are <b>excavating</b> a site that was occupied from the early Etruscan to the late Roman periods. The excavation have yielded many historical and archaeological finds; Saint Anselm College sends over 25 students each summer to the Coriglia excavation, just outside town.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been <b>excavating</b> at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While <b>excavating</b> at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E
50|$|<b>Excavate</b> {{relationships}} are still uncertain; {{it is possible}} that they are not a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the <b>excavates</b> is far from clear, although it seems like there are several clades within the <b>excavates</b> which are monophyletic.|$|R

3000|$|The second {{data set}} {{consists}} of the production data and their related actual sensor measurements. The material travelling time from each production location (excavator & bench location) to RGI location is calculated. In {{order to determine the}} location of the received RGI measurement data, in other words: “to track back where the measured material comes from”, the production data is linked with the RGI data based on the given timecodes (material travel delays are taken into account). The second input file for the algorithm is written to a file containing the following information: timecode, actual sensor measurement (RGI data), <b>excavated</b> block 1 id, <b>excavated</b> block 1 mass, <b>excavated</b> block 2 id, <b>excavated</b> block 2 mass,…, <b>excavated</b> block n [...] id, the <b>excavated</b> n [...] block mass; where b = 1, [...]...,n is the <b>excavated</b> block number in the given time span.|$|R
5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, <b>excavating</b> shallow or deep burrows. Some make {{galleries}} in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published {{through his own}} British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London <b>excavating</b> in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.|$|E
5|$|In late 1996, Keeran ranch workers {{exploring}} {{with metal}} detectors located eight cast-iron cannons buried near Garcitas Creek. After <b>excavating</b> the cannons, the Texas Historical Commission (THC) confirmed {{they were from}} Fort Saint Louis. In 2000 a THC excavation discovered the locations {{of three of the}} buildings that had housed the French colony and the three graves dug by the Spanish.|$|E
5000|$|Cutting II-IV were <b>excavated</b> in 1990; while Cutting I {{had been}} <b>excavated</b> in {{arbitrary}} splits; Cuttings II-IV were <b>excavated</b> in true stratigraphic units.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the groups mentioned in the table above, the genus Malawimonas is {{generally considered to be}} a member of Excavata owing to its typical <b>excavate</b> morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to <b>excavate</b> groups in some molecular phylogenies. However, its position among <b>excavates</b> remains elusive.|$|R

5|$|Jorge F. Guillemín {{cleared the}} ruins in 1956, mapped the {{surviving}} structures, {{as well as}} mapping the central K'iche' region and Q'umarkaj's satellite sites. The State University of New York at Albany spent three seasons <b>excavating</b> the ruins in the early 1970s. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston started major excavations at Q'umarkaj in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of Ypresiomyrma queens collected {{suggests that these}} ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for <b>excavating</b> chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation; their large size and common occurrence in their geographical range would mean they were an important food source {{to a variety of}} birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} weir and {{sluice gate}} servicing the paper mill was built about 1852. The tunnel excavated {{from the third}} chamber to the ninth chamber and then out to daylight was dug in 1974–1975 by ex-coal miners from the Radstock area. The show cave was further extended in 2015 by <b>excavating</b> a tunnel from the ninth chamber to the 20th chamber.|$|E

5|$|The first {{ruler of}} the dynasty, Setnakhte, {{actually}} had two tombs constructed for himself. He started <b>excavating</b> the eventual tomb of his son, Ramesses III, but broke into another tomb and abandoned {{it in order to}} usurp and complete the tomb of the Nineteenth Dynasty female pharaoh, Twosret. Therefore, this tomb has two burial chambers, the later extensions making the tomb one of the largest of the Royal tombs, at over 150 metres.|$|E
5|$|Workers began <b>excavating</b> the {{foundations}} of the United States Capitol in July 1793. During construction of the foundation, building commissioner David Stuart wrote to other members of the capitol commission suggesting a cornerstone ceremony be held. At their September 2 meeting, the commission agreed with Stuart, setting a date for the ceremony {{a little more than two}} weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while <b>excavating</b> a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but thought they belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E

50|$|Of the {{approximately}} 150 square meters of “living area” inside the cave, {{about a fifth}} has been <b>excavated,</b> and only half of that area has been <b>excavated</b> {{all the way down}} to bedrock. This was primarily due to constraints on time and resources, which stopped excavation from being extended to promising areas or even bringing the whole of the <b>excavated</b> area down to bedrock; instead, efforts were focused on obtaining a large sample of artifacts and floral and faunal remains from the area already <b>excavated.</b>|$|R
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires <b>excavating</b> the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact <b>excavating</b> material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 17th century coal was largely {{obtained}} by <b>excavating</b> the outcrops and driving drifts which followed the seam into the ground. Only {{small amounts of}} coal could be obtained by these methods and bell pits were also dug. These were vertical pits, with a 4feet (1.2m) diameter shaft up to 60feet (18.3m) deep, which were opened out at the bottom. When all the coal that could safely be extracted from the pit had been recovered, another pit was sunk close by to intersect the seam and the waste from the second pit thrown into the first.|$|E
50|$|In 1800 the Valentine Museum of Richmond, Virginia first <b>excavated</b> Garden Creek. George Gustav Heye also <b>excavated</b> {{the site}} from 1915 to 1919.

5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists <b>excavating</b> the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt <b>excavating</b> a dried-up lagoon {{known as}} Mersa Gawasis have {{unearthed}} traces {{of an ancient}} harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles. And in 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what {{is believed to be}} the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King Cheops on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of Suez).|$|E
5|$|Inseminoid (titled Horror Planet in the United States) is a 1981 British-Hong Kong science-fiction {{exploitation}} horror film. Director Norman J.
