His grave is located about [...] {{from the grave}} of Babe Ruth in Section 25. The {{following}} epitaph, said by Martin himself at his number retiring ceremony at Yankee Stadium in 1986, appears on the headstone: <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been the greatest Yankee {{to put on the}} uniform, but I was the proudest.

There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the solution, but at least I can hear and understand." ...|$|E
