50|$|<b>Eurogas</b> is an {{association}} representing the European gas wholesale, retail and distribution sectors towards the EU institutions. The association aims {{to strengthen the}} role of gas in the energy mix by establishing an ongoing dialogue with European industry players, global gas producers and relevant institutions. <b>Eurogas</b> was founded in 1990, with its members currently including 44 companies and associations from 22 countries.|$|E

After {{just one}} week {{following}} his appointment to the cabinet, {{he was forced to}} resign because he had {{become a member of the}} supervisory board of US-based <b>Eurogas</b> in 1994 without applying for approval as required by German law.|$|E
50|$|Gertjan Lankhorst (born 22 December 1957 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch {{business}} {{executive and}} the current CEO of GasTerra. He was appointed CEO in September 2006. Prior to that appointment, he served successively as the Dutch Minister of Oil & Gas, Competition, and finally Energy within the Ministry of Economic Affairs (Netherlands). He graduated from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and currently chairs the university's board; he also serves as President of the Royal Dutch Gas Association and <b>Eurogas.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 2001 to 2007, Llardén was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sedigas, an {{association}} comprising companies {{related to the}} gas sector in Spain. During this period, {{he was also a}} member of the Board of Directors of <b>Eurogas</b> and the Executive Committee of the International Gas Union (IGU). In this context, he was a member of Policy Advisory Network of International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and was part of its Commission on Environment and Energy. In addition, he was a member of High Level Group on the South West Regional Energy Market of the European Commission.|$|E
40|$|The Dutch {{energy system}} is greatly {{dependent}} on natural gas. In 2013 the {{primary energy consumption}} in the Netherlands was for 43 % supplied with natural gas (CBS, 2015 a). With this proportion of natural gas the Netherlands has the highest share in national primary energy consumption of Europe (<b>Eurogas,</b> 2014). The reason for this large share of natural gas is the Dutch national gas production. The Netherlands has been a large gas producer, consumer and exporter since the find of the large onshore field in Groningen province. The natural gas production in the Netherlands is decreasing currently. Several {{studies have shown that}} natural gas production will be at such a level that the Netherlands will become a net importer around 2025 (IEA, 2012; ECN, 2014). These estimates are without inclusion of the recent decisions to limit production from the Groningen field. The integral role of natural gas is very important; many energy processes in the Dutch economy run on natural gas. When Dutch gas production decreases, the downstream part of the natural gas-value chain in the Netherlands might be affected. To prevent structural import dependency on one supplier, such as Russia or Norway, the Netherlands can diversify gas supply with LNG imports and biogas production. Another method to be less dependent on import is to find alternatives in the energy portfolio to satisfy Dutch energy demand. Clustered industrial sectors, such as the Rotterdam area, will also be affected when domestic gas supply will be reduced. The question is how dependent the Rotterdam industrial cluster is on natural gas. The Dutch industrial dependency on gas will be the focus of this master thesis, as presented in the main research question: “What influence has the reduction of gas production in the Netherlands on the energy sourcing of the Rotterdam industrial cluster?”SEPAMEnergy and IndustryTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E
40|$|The European gas {{transport}} market {{is one of}} the most dynamic due to emerging new markets, liberalization changes in the new energy business and therefore ever changing regulations. With their integrated IT solution; Energy Components (EC), TietoEnator (TE) tries to fulfill its global strategy 1 and seeks growth in the gas transport business. This research gained insight in the business opportunities of the Energy Components Transport module (ECTS) in the onshore gas {{transport market}} in Europe. Insight is given through the research of elements in the conceptual model. The goal of this model is to make a fit between the IT solution demands from a market point of view and the IT solution features of ECTS on corresponding dimensions: functionality, costs, continuity, flexibility and knowledge & expertise. Research findings show the following results: • The trend towards an oligopolistic supplying market, LNG imports and spot market trade are the most important influencers on the customers IT demands. • Market liberalization, regulation issues and governments interest stress the importance of future functionality and flexibility in ECTS and in knowledge & expertise of TE. • The Common Business Practices of EASEE-gas institute will influences the flexibility issues inside ECTS. • Currently offered services of gas transport companies in Europe mainly affect the solution features in the functionality and flexibility dimension of ECTS. • TietoEnator must always consider the whole gas value chain when adapting the integrated solution and not only parts of it. • Five dominant solution features have been found: allocation, user configuration, experience in related projects, information services and contracting. • Value is offered through solution features which are affected by the functionality of gas transport services. • Added value is offered mainly through the user configuration and extensive knowledge & expertise of TE into the gas transport business processes. This research concludes the following business opportunities: • The attention and reaction on influences related to the dominant solution features will determine business advantage over competitors, time to market (TTM) and first mover advantages. • Research results on LNG development, spot market trade, implementation of EASEE-gas CBP’s, Government interest, future regulations and the market liberalization progress define the most important business opportunities for an integrated total IT solution like ECTS. • With an active role in gas business panels (e. g. EASEE-gas, <b>Eurogas)</b> and strategic sales projects with important gas transport companies 2 TE can strengthen their influence on the gas business process of gas transport companies and cooperate in defining the gas business. TE should focus internally on the dominant solution features and externally focus on the most important market influencers. Both these processes can be integrated by means of the active participation and strategic sales processes in the onshore European gas transport market. Recommendations for further research focus upon quality research of the dominant solution features identified in this research. Also more research is needed into the company- market relationship which is a prerequisite for the business opportunities. Finally tendencies of downward integration of midstream companies, groupings of energy affairs and the migration of companies in the energy field and security issues will have great influence on the business opportunities in the onshore European gas transport market. ...|$|E
