5|$|Viktor Pugachyov, {{piloting}} {{the second}} Su-27K, {{became the first}} Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It {{was found that the}} carrier's jet blast deflectors were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced <b>engine</b> <b>throttle,</b> accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.|$|E

25|$|Most modern road use {{diesel engines}} are {{provided}} with an FRP valve in the intake manifold (usually mistaken {{by some as a}} petrol <b>engine</b> <b>throttle</b> body). In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent advances}} in ion propulsion system design which promise to increase the propulsion system reliability by reducing the overall system complexity. The greatest simplification in the overall propulsion system operation is accomplished through {{a change in the}} ion <b>engine</b> <b>throttling</b> strategy. By using three grid optics it is possible to effect <b>engine</b> <b>throttling</b> at a constant beam curent over at least a 3. 8 to 1 variation in input power. Throttling at a constant beam current results in a single discharge chamber operating point and eliminates the need for active propellant flow controllers and complex <b>engine</b> <b>throttling</b> software. Detailed mission analysis calculations for a CNSR mission performed using this constant beam current throttling strategy indicate only a small reduction in delivered payload and increase in required propellant relative to a conventional throttling profile based on varying the beam curent...|$|R

In the drive-by-wire system, the <b>engine’s</b> <b>throttle</b> body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|R

25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and <b>engine</b> <b>throttle</b> settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce unsprung mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} systems study to examine and evaluate throttling capabilities of liquid rocket engines. The focus {{of this study is}} on engine components, and how the interactions of these components are considered for throttling applications. First, an assessment of space mission requirements is performed to determine what applications require <b>engine</b> <b>throttling.</b> A background on liquid rocket <b>engine</b> <b>throttling</b> is provided, along with the basic equations that are used to predict performance. Three engines are discussed that have successfully demonstrated <b>throttling.</b> Next, the <b>engine</b> system is broken down into components to discuss special considerations that need to be made for <b>engine</b> <b>throttling.</b> This study focuses on liquid rocket engines that have demonstrated operational capability on American space launch vehicles, starting with the Apollo vehicle engines and ending with current technology demonstrations. Both deep throttling and shallow <b>throttling</b> <b>engines</b> are discussed. Boost and sustainer <b>engines</b> have demonstrated <b>throttling</b> from 17 % to 100 % thrust, while upper stage and lunar lander <b>engines</b> have demonstrated <b>throttling</b> in excess of 10 % to 100 % thrust. The key difficulty in <b>throttling</b> liquid rocket <b>engines</b> is maintaining an adequate pressure drop across the injector, which is necessary to provide propellant atomization and mixing. For the combustion chamber, cooling can be an issue at low thrust levels. For turbomachinery, the primary considerations are to avoid cavitation, stall, surge, and to consider bearing leakage flows, rotordynamics, and structural dynamics. For valves, it is necessary to design valves and actuators that can achieve accurate flow control at all thrust levels. It is also important to assess the amount of nozzle flow separation that can be tolerated at low thrust levels for ground testing...|$|R

2500|$|The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe {{featured}} the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls {{which could be}} mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using safety glass and the door window panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had dual flight controls, low pressure tires and mohair interior. Both models featured dual <b>engine</b> <b>throttle</b> controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the brake lever. The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and [...] $4,985 for the Deluxe.|$|E
2500|$|At , {{the engines}} {{were still at}} idle power. Power {{settings}} for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as [...] "N1" [...] and [...] "N2". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured {{as a percentage of}} maximum N1 or N2 rpm. Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions. The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2. This is because jet <b>engine</b> <b>throttle</b> response is not linear; jet engines have to [...] "spool up" [...] in order to produce more thrust. At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to [...] "spool up" [...] to full power. On PLF 101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32%-33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51%-52% N1 for the given conditions. As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA). However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.|$|E

All the same, he knew himself ridiculous. The extra water the pump lifted would not help much now. They had a few minutes, and then, if nobody cut the ropes, the hulk would go down.|$|E
5000|$|... c) are {{designed}} to have a normal shock in the ducting downstream of intake lip, so that the flow at compressor/fan entry is always subsonic. This intake {{is known as a}} mixed-compression inlet. However, two difficulties arise for these intakes: one occurs during <b>engine</b> <b>throttling</b> while the other occurs when the aircraft speed (or Mach) changes. If the <b>engine</b> is <b>throttled</b> back, there is a reduction in the corrected (or non-dimensional) airflow of the LP compressor/fan, but (at supersonic conditions) the corrected airflow at the intake lip remains constant, because it is determined by the flight Mach number and intake incidence/yaw. This discontinuity is overcome by the normal shock moving to a lower cross-sectional area in the ducting, to decrease the Mach number at entry to the shockwave. This weakens the shockwave, improving the overall intake pressure recovery. So, the absolute airflow stays constant, whilst the corrected airflow at compressor entry falls (because of a higher entry pressure). Excess intake airflow may also be dumped overboard or into the exhaust system, to prevent the conical/oblique shock waves being disturbed by the normal shock being forced too far forward by <b>engine</b> <b>throttling.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's <b>engine</b> <b>throttles</b> down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's <b>engine</b> <b>throttles</b> back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|R
