5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{advent of}} printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth.

In <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> holiday, it was customary to buy and eat varme hveder, a traditional bread, because bakers were closed on holidays and people bought bread for the following day.|$|R

5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the national flag <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> passage of the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding {{the use of the}} flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E

5|$|British troops {{proceeded}} {{to occupy the}} various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.|$|E
5|$|Croatia and Slovenia started {{negotiations}} to define maritime borders in the Gulf of Piran in 1992 {{but failed to}} agree, resulting in a dispute.

These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an international arbitration commission set up via the UN, enabling Croatia to progress towards EU membership. The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> arbitration agreement.|$|E
