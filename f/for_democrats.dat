5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible <b>for</b> <b>Democrats</b> to win.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook <b>for</b> <b>Democrats</b> there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on {{a liberal}} {{platform}} that included support for public {{housing in the}} suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year <b>for</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate {{in a couple of}} years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.|$|E

On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States.|$|E

25|$|It's {{definitely}} {{worth it}} to the Democrats {{to put in the}} effort if only to keep the party energized. Even if Paul Hackett loses, it is very important for the party for him to do well.

25|$|As {{with most}} urban districts, Colorado's 1st Congressional District is racially diverse and {{has proven to}} be {{friendly}} territory <b>for</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Only two Republicans have been elected to the district's Congressional seat since the Great Depression. Dean M. Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947, and Mike McKevitt served one term from 1970 to 1972, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats.|$|E

Having worked without a contract for two years, the police union struck a deal with Boston mayor Thomas Menino for a new contract, avoiding a major embarrassment for the party.|$|E
