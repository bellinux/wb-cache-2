5|$|Edwin and Eadbald of Kent were allies at this time, and Edwin {{arranged}} to marry Eadbald's sister Æthelburg. Bede notes that Eadbald {{would agree to}} marry his sister to Edwin only if he converted to Christianity.

5|$|In 2006 Coca-Cola began a {{collaboration}} with Emeco {{to create a}} 1006-based chair made out of recycled Coca-Cola bottles, which was released in 2010.

5|$|The Florida mouse is nocturnal, and {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year except on especially cold nights. The mouse can climb, but is primarily a terrestrial species.

50|$|The Politics of Justus Lipsius (Politicorum Libri Sex, 1589) {{consists}} only of centos, {{there being}} nothing {{of his own}} but conjunctions and particles.

50|$|In hindsight, I {{think it}} works because Philip Glass's music {{is kind of}} a metaphor for Jiro's work ethic, because it's {{repetitive}} but it also builds on itself and escalates, and it's <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with Jiro's work. Because every day he's going, he's <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> routine, and trying to <b>do</b> everything exactly <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but just reaching for that one step of improvement, and I feel like <b>the</b> music's <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, so they match perfectly.|$|R

5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There {{is little evidence that}} the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E

5|$|Although Paisley was now {{in charge}} of the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead them onto the pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for Leeds but Revie, who watched the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E
5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured {{fire on the}} Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up the ground. In the night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended {{the first day of}} fighting.|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, {{as there}} is no elected head of state who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and five are semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their president by direct popular vote. Among the fourteen parliamentary republics, half <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas in the remaining seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special representative body such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E

She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was {{a victory for the}} Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E

By the night, Saavedra and Castelli resigned, convincing Cisneros to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
