5|$|The {{long-term}} success of <b>implants</b> is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As <b>implants</b> have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of <b>implants</b> must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of <b>implants</b> is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. <b>Implants</b> placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than <b>implants</b> placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on <b>implants</b> and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium <b>implants</b> {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term <b>implants).</b> Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{data was}} {{extracted from the}} studies; study design, centres (single vs multiple centres), patient demographics (patient age, H&N cancer diagnosis), treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), donor site of autogenous bone graft, outcome measures, <b>implant</b> details (<b>implant</b> system, <b>implant</b> number, <b>implant</b> site, type of bone <b>implant</b> placed into (non-vascularised vs vascularised/free flap), <b>implant</b> placement surgical protocol <b>implant</b> survival/success/failure figures), <b>implant</b> definitions (<b>implant</b> survival/success/failure), type of prosthetic rehabilitation (fixed vs removable), and any reported complications.|$|R
30|$|Data was {{collected}} for <b>implant</b> survival, <b>implant</b> success, <b>implant</b> failure, <b>implant</b> complications, surgical <b>implant</b> placement protocol, <b>implant</b> system used, clinical follow-up, how the author defined success/survival, {{the type of}} autogenous bone graft, <b>implant</b> site, the prosthodontic rehabilitation and type of cancer, {{and the use of}} radiotherapy were documented where possible.|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety-five {{crossbred}} steers {{were used to}} compare lifetime <b>implant</b> strategies and {{study the effects of}} <b>implanting</b> during the suckling period on performance in the growing and finishing periods. There were no differences in growing period gains when both groups were <b>implanted</b> in the suckling period and the growing period. However, steers <b>implanted</b> in the suckling period but not <b>implanted</b> in the growing period had significantly lower gains than all other treatments including controls. Steers <b>implanted</b> only in the growing period had better feed efficiency in the growing period than both controls and steers <b>implanted</b> only in the suckling period. Steers reimplanted during the finishing period had similar finishing gains regardless of prior <b>implant</b> treatment, and all <b>implanted</b> cattle gained faster than controls in the finishing period. Steers not reimplanted during the finishing period had lower gains than those reimplanted. <b>Implanting</b> in the finishing period resulted in better feed efficiency. All <b>implanted</b> cattle that were reimplanted in the finishing period had higher lifetime gains than controls, but {{there was no difference between}} <b>implant</b> combinations. The only carcass characteristic changed by <b>implanting</b> was quality grade, which was reduced by all <b>implant</b> combinations with the exception of <b>implanting</b> only in the finishing period. <b>Implanting</b> during the suckling period did not reduce cattle performance during the growing and finishing periods when the steers were also <b>implanted</b> during these periods. This study emphasizes the importance of <b>implanting</b> twice in the finishing period to maximize finishing gain and final weight...|$|R
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of <b>implants</b> splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When <b>implants</b> can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other <b>implants,</b> there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between <b>implants</b> loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single <b>implants,</b> even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{compound}} <b>implants</b> (two stage <b>implants),</b> {{between the}} actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue {{and can cause}} periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental <b>implants</b> {{focuses on}} the general health {{condition}} of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing <b>implants</b> although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects <b>implants</b> called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of <b>implants.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper aims at {{providing}} a preliminary understanding in a biomechanics effect of immediate dental <b>implant</b> loading. Immediate loading of an <b>implant</b> interface {{has been used}} for completely and partially edentulous patients. Forces may be influenced by patient factors, <b>implant</b> position, cantilever forces, occlusal load direction, occlusal contact intensity. The surface area of load distribution may be increased by <b>implant</b> size, <b>implant</b> design, and surface condition of the <b>implant</b> body. This article addresses the effect of <b>implant</b> material on stress and strain in the bone. These factors affect the amount of stress on the developing at <b>implant</b> interface and hence may affect the risk of immediate occlusal loading for <b>implant</b> prostheses...|$|R

5|$|Small {{diameter}} <b>implants</b> are <b>implants</b> of low diameter {{with one}} piece construction (implant and abutment) that are sometimes used for denture retention or orthodontic anchorage.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with <b>implants</b> relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the <b>implants</b> does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer <b>implants</b> than roots or teeth that are longer than the <b>implants</b> that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter <b>implants</b> increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the <b>implants</b> themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E
30|$|The main outcome {{measure was}} <b>implant</b> {{survival}}. This review will define <b>implant</b> survival as an <b>implant</b> still in situ {{that has not}} been removed or lost at the census date and thus <b>implant</b> failure defined as an <b>implant</b> that has been removed or lost and is no longer in situ.|$|R
40|$|A feedlot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate initial and terminal <b>implant</b> combinations in finishing steers. <b>Implant</b> strategies including Synovex Choice increased average daily gain and rib eye area when compared to strategies including Revalor-IS. Steers <b>implanted</b> initially and terminally with Synovex Choice also had increased performance compared to steers <b>implanted</b> initially and terminally with Revalor-IS; however, performance was not different when comparing Synovex Choice verses Revelor-IS as an initial <b>implant</b> (Revalor-S terminal <b>implant).</b> Marbling was similar across <b>implant</b> strategies, indicating the observed increase in performance with Synovex Choice was achieved without negatively influencing carcass quality...|$|R
5000|$|Osseointegration is also defined as: [...] "the {{formation}} of a direct interface between an <b>implant</b> and bone, without intervening soft tissue". Osseointegrated <b>implant</b> {{is a type of}} <b>implant</b> defined as [...] "an endosteal <b>implant</b> containing pores into which osteoblasts and supporting connective tissue can migrate". Applied to oral implantology, this thus refers to bone grown right up to the <b>implant</b> surface without interposed soft tissue layer. No scar tissue, cartilage or ligament fibers are present between the bone and <b>implant</b> surface. The direct contact of bone and <b>implant</b> surface can be verified microscopically.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary use}} of dental <b>implants</b> {{is to support}} dental prosthetics. Modern dental <b>implants</b> make use of osseointegration, the {{biologic}} process where bone fuses tightly {{to the surface of}} specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.|$|E
5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or <b>implants</b> {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas <b>implants</b> are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace {{complete}} arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental <b>implants</b> may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though <b>implants</b> are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, <b>implants</b> {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, <b>implants</b> may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed <b>implants</b> in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
30|$|For {{study of}} the {{long-term}} effects of the interaction between an <b>implant</b> and the human body, the surface morphology and the average surface composition of an <b>implanted</b> Carbulat™ <b>implant</b> (retrieved after 8  years) and a sterilized but not <b>implanted</b> Carbulat™ reference <b>implant</b> were compared. After 8  years, the alloplastic material was removed from the above 18 -year-old asymptomatic patient, and the composite <b>implant</b> was replaced with autologous bone tissue from the iliac crest.|$|R
50|$|House's first {{design for}} a {{cochlear}} <b>implant</b> was surgically <b>implanted</b> in 1961, but the <b>implant</b> {{was rejected by the}} patient's body. A longer-lasting model was developed and successfully <b>implanted</b> in 1969, and it was introduced commercially in 1972.|$|R
40|$|Over 500 {{crossbred}} steers {{were used}} in three trials to compare lifetime <b>implant</b> strategies and to {{study the effects of}} <b>implanting</b> during the suckling period on performance in the growing and finishing periods.

All <b>implant</b> treatments increased (P<. 05) lifetime average daily gains and total gain, and there was no difference among <b>implant</b> combinations. <b>Implant</b> treatments increased lifetime gains by 30 to 54 lbs. Because <b>implanting</b> in the suckling period did not reduce cattle performance during the growing and finishing periods, {{there appears to be no}} basis for discounting the price of previously <b>implanted</b> cattle.

5|$|As {{platinum}} is {{a catalyst}} {{in the manufacture}} of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical <b>implants</b> (breast <b>implants,</b> joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study.

5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and <b>implants,</b> such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) and dental <b>implants</b> that can stay in place for up to 20 years.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In orbital reconstruction, {{the optimal}} {{location}} of a predefined <b>implant</b> can be planned preoperatively. Surgical results can be assessed intraoperatively or postoperatively. A novel method for quantifying orbital <b>implant</b> position is introduced. The method measures predictability of <b>implant</b> placement: transformation parameters between planned and resulting <b>implant</b> position are quantified. METHODS: The method was tested on 3 human specimen heads. Computed Tomography scans were acquired at baseline with intact orbits (t 0), after creation of the defect (t 1) and postoperatively after reconstruction of the defect using a preformed <b>implant</b> (t 2). Prior to reconstruction, the optimal <b>implant</b> position was planned on the t 0 and t 1 scans. Postoperatively, the planned and realized <b>implant</b> position were compared. The t 0 and t 2 scans were fused using iPlan software and the resulting <b>implant</b> was segmented in the fused t 2 scan. An <b>implant</b> reference frame was created (Orbital <b>Implant</b> Positioning Frame); the planned <b>implant</b> was transformed to the reference position using an Iterative Closest Point approach. The segmentation of the resulting <b>implant</b> was also registered on the reference position, yielding rotational (pitch, yaw, roll) as well as translational parameters of <b>implant</b> position. RESULTS: Measurement with the Orbital <b>Implant</b> Positioning Frame proved feasible on all three specimen. The positional outcome provided more thorough and accurate insight in resulting <b>implant</b> position than could be gathered from distance measurements alone. Observer-related errors were abolished from the process, since the method is largely automatic. CONCLUSION: A novel method of quantifying surgical outcome in orbital reconstructive surgery was presented. The presented Orbital <b>Implant</b> Positioning Frame assessed all parameters involved in <b>implant</b> displacement. The method proved to be viable on three human specimen heads. Clinically, the method could provide direct feedback intraoperatively and could improve postoperative evaluation of orbital reconstructive surgery...|$|R
5|$|Root form implants; {{the most}} common type of implant {{indicated}} for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that <b>implants</b> with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than <b>implants</b> with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success.|$|E
5|$|Surgical <b>implants,</b> {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed <b>implants</b> make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} <b>implants</b> has {{to account for}} a {{lifetime}} of real-world use in a person's mouth.

40|$|A new entity called "implant periapical lesion" has {{recently}} been described. This lesion could be the result of, for example, bone overheating, <b>implant</b> overloading, presence of a preexisting infection or residual root fragments and foreign bodies in the bone, contamination of the <b>implant,</b> or <b>implant</b> placement in an infected maxillary sinus. This case report describes a titanium <b>implant</b> that {{was placed in the}} maxillary premolar region. A fenestration involving the middle portion of the <b>implant</b> was present. After 7 months, the apical portion of the <b>implant</b> showed radiolucency. This lesion rapidly increased in size and a vestibular fistula appeared. A systemic course of antibiotics was not successful, and the <b>implant</b> was then removed. The histologic examination showed the presence of necrotic bone inside the antirotational hole of the <b>implant.</b> The etiology of the <b>implant</b> failure in this instance could possibly be related to bone overheating associated with an excessive tightening of the <b>implant</b> and compression of the bone chips inside the apical hole, producing subsequent necrosis...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that <b>implant</b> overload can cause bone resorption and inflammation (Isidor 1996; Miyata et al. 2000). Implant-protected occlusion proposed by Misch and Bidez (1994) aims to reduce stress that arises in the <b>implant</b> bone by lowering the <b>implant</b> occlusion area to the same size as that of the periodontal membrane (approximately 25  μm). Thus, considering that the <b>implant,</b> unlike natural teeth, does not have a periodontal membrane, reducing <b>implant</b> occlusal contact area to lower than that of natural teeth to prevent pressure displacement can prevent <b>implant</b> overload and increase <b>implant</b> survival rate. Meanwhile, Doi et al. (2006) have measured the occlusal force distribution in <b>implant</b> prostheses using a dental prescale and reported that when there was no initial occlusal contact in the <b>implant</b> region, there was low <b>implant</b> occlusal force and occlusal balance could not be maintained during maximum clenching. Furthermore, it {{has been reported}} that implant-protected occlusion can cause onset of temporomandibular joint arthrosis (Inai 1998).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the optimal thread design for an experimental cylinder <b>implant.</b> Three-dimensional finite element models with an <b>implant</b> of single-thread, double-thread, and triple-thread were created. TheMax EQV stresses in jaw bones andMax displacement of implant-abutment complex were compared. It was found that, under AX load, the Max EQV stresses in cortical bone and cancellous bone of double-thread <b>implant</b> increased by 10. 4 % and 9. 2 % compared with that of single-thread <b>implant</b> respectively. Under BL load, the Max EQV stresses in cortical bone of double-thread <b>implant</b> increased by 9. 1 % and Max EQV stresses in cancellous bone of triple-thread <b>implant</b> decreased by 14. 2 % compared with that of single-thread <b>implant</b> respectively. The results imply that single-thread <b>implant</b> shows the best stress transmission under axial load. Single-thread and triple-thread <b>implant</b> show the better stress transmission under buccolingual load. Different thread designs show similar effect on the osseointegrated <b>implant</b> stability...|$|R
