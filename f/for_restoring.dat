5|$|Edward III (13 November 1312– 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 {{until his}} death; he is noted for his {{military}} success and <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, EdwardII. EdwardIII transformed the Kingdom of England {{into one of}} the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E
5|$|The Genocide run {{requires}} the player to kill all monsters and maximize their LOVE. As Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but Frisk kills him along with Asgore and Flowey. Chara materializes after Flowey is killed and explains {{that they were}} resurrected by the player's LOVE. The player is then asked to join them {{in the destruction of}} the universe, which occurs regardless of the player's choice. In order to enable further replays of the game, Frisk must first give their soul to Chara in exchange <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> the universe. In doing so, the ending of every subsequent Pacifist route is marred by Chara's malevolent presence.|$|E

To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East. Tiberius was responsible <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It {{is a testament to the}} resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, the leaking {{roof was}} repaired. In December 2007, the House {{received}} a $28,500 {{grant from the}} Dr. Scholl Foundation. The grant was used to complete lead-paint abatement, which would make conducting other restoration work safer. By 2010, the Dr. Scholl Foundation granted another $50,000 and a family foundation provided another $50,000 for the restoration. It was reported that other college grants totaling $15,500 were given for preservation planning, {{in part by the}} Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. It was reported in May 2010 that a matching grant of $101,500 was given to Connecticut College from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, which provided the funding for the next phase of renovations <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> the House.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to studies and accounts {{that showed the}} bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration {{of the lake and}} forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Plans <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> the {{courthouse}} had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted in {{the courthouse}} being reopened in 1985 for the use of the civil courts and other county offices.|$|E

5|$|Wizards & Warriors III is a {{platforming}} {{video game}} which features open-ended gameplay elements similar to games such as Metroid and Faxanadu. Players control {{the main character}} Kuros as he sets out to defeat Malkil and free the town of Piedup. The game features three separate realms in which the player must explore - the town, the underworld, and the palace; players can freely navigate from one realm to another. Throughout the game, players find money {{which can be used}} to buy items from inns located throughout Piedup; players can buy keys for unlocking doors, food and drink <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> health, and information from shopkeepers. Players begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives have been lost; unlike the previous Wizards & Warriors games, there is no password or continue feature.|$|E
5|$|After {{the primary}} defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from {{sales of the}} Daily News began to decrease. In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper. In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium. In August 1952, Boddy {{announced}} his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a Sunday News. He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, Sheldon F. Sackett. After signing, Smith {{backed out of the}} deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the Daily News was losing over $100,000 a month. McKinnon had no better luck than anyone else in reviving the paper, and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Mirror. Under the sale agreement, the Mirror became the Mirror & Daily News (before again being renamed the Mirror-News) and all Daily News employees lost their jobs. On December 18, 1954, publication of the Daily News ceased.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E

5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military <b>for</b> <b>restoring</b> military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E
