40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{survey was conducted}} in Iran and Australia to study the choice and effects of governance mechanisms in regulating client-contractor relationships in two culturally and legally diverse environments. Data collected from 73 Iranian and 38 Australian client-contractor partnerships were then analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The contributions of this thesis are threefold; first, it contributes to social capital theory and social exchange theory by revealing that social capital and collaboration play different roles in regulating exchange relationships; for example, {{the results showed that}} where there is no substitutive or complementary relationship between social capital and <b>formal</b> <b>contract,</b> collaboration and <b>formal</b> <b>contract</b> complement each other. Second, it contributes to the inter-organizational relationships (IORs) and project management literature by introducing a new construct of ‘project control capability’ and showing the importance of its role in transaction performance; for example, the findings showed that if collaboration is not effectively implemented to enhance ‘project control capability’, its impact on project performance will disappear. Third, this thesis enriches the IORs literature by identifying and elaborating how culture and contract enforceability influence the choice and effects of governance mechanisms. For instance, the findings showed that while collaboration is the main contributor to relationship satisfaction in Australia as an individualistic country with high contract enforceability, social capital is the main motivator for relationship satisfaction in Iran with its collectivistic culture and low contract enforceability. Together, this study provides important theoretical and managerial insights and opens the way for more research within IORs context, particularly with regard to complex conditions in large construction projects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{component}} {{interaction is}} based on interface calls and callbacks. Such interaction can introduce integration faults, i. e., side effects {{at the moment of}} component integration. Solutions to such problems can be hard to apply, and may require drastic changes {{in the design of the}} involved components. This paper introduces <b>Formal</b> <b>Contracts,</b> a software construct that allows side-effect free component interaction, and thereby avoids the introduction of integration faults. Furthermore, via a state machine representing the inter-component <b>contract,</b> <b>Formal</b> <b>Contracts,</b> in addition to the static aspects, formally specify the dynamic aspects of component interaction. <b>Formal</b> <b>Contracts</b> are a pragmatic software mechanism that supports the full development cycle: from the specification and decomposition until the debugging, composition, and test of a system. 1 Problem Statement Research, as in Trew[2], has identified that during software Component Integration, so typically at a relatively late stage of the development cycle, the following integration issues make the development cycle costly and unpredictable...|$|R

40|$|Why do firms use <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> or {{relational}} {{contracts with}} their business partners? The paper uses survey data {{based on a}} large number of Chinese firms to uncover some important factors for why and when <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> or relational contracts are used. This study identifies geographical location as an important factor in affecting Chinese firms' contracting decisions. We find that a firm is more likely to use <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> with its clients and suppliers if they are located in a city different from the firm's main business location. We also find that larger (smaller) firms tend to adopt <b>formal</b> (relational) <b>contracts.</b> However, while the number of clients has a negative impact on a firm's adoption of <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> with its clients, the number of suppliers has a positive impact on its adoption of <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> with the suppliers. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Can <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> help {{resolving the}} holdup problem? We address this {{important}} question {{by studying the}} holdup problem in repeated transactions between a seller and a buyer in which the seller can make relation-specific investments in each period. In contrast to previous findings, we demonstrate that writing a simple fixed-price contract based on product delivery is of value even when relation-specific investment is purely cooperative. In particular, there is a range of parameter values in which a higher investment can be implemented only if a <b>formal</b> fixed-price <b>contract</b> is written and combined with an informal agreement on additional payments or termination of future trade, contingent upon investments. Furthermore, we show that under an additional natural assumption, focusing our attention on fixed-price <b>contracts</b> {{as a form of}} <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> is without loss of generality. The key driving force of our result is a possibility that the threat-point effect is negative, i. e., the relation-specific investment decreases the surplus under no trade. This possibility, although very plausible, has been largely ignored in previous theoretical/empirical analyses of the holdup problem. holdup problem, <b>formal</b> <b>contract,</b> relational contract, cooperative investment, fixed-price contract, relation-specific investment, repeated transactions, long-term relationships...|$|R
40|$|Our {{exploratory}} empirical study, {{based on}} a series of in-depth interviews and a survey of firms, searches for answers on a number of questions that deal with the role of <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> and intellectual property rights in the context of open innovation. We find that firms active in open innovation have a strong preference for the governance of their open innovation relationships through <b>formal</b> <b>contracts.</b> These contracts are relevant from both a control and a process monitoring perspective. Also, despite the open nature of open innovation, firms still see intellectual property rights as highly relevant to the protection of their innovative capabilities. In a first attempt to explain this preference for intellectual property rights by open innovation firms, we find the degree of openness of firms, their legalistic attitude, and the competitive dynamics of their product market environment to be related to this preference...|$|R

30|$|However, this {{inference}} {{does not}} suggest {{the preservation of the}} informal institutions by limiting the power of the formal courts.

There is no point in denying that improvement in <b>formal</b> <b>contracting</b> enhances efficiency and social mobility by allowing contractors without any family/community connection to enter the market. However, the preexistence of a strong informal institutional framework, captured by large community networks, makes the rapid institutional switch socially costly as it may exclude people from participating in the market. Most importantly, the exclusion comes from the high cost of accessing the formal institutions. Given the efficiency property of formal institutions, the most logical implication of our research is to reduce the cost of <b>formal</b> <b>contracting.</b>|$|R

The informal system relies heavily on the reputation mechanism, where someone with a reputation of cheating does not get a job within his/her community. People using <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> however do not care about reputation – punishment under <b>formal</b> <b>contracting</b> is direct and enforced by a third party (fine, imprisonment).

Advanced Donation provides an unusual window into the evolution of the exchange of a single good — a kidney for transplantation — from gift, to simple barter, to exchange with a temporal separation of obligations that relies solely on trust and reputational constraints for enforcement, to a complex matching market in which the parties rely, at least in part, on <b>formal</b> <b>contract</b> to define and clarify their obligations to each other. The transplant community, however, has historically viewed <b>formal</b> <b>contracts</b> in the transplant setting with discomfort, and that traditional discomfort remains evident in current Advanced Donation practice.
