5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may <b>die.</b> <b>If</b> Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Ticks satisfy all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements as ectoparasites, feeding on a diet of blood. They are obligate hematophages, needing blood to survive and move from one stage of life to another. Ticks can fast for long periods but eventually <b>die</b> <b>if</b> {{unable to find a}} host. This behavior evolved approximately 120 million years ago through adaptation to blood-feeding. The behavior evolved independently in the separate tick families, with differing host-tick interactions driving the evolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|Various texts relate {{that in the}} forest, Kalmashapada {{encounters}} a young Brahmin couple engaged in coitus. Kalmashapada disturbs the act before climax and captures the Brahmin youth.

5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or <b>die.</b> <b>If</b> cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Separate {{from the}} main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five {{attributes}} (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark it assumes that form permanently. Although Chao eventually <b>die,</b> <b>if</b> they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.|$|E

He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E

5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will <b>die</b> <b>if</b> he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon <b>die</b> <b>if</b> he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will <b>die.</b> <b>If</b> their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely <b>die</b> <b>if</b> they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will <b>die</b> <b>if</b> the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E
5|$|Momohime's {{story begins}} after {{she wakes up}} Kyo with {{memories}} of being killed by the dying Jinkuro when he was aiming for her betrothed, the samurai lord Yukinojo. Upon encountering the spirit of Jinkuro, he forcefully possesses her, but before the process of soul transference is finished, they are attacked. In the confusion, Momohime's soul is kidnapped by the vengeful monk Rankai and Jinkuro is forced to follow Kongiku as Momohime's body will <b>die</b> <b>if</b> her soul is harmed.

Descending into Yomi, Jinkuro's soul is briefly captured by a demon, and it is only with Momohime's help that he escapes and learns that the Dark Resurrection was never in the storehouse.

5|$|Resident Evil 5 is {{the first}} game in the Resident Evil series {{designed}} for two-player cooperative gameplay. The first player controls Redfield, {{a former member of}} the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and current member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Alomar, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Alomar is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split-screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split-screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will <b>die</b> <b>if</b> their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's story-line is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut-scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will <b>die</b> <b>if</b> he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E
