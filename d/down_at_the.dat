5|$|Texas {{began its}} third {{possession}} with 7:58 {{remaining in the}} quarter. From the 28-yard line, running back Shon Mitchell gained 14 yards and a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 42-yard line. Brown then completed a 26-yard pass to Adams, who earned a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 32-yard line. Now in Tech territory, Mitchell gained eight yards on a run {{to the left side}} of the field. On second down, Williams ran straight ahead for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 17-yard line. Mitchell then advanced to the 12-yard line on a running play, but Brown threw an incomplete pass on second down. Facing a third down and needing five yards, Texas was stopped for a short gain, but Tech was called for an offsides penalty. The five yards negated the third-down stop and gave Texas a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> six-yard line of Virginia Tech. Two plays later, Brown completed a pass to tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who ran into the end zone for a touchdown. The subsequent extra point kick was good, and Texas took a 70 lead with 4:32 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Texas' post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech four-yard line. A two-yard run was followed by an 11-yard carry by Ken Oxendine who earned a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 17-yard line. After the first down, Oxendine earned another six yards. Druckenmiller then completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Bryan Jennings for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 35-yard line. Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain a first down, and the Hokies punted.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati's offense {{took over}} at the spot of the {{interception}} and immediately began moving down the field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the end zone, denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E

5|$|Following Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} kick return, the Virginia Tech offense {{began at}} its 24-yard line. The first Tech play of the quarter, a run up the middle by Edmonds, {{resulted}} in a 17-yard gain and a first down. Dwayne Thomas followed Edmonds' run {{with one of his}} own, advancing the ball to the 50-yard line. He pushed into Tennessee territory on the next play, a five-yard run that gave the Hokies a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee 45-yard line. DeShazo then ran nine yards, and Tech gained a first down on the next play. Inside the Tennessee 35-yard line, however, the Volunteers' defense stiffened. DeShazo passed for a seven-yard gain, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down until DeShazo scrambled for a 13-yard gain on fourth down. The run kept the Tech drive alive as the Hokies now had a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee 14-yard line. Tennessee forced another third-down play, but the Hokies gained a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee three-yard line with a pass from DeShazo to Thomas. Four plays later, the Hokies scored their first points of the game as Thomas dove across the goal line on fourth down. The subsequent extra point was good, and the Hokies cut Tennessee's lead to 217 with 5:17 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense {{started work}} at its 20-yard line. Tech {{committed}} a five-yard penalty, {{and as the}} final seconds of the quarter ticked off, Florida State ran up the middle for five yards and a first <b>down.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the first}} quarter, the score was 147, Florida State leading.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Clemson's offense {{started at}} its 25-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the drive, Dantzler {{completed}} a pass to wide receiver Rod Gardner, who ran for 25 yards and a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 50-yard line. A nine-yard shovel pass play {{was followed by a}} run up the middle for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 37-yard line. Dantzler completed an eight-yard pass, then a running play was stopped short of the first-down marker. On third down, Dantzler faked a quarterback sneak in order to attempt a long pass downfield. Dantzler was unable to pass, however, and was sacked for a four-yard loss. Rather than attempt a field goal or punt the ball, Clemson coach Tommy Bowden had his team attempt to gain a first down. Dantzler scrambled forward, but didn't gain the five yards needed. The Tigers thus turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 28-yard line.|$|E
50|$|Kentucky {{threatened}} to score late and tie it, but turned {{the ball over}} on <b>downs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2-yard line. Neely sealed the game by running the ball 34 yards to the 36-yard line.|$|R

Simmons then completed a six-yard pass before throwing a shovel pass to Kelly for a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 32-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by six-yard toss and a pass to Watts at the 12-yard line. Simmons ran out of bounds for a two-yard loss, then completed a touchdown pass to Gardner. The extra point kick was good, and Clemson closed Virginia Tech's lead to 3420 with 7:19 remaining.|$|E

Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard gain, which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good. With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E
