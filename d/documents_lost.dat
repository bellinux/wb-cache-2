Older than many who served at Philadelphia and came into prominence with the new federal government, Mason died soon after the constitution came into force and displayed no ambition for federal office, declining {{a seat in the}} Senate. Mason left no extensive paper trail, no autobiography like Franklin, no diary like Washington or John Adams. Washington left papers collected into 100 volumes; for Mason, with many <b>documents</b> <b>lost</b> to fire, there are only three. Mason fought on the side that failed, both at Philadelphia and Richmond, leaving him a loser in a history written by winners—even his speeches to the Constitutional Convention descend through the pen of Madison, a supporter of ratification.

The American press hounded Papen on his [...] "idiotic Yankees" [...] remark, and during a visit to San Francisco, Papen told a journalist that he only meant certain New York newspapers were [...] "idiotic", not the American people in general, claiming that American media were out to defame him, a statement that only made matters worse for him as any reading of his letter clearly did not support that interpretation. Unknown to Papen, the British had broken the German diplomatic codes, and in late 1915 presented the American government with intercepts of messages showing that Papen had been raising a [...] "legion" [...] for the invasion of Canada; was involved in acts of sabotage and plans for sabotage all over Canada, the United States and Mexico; and sundry other violations of American neutrality.|$|E

Under these circumstances, the objectivity of the volume can be questioned as an instalment of the [...] ""battle of the memoirs", despite the claim in the foreword written by Förster, that the Reichsarchiv would show the war as it actually happened ("wie es eigentlich gewesen"), in the tradition of Leopold von Ranke.

5000|$|Ana Carrigan alleged {{against the}} widely {{accepted}} version that drug lords, such as Pablo Escobar, may have masterminded the operation {{in order to}} get rid of several criminal investigations recorded in the <b>documents</b> <b>lost</b> during the event. A Special Commission of Inquiry, established by the Betancur government, released a June 1986 report which concluded that Escobar had no relation with this event, so these allegations could not be proven (though it did not rule out the possibility either). Carrigan alleged that the act was a conspiracy of the Colombian government. Others state that the alleged Guerrilla-Cartel relation was unlikely to occur because the two organizations had several standoffs and confrontations, like the kidnapping of Nieves Ochoa, the sister of Medellin cartel founder Juan David Ochoa, by M-19. The kidnapping {{led to the creation of}} the MAS/Muerte a Secuestradores ("Death to Kidnappers") paramilitary group by the Medellin cartel.

Although the Trustees did not believe that the particular <b>documents</b> <b>lost</b> were likely to cause many future problems, the remaining manuscripts were moved to the main Library to prevent further damage. In other respects, Wise's tenure was marked only by his poor (and worsening health) and poor relations with the University. University members expected to be admitted and the Vice-Chancellor made it clear to Wise that he believed the Library part of the University and thus under his overall control. Wise did not agree, threatening at one point to padlock the Library and refer any man who cut it to the courts. The Vice-Chancellor took this as an unprovoked insult and turned to consideration of the University statutes and the imposition, if they did not already exist, of such statutes as would compel the ageing Wise to attend to his duties from which he was now regularly absent. Five years before his actual death in 1767, a satirical death notice was placed in the London papers announcing the [...] "greatly regretted" [...] death of Wise [...] "death occasioned by a violent cold, contracted by too close attendance on the duties of his respective offices". In those last years, Wise was so ill that he could no longer attend the Library. Upon his death, his collection of coins was presented to the Library.|$|E
5000|$|Again, several fine forts were produced, but {{generally}} projects went unfinished, {{and between the}} First System and Second System little was prepared to resist the British in the coming War of 1812. However, no First System or Second System fortress was captured by the British. The invasion of Baltimore was prevented by Fort McHenry (along with its protecting shoreline batteries of Forts Babcock and Covington to the west, Fort Look-Out (or the Six-Gun Battery) on the peninsula to the rear in the west, a temporary naval battery across the Patapsco channel to the east at Lazaretto Point, and the sunken ships blocking both channels {{on either side of}} McHenry along with 20,000 militia dug in {{on the east side of}} the town at [...] "Loudenschlager's Hill" [...] - later [...] "Hampstead Hill" [...] in today's Patterson Park). The intense all-night bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British ships offshore was memorialized by Francis Scott Key, a Baltimore lawyer who witnessed the ferocious attack from one of the vessels, and put down his thoughts watching the barrage - which failed to either destroy the fort or subdue its defenders - in a four-stanza poem, which became known as The Star-Spangled Banner and later became America's national anthem. In some cases even incomplete forts (some with fake wooden cannon barrels painted black pointed out the embrasures) were sufficient to deter attack from the sea. But, undefended and unfortified, Washington, D.C., the national capital, was burned after the land militia forces were routed at the Battle of Bladensburg northeast of the capital in Prince George's County, Maryland. Washington had one fort, Fort Washington on the Potomac River just below Alexandria, Virginia, whose commander ordered the magazine blown when the passing British fleet appeared nearby, after the British had already occupied Washington. The present Fort Washington was built on the site of the destroyed Fort Washington in the early 1820s as part of the Third System.

40|$|The growing {{effort of}} {{reducing}} energy {{needs in the}} building sector calls for an accurate characterization of the performances of external walls, which are {{the main cause of}} thermal exchanges and consequently are fundamental to realize accurate simulation models to evaluate and control thermal loads. The dynamic characterization of a multilayer wall can be performed by defining its stratigraphy and the thermo-physical parameters of each layer. When existing buildings are investigated, technical specifications may be unknown or difficult to obtain due to <b>documents</b> <b>lost</b> over time; furthermore, aging may have altered the building materials characteristics. In these cases, in-situ measurements become essential but there is the need to analyze the behavior of walls considering their dynamic characteristics, not obtainable by employing non-destructive tests, such as the heat-flow meter method. The paper aims to verify if an equivalent homogeneous wall can be associated to a multilayer wall in the sense of producing the same behavior if exposed to the same outdoor environmental conditions. Findings in literature demonstrate that, generally, this is not exactly achievable. However, the possibility of an approximate equivalence is investigated in this work by means of finite-element simulations and experimental measurements. The results obtained in actual case studies show that this equivalence can be made, obtaining preliminary satisfying results. The proposed methodology can be employed in existing and historical buildings to achieve useful equivalent data directly applicable for the energy retrofit phase and for achieving a better coupling between the building and the heating/cooling system, reducing environmental impacts...|$|E
40|$|Migration and {{stratification}} {{are increasingly}} intertwined. One day {{soon it will}} be impossible to understand one without the other. Both focus on life chances. Stratification is about differential life chances – who gets what and why – and migration is about improving life chances – getting more of the good things of life. To examine the interconnections of migration and stratification, we address a mix of old and new questions, carrying out analyses newly enabled by a unique new data set on recent legal immigrants to the United States (the New Immigrant Survey). We look at immigrant processing and lost documents, depression due to the visa process, presentation of self, the race-ethnic composition of an immigrant cohort (made possible by the data {{for the first time since}} 1961), black immigration from Africa and the Americas, skin-color diversity among couples formed by U. S. citizen sponsors and immigrant spouses, and English fluency among children age 8 - 12 and their immigrant parents. We find, inter alia, that children of previously illegal parents are especially more likely to be fluent in English, that native-born U. S. citizen women tend to marry darker, that immigrant applicants who go through the visa process while already in the United States are more likely to have their <b>documents</b> <b>lost</b> and to suffer visa depression, and that immigration, by introducing accomplished black immigrants from Africa (notably via the visa lottery), threatens to overturn racial and skin color associations with skill. Our analyses show the mutual embeddedness of migration and stratification in the unfolding of the immigrants' and their children's life chances and the impacts on the stratification structure of the United States. nativity premium, immigration, children of immigrants, immigrant visas, social stratification, gender, race, Hispanic origin, skin color, presentation of self, visa depression, New Immigrant Survey, illegal experience, English fluency, spouse selection...|$|E

Today, the remaining places and spaces of the bomb at Los Alamos are being preserved for future generations through their inclusion in the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, a unique partnership between the Department of Energy, which will continue to own and manage its wartime properties located “behind the fence,” and the Department of Interior’s National Park Service, which will take the lead on interpreting the complex history and continuing legacy of nuclear weapons. This study, a blend of social, architectural, and scientific history, examines the historical contexts of the remaining World War II buildings and structures at Los Alamos National Laboratory that {{are listed in the}} park legislation. Arguing that the decision to use atomic weapons against the people of Japan is the polarizing master narrative of the Manhattan Project, this dissertation focuses instead on the narratives of people, places, and institutions that have been overshadowed by controversy. Using primary, secondary, and oral history sources, along with historical photographs and architectural drawings, this research project explores the Manhattan Project through the lens of place. This study examines the voices of women and the military, <b>documents</b> <b>lost</b> technologies and places, and discovers connections between Los Alamos and other institutions that supported the development and deployment of the first atomic bombs, including the underappreciated contributions of the Navy and the University of New Mexico, which have been obscured by past government secrecy practices. As national sites of memory—Pierre Nora’s lieux de mémoire—the meaning of these atomic places and landscapes will change through time, ever responding to the dynamics of collective memory and experience. The goal {{of this study is to}} look beyond the controversy of atomic weapons to reveal hidden narratives and historical associations that will provide the intellectual stage for continued public dialogue about the memory and meaning of the development and use of nuclear weapons.
