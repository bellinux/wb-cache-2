60|$|The tragic {{adventures of}} the Indian captives must often have been {{relieved}} by comic incidents {{like those of}} Knight's escape from his guard; but {{there is very little}} record of anything except sorrow and suffering, danger and death. Certainly in the captivity of John Slover, another of Crawford's ill-starred and <b>ill-willed</b> crew of marauders, there were few gleams of happier chance to distinguish it from most histories of the sort. He had been captured by the Indians when a boy of eight years, and carried from his home in Virginia to their town of Sandusky, where he was adopted into their nation, and where he lived quite happily till his twentieth year, when he was given up to his own people.|$|E

50|$|The {{stand-alone}} Game Boy comic books, {{despite having}} that title, are {{based solely on}} Super Mario Land since {{it was the only}} Game Boy adventure game around at the time. It ended at four issues. The stories feature an original character named Herman Smirch, a quasi-hero of the storyline. He is an <b>ill-willed</b> character whom Tatanga—the villain of source game—could easily hypnotize into doing his bidding due to the bitterness in the man's cynical soul. In each issue, Smirch releases Tatanga and his minions into the real world, and a child then releases a tiny Mario to battle them.|$|E

5000|$|Nahua {{suffering}} from a disease often seek out a shaman to attract the malevolent pathogen away from them. If this does not work, they may seek Western medical treatment but use of shamans is typically first. Shamans attract the life-forces of spirits through cut-outs used during cleansing rituals. These <b>ill-willed</b> spirits have names, associated colors, and representations through paper. They arise from villagers who have died a violent death or who were forgotten by their kinsmen during ceremonies such as the Day of the Dead. [...] They enjoy eating corn, as well as drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco and are continuously floating around looking for a susceptible person in which to enter. [...] These spirits tend to prey on those with less chicahualistli or force such as the young or the elderly.These spirits cause sickness, displeasure or even eventual death. One spirit does not represent one type of disease. Rather, their harm is manifested by different people through different symptoms. However, not all spirits cause ill. Some spirits are protectors {{and need to be}} appeased, and Nahua perform occasional rituals simply as a means of appeasing these helpful spirits.|$|E
5000|$|The Westerners {{were led}} by Shim Eui-gyeom (심의겸), Myeongjong's {{brother-in-law}} whose house was on {{the west of the}} palace. Although Sarim scholars were usually hostile to royal in-laws as corrupting influence, Shim was Yi Hwang's disciple and protected Sarim scholars by impeaching his uncle who was planning another literati purge. In addition, many Westerners were disciples of Yi I and Seong Hon and followers of Giho school while many Easterners were disciples of Yi Hwang and Jo Shik and followers of Youngnam School. Easterners emphasized moral purification of the ruling class and rooting out corruption of earlier period while Westerners emphasized reforms that would strengthen the country and improve livelihood. (Easterners blamed Shim Eui-gyeom's <b>ill-willed</b> opposition to Kim Hyo-won's appointment at a key position in Ministry of Personnel for split while Westerners blamed Easterner's self-righteous attack.) Yi I attempted to prevent the factional split by appointing Shim Eui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won to provincial posts far away from the court and arranging truce between Easterner Yi Bal and Westerner Jeong Cheol. After Yi I's death, however, the conflict between two factions became more intense as the Easterners impeached Shim Eui-gyeom and Jeong Cheol, leading to their dismissal, and gained upper hand.|$|E
50|$|Olivier de Vézin and {{two former}} {{partners}} in the mill agreed to collaborate, receiving royal approval in 1736. The company was formed on 16 October 1736 {{with a total of}} five partners, who formally signed the paperwork establishing the Society and Company for the Exploitation of Iron Mines on 11 February 1737. Despite having friendly relations with colonial officials, the projects did not progress smoothly and went over budget. The Intendant, Gilles Hocquart, questioned Olivier de Vézin's competence, a doubt which was justified as de Vézin had masked an error regarding the stream used in the ironworks. The ironworks' furnace was first lit in August 1738, and that month de Vézin became the company's director. The following year he retrieved more labourers from France, as well as his brother Sieur Darmeville. This was followed by violent disputes between de Vézin and his partners; the partners blamed Olivier de Vézin for the ironworks' lack of profit and <b>ill-willed</b> workers. With bankruptcy fast approaching Olivier de Vézin resigned on 13 October 1740 and immediately returned to France. In a letter to the king dated 13 March 1742, de Vézin offered to return to the Saint-Maurice ironworks. The king instead commissioned Olivier de Vézin as chief road officer in Louisiana. This position dissatisfied Olivier de Vézin, but he went to Louisiana, where he unsuccessfully attempted to exploit iron mine. He may have died in France.|$|E
5000|$|... “Dill” is {{the story}} of Dame Clementina and her long lost father. Dame Clementina has a daughter, Nan, who one day picks a sprig of dill. Her mother tells her of the tale that if you hang a sprig of dill over your door, it will freeze anyone who is <b>ill-willed</b> or envious of you before they can enter the house. Now, Dame Clementina is the count’s daughter, but when she marries a poor lowly dairyman she is disinherited from her father. While he gives her silver milk pans and a {{beautiful}} dairy, she doesn’t see him for many years and he has never met his granddaughter Nan. One day, Dame Clementina finds that Nan had hung the sprig of dill over their front door, but the Dame insists to Nan that no one is envious of them. But just then, Dame Goulding comes walking up the path and is stopped by the curse for she envied Dame Clementina and her milk pans. Nan runs to get Dame Goulding’s husband, but he too is stopped by the curse for envying Dame Clementina’s white cow. More and more people try to enter the house but are stopped by the curse and soon the yard is full of people screaming to be released. Finally, the Count rides to the house and is stopped on his horse for he envied Dame Clementina for having a child like Nan.|$|E
50|$|The {{legend of}} the White Lady exists in Durand Eastman Park. The {{legend of the}} white lady is very popular among locals, often used to scare teens who go there seeking privacy, making it a common spot for lovers to slip off to. The white lady herself was very {{protective}} of her daughter. She often warned her to never go near any men, telling her that they were <b>ill-willed.</b> Some say that her daughter followed her mother's wishes, and others say that she would sneak out to see boys in the night. On one of these nights, the daughter told her mother {{that she was going}} out for a walk along the shore, and would be back soon. When her daughter never returned, the woman was positive that her daughter had been raped and/or murdered. Every evening the neighbors would see her walking along the shores of the beach, calling her daughter's name. Other times they would see her walking in the forest with her German Shepherd, looking for where her daughter was buried, always in a white dress. She grew so grief-stricken that she threw herself over a cliff into lake Ontario, committing suicide. The locals say that on foggy nights, or nights of the full moon, you can see her misty form looking for her daughter, with her German Shepherd by her side. They also say that she takes a certain disliking to men, especially those who are hurtful towards woman. Some say that she even rattles their cars, and chases them toward the lake, but never harms the woman accompanying them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{liberation of}} {{histamine}} is a dose-dependent phenomenon such that, with increasing doses administered {{at the same}} rate, {{there is a greater}} propensity for eliciting histamine release and its ensuing sequelae. Most commonly, the histamine release following administration of these agents is associated with observable cutaneous flushing (facial face and arms, commonly), hypotension and a consequent reflex tachycardia. It should be noted though that these sequelae are very transient effects: the total duration of the cardiovascular effects is no more than one to two minutes while the facial flush may take around 3-4 minutes to dissipate—(note: half-life of plasma histamine is ~2 minutes). Because these effects are so transient, {{there is no reason to}} administer adjunctive therapy to ameliorate either the cutaneous or cardiovascular effects. Thus, in the fierce battle to win market share for sales of the [...] "steroidal" [...] versus the terahydroisoquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents, fact and information pertaining to adverse events were distorted to suit partisan taste, and, consequently, much misinformation was deliberately disseminated regarding histamine release and its effects: this was particularly so in the 1980s and 1990s shortly after the near simultaneous competitive clinical introduction of atracurium (Tracrium—a bis-benzyltetrahydroisoquinolinium (BBTHIQ) neuromuscular blocking agent marketed by Burroughs Wellcome Co., now subsumed into GlaxoSmithKline) and vecuronium (Norcuron—a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent marketed by Organon, now subsumed into Merck & Co. Inc.). The most common misinformation seeded into the minds of anesthesiologists was the failure to categorically state that the cardiovascular effects following histamine release were transient: instead, the marketing focus was single-mindedly to regurgitate and emphasize that the tetrahydroisoquinolinium class elicited histamine release that could prove to be a danger to the cardiovascular stability of the patient during surgical procedures. There was complete failure to disseminate the true picture that these effects were not only transient but that the extent of the hypotensive effect and the reflex tachycardia were rarely of clinical significance and therefore did not require adjunctive therapy, as evidenced by the complete lack of any clinical literature advocating the need for adjunctive antihistamine use concomitantly with the administration of tetrahydroisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking agents. Unfortunately, these <b>ill-willed</b> beguiling marketing notions have persisted through the decades and become ingrained with each successive generation of newly qualified anesthesiologists and CRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetists) to the extent that the mere mention of [...] "benzylisoquinolines" [...] (the erroneous but commonly used class name for tetrahydroisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking agents) immediately conjures images of histamine release, cardiovascular instability and generates unnecessary anxiety.|$|E
40|$|India is {{progressively}} {{moving ahead}} {{in the field of}} Information technology. The concept of e-commerce is already in place whereas e-governance is also on the same track. Similarly other sectors like health, judiciaries etc. are following the path. With the advent of information technology, malevolent people now have another option to cause damage to people by doing cyber attacks rather than physical damage, wherein the impact of cyber damage is equally devastating. As people are launching themselves into the e-world completely, the Cloud as a service is now shaping up the future. Since the cloud services are available through internet, it is the need of hour to prevent cyber attacks {{and at the same time}} trace the <b>ill-willed</b> persons for the sake of securing business, personal information and nation. Data Mining techniques and algorithms contribute tremendously to this task of assuring security of information on the cloud. In this paper, review of various data mining techniques and algorithms is presented which can help achieve security of information on cloud...|$|E
30|$|The {{common cause}} of the mass {{mortality}} of fishes in a fish farm is a power failure. There can be many reasons for the power failures {{but most of them}} are the result of natural disasters, systematic faults, <b>ill-willed</b> sabotages, or mistakes of employees. Such incidents usually have a bad influence upon small or medium-scale farmers. To deal with unexpected power failures, this research proposes a status monitoring system utilizing both PLC and ICT. Consistent supply of electric power in Fish Farms is essential for the operation and management of farm facilities regardless of them being indoors or afloat. The statistics show that the power failure and the red tides are the major causes of ruining farmer’s earnings. The proposed system is autonomous and simple enough for the employees to operate such that prompt actions can be taken in times of crisis. There have been some concerns about applying the PLC technology as it often involves loss of transmission signals. To minimize signal losses, use of RUDP in the transmission layer was proposed as well. At the same time, a GUI-based operational mode has been embedded in the Android application to enhance user convenience for observing and managing farm’s activities such as controlling of seawater and farm accesses and checking locations, photoperiods, withdrawal periods, and system’s batteries. The proposed design can be quite suitable for the Vertical Fish Farm.|$|E
40|$|Networks are {{forwarding}} {{more and}} more data every year, thus its harder to reveal malicious traffic among all of it. Current systems might not be capable of {{keeping up with the}} rapid pace of the growth, and {{might not be able to}} separate <b>ill-willed</b> from harmless traffic, or point out to many false positives and not be of much use. Cisco ́s NetFlow standard is used to monitor networks, and due to its versatility it can be used to reveal several interesting things about a network, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) -attacks or port scans. In this paper I will compare the current solution up against a visual solution developed for this thesis. Carefully choosing different visual elements to represent NetFlow data as clear as possible using the D 3. js framework. Using nfdump it is possible to extract specific information and export it into files readable by D 3. js code. The solution was tested with large amounts of data to test if it served its purpose. It was possible to see clear patterns in the data showing the network behavior was repeating itself. It was able to point out abnormalities where single Internet Protocol (IP) -addresses suddenly receives atypical amounts of traffic either distributed across thousands of ports or just to one single one. Since the data is anonymized it is hard to point out what the reason for the peaks in traffic, but shows the solution serves its purpose to separate the irregular from the harmless traffic. Through further testing it was concluded that the solution has great purpose, but cannot serve as a stand alone solution due to its limitations for going into very specific details while still being intuitive and easy to use. But its functionality complements a text-based solution very well by removing a lot of the resource and time consuming commands that would be done in the command-line...|$|E
40|$|Xen is {{a virtual}} machine monitor (VMM) that we have {{developed}} at the University of Cambridge over the past 5 years. As a VMM, Xen allows a single physical computer to be partitioned into a set of isolated virtual computers, each running their own operating system and applications. Xen has received a fair bit of attention recently and we have even spun out a company to support the commercial use of the software. This article isn’t just about our VMM though. Xen is the core {{part of a much}} larger vision for public computing that has been behind a lot of our research in the 21 st century. In this article, we articulate this vision, and the motivation behind Xen, and cover the details of the current VMM, the context in which it was conceived, and the future uses that we anticipate. 1 Xen: Master and Servant Xen is the crucial component of the Xenoserver world of public computing. The Internet provides connectivity between all the networks in the world, and the Web provides glue between all of the information resources connected to these networks. In both of those contexts, there is mutual benefit to participants: Sometimes referred to as Metcalfe’s Law, the value of N nodes joining in a network is ¢¤ £, which usually offsets the risks, added security costs, denial of service and so forth, associated with being connected to a global and largely unregulated network. There are already a great deal of resources attached to these networks, and an interest in building services (online games, file sharing, Internet telephony, and even the search for extra-terrestrial life) that are built by combining distributed resources together. However, if we want equipment owners to share their computational resources, the benefit is often less obvious and the risks are certainly greater — it’s a big bad world out there full of worms, viruses, and <b>ill-willed</b> teenagers. To offset the risks, we must provide one service on each host: isolation. If a user is to, for instance, offer CPU resources she must be assured there is no negative impact on her normal applications. I...|$|E
