5|$|Later on 20 November, Šljivančanin and Colonel Nebojša Pavković {{informed}} {{the press that}} the JNA would provide buses to transport the wounded out of Vukovar. Instead, at about 10:30, the buses took the prisoners to the JNA barracks on {{the southern edge of}} Vukovar, where 15 men were separated from the group and returned to the hospital after being identified as hospital staff. During their stay in the barracks, the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries threatened the prisoners. Croatian Serb leaders opposed moving the prisoners to detention facilities in Serbia, claiming they wished to prosecute them for alleged crimes committed against Serbs. After spending two hours at the barracks, the buses took the prisoners to the Ovčara farm near the village of Grabovo. The group largely consisted of Croats, but also included several ethnic Serbs, Muslims, ethnic Hungarians, the French national Nicolier, and one German national who fought in defence of Vukovar. It also included Rašeta's nephew, who worked at the Vukovar <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacy</b> at the time. The group of taken to Ovčara consisted of 261 people. Sources disagree as to whether the group included one, or two women, one of whom was five months pregnant. The age of the prisoners ranged from 16 to 72. The youngest among them was 16-year-old Igor Kačić.|$|E
25|$|A Pharmacy Technician in the UK has {{recently}} been referred to {{by some as a}} professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacy</b> has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy premises.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), {{based in}} {{suburban}} Philadelphia, {{is a nonprofit}} organization devoted to preventing medication errors and the safe use of medications. Its medication error prevention efforts began in 1975 with a column in <b>Hospital</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> to inform healthcare professionals and others about medication error prevention. ISMP operates a voluntary practitioner error-reporting program to tabulate errors nationally, understand their causes, and share “lessons learned” with the healthcare community, known as the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP), operated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in cooperation with ISMP. In addition, ISMP’s corporate subsidiary, Med-E.R.R.S. (Medical Error Recognition and Revision Strategies), works directly and confidentially with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent errors that stem from confusing or misleading naming, labeling, packaging, and device design. The ISMP list of error-prone abbreviations is distributed nationally.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> {{can often}} be found within the {{premises}} of the <b>hospital.</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. [...] Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications given intravenously. [...] This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. [...] Several <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with {{the potential impact of}} medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> perform at the highest level possible.|$|R

25|$|In 2001, North Dakota {{became the}} first U.S. state to pass {{regulations}} allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacy</b> sites throughout North Dakota. In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site pharmacy technicians and patients through videoconferencing. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities, and {{a study of the}} operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably. The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the chemical contamination of surfaces by cytotoxic agents during preparation of injectable chemotherapies in <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Methods 526 wipe samples collected in 24 Swiss <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> were analysed using a validated liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method able to quantify 10 cytotoxic agents: cytarabine, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate, etoposide phosphate, irinotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin and vincristine. Information on chemotherapies produced, equipment and production processes used {{were collected from}} all the <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> {{on a voluntary basis}} in order to investigate their association with contamination rates. Results In two pharmacies, no trace of the 10 cytotoxic agents was detected. Chemical contamination was found in the other 22 <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> with combined total contamination of the 10 cytotoxic agents ranging from 8 ng to more than 41 000 ng per sample. Most contaminated samples came from inside biosafety cabinets, but some came from other clean room areas and logistics rooms. Statistically significant associations were observed between contamination rates and sampling locations, the number of chemotherapies prepared per year and types of cleaning solutions used. Conclusions This study demonstrated that most of the <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> tested had some contamination of surfaces by different cytotoxic agents. Even if highest levels of contamination were mainly detected inside biosafety cabinets, technicians were also exposed to cytotoxic agents detected in logistical and storage areas. Protective measures should therefore be maintained or even reinforced in these areas in order to limit technicians’ risks of exposure when handling cytotoxic products...|$|R

40|$|Background: According to the Dutch GMP-hospital {{pharmacy}} directive (1) {{three types}} of microbiological controls are required when aseptic dispensing is performed: 1. microbiological monitoring of {{the air in the}} working area, the gloved hands of the operator and the work surface at the critical place in the laminar airflow cabinet; 2. microbiological validation of the operators through media fill runs; 3. validation of the aseptic process by repeating the procedures with an appropriate broth. Purpose: To develop a web-based program for data of microbiological controls on aseptic dispensing for Dutch <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> for: simple processing of environmental monitoring data; trending of environmental monitoring data; comparing individual data with other <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> nationwide. Materials and methods: The web-based program MICROBIO was designed in collaboration with an expert group of hospital pharmacists. Participating <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> collected microbiological control data and entered them into the program. Limits for microbiological contamination are based on EU-GMP recommendations (2). Results: Currently 49 of 80 Dutch <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> use MICROBIO. More than 85 % of the microbiological controls on monitoring comply with the results (air 87 %, gloved hands 90 %, work surface 86 %).

40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of accreditation for <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> {{this study was to}} determine the challenges of medication management in <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study was a mix-method research conducted in two qualitative and quantitative phases during the years 2014 – 2015 in Shiraz, Iran. National Accreditation Standard checklist for hospitals was used for data collection in the first phase, and Delphi method was applied in three rounds to achieve the most challenges of medication management and the related solutions. Results indicated a medium status of accreditation for all three dimensions in the above <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> (3. 53, 42. 15 and 7, respectively). Lack of clinical pharmacists, nonparticipation of the pharmacy director in annual budgeting, lack of access to patient information, discontinuity of pharmaceutical care for patients discharged, defects in pharmacy staff training, lack of legislation in support of pharmacists and lack of adequate access to physicians' prescriptions, shortages in reporting medication errors, and lack of evidence related to microbial contamination are the most challenges extracted from the second phase. It seems that the studied <b>hospital</b> <b>pharmacies</b> encounter numerous problems regarding accreditation, pharmaceutical care as well as appropriate medication management and supply chain. Attempts to solve these problems can play an important role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of pharmacies in Iran...|$|R
