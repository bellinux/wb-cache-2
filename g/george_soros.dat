5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and <b>George</b> <b>Soros</b> were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E

United. Kevin Payne, former President of Soccer USA Partners and current CEO of D.C. United, was instrumental in organizing this ownership group. By 1998 the group was looking for new investors, and on February 15, 2001, it agreed to sell the team to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), founded by Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, with AEG exercising its option to become the sole investor-operator on January 8, 2002.

5|$|The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee {{attempted}} {{to raise more}} individual contributions in smaller dollar amounts compared with the second inauguration of GeorgeW. Bush in 2005. The 2009 contribution limit was set at $50,000for donations by individuals, whereas individuals and companies were able to give a maximum of $250,000 apiece for the 2005 event. As of January 30, 2009, the presidential committee raised more than $53million, with at least 458people giving the committee-imposed maximum of $50,000, including celebrity donors such as <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> Halle Berry, Jamie Foxx and George Lucas. Emphasizing a change from business as usual, the committee set stringent guidelines for campaign contributions, barring donations from corporations, political action committees, registered federal lobbyists, labor and trade unions, registered foreign agents and non-U.S.citizens. The committee did accept donations from people with active lobbying interests before the federal government, but not registered as federal lobbyists, such as Google executive Eric Schmidt and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer.|$|E
5|$|The shares debuted on the NYSE on 10 August 2012, and {{initially}} showed a slight rise to $14.05 per share, but closed the day {{back at the}} offer price of $14 each, valuing the club as a whole at $2.3billion, and {{making it one of}} the most valuable sports teams in the world. One of the biggest investors in the IPO was American billionaire <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> whose investment company purchased about 3.1million class A shares (1.9% of the club), valued at $40.7million (£25.8million) at the time. Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £359.7million after the share sale paid off £62.6million of bonds. The club's debts were further remedied in May 2013, after a new loan deal was agreed that would save the club £10million a year in interest payments on debts now totalling around £307million.|$|E

25|$|Financier <b>George</b> <b>Soros</b> {{called for}} an {{outright}} ban on naked credit default swaps, viewing them as “toxic” and allowing speculators to bet against and “bear raid” companies or countries.

25|$|Foreign {{support for}} the Shevardnadze regime {{declined}} from 2000 to 2003, with notable figures outwardly calling for a more democratic transition. These included <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> Richard Miles (the US ambassador to Georgia), and allies of the Bush administration, including a visit from James Baker (the former U.S. Secretary of State) who pressured Shevardnadze to accept parallel vote tabulation and pushed for free election standards.|$|E
25|$|A $22.6billion International Monetary Fund and World Bank {{financial}} package was approved on 13 July 1998 to support reforms and stabilize the Russian market by swapping out an enormous {{volume of the}} quickly maturing GKO short-term bills into long-term Eurobonds. The Russian government decided to keep the exchange rate of the ruble within a narrow band, although many economists, including Andrei Illarionov and <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> urged the government to abandon its support of the ruble.|$|E

By 1998 the company improved its financial performance and revenues passed the $200 million mark for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Human Rights Watch (HRW) {{said in a}} {{statement}} on 29 June that in two Harare neighbourhoods ZANU-PF supporters inflicted beatings on people who did not vote; non-voters were reportedly identified either by the absence of indelible ink on their fingers or by their absence from a list of those who had voted. HRW is part of a network of organisations associated with <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> which also includes the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa and Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, parent organisation of the MDC.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} {{career as a}} fitness professional, John Sitaras created his own system and, as he {{developed}} a good following, he embarked {{on a plan to}} open his own gym. His plan was financed by some well-known Wall Street clients, who put in nearly $1.5 million, and the club, Sitaras Fitness, opened in November 2007, in Upper East Side, Manhattan. It quickly became a place frequented by high-profile people from various fields, like business magnate <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> economist and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, journalist Charlie Rose, record executive David Geffen or NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} forms of {{international}} involvement was with <b>George</b> <b>Soros</b> and the Open Society Foundation located in the United States. A non-governmental organization that’s mission is to promote democracy, human rights, and reform in various areas, such as the economy helped {{in the making of}} Kmara, a student movement that was brought to Serbia by the foundation to get insight for the resistance, particularly training in nonviolent methods of protest. Translating as “Enough,” it resembled a Serbian organization that played a heavy role in the Bulldozer Revolution that happened three years prior and which ended the presidency of Slobodan Milošević in Yugoslavia.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, complex issue, critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires like <b>George</b> <b>Soros</b> ritualistically applaud their own bravery and pretend they are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it {{is that people who}} viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers are supposed to do – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E
25|$|John Sitaras is an American fitness professional, {{the creator}} of the Sitaras Method and the founder of Sitaras Fitness in New York City. The method {{developed}} by him supposes an initial comprehensive evaluation system similar to a general medical examination, in order to design individualized routines according to each student's genetic aptitude, level of fitness, health conditions, and personal goals. As the students make progress, the evaluation is resumed periodically to reassess the routines and track their physical changes. He is the personal trainer of several high-profile people from various fields, like business magnate <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> economist and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch (who recovered from muscular atrophy under Sitaras' supervision), journalist Charlie Rose, record executive David Geffen or NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson (who was the first racing driver to become the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and who won seven championships).|$|E
25|$|In {{the three}} years before the Rose Revolution, foreign {{financial}} support for the regime began to become severely limited. Instead, foreign states and organizations gave financial assistance to NGOs and opposition parties within Georgia, worsening the desperate budget situation of the Shevardnadze government. The United States announced a reduction in aid, coinciding with {{a decision by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend aid to Georgia. As international support for the regime deteriorated (particularly in the West), public perceptions of Shevardnadze's political weakness increased. A significant source of funding for NGOs and election monitoring organizations came from foreign governments and individuals. The U.S. and European governments gave the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) the funds to support foreign election observers. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)§ spent $1.5 million to computerize Georgia's voter rolls. The Open Society Institute (OSI), funded by <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> supported Mikheil Saakashvili and a network of pro-democratic organizations. The OSI additionally paid for a number of student activists to go to Serbia and learn from Serbians who had helped to topple Slobodan Milošević in 2000. Western democracy promoters also circulated public opinion polls and scrutinized election data throughout Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Over 1,000 economists (including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, Jeffrey Sachs and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz), {{more than}} 1,000 parliamentarians from over 30 countries, the world's major labor leaders, the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action, Occupy Wall Street protesters, Oxfam, War on Want {{and other major}} {{development}} groups, the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace and other major environmental organizations support a FTT. Other notable supporters include the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bill Gates and Michael Moore. David Harding, founder and CEO of one of London's biggest hedge funds has given qualified support for a European tax on financial transactions, breaking ranks with many of his peers fiercely opposed to such a measure. Speculator <b>George</b> <b>Soros,</b> put forward a different proposal, calling rich countries to donate their special drawing rights {{for the purpose of}} providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. It has been widely reported that the Pope backs such a tax. However, the reality is that a commission of the Vatican of which the Pope is not a member merely said that such a tax would be worth reflecting on.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate <b>George</b> <b>Soros</b> warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E
