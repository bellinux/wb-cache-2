5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed <b>faucets</b> which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting <b>faucets.</b>|$|E

In addition, it has pledged to employ low-flow <b>faucets</b> and shower heads, use sustainable materials like reprocessed flooring, recycle up to 90% of its debris, and seek LEED Silver certification in its construction of new facilities on campus. Also, the Department of Grounds Maintenance at Fordham has committed to making half of its vehicle fleet electric by 2016. The university has also proposed numerous environmental initiatives, including using certified green cleaning products, a uniform recycling program, and composting {{in cooperation with the}} New York Botanical Garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated <b>faucets</b> may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} <b>faucet</b> {{concept was}} realized and demonstrated by embedding cobalt nanocrystals in a TiN/SiO 2 /FeOx/FePt structure. The thermal annealing induced cobalt nanocrystals in silicon oxide would shrink both the operation voltage and variation {{as well as}} improves the electric <b>faucet</b> stability. The thickness effect and area size effect would be discussed, which indicated the optimized design and possible resistive switching mechanism for the FeOx-based memristor. The improvement of resistive switching stabilities and switching power characteristics show that the embedded nanocrystals in the insulating layer would localize the electric <b>faucet</b> formation and rupture at interface region. Importantly, a proposed mathematical model to describe the compliance current effect shows that the electric <b>faucet</b> was grown in two dimensions.

25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{which oversees}} the {{regulation}} of antimicrobial agents and materials in that country, found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. Copper and copper alloys are unique classes of solid materials as no other solid touch surfaces have permission in the U.S. to make human health claims (EPA public health registrations were previously restricted only to liquid and gaseous products). The EPA has granted antimicrobial registration status to 355 different copper alloy compositions. In healthcare applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, <b>faucets,</b> door knobs, toilet hardware, intravenous poles, computer keyboards, etc. In public facility applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include health club equipment, elevator equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. In residential building applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include kitchen surfaces, bedrails, footboards, door push plates, towel bars, toilet hardware, wall tiles, etc. In mass transit facilities, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include handrails, stair rails grab bars, chairs, benches, etc. A comprehensive list of copper alloy surface products that have been granted antimicrobial registration status with public health claims by the EPA can be found here: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the strength of the association between the isolation of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) from tap water <b>faucet</b> aerators and the prevalence of colonization or infection of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Surveillance cultures were obtained during a 4 -month period from 162 <b>faucet</b> aerators located in seven different ICUs. The prevalence of colonization or infection of ICU patients with NFGNB was determined by prospective surveillance during the same period. Fifty four (33 %) of the <b>faucet</b> aerators contained NFGNB. Among the 66 NFGNB isolated from <b>faucet</b> aerators, the most frequently encountered ones were Sphingomonas paucimobili (26 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 isolates), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (13 isolates), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (6 isolates), Burkholderia cepacia (4 isolates), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (3 isolates). Acinetobacter baumannii was not recovered. The most common NFGNB isolated from ICU patients were P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. There was a significant correlation between the overall prevalence of NFGNB in <b>faucet</b> aerators and their prevalence in exposed ICU patients (Spearman r = 0. 821, P = 0. 02). There was also a significant correlation between the prevalence of C. meningosepticum in <b>faucet</b> aerators and its prevalence among ICU patients (Spearman r = 0. 847, P = 0. 016).
