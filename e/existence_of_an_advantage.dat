40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the relation between}} language control and nonverbal cognitive control in different bilingual populations. We compared monolinguals, Dutch-French unbalanced bilinguals, balanced bilinguals, and interpreters on the Simon task (Simon & Rudell, 1967) and the Attention Network Test (ANT; Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, & Posner, 2002). All bilingual groups showed a smaller congruency effect in the Simon task than the monolingual group. They were also faster overall in the ANT. Furthermore, interpreters outperformed unbalanced, but not balanced, bilinguals in terms of overall accuracy on both tasks. In the ANT, the error congruency effect was significantly smaller for interpreters and balanced bilinguals. Using <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> switching fluency in language production, this study also found direct evidence for a relation between language control and executive control. This relation was only observed in balanced bilinguals, where fluent switching was correlated with the Simon effect.

40|$|The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{behavioral}} <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> bilinguals over monolinguals during {{executive tasks}} is controversial. A {{new approach to}} this issue is to investigate the effect of bilingualism on neural control when performing these tasks as a window to understand when behavioral differences are produced. Here, we tested if early bilinguals use more language-related networks than monolinguals while performing a go/no-go task that includes infrequent no-go and go trials. The RTs and accuracy in both groups did not differ. An independent component analyses (ICA) revealed, however, that bilinguals used the left fronto-parietal network and the salience network more than monolinguals while processing go infrequent cues and no-go cues, respectively. It was noteworthy that the modulation of these networks had opposite correlates with performance in bilinguals and monolinguals, which suggests that between-group differences were more qualitative than quantitative.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} futures innovation on LIFFE by empirically {{analyzing the}} individual growth profiles of its futures contracts and {{the factors that}} determine contract success or failure. The paper documents considerable heterogeneity across contracts, and finds that contract success can not easily be inferred from the contract's first years <b>of</b> trading. <b>As</b> expected, contract success is highly correlated {{with the size of}} the underlying market, as well as with its volatility. The paper also confirms the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> first-mover <b>advantage.</b> There is little systematic correlation, however, between bid-ask spreads and futures volume.

40|$|Evidence {{points to}} the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home <b>advantage</b> effect in soccer with referees giving more {{decisions}} to the home team being a plausible explanation for this effect. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to use qualitative methods to explore the factors that influence experienced referees when making decisions. Five experienced referees volunteered to participate in semi-structured interviews of 30 - 40 minutes duration. Examples of questions/probes included ‘Are there times when it is difficult to make a decision on whether there was a foul or not? When? Why?’ and ‘Do you worry about making the wrong / unpopular decision? What affect does this have on you?’ Content analysis identified 13 inter-related themes that describe four higher-order themes. The themes ‘accuracy-error’, ‘regulations’, and ‘professionalism’ form a higher-order theme labeled ‘ideal-decision making’. The themes ‘opinion’, ‘concentration’, and ‘control’ represent a higher-order theme labeled ‘individual factors’; ‘experience’, ‘personality’, and ‘personal life’ represent a higher-order factor labeled ‘experience factors’, and crowd factors, player reaction, environmental factors, and crowd interaction represent a higher-order factor labeled ‘situational factors’. Findings from the present study offer some insight into difficulties and coping strategies used by referees to perform consistently in professional soccer. Future research could use quantitative methods to test the relative contribution of themes identified above to the decisionmaking process in referees.

In order to ensure that all bilinguals had spent <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> time speaking their second language in its natural environment, bilingual exchange students were recruited. This bilingual group was tested alongside a monolingual exchange group and a monolingual control group who had not been on exchange. One hundred participants were administered <b>a</b> battery <b>of</b> tests, chosen to reflect the selective pattern of advantage in executive function found in previous research.

Bilinguals and monolinguals performed comparably on all tests. A significant difference did however emerge between monolingual participants who had been on exchange and control participants on the D-KEFS Card Sorting task.

40|$|Objectives: Accurate emotion {{processing}} {{is critical}} to understanding the social world. Despite growing evidence of facial emotion processing impairments in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), comprehensive investigations of emotional prosodic processing is limited. The existing (albeit sparse) literature is inconsistent at best, and confounded by failures to control {{for the effects of}} gender or low level sensory-perceptual impairments. The present study sought to address this paucity of research by utilizing a novel behavioural battery to comprehensively investigate the auditory-prosodic profile of BD. Methods: Fifty BD patients and 52 healthy controls completed tasks assessing emotional and linguistic prosody, and sensitivity for discriminating tones that deviate in amplitude, duration and pitch. Results: BD patients were less sensitive than their control counterparts in discriminating amplitude and durational cues but not pitch cues or linguistic prosody. They also demonstrated impaired ability to recognize happy intonations; although this was specific to male's with the disorder. The recognition of happy in the patient group was correlated with pitch and amplitude sensitivity in female patients only. Limitations: The small sample size of patients after stratification by current mood state prevented us from conducting subgroup comparisons between symptomatic, euthymic and control participants to explicitly examine the effects of mood. Conclusions: Our findings indicate the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female <b>advantage</b> for the processing of emotional prosody in BD, specifically for the processing of happy. Although male BD patients were impaired in their ability to recognize happy prosody, this was unrelated to reduced tone discrimination sensitivity.

Rare-male mating advantage {{has been shown to}} be a widespread phenomenon in Drosophila, although it is seen to be absent in some species. During the present investigation, experiments were conducted to study the mating success of wild type and mutant males at different ratios in the Elens-Wattiaux mating chamber using sepia and cardinal mutant stocks and a wildtype stock in order to detect a rare male effect in D. ananassae. In all the experiments the female-choice technique was employed. Red eye males were tested separately with sepia and cardinal mutants. Experiments were conducted at 9 different ratios. The results show that although both types of males are equally successful in mating when present in the same ratio, they are more successful in mating when in <b>a</b> minority.

Ethanol addition was able to increase total yield up to 60 % within the 6 h of extraction, reaching up to eta(total) = 1. 25 (wt. %). For stigmasterol uptake, two yield plateaus were observed within the six runs: one at eta(stigm) = 0. 17 (wt. %) for 0. 0 (wt. %) ethanol and the other at 0. 23 (wt. %) for 5. 0 (wt. %) ethanol, {{which suggests that the}} attainable practical amount of extractives depends on whether cosolvent is used or not. Simplified modeling disclosed that both intra-particle diffusion and film diffusion may be present in the SFE process. On the other hand, the broken plus intact cells (BIC) model of Sovova allowed to fit experimental data with deviations of 4. 20 % for eta(total) and 4. 02 % for eta(stigm) and to get instructive insights on the process. In fact, BIC model evidenced the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> selectivity <b>advantage</b> favorable to stigmasterol that is driven by kinetics rather than by solubility, which is corroborated by the fact that shorter extraction periods were noticed in stigmasterol yield curves than in the global extract yield curves.

30|$|Furthermore, {{despite the}} {{calculation}} {{results of the}} revealed comparative advantage in the second section of this paper, indicating that Egypt enjoys <b>a</b> strong comparative <b>advantage</b> in orange exports in comparison to other orange suppliers to Russia, these results should {{be interpreted with caution}} since the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comparative <b>advantage</b> alone certainly does not guarantee that a country’s exported commodity will be able to “compete” successfully. <b>A</b> country’s comparative <b>advantage</b> in <b>a</b> given commodity could alter over time due to changes in any of the other determinants of comparative advantage, such as demand patterns; the level of technology and production systems, government policies, and food safety; and quality standards among others (Cai and Leung 2007). In particular, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) such as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures are increasingly becoming <b>a</b> major determinant <b>of</b> the performance and market share of Egyptian agricultural exports to Russia and other importing markets (Bassiony 2012; Torayeh 2013). In this context, Trienekens and Zuurbier (2008) illustrated that the growing proliferation and stringency of food safety and quality standards in global importing markets have brought additional challenges to developing countries and raised concerns about their ability to cope with export requirements. Accordingly, the international fresh produce market has increasingly become highly competitive and sophisticated, and compliance with these ever-rising standards has become a critical factor that can adversely affect the competitiveness of exports from developing countries (Martinez and Poole 2004; Okello and Swinton 2007). With respect to the Russian market, Vinokurov et al. (2015) classified and assessed the impact of NTBs in the members states of the Eurasian Economic Commission (including Russia) and concluded that SPS measures represent {{one of the most important}} NTBs that increase the cost of exports to Russia on a significantly larger scale than other NTBs and therefore affect the access and competiveness of foreign exporters. Such NTBs could negate the positive effects of ongoing Egypt-Russia trade liberalisation efforts with Egyptian orange exports and should therefore be given priority within the context of these efforts, as well as in the ongoing negotiations aimed at the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free trade area between Egypt and the Eurasian Customs Union. Moreover, while the primary focus of this paper has been on price relationships between orange suppliers to Russia, more research using different and approaches is needed to provide <b>a</b> quantitative assessment <b>of</b> the trade implications of NTBs on the access and competitiveness of Egyptian orange exports on the Russian market.|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> number <b>of</b> non-mnemonic tasks have {{revealed}} the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bilateral field <b>advantage</b> (BFA; i. e. {{the increase in}} processing capacity when information is distributed across the two visual fields relative to within a single hemifield) in visual processing. Recent {{research suggests that the}} BFA may also extend to visual short-term memory (VSTM). However to date, studies have produced inconsistent findings, demonstrating a BFA in VSTM for spatial locations and orientations but not for colours (Delvenne, 2005; Umemoto, Drew, Ester, & Awh, 2010). Two possible hypotheses may account for those findings. The first suggests that the BFA is <b>a</b> feature <b>of</b> processing spatial information but not identity information (the stimulus domain hypothesis) whilst the second claims that the BFA is <b>a</b> feature <b>of</b> attentional selective processing (the attentional selection hypothesis). With the primary aim to uncover the conditions which promote a BFA in VSTM, the present thesis tested those hypotheses. Since the stimulus domain hypothesis predicts no possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> BFA for colour VSTM, Part One investigated whether colour VSTM may exhibit a BFA when the task demands on selective attention are increased. The findings revealed this to be the case, highlighting that the requirement to attentionally filter spatially distinct target stimuli from distracter stimuli promoted the BFA. In Part Two, selective attention was also found to promote a BFA in colour VSTM during maintenance. Specifically, the findings suggest that bilaterally encoded items can better survive decay in VSTM when spatial selective attention is oriented to stimuli locations at the encoding stage. Overall, the findings strongly suggest that the BFA in VSTM is <b>a</b> signature <b>of</b> attentional selective processing during VSTM encoding and VSTM maintenance. Those findings have important implications for our understanding of the capacity limits of VSTM and attention, and interhemispheric communication more generally...|$|R
40|$|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is <b>a</b> common disorder <b>of</b> childhood {{with negative}} lifetime outcomes. Although subjective ratings of attention problems are diagnostic for the disorder, an objective attention deficit has proven hard to isolate. An emerging {{body of work}} suggests that a reliable attentional phenotype in ADHD is a subtle, “neglect-like” performance deficit for stimuli presented in the left hemifield. In comparison, healthy subjects tend to exhibit a subtle bias or asymmetry of visual attention favouring left space, termed ‘pseudoneglect’, that is thought to arise from right hemisphere lateralised attention processing in neurotypical individuals. An absence or reversal of the left hemifield advantage appears to mark neurological vulnerability across <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> disorders of attention, including ADHD. Previous research has found associations between spatial attention biases, asymmetries in hemispheric dominance for EEG markers, and genetic variants in genes associated with attentional systems such as the gene encoding the dopamine transporter (DAT 1). However, no studies to date have examined {{the implications of these}} factors in combination in an ADHD sample. As such, the current study aims to understand the electrophysiological and genetic substrates of visuospatial attention in children with ADHD in comparison to typically developing controls. In addition to the collection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saliva sample for genotyping, EEG was recorded from 22 children diagnosed with ADHD and 29 typically developing control children while they performed a visuospatial attention task. Behavioural data confirmed the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> significant leftward <b>advantage</b> for target detection in typically developing children that is consistent with pseudoneglect. This RT advantage for left targets was lost in ADHD subjects and tended to be reversed, favouring target detections in the right hemifield. EEG analysis confirmed the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> group differences in the N 2 pc-like component that differed as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> hemisphere and, across all subjects, a relationship between hemispheric asymmetry in pre-target alpha power and RT asymmetry was observed. Evidence for an earlier onset decision-making signal in ADHD and control participants was observed for right and left hemifield targets, respectively. Further, there was a significant relationship across all participants in the expected direction between the onset asymmetry of this decision variable and RT asymmetry. Although no differences in electrophysiological measures or RT asymmetry were found between the two DAT 1 groups, {{there was a significant difference}} between the genotype groups in ADHD symptom scores irrespective of ADHD diagnosis, and also reading ability such that participants in the high-risk DAT 1 group tended to have more severe ADHD symptomatology and poorer reading ability. The results of this study provide some of the first evidence for abnormal hemispheric activation patterns and perceptual decision-making processes in ADHD during the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> visuospatial task. These findings advance the knowledge in the field of ADHD towards the identification of objective biomarkers for the disorder that may aid clinical decision-making and result in more reliable diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Leasing {{provides}} <b>a</b> significant source <b>of</b> finance across UK firms. Historically, its use {{has been}} attributed to favourable tax treatment and 'off-balance sheet' accounting, both of which have been eroded over time. The present day determinants of leasing have received limited investigation, and prior research has focused on the use of finance leases in isolation from overall corporate financing decisions. This seems inappropriate given the predominant and prolific use of operating leases (Beattie, Edwards and Goodacre, 1998), and evidence to suggest that lease and debt finance appear to be at least partial substitutes (Beattie, Goodacre and Thomson, 2000). Further, proposals issued by the Accounting Standards Board in late 1999 look set to essentially remove the current 'off-balance sheet' accounting treatment of operating leases. If accounting treatment is in any way responsible for the current use of operating leases, these proposals are likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the future role of leasing. In response, the present study. investigated both the current role of leasing in the wider context of corporate financing decisions, and its future role in light of the new proposals for lease accounting. Two separate surveys of UK quoted industrial companies were undertaken to investigate corporate financing and leasing decisions and views and opinions on lease accounting reform. Findings are based on <b>a</b> response <b>of</b> 23 % (198 completed questionnaires) and 19 % (91 completed questionnaires) respectively. OLS regression analysis was also employed for <b>a</b> sample <b>of</b> 159 UK quoted industrial companies, to establish the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> 'offbalance sheet' <b>advantage</b> to operating leases from a market perspective. Findings suggest that UK firms appear more likely to follow Myers' (1984) suggestion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modified pecking order of capital structure when determining their debt, including leasing, levels. Investment nd dividend payout dictate the need for external finance, and debt including leasing is internally rather than externally constrained. On average, internal reserves followed by straight debt appear preferable to leasing. However, the benefits and costs associated with all sources of finance are likely to be considered when additional finance is required. Although tax and 'off-balance sheet' advantages to leasing remain, they do not appear to dominate the leasing decision in the current climate. Avoiding large capital outlay and cash flow considerations appear of paramount importance in the decision to lease all asset types. Findings suggest that the preference for leasing over other forms of debt is not anticipated to change in response to the new proposals for lease accounting. However, the new approach may not be without consequence. Where possible, financial statement preparers are likely to take reactionary steps to minimise balance sheet obligations. At the very least, this could involve exercising any opportunity to manipulate the new accounting treatment. It may extend to reduced investment and a decline in levels of debt financing, including leasing. Although operating lease obligations appear to be currently taken into account in the UK market's assessment of equity risk, the accuracy with which they are taken into account remains unclear. Therefore, the revaluation of securities in the wake of the new proposals becoming mandatory is not beyond the realms of possibility. The present study provides <b>a</b> holistic analysis <b>of</b> corporate financing and leasing decisions in UK firms. It provides a valuable contribution to the capital structure debate. It would seem inappropriate for future capital structure research to focus on proving alternative static trade-off and pecking order theories. Future research would benefit from <b>a</b> reconciliation <b>of</b> the two. The present study highlights the difficulties in analysing corporate financing and leasing decisions, by establishing that they are complex, multidimensional and essentially situation-specific. The present study also has important implications for policy makers. In addition to the potential economic consequences, findings appear to suggest that certain features of the new proposals fall short <b>of</b> developing into <b>a</b> high quality lease accounting standard. Further consideration by policy makers from alternative perspectives appears necessary. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
