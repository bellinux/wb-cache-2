25|$|Further {{expansion}} of the league followed in 1988, with another three teams based outside Sydney introduced to the competition; the Newcastle Knights and the first two Queensland teams, the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast-Tweed Giants. The Brisbane and Newcastle sides proved to be successful and popular and paved the way towards a push <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> national competition. This was attempted in 1995 with control of the premiership passing from the NSWRFL to the Australian Rugby League (ARL), who invited four more teams from outside NSW to participate in 1995. Ultimately this competition failed, but in its demise the National Rugby League was born, incorporating the traditional Sydney clubs, successfully coercing the Sydney market to follow the newly created national competition.|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} detriments towards the {{theoretical}} success of open source software, {{there are several}} {{factors that contribute to}} the lack of long-term success in open source projects. One of the most obvious drawback is that without pay or royalty licensing, there is little financial incentive for a programmer to become involved with a project in the first place, or to continue development and support once the initial product is released. This leads to innumerable examples of well-anticipated software being forever condemned to beta versions and unsupported early model products. With donations as the only source of income <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> open source (and GPL licensed) project, there is almost no certainty in the future of the project simply because of developer abandonment, making it a poor choice for any sort of application in which future versions, support and a long-term plan would be essential, as is the case for most business software.|$|E

500|$|John Shore (who went on {{to succeed}} Cornwallis as Governor-General) and Charles Grant, two men he came to trust implicitly, were the most {{important}} contributors to what is now called the Permanent Settlement. [...] The essence of the arrangement they came up with in the summer of 1789 was that the zamindars would effectively become hereditary landholders, paying the company tax based on the value of the land. [...] Shore and Cornwallis disagreed on the term of the scheme, with Shore arguing for a ten-year time limit on the arrangement, while Cornwallis argued <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> permanent scheme. Cornwallis prevailed, noting that many of the company's English revenue collectors, as well as others knowledgeable of company finance and taxation, supported permanency.

Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is a minor letdown; Shakira's voice is too like Beyoncé's <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> complementary tango".
