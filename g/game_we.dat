25|$|The {{most recent}} {{of the major}} types of board wargame, it {{was created by the}} <b>game</b> <b>We</b> the People {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1994. In most aspects it is much like a typical board wargame (on the simpler side of the spectrum), but play is driven by a deck of cards that both players draw from. These cards control activation points, which allow the use of troops, as well as events that represent things outside the normal scope of the game. Newer card driven games have helped reinvigorate the war game genre as well as other differently themed games.

500|$|Despite {{positive}} reactions, reviewers {{brought up}} several {{issues with the}} game. The British video game publication PC Gamer UK was unhappy with the game, claiming that Electronic Arts chose to release a formulaic game {{because it was a}} safer choice than taking The Battle for Middle-earth II in another direction. PC Zone agreed with this view, claiming that although the game looked impressive, it took a by-the-numbers approach towards the real-time strategy genre in a [...] "mindless sort of way", concluding that [...] "in no way is it anywhere near the <b>game</b> <b>we</b> hoped for." [...] The game's multiplayer portion disappointed GameSpy, which found it too unbalanced compared to the heroes, whom they considered to be too strong. Eurogamer considered the game to be of average quality, noting that there were no truly redeeming qualities.|$|E

However, such a strategy can sometimes lead to a Pareto-dominated outcome for the repeated game. Our goal is to design learning strategies that converge to a Pareto-efficient outcome that also produces a Nash Equilibrium payoff for repeated two player n-action general-sum <b>games.</b> <b>We</b> present a learning algorithm, POSNEL, which learns opponent’s preference structure and produces, under self-play, Nash equilibrium payoffs in the limit in all such <b>games.</b> <b>We</b> also show that such learning will generate Pareto-optimal payoffs in a large majority of <b>games.</b> <b>We</b> derive a probability bound for convergence to Nash Equilibrium payoff and experimentally demonstrate convergence to Pareto optimality for all structurally distinct 2 -player 2 -action conflict <b>games.</b> <b>We</b> also compare our algorithm with existing algorithms such as WOLF-IGA and JAL and showed that POSNEL on average, outperforms both the algorithms. 1...|$|R
