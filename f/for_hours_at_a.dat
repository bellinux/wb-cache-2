5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of}} time as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lahan {{was born}} in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst {{attending}} Leeds University. Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier {{in order to get}} back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn remembered that during their time, John would talk to him about Maya <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. However, after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael).|$|E

25|$|With seven {{separate}} shooting victims, {{including six}} deaths, {{in the first}} 15 hours of the D.C. area spree, the North American media soon devoted enormous coverage to the shootings. By the middle of October 2002, all news television networks provided {{live coverage of the}} aftermath of each attack, with the coverage often lasting <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. The Fox show America's Most Wanted devoted an entire episode to the shooters in hopes of aiding in their capture. Much of the coverage of the case in The New York Times was written by Jayson Blair and subsequently found to be fabricated; the ensuing scandal led the newspaper's two top editors, Howell Raines and Gerald Boyd, to resign.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and privations, Halberstam was {{a beacon of}} {{strength}} and hope for his fellow prisoners. When one died in the infirmary—hardly a noteworthy occurrence in those days—the Rebbe stood up and eulogized him for having been a great Torah scholar in Hungary. He refused to eat non-kosher food or food cooked in the non-kosher kitchen, subsisting only on bread and water during his nine months in Muldorf. Moreover, he would not eat the bread until he had ritually washed his hands, and would often wait for days to find some water for this purpose. One prisoner watched him stand beside the cement mixer <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, collecting the drops of water that dripped from the tank.|$|E
25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of World War II, Garfield {{immediately}} attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down because of his heart condition. Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort. He and actress Bette Davis were the driving forces behind {{the opening of the}} Hollywood Canteen, a club offering food and entertainment for American servicemen. He traveled overseas to help entertain the troops, made several bond selling tours and starred in a string of popular, patriotic films like Air Force, Destination Tokyo and Pride of the Marines (all box office successes). He was particularly proud of the last film, based on the life of Al Schmid, a war hero blinded in combat. In preparing for the role, Garfield lived for several weeks with Schmid and his wife in Philadelphia and would blindfold himself <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E
25|$|Market analysts had a mixed {{response}} to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch. Following the financially under-performing Wii U, analysts had expected that Nintendo would recognize their vulnerable position in the console market when developing their next console, believing that the company would find a means to draw back the core gamer market. Instead, initial promotion of the Switch appeared to appeal to an audience that fell between the core gamer and casual gamer markets, the latter being mobile game players who would want a more engaging experience but would {{not be willing to}} play <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, according to The New York Times. Analysts were unsure if such a market existed in large enough numbers to justify the Switch. Other concerns about the Switch's announcement were related to yet-to-be-confirmed details that could make or break the system, such as its retail price, whether the unit includes a touchscreen, the unit's battery life, and the type of games that development partners would bring to the console.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E
