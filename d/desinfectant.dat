Pathogenic microorganisms with resistance to various antimicrobial agents have risen over the last several years, resulting in increase in morbidity and mortality and overall treatment cost. In this regard, inorganic bactericides have attracted special interest due to their chemical stability, long life and heat resistance [3, 4]. Silver, known as a <b>desinfectant</b> for many years, has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Silver nanoparticles show efficient antimicrobial properties compared to other silver salts due to their extremely large surface area and low solubility, which provides better contact with micro-organisms.

It departs from other Cryptosporidiiae in its localization on the brush border of epithelial cells, without intracytoplasmic multiplication. The life cycle is direct, with merogonia, endogenous sporogonia and formation of gametes. Thin-walled oocysts maintain the endogenous cycle; thick-walled oocysts excreted {{into the environment}} infect other vertebrates. Cryptosporidium infects the intestinal epithelium of immunocompetent individuals. The pathogenesis is unknown; morphologic alterations {{and the existence of}} a toxin or moiety may induce fluid and electrolyte loss. Cryptosporidium invades epithelia of the respiratory tract and gall bladder inducing chronic and emaciating diarrhea and eneumonia in persons with an altered immune system. Most Cryptosporidium diarrheas olve within a few days; dehydration is rapidly corrected by oral or intravenous therapy with glucose-salt solution. There is no specific therapy against the parasite. The most severe manifestations are in non-breast-fed and prematurely weaned infants. Cryptosporidium investigated through two years of systematic study of acute diarrheas in Costa Rica showed a frequency of 3 %, but in the warm and humid months of the year the frequency was as high as 2564. The transmission of Cryptosporidium may involve domestic animals. Oocysts are resistant to laboratory <b>desinfectants</b> but are susceptible to freezing. Diagnosis consists in finding oocysts in feces by direct examination, or after fixation and staining with Ziehl-Neelsen or Giemsa.

30|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} E. coli O 157 :H 7 as {{a member}} of the enterohemorrhagic group of pathogenic bacteria frequently occurs as a foodborne and waterborne pathogen and is a major public health concern (Lee and Kang 2009). The present work devoted to the inactivation of the O 157 :H 7 strain of Escherichia coli showed that the treatment with electro-activated aqueous solutions of food grade organic salts is highly efficient under the conditions of the assay performed (Table  1). Moreover, the results showed that electro-activation of such solutions creates specific synergistic conditions with a stronger effect than conventional hurdle approaches used to ensure microbial food safety (Huang et al. 2008; Aider et al. 2012). Thus, it may be suggested that appropriate application of this treatment allows the reduction of 6 log CFU/ml of bacteria within 5  min contact time, especially when a combination treatment is used (Huang et al. 2008). Application of the organic acids in combination with different treatments like heat or salt has been commonly used to ensure the microbial safety of foods in many products. The combined treatment can result in additive results, such as additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects (Lee and Kang 2009). However, although the organic acids are effective against different pathogens, they are usually supplied in a concentrated form. Thus, they must be handled with care to ensure adequate safety of the employees. Moreover, acids in strong concentration from should be used with high precaution because they may have undesirable effects on the sensory quality of the food product. Thus, it seems to be preferable to use low concentration of organic acid solutions during the combination treatment (Choi et al. 2009; Luttrell 2012). The anolytes of OSS during the EA treatment acquire important changes in properties which are able to disturb the bacteria homeostasis and act synergistically with heat or other hurdles (Liato et al. 2015 b). On one hand, the growth of micro-organisms is mostly dependent on the medium acidity; namely the solution pH and its titratable acidity which is a measure of all free and bond hydrogen ions available to maintain a buffering capacity of acidic solution. Moreover, the balance of oxidizing and reducing agents may significantly affect the environmental conditions in which the bacteria are growing. This parameter called the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) of the solution is intensively studied and was used as effective parameter for microbial control and it is estimated as one of the crucial parameters for satisfactory biotic homeostasis (Lund and Wyatt 1984; Bagramyan et al. 2000). The creation of the adverse conditions through extreme values of the ORP requires the application of additional chemical agents which could be eliminated by using an electro-activation reactor (Aider et al. 2012). Moreover, the oxidative radicals generated by electro-activation is also considered as a source of the antimicrobial effect of electro-activated solutions. This particularity was successfully exploited for use forn food safety and in medicinal practice as preservative or <b>desinfectant</b> (Aider et al. 2012; Al-Haq and Gómez-López 2012; Gil et al. 2015). Related works on electro-activated solutions showed that the NaCl is the most utilised salt due to the generation of strong chlorine radicals (Liato et al. 2015 a). Its radical combinations resulting from electro-activation treatment were found to be more significant for microbial reduction in comparison with hydroxyl radicals (Hao et al. 2012). However hydroxyl radicals are the most reactive radicals and could be the principal starters of chlorine reactivity. Although this phenomenon creates adverse conditions for microorganisms growth, it could also be harmful for human. Thus, it is considered as undesirable agent for food preservation (Rico et al. 2007; Xiong et al. 2010). The oxygen species, pH and especially ORP are additional factors which influence the antimicrobial activity of EA solutions and explain the effectiveness of the electro-activation technology as strong desinfection tool (Kim et al. 2000; Liao et al. 2007). Thus, organic acids obtained by electro-activation of their conjugated salts, as inexpensive and environmentally friendly compounds, can be successfully used for food preservation.|$|E
40|$|L'étude a permis de suivre l'évolution des caractéristiques physico-chimiques et microbiologiques des eaux dans un réseau de {{distribution}} expérimental de taille industrielle, afin de comparer d'une part l'effet du chlore et de la monochloramine sur la biomasse présente dans le système à l'équilibre et d'autre part d'établir des relations quantitatives entre prolifération bactérienne, oxydant et matière organique biodégradable. Dès les premières heures de transit dans le réseau, une consommation des oxydants est constatée, avec toutefois une plus grande stabilité de la monochloramine (vitesse de consommation de 0, 05 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1 et 0, 02 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1 respectivement pour le chlore et la monochloramine). Même en présence d'un <b>désinfectant</b> résiduel, il est possible de noter une accumulation de bactéries-à ta surface des tuyaux de distribution (105 à 106 cellules. cm- 2, dont environ 1 % est cultivable sur gélose) qui augmente avec la diminution de concentration du <b>désinfectant</b> résiduel. Les relations logarithmiques entre densité cellulaire (phase eau ou biofilm) et oxydant résiduel montrent d'une part que pour inactiver totalement les bactéries en suspension dans l'eau il convient de maintenir une chloration en continu avec un résiduel constant supérieur ou égal à 0, 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 et, d'autre part que les chloramines sont au moins 2, 5 fois moins efficaces que le chlore, même vis-à-vis des bactéries fixées. La présence de matière organique biodégradable dans les eaux explique la prolifération des bactéries dans le système de distribution. Ainsi une concentration additionnelle de 100 µg. l- 1 de carbone organique dissous biodégradable (CODB) dans l'eau entrant dans le réseau de distribution occasionne en 24 heures et à 20 °C une augmentation du nombre de bactéries fixées (+ 7, 5. 105 cellules. cm- 2) ou en suspension (+ 4. 104 cellules. ml- 1) dans le réseau de distribution, à l'équilibre, déjà largement colonisé par des micro-organismes. Ainsi le contrôle de la fraction biodégradable de la matière organique apparaît toujours comme un objectif primordial. This {{study was}} carried out in order to evaluate the variations in the physicochemical characteristics of the water in an experimental distribution system. The primary objectives of the study were :- to compare the disinfectant efficiency of chlorine and monochloramine- to establish quantitative correlations among bacterial density, concentration of residual disinfectant, and concentration of biodegradable organic matter. The finished waters were obtained from a water treatment pilot plant characterized by : prechlorination (average treatment rate : 1. 4 mgCl 2 l- 1 and residual alter sand filtration : 0. 08 mgCl 2 l- 1), coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation (FeCl 3 treatment rate : 30 to 60 mg l- 1 adjusted to the raw water turbidity below 0. 3 NTU), sand filtration (filtration rate : 6 h- 1) and post-disinfection with chloramine (average treatment rate : 1. 8 mgCl 2 l- 1) or chloramine (average treatment rate : 1. 66 mgCl 2 l- 1). The concentrations of post-disinfectant used were chosen in order to maintain chlorine at 0. 2 to 0. 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 and monochloramine at 1 mgC 2 l- 1 after the first 24 hours residence time in the experimental distribution system. The experimental distribution system is composed of three parallel loops connected in series (31 m length, 100 mm diameter, cement lined cast iron, water velocity : 1 m s- 1). The configuration and operation of the system permitted a residence time of 24 hours in each loop (that is 72 hours for the whole system). Appropriate sample tap locations facilitated removal of bulk water samples. Special sampling parts also permitted sampling of cement coupons for determination of attached biofilm. The measured parameters were : residual oxidant (DPD method), DOC, BDOC (28 days of incubation at 28 °C with a bacterial inoculum), cell density in the bulk water phase (CFU ml- 1) and in the biofilm (CFU cm- 2) after 15 days of incubation at 20 - 22 °C. Total cells were enumerated using the epifluorescence direct count technique. For each experiment, all the sampling sequences were carried out on each of three days, after quasi steady-state was achieved in the system (4 to 6 weeks after starting each experiment). The data were analysed in order to characterize the treated and distributed waters; the results discussed here are based on the averages of the measured parameters tram the water samples and biofilm samples taken after the system achieved quasi steady-state. Characteristics of the treated watersThe treated waters were characterized by important variations at the DOC, BDOC and cell density. For example, the concentrations of DOC showed a seasonal variation ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 3 mg Cl- 1 in winter to 1. 6 to 2. 6 mg Cl- 1 in summer. The treated waters contained approximately the same concentrations of residual disinfectant, averaging 1. 6 mgCl 2 l- 1 for chlorine and 1. 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 for monochloramine. However, a significant difference cell density was found between the two post-disinfectants. Cell densities by the epifluorescence direct count technic were 1. 6 x 103 ml- 1 (0. 3 % of CFU ml- 1) with chlorine and 6. 3 x 104 ml- 1 (0. 03 % of CFU ml- 1) with monochloramine. The difference on cell density between the post-chlorination and the post-chloramination treatments has been observed systematically, and may be explained either as cellular lysis with chlorine or an interference when using epifluorescence counting for chlorinated waters. Characteristics of the distributed watersWhatever the season, depletion of oxidant (chlorine or monochloramine), and elimination of dissolved organic matter (DOC, BDOC) occured during the first hours of circulation of water in the distribution system. The net result was an increase in bacterial cell density. During the first hours of circulation of the waters in the distribution system, depletion of the disinfectant occured. Depletion was more rapid for chlorine (- 0. 05 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1) titan for monochloramine (- 0. 02 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1), winch is considered more stable titan chlorine. Even {{in the presence of a}} residual disinfectant in the distribution system, microorganisms are present in the water phase (104 to 106 cells ml- 1 by epifluorescence direct count; 1 % CFU ml- 1 after 15 days of incubation at 20 - 22 °C) and in the biofilm (105 to 106 cells cm- 2 by epifluorescence direct count; 1 % CFU ml- 1 after 15 days of incubation at 20 - 22 °C). The bacterial density increased white the disinfectant residual decreased. The apparent growth rate of the attached biomass (µfix) in loop 2 of the chlorinated distribution system (equivalent to 48 hours detention), was close to the µfix calculated for loop 2 of the chloraminated distribution system : the values were 0. 0043 h- 1 and 0. 005 h- 1 respectively. In addition, the change in the organic matter (expressed as DOC) occured in two steps :- a slight increase in DOC during the 24 first hours of residence time (loop 1), when increased residual disinfectant were present. - a bacterial consumption of DOC after 24 hours of residence time (loops 2 and 3), even in the presence of small concentrations of disinfectants. In loop 2 (48 hours residence time of the water in the system; chlorine : 0. 01 mgCl 2 l- 1, chloramine : 0. 3 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1), the rates of DOC elimination averaged 13 mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1 and 0. 42, mgCl 2 l- 1 h- 1, respectively in the chlorinated and chloraminated distribution systems. This decrease in DOC concentrations was related to the increase in bacterial density. Relationships between cell density, oxidant and organic matterLinear relationships between the concentration of residual oxidant (chlorine or monochloramine) and the cell density in the water phase or in the biofilm show that :- whichever oxidant was used, the pipe loop sections without residual disinfectants were characterized by about 5 x 106 attached cells per cm 2 (4 to 10 % were able to grow on agar medium in 15 days at 20 - 22 °C) and by 4 x 105 planktonic cells per ml (1 % CFU ml- 1);- consistently, in the sections of the system with a residual disinfectant, the bacteria (CFU and epilluorescence counting) in the water phase were more sensitive to the residual disinfectant (chlorine or monochloramine) than the bacteria attached to the pipe walls (biofilm). However, there was a difference in effectiveness between the two disinfectants; chlorine was more efficient in controlling planktonic bacteria and biofilm bacteria than was monochloramine. For example, to achieve complete inactivation of the planktonic bacteria (CFU ml- 1) a constant chlorine residual of 0. 5 mgCl 2 l- 1 was required throughout the whole distribution system, compared to 2. 5 times more chloramine to achieve the same efficiency. Finally, with equivalent concentrations of residual disinfectant, the microbiological quality of the chlorinated distribution waters was better than that of the chloraminated distribution waters. From loop to loop, linear relationships between ∆DOC and cell density pointed out that the presence of biodegradable organic matter can explain the bacterial proliferation in the distribution system. For example, a concentration of BDOC as low as 0. 1 mgC l- 1 resulted in an increase in the cell density : an additional accumulation of 7. 5 x 105 attached cells cm- 2 and 4 x 104 planktonic cells ml- 1 was observed in the experimental distribution system at quasi steady-state. Consequently, the control of the biodegradable organic carbon remains one of the prime objectives in order to achieve biologically stable distribution waters...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of Council Regulation (ECC) 2377 / 90, German {{agriculture}} has been se-verely affected by stringent restrictions concerning the use of medications in animals reared for human consumption. In commercial fish production, legal administration has been limited to a few <b>desinfectants</b> and antibiotic drugs. Currently, no permitted antiparasitic drug is available to treat fish stock threatened by endogenous parasites. After demonstrating the detrimental effects of fish-pathogenic parasites on commer-cial fish production by examining an exemplary fish-rearing facility, this paper contin-ues to investigate alternative, non chemical ways to effectively disrupt parasitic life cycles in an economic fashion. Using different diagnostic procedures, numerous parasite species are identified in a fish-rearing facility in Saxony. The trematode Bucephalus polymorphus is quickly found to be causing reoccurring fish-mortality in the aforementioned facility because of its high intensities in examined fish and invertebrate hosts. It can be shown that B. polymorphus is able to survive several years in its 1 st intermediate host, zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. Exposing different species of fish to cercariae of B. polymorphus demonstrates varying susceptibility rates among investigated spe-cies. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and several cyprinid species show high susceptibilities. The role of pike perch (Sander lucioperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) as final hosts of the infection is investigated. After feeding on infected fish, adult trematodes are detected in the digestive tract of all examined pike perch, whereas none of the perch receiving a similar diet can be diagnosed with a B. - polymorphus- infection. To develop a practical anti parasitic treatment of the facilities´ production water which is taken from a nearby reservoir, three non chemical water treatments are examined for their effectiveness against B. - polymorphus- cercariae in the laboratory. An impact resulting from pouring suspended cercariae from a height of 36 to 200 cm leads to injury and death of a proportion of exposed individuals. Exposure to ultra-sonic waves with specific energy inputs of 0, 0005 to 0, 001 kWh/ l results in cercarial mortalities ranging from 60 to 100 %. After being submitted to ultraviolet light at a dose of 1800 to 2850 J/ m 2, examined cercariae show slightly reduced activity. Field trials with carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss) demonstrate that ultrasonic treatment with a specific energy input of 0, 000652 kWh/ l {{as well as an}} exposure of production water to ultraviolet light at a dose of 58 J/ m 2 can potentially be used to reduce infections with B. polymorphus. The aforementioned findings are compared to additional potential treatment possibili-ties (ozonation, filtration, use of electric current and biological manipulation). All pro-cedures are then discussed concerning their sustainability, economic efficiency and ecological tolerability. Summarizing the individual treatments it is concluded that none can be unrestrictedly recommended to treat all of the production water in a cost-efficient and effective manner. Consequentially, periodic cleaning and disinfection are shown to still be the primary means to limit parasitic infections of commercial fish populations by reducing the number of host organisms in the fish's vicinity. Additionally, a time-limited water treatment of single production-subunits holding the most susceptible fish species us-ing UV- doses of > 400 J/ m 2 is recommended to treat waterborne parasitic stages {{at the time of their}} highest occurrence. UV-lamps are mobile, their use affects numer-ous parasitic stages and is comparatively cost-effective. The treatment facilities can be maintained by staff members. In case of a malfunction, only single subunits which can easily be sanitised are affected. Furthermore, the use of ultraviolet light involves low hazard risks and has no negative impact on water parameters. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidiosis {{represents}} {{a major public}} health problem. This infection, caused by protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium, has been reported worldwide as a frequent cause of diarrhoea, and its prevalence varies according to different regions. In developed countries, massive Cryptosporidium foodborne and waterborne outbreaks have been reported. In developing countries, Cryptosporidium affects mostly children under five. Furthermore, cryptosporidiosis remains a clinically significant opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, causing potentially life-threatening diarrhoea, especially in those HIV-infected persons. Additionally, these parasites not only infect humans, but also cause morbidity in farm animals. The parasite begins its life cycle as sporulated oocysts which enter the environment through the feces of the infected host. The infective oocysts reside in food and water. Most transmission occurs through recreational water use. Cryptosporidium has also entered drinking water supplies, causing major outbreaks in cities around the world. Infection occurs when the oocysts are ingested by a suitable host. Without medical prescription, Cryptosporidium detection is not done as a routine, and the observation of the morphology of the parasite {{is not enough to}} establish differences between species. For that reason molecular techniques have been developed to differentiate this parasite at the species and genotype levels, and several methods have been used to study and characterize different parasite strains. Because the knowledge about molecular epidemiology is important to the better understanding of the parasite infection, {{in the first part of}} this work we characterized the genetic variability of species and subspecies of Cryptosporidium in different regions: Venezuela, Francia, Haiti et Iran. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and its clinical and laboratory pattern in Venezuelan HIV-infected patients. At enrollment, they underwent thorough clinical history and physical examination and provided stool specimens for the identification of Cryptosporidium sp. and other parasites. Cryptosporidium sp. was identified in 15 %. This infection was strongly associated with acute and chronic diarrhea, weight loss, CD 4 + counts below 100 cells/mm 3, older age in patients with leukopenia, and more than 5 stools per day when CD 4 + counts were below 100 cells/mm 3. We characterized new stool specimens from Venezuelan HIV infected patients using nested PCR�RFLP and sequencing tools, based on the 18 S rRNA gene. Three species of Cryptosporidium were identified among these patients on the basis of the 18 S rDNA locus: C. hominis, C. parvum, and C. canis. In this study, five C. hominis samples were sub-genotyped with micro- and minisatellite markers. For four of them, the same combination of alleles was found. We studied too the population genetic structure of Cryptosporidium spp. in France and Haiti. In the two areas under study, clonality was predominant, even if some sub-populations exhibited panmixia. Clonal genotypes are considered to be stable in space and time and thus can provide efficient tools for the identification of infection sources or transmission routes. Then, in order to define efficient prevention and control strategies, biology and clinical features of genetically well-defined parasite populations have to be explored. Isolates of Cryptosporidium spp. from human and animal hosts in Iran were also characterized on the basis of both the 18 S rRNA gene and the Laxer locus. Three Cryptosporidium species, C. hominis, C. parvum, and C. meleagridis, were recognized, and zoonotically transmitted C. parvum was the predominant species found in humans. To contribute to the comprehension of the dynamics of infection and to investigate biological divergence between different populations of Cryptosporidium, culture tissue and animal models have been used. It has been difficult to find suitable models for cryptosporidiosis, as most mammalians are susceptible to infection only as newborns. However, some Cryptosporidium species can be propagated in either chemically or genetically immunosuppressed mice. Efforts are still needed to develop reproducible animal models allowing both the routine passage of different species and approaching unclear aspects of Cryptosporidium infection, especially in the pathophysiology field. In the second part of this work we developed a model using adult severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice inoculated with Cryptosporidium parvum or Cryptosporidium muris while treated or not with Dexamethasone (Dex) in order to investigate divergences in prepatent period, oocyst shedding or clinical and histopathological manifestations. C. muris-infected mice showed high levels of oocysts excretion, whatever the chemical immunosuppression status. Parasite infection was restricted to the stomach, and had a clear preferential colonization for fundic area in both groups. Among C. parvum-infected mice, Dex-treated SCID mice became chronic shedders. C. parvum-inoculated mice treated with Dex developed glandular cystic polyps with areas of intraepithelial neoplasia. To further characterize this Cryptosporidium induced neoplastic cell transformation, SCID mice treated with Dexamethasone were challenged with different doses of C. parvum oocysts, and euthanatized sequentially after infection for histological examination. Our previous results were confirmed, and it was also found that mice infected with higher inoculums experienced more severe infections. Additionally, neoplastic changes were observed not only in the caecum but also in the stomach and duodenum of some animals. Then, we developed different animal experiments to determine whether other strains of C. parvum or other Cryptosporidium species were able to propagate in our model of SCID mice treated with Dex and to induce the development of premalignant or malignant lesions. All fecal and histological specimens from infected mice treated or not with Dex were negative for either C. molnari, species found in fishes or C. hominis, species considered as anthroponotic. In fact, our results give insights about the genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium in different regions of the world and about the variable expression of the disease severity according to the infecting species. Furthermore, we have standardized a rodent reproducible model of chronic infection and for the first time we showed an association between Cryptosporidium infection and the induction of dysplasia in the gut of SCID miceLe genre Cryptosporidium (Apicomplexa : Alveolata) comprend des espèces qui infectent l'intestin d'un grand nombre de vertébrés (l'homme compris). Elles sont la cause de la cryptosporidiose, maladie opportuniste émergente avec un impact considérable chez le patient immunodéficient, notamment sidéen. Ces protistes infectent aussi des sujets immunocompétents dans toutes les latitudes, en déterminant des diarrhées en général autorésolutives. Les oocystes hébergeant les sporozoïtes infectants sont éliminés avec les selles des hôtes infectés, contaminent l'environnement, sont fréquemment véhiculés par les eaux où ils gardent leur pouvoir infectieux pendant longtemps, résistant aux <b>désinfectants</b> usuels. Par ailleurs, étant immédiatement infectieux après leur excrétion, ils peuvent être transmis directement par contact inter-humain. Sans prescription spécifique, rare dans les faits, la détection d'oocystes de Cryptosporidium n'est pas pratiquée lors de l'examen coproparasitaire conventionnel. De plus, la morphologie étant insuffisante à la distinction des espèces dans le genre, leur identification, qui fait appel à des méthodes moléculaires, est rarement pratiquée, notamment dans les pays en développement. Cependant, elle constitue le seul moyen de déterminer les sources, les voies et les mécanismes de l'infection, informations essentielles au développement de stratégies rationnelles de prévention. Pour toutes ces raisons, nous avons dans un premier temps cherché à caractériser la variabilité génétique des espèces et de sub-espèces de Cryptosporidium dans différentes régions : Venezuela, Francia, Haïti e Iran. Au Venezuela, chez les 397 patients avec un statut VIH/SIDA confirmé, notre étude a révélé que l'infection par Cryptosporidium est fréquente parmi les patients infectés par le VIH vivant à Caracas, que l'infection, dont la prévalence augmente avec l'âge, s'associe fréquemment à une diarrhée (plus de 5 selles par jour) et à une perte de poids, et qu'un taux de CD 4 + La seconde partie de ce travail décrit le développement d'un modèle murin immunodéprimé, représenté par des souris SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency), traitées par la dexaméthasone. Ce modèle, destiné à caractériser les isolats de Cryptosporidium spp sur le plan phénotypique, a révélé des divergences marquées entre C. parvum et C. muris. Les espèces C. hominis, spécifique de l'homme, et C. molnari, de poisson, ne se sont pas développées chez la souris SCID traitée ou pas par la déxaméthasone. L'étude histopathologique a confirmé la localisation gastrique (préférentiellement fundique) de C. muris. Les souris SCID sous dexaméthasone inoculées avec C. parvum ont développé des dysplasies iléo-caecales à partir du 35 ème jour post-inoculation. Chez les souris non traitées par la déxamethasone euthanasiées 57 jours après l'infection la parasitose était associée à un néoplasie intestinal de bas grade. Des néoplasies de haut grade ont été observés au niveau de l'estomac (souris sous déxaméthasone), principalement dans la zone antrale. Globalement, nos expériences ont montré que C. parvum induit des néoplasies intra-épithéliales de bas et de haut grade dans l'estomac, le duodénum, le caecum et autres régions du côlon. Un tiers de ces souris présentaient des lésions néoplasiques dans plus d'un type d'organe. Des approches immunohistochimiques et biochimiques complètent la caractérisation de ces lésions. Globalement, ce travail, qui rapporte un modèle expérimental hautement reproductible de cryptosporidiose, fournit des nouvelles informations sur la diversité génétique de Cryptosporidium dans plusieurs régions du monde et sur les différences biologiques entre espèces. En particulier, ce travail démontre pour la première fois la capacité de C. parvum à induire des processus néoplasique chez l'hôte. Cette découverte majeure accroît significativement l'intérêt scientifique des Cryptosporidium spp et suggère que l'impact de ces parasites en santé humaine et animale pourrait être beaucoup plus grand que ce qu'on cro...|$|R
