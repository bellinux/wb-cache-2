25|$|The up {{and down}} {{fluctuation}} of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the <b>heartbeat.</b> <b>Pulse</b> pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant. The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|E

It is, for sure, beautifully scored, not least when flashy passages spill out at once from the piano and the percussion or the high woodwinds. It speaks of excitement -- perhaps of the composer's excitement in returning to the scene of his early triumph and in finding a new sense of direction. It sounds as if it will, like the Piano Concerto, be the start of something." [...] The work was also praised by Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote, [...] "The orchestral writing is colorful and of exceptional beauty. The concerto is in sections meant to depict fire, water, earth and wind; and the elements are captured through delicate woodwind flickers, string washes and an ever-changing <b>heartbeat</b> <b>pulse</b> that ranges from a delicate fluttering to a delicious, deliberate plotz of brass and percussion. Though ever serious, spiritual and modernist, Lieberson is also a closet eclectic. And it is a unique quality of his music that traces of Broadway dance music in the last section of earth and wind can contribute to the work's ineffable feeling of mysticism and satisfaction." [...] Andrew Clements of The Guardian similarly lauded the [...] "resourceful solo writing" [...] and remarked, [...] "It's cast as a 25-minute set of loose-knit variations, rapt stillness and teeming energy." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMobile {{computing}} {{emerged in}} the market {{for the past few years}} to provide solution for various platforms that range from smart phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, server to virtual computing systems such as cloud computing. The design approach and development of solutions for mobile computing continues to evolve in fulfilling the needs of diverse applications that run on various platforms. Recently, a new framework was introduced to provide a unified approach to resolve Security, Trust and Privacy (STP) enhancement on these platforms. This new framework emerged to enable a better way of dealing with security, trust and privacy conflicting aspects in pervasive environment such as mobile computing. This framework will be useful for system architects, engineers, designers and developers that are still struggling to create a secure, trustworthy, and privacy preserved environment to create confidence amongst users to do business transactions and collaborations especially in a more challenging environment such as cloud computing. In this paper, we discuss and propose new Secure System Architecture for strengthening surveillance activities in Wide Area using a combination of Trusted Computing (TC) via mutual attestation process to ensure integrity of components of the system, and Surveillance System. We further propose using Intel AMT chip that will generate a <b>heartbeat</b> <b>pulse</b> and transmit the signal through network interface to detect any possible physical intrusion. A failure to provide this pulse within a given time frame will trigger an action by the trusted security system for further analysis such as thievery detection...|$|E

5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a <b>heartbeat</b> or <b>pulse,</b> it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} compute the pulse frequency, an {{accurate}} 1 -second time base must be provided as the master clock or <b>heartbeat.</b> The one <b>pulse</b> per second (1 PPS) signal from a GPS board is easy to obtain, as most OEM GPS boards provide this signal, which is accurate to ± 1 μS, making it an ideal time base for measuring {{the frequency of the}} magnetic sensor output signal. The master clock is implemented through an interrupt, with counter reset and transmission of frequency data as part of the interrupt service routine executed by the CPU (and thus not affecting the ability of the timing registers to count). Time and date information aligned to {{the leading edge of the}} 1 PPS signal is fed to the controlling microcontroller (MCU) module over a TTL serial link, and is encoded in industry-standard NMEA 0183 format (National Marine Electronics Association, 2002).

It is a 61 mm diameter by 19 mm thick disk containing an integrated receiver and antenna attached toa 5 m power/communication cable. The unit was configured to emit a 1 PPS pulse and the NMEA GPRMC sentence, thus providing the 1 Hz timing pulse and time stamps.

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances in wireless communications and physiological sensing allow miniature, lightweight, ultra-low power, intelligent monitoring devices, {{which can be}} integrated into a Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) for health monitoring. Physiological signals of humans such as <b>heartbeats,</b> temperature and <b>pulse</b> can be monitored from a distant location using tiny biomedical wireless sensors. Hence, it is highly essential to combine the ubiquitous computing with mobile health technology using wireless sensors and smart phones to monitor the well-being of chronic patients such as cardiac, Parkinson and epilepsy patients. Since physiological data of a patient are highly sensitive, maintaining its confidentiality is highly essential. Hence, security is a vital research issue in mobile health (mHealth) applications, especially if a patient has an embarrassing disease. In this paper a three tier security architecture for the mHealth application is proposed, in which light weight data confidentiality and authentication protocols are proposed to maintain the privacy of a patient. Moreover, considering the energy and hardware constraints of the wireless body sensors, low complexity data confidential and authentication schemes are designed. Performance evaluation of the proposed architecture shows that they can satisfy the energy and hardware limitations of the sensors and still can maintain the secure fabrics of the wireless body sensor networks. Besides, the proposed schemes can outperform in terms of energy consumption, memory usage and computation time over standard key establishment security scheme...|$|R

It was as if she wished not to present herself in port with the splashed eagerness of a young creature. We weren't numerous enough quite to elbow each other and yet weren't too few to support--with that familiarity and relief which figures and objects acquire on the great bare field of the ocean and under the great bright glass of the sky. I had never liked the sea so much before, indeed I had never liked it at all; but now I had a revelation of how in a midsummer mood it could please.

When it doesn't confer trouble it takes trouble away--takes away letters and telegrams and newspapers and visits and duties and efforts, all the complications, all the superfluities and superstitions that we have stuffed into our terrene life. The simple absence of the post, when the particular conditions enable you to enjoy the great fact by which it's produced, becomes in itself a positive bliss, and the clean boards of the deck turn to the stage of a play that amuses, the personal drama of the voyage, the movement and interaction, in the strong sea-light, of figures that end by representing something--something moreover of which the interest is never, even in its keenness, too great to suffer you to slumber. I at any rate dozed to excess, stretched on my rug with a French novel, and when I opened my eyes I generally saw Jasper Nettlepoint pass with the young woman confided to his mother's care on his arm. Somehow at these moments, between sleeping and waking, I inconsequently felt that my French novel had set them in motion. Perhaps this was because I had fallen into the trick, at the start, of regarding Grace Mavis almost as a married woman, which, as every one knows, is the necessary status of the heroine of such a work.

40|$|Time is a {{fundamental}} part of all biological processes. During {{the whole process of}} evolution, living cells and organisms had to adapt to cyclic variations in the environment. In particular, the light and temperature conditions varied with day and night and with the seasons. The cellular functions and behavior in organisms were regulated according to their daily needs and provision of optimal conditions for survival. Time functions in cells are of two kinds. One is the cyclic variation, where the same events come back with regular intervals. Thereby, cellular adaptation occurs in a cyclic manner. The second way is longitudinal time regulation. From conception on, the development of organs occur sequentially and strictly coordinated in time until a mature fetus is ready for delivery. The periods of gestation, infant, growth and maturity, as well as aging, are strictly regulated in all higher organisms. Total life span is also rather constant within each species, although there are differences of many fold between short-lived and long-lived species. Thus, all the different longitudinal time periods in the life within a species are strictly coordinated to each other and are in concordance with total life span. Time regulation in single cells occurs at shorter intervals, both with cyclic and noncyclic variations. The oscillations may be down to a few seconds or even parts of seconds, such as nerve <b>pulses.</b> <b>Heartbeat</b> in higher organisms usually occurs as a rhythm of about one second or less, respiratory rhythm is slower, while the rhythm of the blood pressure is according to day and night. As a result, many types of time regulation and adaptation are occurring simultaneously in the same organism. Until a few years ago, the study of such time keeping was largely confined to the observation of phenomena from the outside and with mainly a descriptive approach. This {{has been replaced by a}} deeper understanding of the underlying biology and regulatory mechanisms at the genetic level (for recent review see Koukkari and Sothern, 2006 b). This thesis deals with the hematopoietic system in mice and in men, a highly adaptable tissue with a high cell turnover and many different functions that cover all parts of the body. It is therefore no wonder that time keeping is an important part of the regulatory circuits. The main emphasis of this thesis is on the elucidation of local clock functions in cells of different stage of maturation, and discussion on how the molecular clock in bone marrow (BM) is unique compared to other tissues, as well as different between species...|$|R
