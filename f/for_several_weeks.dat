40|$|Nine {{members of}} the tetraâˆ’nâˆ’alkanoyloxy ellagic acid series, ranging from the octanoyl to hexadecanoyl were {{synthesized}} and studied by calorimetry and optical microscopy.

Of these the five members with the longest side chains exhibit in addition a monotropic optically isotropic, and consequently, a cubic mesophase. From miscibility studies it appears that this cubic phase, which we name CD, is different from other cubic mesophases previously identified in nonâˆ’chiral thermotropic mesogens. This monotropic CD mesophase can be maintained at room temperature in a metastable state <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>week...</b>|$|R
