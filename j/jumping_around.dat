5|$|Season five began airing on January 21, 2009, {{and ended}} on May 13, 2009, {{featuring}} seventeen episodes. A clip show recapping {{the first four}} seasons preceded the premiere. Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island, where the remaining survivors begin to erratically jump forward and backward through time, following the island being moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead up to Locke stopping the time jumps and leaving the Island. The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six {{and return to the}} island with Locke's dead body. The second part of the season starts after the time jumps end and the Oceanic Six return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316. The show continues to follow two time lines, both of which take place on the island. The first takes place in 1977 when the survivors who had been left behind are stranded after <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> in time. It is also where some of the Oceanic Six are transported during the return flight to the island. The second takes place in late 2007 after Flight 316 is forced to crash land on the island.|$|E

Smith enjoyed producing activewear {{so much that she}} decided to give up instructing and make it her full-time occupation. In 1989, the owner of the gym at which she worked offered her space for a studio above the gym, and also casual work as a receptionist if she needed extra money. She remembers the space as squalid, full of cockroach droppings that would be dislodged by the vibrations of people <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> in the building. Her mother lent her money to fund increasing production, and to help her with her rent and costs of living.|$|E

It was expected that Stoltenberg would contest the leader during the national congress of Labour in November 2002, and in January 2002 the two were supposed to say if they wanted role. On the 15th of January, Jagland collapsed in the parliament and {{was sent to the}} hospital. Later that evening, during live coverage by TV 2 Nyhetene, comedian Bård Tufte Johansen interrupted the live broadcast <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> in a chicken costume, cackling about media's treatment of Thorbjørn Jagland and mocking the media's double standards.

500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to {{a consent form}} and sign a document authorizing the abortion. [...] She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus. Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E

500|$|Unlike most productions, it {{was filmed}} in near {{sequential}} order, {{as stated by}} Lennon in 1964. Filming began on 2 March 1964 at Marylebone station in London (sometimes misidentified as Paddington). The Beatles had joined the actors' union, Equity, only that morning. The first week of filming was on a train travelling between London and Minehead. On 10 March, scenes with Ringo were shot at the Turk's Head pub in Twickenham, and over the following week various interior scenes were filmed at Twickenham Studios. From 23 to 30 March, filming moved to the Scala Theatre, and on 31 March, concert footage was shot there, although the group mimed to backing tracks. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment, which featured creative camera work and the band running and <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> in a field was shot on 23 April 1964 at Thornbury Playing Fields, Isleworth, Middlesex. The final scene was filmed the following day in West Ealing, London, where Ringo obligingly drops his coat over puddles for a lady to step on, {{only to discover that}} the final puddle is actually a large hole in the road.|$|E
500|$|Disasterpieces was {{recorded}} at the now defunct London Dockland Arena in England on February 16, 2002, {{it was one}} of the final dates on the band's European tour which was subsequently their final tour until 2004. The concert was shot with 26 different cameras under the direction of Matthew Amos and documents the show, backstage action and an in-store signing in Paris, France. In addition to operated cameras each band member had an individual camera which was attached to the side of their masks, apart from Mick Thomson whose camera was attached to the headstock of his guitar. The concept behind these cameras was to allow the viewer to see the show from the band member's point of view. However they did cause some discomfort and problems for some band members. Bassist Paul Gray removed his after four songs, explaining that [...] "they gave us this big [...] pack to wear around our waist. So when I was <b>jumping</b> <b>around,</b> the thing started sliding down my leg". Also during the song [...] "Spit It Out" [...] DJ Sid Wilson had his camera stolen when he was in the crowd, however it was returned at the end of the show, all of this is documented on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

500|$|Liu Kang's Fatality {{from the}} {{original}} game is the [...] "Shaolin Uppercut", in which he performs a butterfly kick (often mistaken for a cartwheel) on his opponent before hitting an uppercut that knocks them offscreen before landing. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, there were two versions; one where the victim explodes to pieces upon impact and the original, in which the opponent is torn to pieces upon falling to the ground. In another signature Fatality, he morphs into a large dragon, chomping the upper body of his opponent. This Fatality was turned into an Animality in Mortal Kombat 3 and back into a normal Fatality in Mortal Kombat 4. In the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of Mortal Kombat II, the dragon torches the opponent with fire instead. The series' composer and co-designer John Vogel noted it to be his favorite Fatality due to how much Liu Kang's appearance changes. Another famous Fatality of Liu Kang has him vanish and a Mortal Kombat arcade game machine drop down and crush his opponent. According to GameSpy's MK2011 walkthrough, Liu Kang [...] "inflicts better damage" [...] than Kung Lao [...] "by <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> like a lunatic and kicking {{the crap out of}} everything he sees." ...|$|E
500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins {{have been}} praised as [...] "responsible {{for some of}} the most {{striking}} and memorable video clips" [...] and for having [...] "approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums". |author=Greg Prato |work=Allmusic |accessdate=March 4, 2012}} MTV's 2001 anniversary special Testimony: 20Years of Rock on MTV credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, [...] "We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> and stuff." [...] The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake ("Cherub Rock"), Samuel Bayer ("Bullet with Butterfly Wings"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ("Rocket", [...] "1979", [...] "Tonight, Tonight", [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and [...] "Perfect"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, [...] "I know my [...] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler." [...] Videos like [...] "Today", [...] "Rocket", and [...] "1979" [...] dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for [...] "Thirty-Three", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.|$|E
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E
5000|$|Rumspringa is a Pennsylvania German noun meaning [...] "running around". It {{is derived}} from the verb rumspringen. It is closely related to the Standard German verb (he)rumspringen meaning [...] "to <b>jump</b> <b>around</b> or about". The Standard German term is a {{compound}} word of the adverb herum (around, about) and the verb springen ("to jump"). However, in Swiss German as in some other southern German dialects, springen — besides meaning [...] "to jump" [...] — also means [...] "to run". In modern Standard German [...] "to skip" [...] ordinarily would be translated with the verb hüpfen, which literally means [...] "to hop". This term/concept also is used as a separable verb, i.e., rumspringen (to <b>jump</b> <b>around)</b> / er springt rum (he <b>jumps</b> <b>around).</b>|$|R

2500|$|An {{influential}} guitar player, Bo Diddley developed many {{special effects}} and other innovations in tone and attack. His trademark instrument was his self-designed, one-of-a-kind, rectangular-bodied [...] "Twang Machine" [...] (referred to as [...] "cigar-box shaped" [...] by music promoter Dick Clark) built by Gretsch. He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made {{for him by}} other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the [...] "Cadillac" [...] and the rectangular [...] "Turbo 5-speed" [...] (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others). In a 2005 interview on JJJ radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while <b>jumping</b> <b>around</b> on stage with a Gibson L5 guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin.

2500|$|Hunter's {{entry into}} the music {{business}} came after a chance encounter with Colin York and Colin Broom at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, where the trio won a talent competition performing [...] "Blue Moon" [...] on acoustic guitars. York and Broom were members of a Northampton-based band called The Apex Group, fronted by bass player and band leader Frank Short. Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to British Timken in Northampton, and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar.
