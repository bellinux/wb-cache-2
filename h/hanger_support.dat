The present paper is related to steam piping layout between Boiler outlet & Turbine inlet i. e. main steam line. The steam piping layout directly impacts the drop in pressure of the steam. The ideal condition is that the pressure require at turbine inlet should be equal to boiler super heater out let pressure. But due to various factors there is 7 to 9 Kg/cm 2 pressure drop. By changing the steam piping layout pressure drop can be minimized. The slight change in pressure drop result less power require to increase the pressure of steam (i. e.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of using the guided wave non-destructive testing technique for power plant applications. Guided waves are already used extensively in the petrochemical industry, however the nature of pipework in a power station has meant that guided waves have not been studied for use in this environment. Power station pipework is more challenging to inspect than petrochemical pipework using guided waves because the pipelines tend to be shorter, and the feature density is much higher, with welds, <b>hangers,</b> <b>supports</b> and bends all contributing to make analysis of results more difficult. A particular focus of the study was detecting axially aligned defects in pipes, a problem that emerged in the UK coal power station fleet in 2006. Guided waves provided a desirable inspection technique because large volumes of pipework can be screened quickly, this being particularly advantageous due to the high volume of pipework that requires inspection. Two guided wave approaches to detecting axial cracks in pipes were pursued. Long- range guided waves were initially examined as they are able to examine large quantities of pipework in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, long-range guided waves are sensitive to the change in cross-sectional-area of a pipe, and axially aligned defects produce only a very small change in cross-section. Therefore long-range guided waves were not sensitive enough to detect a critically sized axial crack. The sensitivity of long- range guided waves was improved using a synthetic focusing algorithm, although this was still insufficient to detect a critically sized defect. The second guided wave approach was to utilise circumferential guided waves to detect axial cracks in pipes. Although many of the advantages of long-range guided waves are lost, using circumferential guided waves is much faster than an alternative manual ultrasonic inspection. The results of circumferential guided wave experiments suggest that they would be capable of detecting a critically sized axial crack in a pipe. Besides attempting to detect axial cracks guided waves have been tested on a small number of other power station pipework systems. These systems were tested as a way to examine the viability of using guided waves as a general inspection tool at a power station. Although guided waves are not suitable for every application, there are a good number of potential applications due to the wide variety of pipework systems at a power station.

To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, pipe <b>support</b> <b>hangers,</b> piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of structural materials and sensor technology has impacted the bridge industry by improving the robustness {{of the highway}} network and providing behavior based condition assessments. During the last decades, conventional materials have been supplemented with state-of-the-art materials (e. g., carbon and fiber based, ultra-high performance concrete, etc.). The {{evolution of}} smart or intelligent structures by incorporating systems to quantify performance will continue to revolutionize the bridge industry. While laboratory and field applications have indicated that smart materials are appropriate for bridge applications, additional investigations regarding sensor installation, deployment and data reduction are still needed. The work described herein {{is a collection of}} field and laboratory tests in which sensors were applied to verify structural and material behavior and develop smart members for integration as part of a structural health monitoring system for bridge superstructures. Three projects are presented in which new materials and unique structures were evaluated using specialized sensors and monitoring techniques. Two basket-handle arch pedestrian bridges with high-strength steel <b>hanger</b> rods <b>supporting</b> a pre-cast, post-tensioned concrete panel deck system were monitored to prevent deck cracks {{in the vicinity of the}} hanger rods. Fiber optic sensors and externally mounted accelerometers were attached to the hanger rods to indirectly determine the tensile forces during incremental construction stages and in service conditions. For the second project, a three-span prestressed concrete (PC) girder, composite deck bridge was monitored and evaluated. One end span consisted of composite FRP deck panels and was compared to the opposite cast-in-place reinforced concrete deck end span. Strategically placed transducers measured strain levels on the PC girders and the FRR panels from controlled live and ambient traffic loadings to determine the degree of composite action, load distribution, and maximum in-service strains. A FRP panel temporary bypass bridge was evaluated as a replacement to typical steel temporary bridges as part of the third project. The research focused on the design, fabrication, construction and load testing of this state-of-the-art bridge. This bridge was instrumented with transducers for measuring deflections and loaded with a static truck at pertinent locations to evaluate its performance. A five year research plan was established to develop a conceptual smart timber bridge made of glued laminated (glulam) stringers and a transverse glulam deck. Both stock and custom fiber optic sensor packages were implemented to quantify the structural response. The first of multiple phases of this national five year plan includes the development of an efficient structural health monitoring system and a smart timber bridge field demonstration. To support these goals, two types of FBG sensors packages were developed, the first evaluated the structural strain response and the second isolated the sensor from mechanical strain for detecting deterioration parameters (e. g., moisture content, corrosion, wood deterioration, etc.). Techniques were developed for embedding and attaching the FBG sensor packages to glulam specimens. Small scale specimens were instrumented with the custom FBG sensor packages and tested under a range of temperature and loading conditions to determine sensor viability. A full scale glulam beam was instrumented with similar FBG sensor packages to demonstrate applicability and evaluate performance at service level proportions. From this work, the following contributions in structural bridge monitoring were added to the state-of-the-art: *	Application of FBG sensors and accelerometers to monitor the structural behavior of a bridge during construction. *	Applied testing of non-traditional FRP deck panels to validate composite action. *	Initial development of a smart timber bridge structural health monitoring system. *	Development of FBG sensor packages for implementation in glulam members as part of a smart timber bridge...|$|R
