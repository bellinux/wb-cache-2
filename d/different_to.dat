5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no <b>different</b> <b>to</b> humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was <b>different</b> <b>to</b> his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very <b>different</b> <b>to</b> his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner. Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E

5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call <b>different</b> <b>to</b> subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E

5|$|Tenebraes {{score is}} very <b>different</b> <b>to</b> those the band had {{produced}} for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, {{and he decided}} on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae. Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So {{it would not be}} difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX digital drum, a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Roland MC-4 music sequencer. Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.|$|E
5|$|The absolutist {{restoration}} in Spain and {{the growing}} influence of Artigas generated a political crisis in Buenos Aires, forcing Posadas to resign. Alvear became the new Supreme Director, but had to resign after three months. San Martín's plan was complicated as well by the Disaster of Rancagua, a royalist victory that restored absolutism in Chile, ending the Patria Vieja period. San Martín initially proposed a regular-sized army, simply to reinforce Chile, but changed to propose a larger one, to liberate the country from the occupation. Chileans Bernardo O'Higgins, José Miguel Carrera, Luis Carrera and Manuel Rodríguez, {{the leaders of the}} deposed Chilean rule, sought refugee in Cuyo, along with their armies. O'Higgins and Rodríguez were well received, but the Carrera brothers intended to act as a government in exile. They ignored the local laws of Cuyo, and their soldiers committed acts of vandalism. San Martín imprisoned them and sent them to Buenos Aires. They proposed a plan to liberate Chile, <b>different</b> <b>to</b> the one outlined by San Martín, who rejected it as impractical. This initiated a rivalry between the Carrera and San Martín.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit <b>different</b> <b>to</b> the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

5|$|The {{design was}} rather <b>different</b> <b>to</b> von Haschenperg's first castle. The keep and the stirrup towers {{were raised in}} height, {{the level of the}} floors elevated, the curtain wall was strengthened, the old bastions entirely removed and four new, larger bastions added in their place, while the older foreworks around the castle were demolished. The keep's flat roof was altered to a pitched design, and the guns that it had {{supported}} moved into the outlying bastions. Although the size of the castle had slightly decreased, the new design had much more domestic space available for the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{headquarters}} of the Religious Society of Friends, {{better known as the}} Quakers, is at Friends House, No.173 Euston Road. It was built between 1925–7 and holds the society's library dating back to 1673, including George Fox's journal covering the foundation of Pennsylvania. Euston Road School was opened at No.314 in 1934 by William Coldstream, Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers to encourage artwork in an atmosphere <b>different</b> <b>to</b> traditional art schools. The school struggled and closed by the start of World War II. It was demolished in the early 1960s; the cover shot of the Beatles' Twist and Shout EP was taken on its remains after demolition.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater was {{classified}} in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011. Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic. While five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, studies using the mitochondrial DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most {{closely related to the}} black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus Caligavis. The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently <b>different</b> <b>to</b> be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.|$|E

The British Mission to the Manhattan Project ended when he departed.|$|E
5|$|Work for {{the actors}} began in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles {{was recorded in}} studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they found their performances no <b>different</b> <b>to</b> film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted such {{that they could not}} ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with directorial approval. To prepare for his role as Michael, Luke gained 25 pounds and studied Rockstar's previous games, starting with Grand Theft Auto IV. He considered Michael's characterisation to be an amalgamation of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal of Ward Cleaver in the American sitcom Leave It to Beaver (1957–63) and Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana in the 1983 film Scarface.|$|E
