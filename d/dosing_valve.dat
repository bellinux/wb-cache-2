40|$|Residual gas {{scintillation}} is {{used for}} measuring profile of the proton beam circulating in the COSY synchrotron. The problem of low rate of scintillation events detected by a multichannel photomultiplier is coped with by injecting small amounts of pure nitrogen into the vacuum chamber of the Scintillation Profile Monitor (SPM). This leads to a temporary local pressure bump {{of no more than}} an order of magnitude. A commercially available piezoelectric <b>dosing</b> <b>valve</b> allows good control over the amplitude and duration of the pressure bump. Since the average pressure in the machine is hardly changed, the method is fully compatible with experiment operation. This approach offers a robust and inexpensive way to measure the beam profile.

40|$|Microfluidic {{analysis}} {{systems are}} becoming an important {{technology in the}} field of analytical chemistry. An expanding area is concerned with the control of fluids and species in microchannels by means of an electric field. This paper discusses a new class of Si-compatible porous oxide interconnects for gateable transport of ions. The integration of such thin oxide films in microfluidics devices has been hampered in the past by the compatibility of oxides with silicon technology. A general fabrication method is given for the manufacture of silicon microsieve support structures by micromachining, on which a thin oxide layer is deposited by the spin-coating method. The deposition method was used for constructing -alumina, MCM- 48 silica, and amorphous titania films on the support structures, from both water-based and solvent-based oxide sols. The final structures can be applied as microporous and mesoporous interconnecting walls between two microchannels. It is demonstrated that the oxide interconnects can be operated as ion-selective electrophoretic gates. The interconnects suppress Fick diffusion of both charged and uncharged species, {{so that they can be}} utilized as ionic gates with complete external control over the transport rates of anionic and cationic species, thus realizing the possibility for implementation of these Si-compatible oxide interconnects in microchip analyses for use as <b>dosing</b> <b>valves</b> or sensors...|$|R

40|$|Determination of {{hydrogen}} in solids {{such as high}} strength steels or other metals in the ppb or ppm range requires hot-extraction or melt-extraction. Calibration of commercially available hydrogen analysers is performed either by certified reference materials CRMs, often having limited availability and reliability or by gas dosing for which the determined value significantly depends on atmospheric pressure {{and the construction of}} the gas <b>dosing</b> <b>valve.</b> The sharp and sudden appearance of very high gas concentrations from gas dosing is very different from real effusion transients and is therefore another source of errors. To overcome these limitations, an electrochemical calibration method for hydrogen analysers was developed and employed in this work. Exactly quantifiable, faradaic amounts {{of hydrogen}} can be produced in an electrochemical reaction and detected by the hydrogen analyser. The amount of hydrogen is exactly known from the transferred charge in the reaction following Faradays law; and the current time program determines the apparent hydrogen effusion transient. Random effusion transient shaping becomes possible to fully comply with real samples. Evolution time and current were varied for determining a quantitative relationship. The device was used to produce either diprotium (H- 2) or dideuterium (D- 2) from the corresponding electrolytes. The functional principle is electrochemical in nature and thus an automation is straightforward, can be easily implemented at an affordable price of 1 - 5 % of the hydrogen analysers price.

40|$|Purpose. The {{creation}} of supersaturation transiently after application overcomes {{the issue of}} drug instability. However, if the solvents used to drive supersaturation evaporate too quickly, drug recrystallisation or rapid film drying can occur which will inhibit drug release. As such {{the effects of a}} residual solvent, poly(ethylene glycol) 400 (PEG), on the release, mobility and supersaturation kinetics of a transiently supersaturated formulation were studied. Materials and Methods. Metered dose aerosol (MDA) formulations consisting of hydrofluoroalkane 134 a, ethanol, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K 90, beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), and 0 %, 5 % or 10 % w/w PEG were prepared in canisters sealed with metered <b>dose</b> <b>valves</b> and tested for release and adhesion over time. Results. The addition of 10 % PEG to the MDA formulation resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0. 05) in steady state drug release rate (230. 4 +/- 17. 3 mu g/cm(2) /h for 0 % PEG MDA, 83. 6 +/- 4. 9 mu g/cm(2) /h for 10 % PEG MDA). The presence of PEG caused a delay in dose depletion (2 h for 0 % PEG MDA versus 4 h for 10 % PEG), retarded supersaturation kinetics and increased film drying time. Conclusion. Whilst equivalent amounts of BDP were released, the residual solvent altered the drug release profile to achieve more constant delivery...|$|R

The studies on MDI revealed that the 15 % of overdoses are required for effective valve delivery and 20 % overages are required for 100 % drug delivery. 5 - 10 %v/v alcohol was found to be preferable to get optimum emitted dose and fine particle fraction...|$|R

40|$|In a {{randomized}} double-blind cross-over study on 20 spontaneously breathing, oxygen-dependent preterm infants {{who had received}} positive pressure ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} one-way non-rebreathing valves of aerosol spacer devices might impair rather than enhance the delivery of aerosols to small infants by metered dose inhalers (MDI). Ten infants were given 2 doses (200 mu g/dose) of MDI albuterol through a neonatal Aerochamber(R) 4 h apart. At tandem sequence, one dose was delivered with the non-rebreathing Valve of the Aerochamber(R) place; for the other <b>dose,</b> the <b>valve</b> had been removed. The experiment was repeated on another ten infants using a different spacer device (Babyhaler(R)) with or without its one-way inspiratory valve removed. During the first hour following aerosol administration, use of the non-valved spacers was associated with a significantly greater degree of tachycardia in both groups, and also lower transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension in the Aerochamber(R) group. All infants showed a reduction in respiratory system resistance and an improvement in functional residual capacity following albuterol treatment. In both groups, maximum reduction in respiratory system resistance, recorded 30 min after aerosol delivery, was significantly greater following the use of the non-valved spacers (Aerochamber(R) : 51. 2 +/- 3. 1 % vs. 35. 0 +/- 2. 8 %, P < 0. 0001; Babyhaler(R) 38. 8 +/- 2. 3 % vs. 19. 2 +/- 1. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) than following the use of the spacers with a valve. The findings provide indirect evidence supporting our hypothesis and suggest that when the MDI is used to deliver therapeutic aerosols to non-ventilated newborns or small infants, a spacer device without a non-rebreathing valve should be used.

40|$|A {{spool valve}} as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the spool valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the spool. To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the spool. Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the spool. The motion of the spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the spool <b>valve</b> <b>dose</b> not exist at present.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{consequences}} of climate change is the increase of ultraviolet radiation, especially UVB (280 - 315 nm). This has important consequences for organisms and ecosystems. In surface freshwater ecosystems with transparent water, UV can easily penetrate deeply. Here, we used three different experimental approaches to examine the response of non-marine ostracods and cladocerans to UVB radiation: estimating lethal doses, determining how much UVB is blocked by the valves, and analysing valve chemical compositions. For most investigated crustaceans, we found {{a strong correlation between}} the amount of UVB that is blocked by the valves and the lethal UVB <b>doses.</b> Most ostracod <b>valves</b> blocked between 60 % and 80 % of UVB radiation, thus providing effective shielding.

In the waterflea Daphnia magna, valves only stopped ca 35 % of UVB radiation, and the lethal dose was half that of the doses estimated for ostracods. Since {{there were no significant differences}} in chemical composition of the valves between the investigated species, other factors must be responsible for the observed differences, which remain to be identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} and dosing of aquatic organisms, such as corals and mollusks, {{are essential for}} ecotoxicology studies, yet {{it is difficult to}} maintain many of these sensitive organisms for an extended period. Consequently, many previous aquatic ecotoxicology experiments have been limited in their number of replicates and maintained in one or a few experimental aquaria, with {{only a limited number of}} stressors tested in each experiment. Here we describe a modular system that overcomes many of the difficulties of maintaining large numbers of sensitive aquatic organisms in separate containers, and allows testing of a large suite of stressors in each experiment. The AADAMS (aquatic automated dosing and maintenance system) allows testing of 40 independent stressors with 10 independent replicates per stressor (400 individuals total).

The fuel {{injector}} acts a double role: {{it is the}} valve of the pump supplying fuel to the combustion chamber and the device spraying a supplied <b>dose.</b> As the <b>valve</b> it may operate as a self-opening or self-closing valve, depending on the pressure produced by the fuel pump, or the valve controlled by external signals.

40|$|Background: Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (HL) {{survivors are}} {{at increased risk}} for developing valvular heart disease (VHD). We evaluated the determinants of the risk and the radiation dose-response. Methods: A case-control study was nested in a cohort of 1852 five-year HL survivors diagnosed at ages 15 to 41 Â years and treated between 1965 and 1995. Case patients had VHD of at least moderate severity as their first cardiovascular diagnosis following HL treatment. Control patients were matched to case patients for age, gender, and HL diagnosis date. Treatment and follow-up data were abstracted from medical records. Radiation <b>doses</b> to heart <b>valves</b> were estimated by reconstruction of individual treatments on representative computed tomography datasets. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Eighty-nine case patients with VHD were identified (66 severe or life-threatening) and 200 control patients. Aortic (nÂ =Â  63) and mitral valves (nÂ =Â  42) were most frequently affected. Risks increased more than linearly with radiation dose. For doses to the affected valve(s) of {{less than or equal to}} 30, 31 â 35, 36 â 40, and more than 40 Gy, VHD rates increased by factors of 1. 4, 3. 1, 5. 4, and 11. 8, respectively (Ptrend <. 001). Approximate 30 -year cumulative risks were 3. 0 %, 6. 4 %, 9. 3 %, and 12. 4 % for the same dose categories. VHD rate increased with splenectomy by a factor of 2. 3 (PÂ =Â . 02). Conclusions: Radiation dose to the heart valves can increase the risk for clinically significant VHD, especially at doses above 30 Gy.

40|$|Introduction: Some cancer {{survivors}} {{are known to}} have an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. An important cause of this elevated risk is recognised to be irradiation of normal tissues during radiotherapy received as part of cancer therapy. There are substantial difficulties in studying radiation-related cardiovascular disease (RRCD). The reasons for this include the complexities of measuring radiation normal tissue doses retrospectively and the prolonged latencies of many of the cardiovascular endpoints. A variety of complimentary research methodologies can help provide additional knowledge to guide the appropriate management of patients treated in the past and of new patients in the future. Methods: 1) A cohort study of mortality from circulatory disease in the nationwide British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS). 2) A case-control study of valvular heart disease (VHD) in Dutch Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors, including retrospective radiation dosimetry to estimate the radiation <b>dose</b> to heart <b>valves.</b> 3) A dosimetric study of cardiovascular radiation doses in patients entered into the UK NCRI Lymphoma Study Group RAPID trial, including predictions of 15 -year cardiac mortality using innovative methods. 4) A modelling study to predict mean whole heart dose (MWHD) from involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) for HL using anatomical measures. 5) A prospective study using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to characterise the heart in women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. Results: 1) The risks of all types of circulatory mortality are elevated in survivors of childhood cancer. The absolute excess risks continue to increase 40 + years following diagnosis. The risk of death from cardiomyopathy and heart failure increased substantially with the introduction of anthracycline chemotherapy. There is no evidence of a reduction in risk of circulatory mortality in more recent eras of diagnosis. 2) There is a strong relationship between estimated radiation dose to the affected heart valve and the risk of subsequent VHD (p Conclusions: Using a variety of methods these studies have all succeeded in adding to knowledge about the nature, magnitude and timing of RRCD.

40|$|A low {{pressure}} reactor (Knudsen cell) coupled to molecular beam modulated mass spectrometry {{was used to}} study the heterogeneous kinetics of the following three systems: (1) NO 2 on amorphous carbon, (2) H 2 O vapor on ice and (3) gaseous HCl on ice. The first system was investigated at ambient temperature while the two last ones were investigated at temperatures typical of the stratosphere, that is roughly between 160 and 220 K. The solid phase samples correspond to model surfaces whose physicochemical properties come {{very close to the}} ones of atmospheric particulates. Firstly, we studied the interaction of gaseous NO 2 with three different commercial samples of amorphous carbon having widely differing physicochemical properties. Using in situ laser-induced fluorescence, the only major product was unambiguously determined to be NO with the oxidation product of carbon apparently remaining on the surface. Probing the gas phase with mass spectrometry (MS), both pulsed <b>valve</b> <b>dosing</b> and steady state experiments were performed and revealed a complex reaction mechanism for both the uptake as well as product formation. The initial uptake coefficient γo for NO 2 was (6. 4 ± 2. 0) · 10 - 2 and proved to be identical within experimental uncertainty for all three types of amorphous carbon. The initial NO 2 uptake rate was independent of the mass of the carbon sample and scaled with its external geometrical surface. Applying a simple chemical kinetic model to both pulsed dosing and steady state experiments resulted in an effective surface for uptake on amorphous carbon ranging between a factor of 2. 8 to 8. 4 larger than the geometrical surface area, but inversely proportional to the measured BET surface area of the three types of amorphous carbon. This means that the amorphous carbon with the highest BET surface (FW 2) had the lowest external surface for NO 2 adsorption. The chemical kinetic model included competing processes between Langmuir-type adsorption and inhibition controlling the adsorption kinetics of NO 2 and revealed that the NO generation rate differed greatly between the three carbon samples examined. All samples showed saturation effects of differing degree that were partially reversible through prolonged pumping at 10 - 4 Torr and/or heating. Virgin amorphous carbon samples did not take up H 2 O vapor at 20 mTorr, and no HONO and/or HNO 3 was detected in simultaneous NO 2 /H 2 O exposure experiments. CO and CO 2 were detected when a sample previously exposed to NO 2 was heated by an incandescent lamp. Moreover, upon heating such a sample, a MS signal m/e 62 originating from NO 3 and/or N 2 O 5 was detected. In addition to the experiments conducted on the three commercial carbon samples, we carried out uptake experiments of NO 2 on acetylene soot. Originating from the flame of an acetylene burner, this soot was freshly deposited on glass dishes before each experiment. The initial uptake coefficient γo for NO 2 was measured to be (3. 0 ± 1. 1) · 10 - 2 is smaller by a factor of two compared to γo observed in the uptake on commercial samples whose mass was a factor of 10 higher. In addition to NO, a net formation of HONO (m/e 47) was observed. This HONO formation is strongly dependent on the instantaneous water desorption from the sample {{as well as on the}} NO 2 partial pressure in the reactor. On the other hand, it is not enhanced by an external water flow which did not show any interaction with the carbon sample. Upon heating the sample using an incandescent lamp, significant amounts of water desorbed, suggesting that the water vapor had condensed into the micropores of the soot during combustion. No quantitative results are presented yet. However, as no correlation between HONO formation and NO partial pressure has been observed so far, we suggest a reaction mechanism that only involves NO 2 and H 2 O but no NO: 2 NO 2 (g) + H 2 O HONO + HNO 3 In a second study, the kinetics of condensation and evaporation of water on ice was determined in the temperature range of 170 to 220 K. The rate of evaporation Fev corresponds to the evaporation of 70 ± 10 monolayers of H 2 O per second at 200 K. The condensation rate constant kc has a negative activation energy of - 3. l± 1. 5 kcal/mol which is significantly larger than the one recently measured by Haynes et al. We report the first real time kinetic measurements of water condensation on ice at stratospherically relevant temperatures. At temperatures above 160 K, pulsed dosing experiments show a dose dependence of the condensation rate coefficient. For example, the condensation rate coefficient increases by a factor of five with a 1000 fold increase of the H 2 O dose from 1 · 1015 to 1 · 1018 molecules per pulse at 180 K. This pressure dependence of the condensation rate constant may be explained by an autocatalytic mechanism involving the competition of two condensation channels. These two channels feed two different surface species, one of which leads to autocatalytic condensation. This mechanism gives insight into the manner in which a gas phase molecule is stepwise incorporated into tetrahedrally coordinated bulk ice. In a third and ongoing study, the uptake kinetics of HCl on ice has been investigated by pulsed valve experiments in the temperature range of 180 to 210 K and are discussed as a function of the state of the surface. In fact, some of the pulsed valve experiments present a relaxation to a steady state level. It is shown that this level originates from the evaporation of a liquid solution corresponding to a temperature specific HCl concentration. The threshold of the injected dose leading to this solution layer is estimated to be 8 · 1014 molecules. This threshold corresponding to a fraction of a monolayer may be explained by the formation of small domains along grain boundaries or other lattice imperfections. Within detection limit, no difference in keff has been observed for pulses on the solution or on a previously exposed sample without formation of the solution. In the case of pulses forming a solution layer, a fraction of 20 ± 20 % of the injected molecules remains permanently adsorbed on the surface. In the temperature range from 210 to 180 K, the pulsed valve experiments yield values of keff roughly between 5 and 25 s- 1 and an activation energy of - 1. 6 ± 0. 7 kcal/mol which are consistent with the values observed by Flueckiger in steady state experiments using the 15 mm escape aperture (kuni varying from 12 to 23 s- 1 and an activation energy of - 1. 9 ± 0. 25 kcal/mol) ...|$|R
