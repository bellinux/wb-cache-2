The paper presents the study of piezoresistive effect in aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) array grown by chemical vapor deposition.

This behavior {{was found to be}} almost fully recoverable for the loading of up to 500 g with an increment of 50 g at an interval of 10 and 50 sec. The recorded drop in resistance during the application of the load is attributed to an increasing number of conduction channels in the nanotubes array.

In a first step, we propose a constitutive framework capable of representing general thermo-electromechanical processes. This framework makes use of internal variables and is thermodynamically consistent with the Clausius-Duhem inequality for all admissible processes. Next, we focus on uni-axial electromechanical loadings and introduce microscopically motivated internal variables and their evolution equations. In order to verify the underlying a priori assumptions, we discuss extensively the numerically calculated model response to standard electromechanical loading paths.

The <b>electromechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> device {{consists of a}} single electrically connected PFW that {{is placed on the}} outer surface of a flexible polystyrene (PS) substrate and bonded at its two ends. The entire device is fully packaged by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin layer. The PFW has Schottky contacts at its two ends but with distinctly different barrier heights. The I-V characteristic is highly sensitive to strain mainly due to the change in Schottky barrier height (SBH), which scales linear with strain.

40|$|The {{field of}} organic {{electronics}} is recently emerging in modern electrical applications. Organic {{light emitting diodes}} have been developed and are implemented in commercially available products. The novel materials are also used in sensor applications, utilizing their intrinsic physical, chemical and electrical characteristics. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrene-sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) {{is one of the}} most successful organic conductive materials. Developed as antistatic coating, it is now used in other fields as well such as in electro-optical devices as transparent electrodes. One of the reasons for its widely spread use is that water-based dispersions in high quality are available. In addition, it is considered highly stable, resisting degradation under typical ambient conditions. For this work, the usability of PEDOT:PSS as active layer for <b>electromechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> applications was investigated. The electrical properties of the material were characterized including temperature dependencies and environmental influences. A piezoresistive effect with negative sign was found. It is small in magnitude and of the same order as the change in resistance due to geometrical effects. The piezoresistive effect is temperature dependent and increasing in magnitude with higher temperatures. An average longitudinal piezoresistive coefficient pi_l of - 5. 6 x 10 - 10 Pa- 1 at room temperature has been evaluated. The transverse effect under the same conditions is opposite in sign and two thirds in magnitude of the lateral effect. The hole mobility of PEDOT:PSS follows an Arrhenius function and thus the resistivity has a negative temperature coefficient. Some other thermally induced effects have been observed such as de-doping of the material resulting in an irreversibly lowered conductivity. Due to the low thermal conductivity of the substrate material used, Joule heating of the samples played an important role during the characterization and was utilized to investigate the temperature dependencies. The change of resistance caused by an applied stress to the sample is small, with a gage factor smaller than one. M. S.

40|$|Ferroelectric bismuth titanate, Na 0. 5 Bi 4. 5 Ti 4 O 15, is a {{piezoelectric}} ceramic {{used as an}} <b>electromechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> in high temperature environments (T 3 ̆c 655 °C). However, the piezoelectric constant, d 33, is relatively low in randomly oriented ceramics. Crystallographic texturing is often employed to increase the piezoelectric constant because the spontaneous polarization axes of the grains are better aligned. This research distinguishes between the crystallographic texture induced to the grains from tape casting and crystallographic texture induced to the ferroelectric domains from electrical poling. Novel quantitative approaches describe texture of both types independently using conventional and synchrotron X-ray sources as well as time-of-flight neutron diffraction with multiple detectors. Furthermore, methods are developed to describe the combined effect of a ferroelectric texture superimposed on a paraelectric texture. ^ Texture of the paraelectric crystallographic axes was induced by novel processing approaches. An alternative to using plate-shaped template particles was developed utilizing calcined powder. Paraelectric texture develops from particle settling and strong surface energy anisotropy during sintering. The 00 l textures induced from this process are {{on the order of}} two to four multiples of a random distribution. These textures create property anisotropies between the casting plane and normal directions of 6. 4 and 5. 7 in piezoelectric d 33 constant and remanent polarization, respectively. ^ Texture of the ferroelectric crystallographic axes was induced by electrical poling at different temperatures and in different orientations. Ceramics with an initial paraelectric texture can exhibit greater change in the domain volume fractions during electrical poling than randomly oriented ceramics. This is demonstrated by applying novel quantitative approaches to reflection X-ray spectra from many sample directions. Because orthorhombic Na 0. 5 Bi 4. 5 Ti 4 O 15 has two ferroelectric domains that can be resolved by diffraction, the maximum possible fraction of non- 180 ° domains switched during poling (η 200) is 0. 5. Textured ceramics poled in a direction in which most of the possible polarization directions are oriented exhibit nearly half of this value in some directions, η 200 = 0. 23, whereas randomly oriented ceramics exhibit only a quarter of the maximum possible, η 200 = 0. 13. In other words, textured ceramics can be poled to a larger degree than randomly oriented ceramics. ...|$|E
