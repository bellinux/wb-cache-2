50|$|Charles <b>Dadant</b> died in Hamilton in 1902.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dadant</b> learned English by {{subscribing to}} the New York Tribune. While {{working as a}} {{traveling}} salesman in France he educated himself. As his horse would plod along, <b>Dadant</b> would read {{the works of the}} French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and the theories of the socialist Charles Fourier.|$|E
50|$|He had one son, Camille Pierre <b>Dadant</b> (1851-1938).|$|E
50|$|He contributed {{articles}} on beekeeping to numerous bee journals, both American and European. <b>Dadant</b> acquired The American Bee Journal and <b>Dadant</b> and Sons have published it since. He translated Langstroth's The Hive and the Honey-Bee into French so {{the rest of}} the world would learn of Langstroth's contributions to beekeeping.|$|E

50|$|Vaux-sous-Aubigny is {{a former}} commune in the Haute-Marne {{department}} in north-eastern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune Le Montsaugeonnais. It is the natal village of beekeeper Charles <b>Dadant.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the Langstroth hive is {{commonly}} used. The Langstroth {{was the first}} successful top-opened hive with movable frames. Many other hive designs {{are based on the}} principle of bee space first described by Langstroth. The Langstroth hive is a descendant of Jan Dzierzon’s Polish hive designs. In the United Kingdom, {{the most common type of}} hive is the British National, which can hold Hoffman, British Standard or Manley frames. It is not unusual to see some other sorts of hive (Smith, Commercial, WBC, Langstroth, and Rose). <b>Dadant</b> and Modified <b>Dadant</b> hives are widely used in France and Italy where their large size is an advantage. Square <b>Dadant</b> hives - often called 12 frame <b>Dadant</b> or Brother Adam hives - are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers. The Rose hive is a modern design that attempts to address many of the flaws and limitations of other movable frame hives. The only significant weakness of the Rose design is that it requires 2 or 3 boxes as a brood nest which infers a large number of frames to be worked when managing the bees. The major advantage shared by these designs is that additional brood and honey storage space can be added via boxes of frames added to the hive. This also simplifies honey collection since an entire box of honey can be removed instead of removing one frame at a time.|$|E
50|$|Named {{for their}} inventor, Rev. Lorenzo Langstroth, Langstroth hives {{are not the}} only hives of this style, but the most common in North America. Langstroth {{patented}} his design in 1852 originally for comb honey production; it has become the standard style hive for many of the world's beekeepers. This class of hives includes other styles, which differ mainly in the size and number of frames used. These include Smith, British National, Segeberger Beute (German), D.E. hive, Frankenbeute (German), Normalmass (German), Langstroth hive, Modified Commercial, and Modified <b>Dadant</b> (developed in USA in 1920 from the Dadant-Blatt hive, a variant of the <b>Dadant</b> hive), plus regional variations.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1890s Root's company started selling {{beekeeping}} equipment produced by competitor <b>Dadant</b> and Sons, Inc. The venture was unsuccessful and was discontinued. In 1928 {{the company began}} a transition into candle-making when a local priest made a request for high quality liturgical candles. The production of beekeeping equipment was reduced and eventually phased out.|$|E
5000|$|Langstroth's {{design for}} movable comb hives was seized upon by apiarists and inventors {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic and a wide range of {{moveable}} comb hives were designed and perfected in England, France, Germany and the United States. Classic designs evolved in each country: <b>Dadant</b> hives and Langstroth hives are still dominant in the USA; in France the De-Layens trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National hive became standard as late as the 1930s although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. However, the Langstroth and <b>Dadant</b> designs remain ubiquitous in the USA and also in many parts of Europe, though Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive evolved to reflect the climate, floral productivity and the reproductive characteristics of the various subspecies of native honey bee in each bio-region.|$|E
50|$|The 1907-08 season saw {{the third}} coach {{in three years}} take the reins at the University of Illinois. Fletcher Lane was Illinois’ third coach, but lasted just one season. Even though he led his team to a 20-6 record, the university, {{as well as the}} athletes, deemed Lane's {{coaching}} style as subpar. Lane's team benefited from a long Southern trip in which the team beat several YMCA and club teams from Tennessee, Texas, Alabama, and Georgia. The starting lineup consisted of forwards Albert Penn and H. J. Popperfuss, center Avery Brundage, and guards Thomas E. Thompson and captain M. G. <b>Dadant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He {{was always}} seeking {{a better way}} to keep bees. Just as he had begun with the old European [...] "eke" [...] he quickly {{abandoned}} that kind of beekeeping for the modern Langstroth hive concept. Bee hives have often been designed and built without regard for the needs and habits of the honey bee colony. Probably the best design for a colony was the large hive developed by Charles <b>Dadant.</b> It provided a large, deep brood chamber with plenty of room in which the queen could lay, and shallower supers for honey storage. However, the price and promotion of smaller hives offered for sale during the period from about 1885 to 1900 made them more popular.|$|E
5000|$|A {{growing number}} of amateur beekeepers are {{adopting}} various top-bar hives similar to the type commonly found in Africa. Top bar hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years. These hives have no frames and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey {{is likely to be}} somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or <b>Dadant.</b> Top bar hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se. Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan Top Bar Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian Top Bar Hive with straight sides, and Vertical Top Bar Hives, such as the Warre or [...] "People's Hive" [...] designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.|$|E

The biological material was represented by 20 Apis mellifera carpatica bee colonies, divided in two experimental variants, 10 colonies/batch, with similar power and same-age queens.   During the experiment, we observed the bee amount at the start of hibernation; the bee amount at the end of hibernation; the evolution of feed intake and losses caused by mortality. At the end of the experiment, we determined a bigger bee amount in the polystyrene <b>Dadant</b> beehives, significantly lower losses caused by mortality from a statistical point of view (p< 0. 001) and lower feed intake with 12. 04 % compared with the bee families maintained in the wooden multi-storied beehives...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn apiary {{trial was}} {{conducted}} in 1999 in Northern Sardinia (Italy) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and the persistence of amitraz impregnated in plastic strips against Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman. Twelve colonies of bees derived from Apis mellifera ligustica Spin. in <b>Dadant</b> Blatt hives were used; six colonies were treated with 2 strips per hive and the other six were left untreated control. Two methods for the evaluation of treatment efficacy were compared: the percent effectiveness measured as the percent reduction of V. destructor infestation in treated hives, and the percent control which took into consideration natural mortality in the control hives. Percent effectiveness was greater than the percent control. Amitraz residues were determined in honey and the plastic strips. No amitraz residue higher than 0. 01 mg·kg^- 1 was detected in honey. The amitraz content was stable during the trial in plastic strips placed in the colonies, and in the control strips.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the meteorological factors, in direct correlation with the nectar release and honey production, helps beekeepers with {{the organization of the}} technological activities within the apiary (determination of the pastoral schedule, supplementary feedings, reproduction of bee colonies, honey harvest, etc.). The study was carried out between 14 th of April and 20 th of July 2017, on 20 Apis mellifera carpatica bee colonies, maintained in multi-layer and <b>Dadant</b> beehives. The bee colonies were transported in field for rape, acacia and sunflower gathering and monitored {{with the help of the}} BeeWatch Professional device. The rape and acacia gatherings were negatively influenced by low temperatures and heavy rainfall, which impeded the capitalization of the melliferous potential. The bee colonies gathered only 5 kg rape honey and 3. 9 kg acacia honey/bee colony/period. As regards the sunflower, the weather conditions were optimal for gathering, and the bee colonies gathered the supplies necessary for winter and also 5 kg honey extra. The honey production obtained by the bee colonies studied was not influenced by the beehive type; it was strongly influenced by the environmental factors, temperature and humidity...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} test various hive systems in growing and {{exploitation}} of bee colonies, {{and in order}} to estimate comparative advantages and disadvantages, assessment of biological bee comfort, as well as economic efficiency of their exploitation in small and medium beekeeping farms, was carried out an experiment on comparative study of maintaining bee colonies in different types of hives: horizontal and vertical, both with <b>Dadant</b> frames. Two similar batches of bee colonies were created. The first batch of 20 colonies was put in horizontal hives and second batch with 25 colonies– in vertical hives. The main sources of honey in the area were: Acacia, Linden tree and spontaneous flora. In beekeeping season of 2011 have been studied main biological and morpho productive characters of bee colonies, such as: colony strengthens, resistance to overwinter and diseases, queens prolificacy, brood viability, total quantity of honey collected in nest after harvest. Appreciation of morpho productive characters was done according to our methodology developed by the new zootechnic regulation according to bee colonies valuation, growing and certification of genitor beekeeping materials, approved by decision of Government of Republic of Moldova no. 306 of 28. 04. 2011. It was found that the types of hives, where were housed the experimental bees, all other equal conditions of maintenance and exploitation, have not had any impact on the biological process of bees overwinter. This is confirmed {{by the fact that the}} average strengthens of bee colonies in both experimental groups, being equal at the beginning of experiment (1, 78 kg in the autumn of 2010, in entry of overwinter) remained same in spring of 2011 (1, 49 kg out of the winter). Therefore, overwinter resistance of bee colonies in both groups was also identical, averaging 83. 1 %. At the same time, the hive types, tested in experiment, had a significant influence on reproduction process and development of bee colonies in high beekeeping season. Thus, the queens prolificacy from 2 nd batch with bee colonies located in vertical hives during the season, was higher compared to the Ist batch, accommodated in vertical hives, with 60 eggs/ 24 hours, or with 3. 5 % (B > 0. 95). A better prolificacy activity of queens in vertical hives can be explained, in our view, by the fact that they have a better comfort of laying, compared with those from horizontal hives. We found that in horizontal hives, queens prefer for laying the area near bee entrance and it is explained by the fact that this place is better aired and ensure the brood with sufficient oxygen. In vertical hives queens laying is more uniform and it is spread on more honeycombs. This is due to a better and uniform ventilation in entire hive, which gives enough oxygen to brood. All this, has led to an active laying of queens from vertical hives, also to a bigger amount of capped brood and as a result, essential increase of bee colony strengthens. At the beginning of first harvest (locust tree), bee colonies placed in vertical hives reclaimed at a bigger rate than those placed in horizontal hives. Regarding bee colonies strengthens, those from 2 nd batch exceeded significant, at this stage, those from 1 st batch, with 0. 33 kg or 9, 4 % (B > 0, 99). Bee colonies from vertical hives entered overwinter significantly more powerful than bees from horizontal hives, which creates premises for a stronger development and better productivity in the next beekeeping season. Due to a quicker development, bee colonies kept in vertical hives accumulated, during active season, a bigger quantity of honey in the nest. Thus, the total quantity of honey accumulated in nest, bee families maintained in vertical hives have significantly exceeded those from horizontal hives with 7. 5 kg, or 19, 1 % (B > 0. 999). Economic effect obtained at exploitation of vertical hives only from honey production is 375 MD lei, or 23. 8 euro per bee colony. Based on obtained results were made following conclusions. 1. Vertical hives compared to horizontal hives, offer to bee colony more comfortable biological conditions. 2. Maintenance of bee colonies in vertical hives ensures an increase of queens laying - 3. 5 % and of average annual strengthens of the bee colony – with 6. 0 %. 3. Use of vertical hives contributes to increasing of honey production with 19. 1 %. 4. Bee colonies exploitation in vertical hives ensures economic efficiency at least 23. 8 euro per bee colony...|$|E
