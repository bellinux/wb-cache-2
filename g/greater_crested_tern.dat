5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E
500|$|Other birds {{known to}} breed on North Island include the osprey (Pandion haliaetus cristatus), <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus bergii), Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), silver gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae novaehollandiae), [...] and welcome swallow (Hirunda neoxena). Birds {{commonly}} recorded as resident {{on the island}} but not recorded as breeding there include the Pacific reef heron (Egretta sacra), white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), red-capped plover (Charadrius ruficapillus), fairy tern (Sterna nereis nereis), Australasian pipit (Antus novaseelandiae australis) and western silvereye (Zosterops lateralis chloronotus). The sooty oystercatcher (Haematopus fuliginosus fuliginosus) and white-backed swallow (Cheramoeca leucosterna) have also rarely been observed as resident on the island.|$|E

5000|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world population of roseate terns, {{as well as a}} large breeding colony of <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns,</b> with up to about 10,000 birds of each species recorded. [...] The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> nest mainly on Sandy Island, with small numbers of silver gulls. As well as roseate terns, birds recorded as nesting on Low Rock include pied cormorants (150), and bridled (1000), black-naped (800) and lesser <b>crested</b> (440) <b>terns.</b>|$|R
25|$|Highlights: Thousands of {{gulls and terns}} are {{recorded}} during the winter months. Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, <b>greater</b> flamingo, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> Sandwich tern, white-winged black tern can be spotted during February and March. Black ibis were recorded {{for the first time}} in Chennai recently.|$|R
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> has grey upperparts, white underparts, {{a yellow}} bill, and a shaggy black crest that recedes in winter. Its young have a {{distinctive}} appearance, with strongly patterned grey, brown and white plumage, {{and rely on}} their parents for food for several months after they have fledged. Like {{all members of the}} genus Thalasseus, the <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments; the male offers fish to the female as part of the courtship ritual.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus bergii) and the Cayenne tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis eurygnatha), {{which have}} yellow rather than orange bills, are {{sometimes}} also {{considered part of}} this group.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{significant}} as a refuge area for numerous bird species including migratory birds such as Latham's snipe (Gallinago hardwickii), the Great egret (Egretta alba) and the <b>Greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Sterna bergii).|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> feeds {{mostly at}} sea by plunge diving {{to a depth}} of up to 1 m, or by dipping from the surface, and food is usually {{swallowed}} in mid-air. Birds may forage up to 10 km from land in the breeding season. Prey size ranges from 7 - 138 mm in length and up to 30 g in weight. Shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovy and sardine are typical prey, but bottom-living species are taken as discards from commercial fishing. This tern actively follows trawlers, including at night, and during the fishing season trawl discards can constitute 70% of its diet. Prawn fishing is particularly productive in providing extra food, since prawns usually represent only 10-20% of the catch, the remaining being bycatch, mainly fish such as cardinalfish and gobies.A study of an area of the Great Barrier Reef where the number of breeding <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> has grown ten-fold, probably due to extra food from trawl by-catch, suggested that lesser <b>crested</b> and sooty <b>terns</b> have moved away and now breed on a part of the reef where fishing is banned. It is possible that the large {{increase in the number of}} <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> may have affected other species through competition for food and nesting sites.|$|R

50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened. These include vulnerable Chinese egrets, greater spotted eagles and straw-headed bulbuls, endangered Nordmann's greenshanks and critically endangered spoon-billed sandpipers, as well as <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Significant {{numbers of}} <b>Greater</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Tern</b> and Black-naped Tern breed at Bancs Providence. There {{are also very}} large numbers of Grey Heron {{breeding}} in the largest heronry of Seychelles and small numbers of Fairy Tern.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} an {{important}} breeding ground for various bird species, namely the masked booby, <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> sooty tern and the brown noddy. Latham is also thought to be of importance for nesting turtles.|$|E
50|$|Fish are {{the main}} food of the <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern,</b> found to make up nearly 90% of all prey items with the {{remainder}} including cephalopods, crustaceans and insects. Unusual vertebrate prey included agamid lizards and green turtle hatchlings.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a very large colony of sooty terns, with up to 100,000 breeding pairs. It also has a much smaller colony of <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> (with at least 50 breeding pairs recorded in 1994). Of at least seven species of landbirds present, most are probably introduced.|$|R
50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of fairy and roseate terns, and of sooty oystercatchers. <b>Greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> breed there irregularly, sometimes in large numbers. Other birds breeding on the islands include ospreys, white-bellied sea eagles, pied oystercatchers, Caspian terns and bridled terns. The islands support 12-15 breeding pairs of beach stone-curlews. Yellow white-eyes have been recorded.|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports the largest colony of <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> in the world, with up to 29,000 nests recorded there. Tern eggs are harvested by the islandâ€™s traditional owners. Up to 800 silver gulls also nest on the island, and possibly bridled and roseate terns. Large numbers of migrant common and little terns roost there, as do smaller numbers of frigatebirds and brown boobies.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} sandbanks on the reefs, {{but little}} land is above the surface at high tide. The atoll is visited by pelagic birds, {{including}} the lesser crested tern (Sterna bengalensis) and <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Sterna bergii).|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> breeds on many {{islands in}} the Indian Ocean {{including}} Aldabra and Etoile in the Seychelles, the Chagos Archipelago, and Rodrigues. There are colonies on numerous Pacific islands, including Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga, the Society Islands and the Tuamotus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> {{has about}} five {{geographical}} races, differing {{mainly in the}} colour of the upperparts and bill. These are listed below in taxonomic sequence. A similar number of other potential subspecies have been proposed, but are not considered valid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{archipelago}} {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) known as the Sir Joseph Banks Group Important Bird Area because it supports over 1% of the world populations of white-faced storm petrels (with up to about 180,000 breeding pairs), Cape Barren geese (up to about 1200 individuals), black-faced cormorants (from 3000 to 5000 breeding pairs), and, probably, of Pacific gulls. [...] Other seabirds which breed in the archipelago include little penguins, silver gulls and <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b> Fairy terns and eastern reef egrets have been recorded.|$|R
25|$|Seabirds use {{the islands}} as resting, breeding, and {{wintering}} sites. Species found here include streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas), brown booby (Sula leucogaster), red-footed booby (S. sula), <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> (Sterna bergii), and white tern (Gygis alba). Little {{information is available}} regarding {{the current status of}} the islands' seabird populations, though it is likely that birds may divert nesting sites to smaller, less disturbed islands. Bird eggs cover the majority of Song Tu, a small island in the eastern Danger Zone. A variety of cetaceans such as dolphins, orcas, pilot whales, and sperm whales are also present around the islands.|$|R
50|$|Amongst {{the many}} birds {{that can be}} spotted feeding on the diverse fauna variety of worms and molluscs, are whimbrel, common greenshank, common redshank, Mongolian plover, curlew sandpiper, marsh sandpiper and Pacific golden plover, yellow bittern and {{cinnamon}} bittern. Lucky visitors to the reserve {{may be able to}} spot the resident family of smooth otters, as well as the rare lesser whistling-duck, and the rare milky stork. The reserve forms part of the Kranji-Mandai Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports Chinese egrets, greater spotted eagles and <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b> Atlas moth, the largest species of moth in Southeast Asia {{can be found in the}} back mangrove.|$|R
5000|$|The {{generic name}} of the <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> is derived from Greek Thalassa, [...] "sea", and the species epithet bergii commemorates Carl Heinrich Bergius, a Prussian {{pharmacist}} and botanist who collected the first specimens of this tern near Cape Town.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> {{is highly}} vocal, {{especially}} at its breeding grounds. The territorial advertising call is a loud, raucous, crow-like kerrak. Other calls include a korrkorrkorr {{given at the}} nest by anxious or excited birds, and a hard wep wep in flight.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two other}} orange-billed terns {{within the range of}} this species, royal tern and <b>Greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern.</b> Both are much larger and stouter-billed; royal also has a white rump and tail, while crested (which shares the grey rump) is darker overall above and has a yellower bill. See also orange-billed tern.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{protected}} area the peninsula supports a diverse array of animal and plant life, including a number of species listed as of conservation concern by international, federal and state bodies including the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 (FFG Act) {{and it is a}} BirdLife International Important Bird Area. It is home to one of the largest Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) breeding colonies in Australia, the second largest breeding colony of Australian Fur Seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) in the world, one of the largest breeding colonies of <b>Greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> (Sterna bergii) in Victoria and an important breeding ground for Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris). Several plants regarded as rare or threatened in either Victoria or Australia have been recorded on the peninsula, including River Swamp Wallaby-grass (Amphibromus fluitans) listed as vulnerable in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Michaelmas Cay is {{important}} as a breeding site for several species of terns. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>crested</b> <b>terns.</b> [...] Sooty terns and common noddies also breed there. Other terns that have nested on the cay in the past include roseate and black-naped terns.|$|R
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{have been}} observed swallowing city pigeons in St. James's Park in London. Spokeswoman for the Royal Parks Louise Wood opined that feeding on other birds is more likely with captive pelicans that live in a semi-urban environment and are in constant close contact with humans. However, in southern Africa eggs and chicks of the Cape cormorant are an important food source for great white pelicans. Several other bird species have been recorded in the diet of this pelican in South Africa, including Cape gannet chicks on Malgas Island as well as crowned cormorants, kelp gulls, <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>terns</b> and African penguins on Dassen Island and elsewhere. The Australian pelican, which is particularly {{willing to take a}} wide range of prey items, has been recorded feeding on young Australian white ibis, and young and adult grey teals and silver gulls. Brown pelicans have been reported preying on young common murres in California as well as the eggs and nestlings of cattle egrets and nestling great egrets in Baja California, Mexico. Peruvian pelicans in Chile have been recorded feeding on nestlings of imperial shags, juvenile Peruvian diving petrels and grey gulls. Cannibalism of chicks of their own species is known from the Australian, brown and Peruvian pelicans.|$|R
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> was {{originally}} described as Sterna bergii by German naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823, but {{was moved to}} its current genus, Thalasseus, after mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that the three main head patterns shown by terns (no black cap, black cap, black cap with a white forehead) corresponded to distinct clades.|$|E
50|$|In {{various parts}} of its range, the royal tern could be {{confused}} with the elegant tern, lesser crested tern (the other orange-billed terns), and the <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern.</b> It is paler above than lesser crested tern and the yellow-billed great crested tern. The elegant tern has a longer more curved bill and shows more white on the forehead in winter.|$|E
50|$|The greater crested tern's closest {{relatives}} {{within its}} genus {{appear to be}} the lesser crested tern (T. bengalensis), and the royal tern (T. maximus). The DNA study did not include the critically endangered Chinese crested tern (T. bernsteini) but, as that bird was formerly considered to be conspecific with the <b>greater</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> as a synonym of the subspecies T. b. cristatus, it is presumably also very closely related.|$|E
40|$|Pulau Ling {{is a small}} rocky island located to {{the south}} of Pulau Redang, forming with other {{southeast}} small islands, the Redang Archipelago, in the state of Terengganu, Malaysia. The island was highlighted in the early 1950 s as an important seabird site, although little was then known on the status of seabirds on the island. Field visits were made between May 2015 and September 2015 to assess the importance of this small island to seabird species. Four tern species were identified: two of them, black-naped tern Sterna sumatrana and bridled tern Onychoprion anaethetus, were found to breed there, while the other two species, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tern</b> Thalasseus bergii and roseate tern Sterna dougallii were found to use the island as a stopover site without any evidence of breeding. Furthermore, the Pacific Eastern Reef egret Egretta sacra (the black morph), was also found to breed on the island. Other species encountered included white-bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster (recorded once in June 2015, soaring over the island). These preliminary data show the importance of such small rocky outcrops for tropical breeding and migrating seabirds, where food availability and lack of disturbance may be the two main drivers for diversity and survival...|$|R
50|$|Three lakes {{created by}} gravel {{workings}} alongside the River Wylye {{have been turned}} into a wildlife reserve called the Langford Lakes Nature Reserve, under the ownership of the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve has an area of fifty acres, and species include mallard, gadwall, tufted duck, common pochard, northern shoveller, Eurasian wigeon, kingfisher, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> grebe, common <b>tern,</b> osprey, brown trout, greyling, otters, and water voles.|$|R
50|$|A {{count in}} May 2008 found 58 {{different}} species of birds, attracted by the various habitats. Woodland birds include jay, green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, carrion crow, blue tit, great tit, common chaffinch, nightingale, kestrel and bullfinch. Around the lake, depending {{on the time of}} year, are graylag geese, Canada geese, mute swan, <b>great</b> <b>crested</b> grebe, common <b>tern,</b> moorhen, coot, occasional kingfisher, cormorant, and grey heron, with swallows and house martins skimming the water. Buzzards can increasingly been seen above the Forest.|$|R
