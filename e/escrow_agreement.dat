50|$|The {{commercial}} {{imperative for}} business process preservation comes from several pressures. Heavily regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacture must fully document processes {{so that they}} can be audited, reproduced, or diagnosed. Long-lived companies must manage services across multiple changes in technical environments. Organisations that use escrow services to mitigate risk must be confident that all of the needed information is demonstrably included in the <b>escrow</b> <b>agreement</b> and services. Organisations undergoing major staff changes must ensure that they retain the knowledge needed to operate or re-instate production processes. In addition to publications and data, academics need the software and process information to assess the validity of the data and the derived scientific claims. The same provenance information that can provide a key in regulated industries can also support credit assignment in academia. All industries benefit from analysis of processes that may lead to their continuous improvement. Memory institutions need to document the provenance of their digital collections as they undergo format-shifts to prove the authenticity or quality of their process products.|$|E
50|$|Source code escrow agents hold {{source code}} of {{software}} in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. Normally {{you do not}} own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that you are accessing, {{under the terms of}} a regular SaaS or desktop software agreement. This does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to your business and you remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless you have an <b>escrow</b> <b>agreement</b> in place. Escrow is when the software source code is held by a third party - an escrow agent - on behalf of the customer and the supplier. Information escrow agents, such as the International Creative Registry, hold in escrow intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information's ownership, contents, and creation date.|$|E

In this system multiple third parties, who are trusted collectively but not individually, perform the dual role of providing users with key management services and providing authorised agencies in the relevant domains with warranted access to the users' communications. We propose two <b>escrowed</b> key <b>agreement</b> mechanisms, both designed for the case where the pair of communicating users are in different domains, in which the pair of users and all the third parties jointly generate a cryptographic key for end-to-end encryption. The fact that all entities {{are involved in the}} key generation process helps {{make it more difficult for}} deviant users to subvert the escrowed key by using a hidden `shadow-key'. The first mechanism makes use of a single set of key escrow agencies moderately trusted by mutually mistrusting domains. The second me [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Digital only {{subscription}} {{is increasingly}} popular {{as a means}} of journal and book delivery among our major libraries. The advantages of digital delivery are apparent, but unlike traditional publications, digital subscriptions are commonly not housed within our national boundaries. With an increasing large proportion of book and journal subscriptions being digital only this presents an as yet un-quantified risk to the collections of the major research and state libraries. At present very little attention is directed to the continuity of access to increasingly important research resources through periods of economic, social or military instability. Escrow contracts are an established method to guarantee continuity of business when licensing business-critical software applications. A case for the establishment of digital Escrow database at the national level is presented, and an architecture is suggested which proposes integration of the <b>Escrow</b> <b>agreement</b> as a fundamental element of the digital resource supply chain. Such a lodgement could then become a contractual element of the subscription to the benefit of both the publisher and the subscriber...|$|E
40|$|Using a Key {{escrow agent}} in {{conjunction}} with Voice over IP (VoIP) communication ensures that law enforcements agencies (LEAs) can retrieve the session key used to encrypt data between two users in a VoIP session. However, {{the use of a}} single escrow agent has some drawbacks. A fraudulent request by an evil employee from the LEA can lead to improper disclosure of a session key. After the escrow agent reveals the key this evil person could fabricate data according to his/her needs and encrypt it again (using the correct session key). In this situation the persons involved in the communication session can be accused of crimes that he or she or they never committed. The problems with a single escrow agent becomes even more critical as a failure of the escrow agent can delay or even make it impossible to reveal the session key, thus the escrow agent {{might not be able to}} comply with a lawful court order or comply with their <b>escrow</b> <b>agreement</b> in the case of data being released according to this agreement (for example for disaster recovery). This thesis project focused on improving the accessibility and reliability of escrow agents, while providing good security. One such method is based on dividing the session key into m chunks and escrowing the chunks with m escrow agents. Using threshold cryptography the key can be regenerated by gathering any n-out-of-m chunks. The value of m and n may differ according to the role of the user. For a highly sophisticated session, the user might define a higher value for m and n for improved, availability, reliability, and security. For a less confidential or less important session (call), the value of m and n might be smaller. The thesis examines the increased availability and increased reliability made possible by using multiple escrow agents...|$|E
40|$|Two or more parties {{entering}} into {{a contract for}} service or goods may make use of an escrow of the funds for payment to enable trust in the contract. In such an event the documents or financial instruments, the object(s) in escrow, are held in trust by a trusted third party (escrow provider) until the specified conditions are fulfilled. In the scenario of software escrow, the object of escrow is typically the source code, and the specified release conditions usually address potential scenarios wherein the software provider becomes unable to continue providing services (such as due to bankruptcy or a change in services provided, etc.) The subject of software escrow is not well documented in the academic body of work, with the largest information sources, active commentary and supporting papers provided by commercial software escrow providers, both in South Africa and abroad. This work maps the software escrow topic onto the King III compliance framework in South Africa. This is of value since any users of bespoke developed applications may require extended professional assistance to align with the King III guidelines. The supporting risk assessment model developed in this work {{will serve as a}} tool to evaluate and motivate for software escrow agreements. It will also provide an overview of the various <b>escrow</b> <b>agreement</b> types and will transfer the focus to the value proposition that they each hold. Initial research has indicated that current awareness of software escrow in industry is still very low. This was evidenced by the significant number of approached specialists that declined to participate in the survey due to their own admitted inexperience in applying the discipline of software escrow within their companies. Moreover, the participants that contributed to the research indicated that they only required software escrow for medium to highly critical applications. This proved the value of assessing the various risk factors that bespoke software development introduces, as well as the risk mitigation options available, through tools such as escrow, to reduce the actual and residual risk to a manageable level...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. This {{research}} report outlines corporate governance {{and information technology}} risk management frameworks {{and the use of}} software escrow within a holistic enterprise risk management strategy to maintain business continuity. Available risk mitigation tools and frameworks were analysed including the use of software escrow as an information technology risk mitigation tool and continuity instrument. The primary researched problem relates to how organisations can ensure business continuity through managing the risks surrounding business-critical software applications. Software escrow was identified in the literature review as a risk management tool used to mitigate operational risks residing in the licencing of mission-critical software applications. The primary research question is: “How can source code escrow contribute towards business continuity by limiting risks contained in licensed business critical software applications?” This study found that an <b>escrow</b> <b>agreement</b> ensures an end-user access to licenced mission-critical intellectual property in the event of the owner’s insolvency, acquisition or breach of maintenance agreements and thereby ensures continuity. The following secondary research questions were also answered: “What types of operational risks will be minimised using software escrow?” and “What constitutes an effective source code agreement in South Africa?” The research identified that the main driver for escrow was operational risk of a mission-critical system failure due to maintenance and upgrades not taking place. The reasons identified included insolvency of the software supplier, acquisition of the supplier, loss of key resources (developers) and breach of maintenance or development agreements. The research also identified some limitations to the application of escrow and the reasons for some agreements not being executed. Key escrow contract quality criteria were identified which ensure an effective agreement under South African law. The following essential quality criteria were found to improve the efficiency of execution of the escrow contract: - Frequency and quality of deposits; - Deposit verification to ensure usability of material post release; and - Well-defined release trigger events to avoid legal disputes regarding what constitutes a release. Case studies highlighted the main risks that drive the creation of escrow agreements and identified limitations to the execution of some escrow agreements. The software end-user operational risks mitigated by the use of escrow included: - Continued use of the software despite vendor bankruptcy; - Reducing the dependency on the supplier for maintenance and support of the software Safeguarding critical business processes; and - Return on investment (software implementation, hardware and training of staff). It was concluded that, despite the legal and practical complexities concerned with escrow, it remains the best instrument to ensure continuity when relying on licensed intellectual property used for business-critical functions and processes. Software escrow is therefore a vital component of a well-formulated license agreement to ensure access to mission-critical technology (including all related intellectual property) under pre-defined conditions of release to the end-user (licensee). In the event of a release, the escrow agent gives the end-user access to the deposited source code and related materials for the purposes of business continuity only and in no way affects the ownership rights of the supplier/owner...|$|E
