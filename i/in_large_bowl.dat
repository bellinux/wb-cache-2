5000|$|Generally speaking, {{the food}} on a skewer is smaller in Osaka style, and {{customers}} tend to order larger number of kushi compared to Tokyo or Nagoya that encouraged many kushiage restaurants using a premixed [...] "batter flour" [...] of powdered egg and flour, compared to that in Tokyo or Nagoya where batter is prepared with fresh egg, water and flour topped with panko crusts. Kushiage restaurants in Osaka on high-ends serve kushikatu in Tokyo-Nagoya style. Varieties include that grated yam is added for softer texture. New types of kushikatsu restaurants serve oil fondue style kushikatsu that you fry kushi {{on the table in}} deep pan with cooking oil. Kushinobō is a typical Osaka style kushiage restaurant on high end with franchiser across Japan, and it is appreciated for their unique serving style that until you tell them you are full and don't need any more, they continue to bring you variations of kushiage to your table endlessly. Diced cabbege leaves are free condiment prepared <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> on the table, which is believed to prevent feeling dull in the stomach.|$|E

5000|$|Visitors to Cockedhat have {{remarked on}} its [...] "high, jagged peaks wrapped in clouds," [...] and its [...] "vast, sheer {{mountain}} walls." [...] The summit of Cockedhat Mountain rises {{at the intersection}} of four steep, long ridges. Cirque glaciers, rare in the central Brooks Range, sit <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowls</b> to the North, East, and West, and a small hanging glacier clings to the peak's steep western face. Only the peak's southern bowl remains free of year-round snow and ice.|$|R

50|$|Stir {{together}} {{sugar and}} 3½ cups water <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> or pot until sugar is dissolved. Add lemon juice, rum, cognac, and brandy and chill, covered, at least 3 hours. Put half-gallon ice block in a punch bowl and pour punch over it.|$|R
5000|$|Food is {{distributed}} by one person per squad, {{which consists of}} about 10 people. This prisoner, called the zhiban or [...] "duty prisoner," [...] delivers the food {{to the rest of}} his group <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowls</b> on a cart. This often involves pushing the cart a great distance to the place where the others are working. Each day prisoners receive gruel, bread, and a watery vegetable soup made from the cheapest vegetables available. Some camps have reported two meals a day, while others allow three. Food is rationed according to rank and productive output, which is believed to provide motivation to work.|$|R

(The Sandwich Islanders always squat on their hams, and who knows but they may be the old original [...] "ham sandwiches?" [...] The thought is pregnant with interest.) The poi looks like common flour paste, and is kept <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowls</b> formed of a species of gourd, and capable of holding from one to three or four gallons. Poi is the chief article of food among the natives, and is prepared from the taro plant.|$|R

50|$|To archaeologists, {{these early}} Polynesians provide a mystery just as perplexing as the Lapitans. By 1550BP (400 BCE), they ceased to produce any pottery at all. They {{seem to have}} turned towards more natural {{materials}} instead, and therefore the archaeological record enters into a “dark age” of relatively little information until the emergence of chiefly states hundreds of years later. Speculations as to disappearance of the pottery tradition ranges {{from the use of}} coconut cups and bowls that are easier to use, a shift away from steaming shellfish <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowls</b> to baking <b>in</b> underground ovens, and the unsuitability of Tongan clays for pottery. Nothing can be said with certainty except that the same disappearance also occurred in Fiji and Samoa.|$|R
25|$|Punch {{is a wide}} {{assortment}} of drinks, both non-alcoholic and alcoholic, generally containing fruit or fruit juice. The drink was introduced from India to the United Kingdom in the early seventeenth century, and from there its use spread to other countries. Punch is typically served at parties <b>in</b> <b>large,</b> wide <b>bowls,</b> known as punch bowls.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> addition, <b>larger</b> <b>bowls</b> {{and spoons}} {{can also cause}} people to serve and consume a greater volume of food, {{although}} this effect may not also extend to larger plates. It {{has been suggested that}} people serve more food into larger dishes due to the Delboeuf illusion, a phenomenon in which two identical circles are perceived to be different in size depending upon the sizes of larger circles surrounding them.|$|R
50|$|The molten sugar solidifies {{in the air}} and {{is caught}} <b>in</b> a <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> which totally {{surrounds}} the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl,</b> at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone, around the rim of the <b>large</b> catching <b>bowl,</b> gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.|$|R
5000|$|The Cyberdrome Crystal Maze was an {{attraction}} usually found <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowling</b> alleys and video arcades in the UK. It allowed fans {{an opportunity to}} [...] "play" [...] the Crystal Maze for themselves in a computerised format. There were a few differences from the show itself, e.g. there is no player choice of game category, {{and there is no}} locking in (instead, failing to quit a game would immediately cost the team a crystal). Five of the first six locations were in Britain, while the sixth was in Japan. All of the Cyberdrome Crystal Mazes have since closed. The locations of the Cyberdromes were Sandcastle Water Park (Blackpool), Oakwood Theme Park (Pembrokeshire), Southampton Megabowl, Coventry Megabowl and next to Magnet Leisure Centre in Maidenhead, (Berkshire). The last one, at Canaston Bowl, Pembrokeshire, ceased operations in June 2010.|$|R
5|$|Tabbouleh is a Mediterranean-style table salad {{originating}} in the Levant. The salad is made from parsley pieces, bulgur, diced tomatoes, cucumbers and is sautéed with lemon juice and vinegar. <b>In</b> 2006, the <b>largest</b> <b>bowl</b> of tabbouleh <b>in</b> the world was prepared by Palestinian cooks in the West Bank city of Ramallah.|$|R
60|$|There was no regular dinner, the {{officers}} coming below by turns, {{and taking a}} biscuit and a chunk of cold meat, standing. But at teatime the captain and second mate came down together; and Bob, who had again been up on deck for a bit, joined them <b>in</b> taking a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of coffee.|$|R
40|$|Extraverted {{children}} are hypothesized {{to be most}} at risk for over-serving and overeating due to environmental cues - such as the size of dinnerware. A within-subject field study of elementary school students found that extraverted children served themselves 33. 1 % more cereal <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowls</b> (16 -oz) than in smaller (12 -oz) bowls, whereas introverted children were unaffected by bowl size (+ 5. 6 %, ns). However, when children were asked by adults how much cereal they wanted to eat, both extraverted and introverted children requested more cereal when given a <b>large</b> versus small <b>bowl.</b> Insofar as extraverted children {{appear to be more}} biased by environmental cues, this pilot study suggests different serving styles are recommended for parents and other caregivers. They should serve extraverts, but allow introverts to serve themselves. Still, since the average child still served 23. 2 % more when serving themselves than when served by an adult, it might be best for caregivers to do the serving whenever possible - especially for extraverted children. ...|$|R
50|$|Cotton candy, {{also known}} as Candy Floss, {{is a form of}} spun sugar. Typical {{machines}} used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small bowl into which granulated sugar is poured. Colored sugar or separate sugar and food coloring are used to provide color. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force, and the molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught <b>in</b> a <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> which totally surrounds the spinning head. After the product builds up on the inside walls of the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl,</b> a stick, cone, or hands are inserted, upon which the sugar strands are gathered.|$|R
25|$|At Nalanda, a Buddhist university, {{four hours}} a day and {{four hours a}}t night were {{measured}} by a water clock, which consisted of a copper <b>bowl</b> holding two <b>large</b> floats <b>in</b> a <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> filled with water. The bowl was filled with water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when completely filled and was marked by the beating of a drum at daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> {{add flour}} and yeast and mix. Then, {{add salt and}} sugar, egg and water until you get the mixture to dough consistency. Leave to stand for {{about half an hour}} until the dough sets. Once the dough has doubled in size, pinch {{medium-sized}} pieces of dough in any shape you like and place in a pan with a good amount of oil, usually filled to half to the top. Fry until just golden brown. Place on paper towel to dry excess oil.|$|R
50|$|These {{flowers are}} also grown in double cultivars {{and are used}} in floral designs. However, they do not last when out of water and the single flowers do not last when wired. The 'Pacific Beauty' (Leptospermum poolgalifolium) is a useful flower to use <b>in</b> <b>large</b> church-service <b>bowls</b> and {{function}} arrangements, however use of Leptospermum in corporate designs is less desirable as they dry and drop when subjected to heating and air conditioning.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{created in}} the same way as a mast horse or hooden horse, the Derby Tup (ram) {{represented}} a male sheep. It took part in a dramatised version of the Derby Ram folksong, which was performed in northern Derbyshire and around Sheffield during the Christmas season by teams of boys. It is [...] "killed" [...] by a butcher and its [...] "blood" [...] is collected <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>bowl.</b> <b>In</b> some versions it is brought back to life by a quack doctor, like a character in the Mummers play.|$|R
50|$|The Scorpion Bowl is {{presented}} <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> volcano <b>bowl,</b> a 48-ounce vessel with a ceramic volcano in the center. Served with dry ice, an orchid, and some 151 proof alcohol aflame in the volcanic center, the drink gives {{the appearance of}} a mysterious tropical island.|$|R
50|$|Fit-fit, or fir-fir, is {{a common}} breakfast dish. It is made from {{shredded}} injera or kitcha stir-fried with spices or wat. Another popular breakfast food is fatira. The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often {{with a layer of}} egg, eaten with honey. Chechebsa (or kita firfir) resembles a pancake covered with berbere and niter kibbeh, or spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. A porridge, genfo is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> with a dug-out made {{in the middle of the}} genfo and filled with spiced niter kibbeh.|$|R
50|$|Salads in food {{photography}} {{are composed}} {{with a view}} to creating appealing textures, shapes and colors. To improve support and aid in composition, salad in a bowl is built around a smaller bowl placed inverted <b>in</b> the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl.</b> Salad greens are kept fresh and crisp by misting them with cold water prior to composition. Salad dressing is not normally used, as it makes the salad slippery and difficult to style, but the appearance of dressing may be created by sprinkling herbs and spices over the wet salad, or mixing them in oil and applying it with a brush.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1840s, punsch {{was served}} as a warm punch, created just before consumption: a sugarloaf was placed upright <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> hot water was poured over it to make the sugar dissolve, and arrack, unflavoured spirits and German Rhine wine was added. Still warm, the drink was then served in cups. However, in 1845 wine {{importing}} company J. Cederlunds Söner started selling premixed punsch in bottles, quickly followed by several other manufacturers, and the habit of drinking punsch cold as a liqueur began to take hold. However, on Thursdays, punsch is still traditionally served warm with Swedish pea & pork soup and pancakes.|$|R
5000|$|The player, after {{inserting}} a coin, must view the [...] "dot matrix" [...] display on the cabinet which displays a set number of pounds (lbs). The dot matrix will quickly rotate {{through all of}} the set pound numbers and the player must quickly press the large [...] "stop" [...] button on the cabinet. A large excavator claw will the drop down and scoop up items placed <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> inside the cabinet. The larger the pounds, the more items the claw will be able to pick up. When the game is over, the player has the option of placing in additional credits to try earning a larger prize.|$|R
50|$|Meat is {{the common}} part of their diet which they usually have it with 'Sharwa' which is soup. It’s a rich and hearty soup made with meat and potatoes.
