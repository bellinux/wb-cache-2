5|$|Hunting hare with beagles {{became popular}} again in Britain in {{the mid-19th century}} and {{continued}} until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> popular where <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> no longer permitted or for those owners who {{do not wish to}} participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} is listed under CITES Appendix II. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> {{prohibited}} in Bangladesh, China, India, Israel, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkey. But {{it does not}} receive legal protection outside protected areas in Bhutan, Georgia, Laos, Lebanon, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|Albert <b>Hunt</b> <b>was</b> the {{inventor}} of the wigwag, a grade crossing signal used in transportation. <b>Hunt</b> <b>was</b> a mechanical engineer from Southern California. He invented the wigwag in 1909 out of the necessity for a safer railroad grade crossing. <b>Hunt</b> <b>was</b> associated with the Pacific Electric interurban streetcar railroad.|$|R
5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A major factor in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> often {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina {{may also}} {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative hunting technique {{is similar to that of}} the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E

5|$|John James Audubon {{reported}} that the American white ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh {{has been described as}} appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus Eudocimus have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> not thought to be major.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle State Park has two {{distinct}} fishing zones. Lake Erie {{is home to}} perch, trout, walleye, bass, and steelhead. Presque Isle Bay {{is the home of}} muskellunge, northern pike, crappie, smelt, as well as other fish that swim in from the lake. Trout fishing is also allowed in the two waterworks basins, which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> prohibited at Presque Isle State Park with the exception of controlled duck and goose hunting seasons in designated blinds.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Major threats to the jungle cat include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hunt</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} Rowland Hunt, of Boreatton Hall, Baschurch, Shropshire and {{his wife}} Florence Marianne, {{daughter}} of Richard B.

5|$|The {{practice}} of coon <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E

5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> also presently conducted by government-mandated programs {{in order to support}} populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs are diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. The cheetah is an alert animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they take turns at keeping a lookout.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> also important {{to some of the}} local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E

5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast {{and in the}} various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Fishing for salmon and steelhead, a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. <b>Hunting</b> <b>is</b> not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> done by {{a select}} group of fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, bears {{have come}} under {{pressure}} through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though <b>hunting</b> <b>is</b> now banned, largely replaced by farming. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American black bear, {{are at risk of}} extirpation in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.|$|E
