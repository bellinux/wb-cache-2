2500|$|A Sumerian {{text from}} 5000 BC {{describes}} a [...] "tooth worm" [...] {{as the cause}} of caries. [...] Evidence of this belief has also been found in India, Egypt, Japan, and China. Unearthed ancient skulls show evidence of primitive dental work.

[...] During the Sargonid dynasty of Assyria during 668 to 626 BC, writings from the king's physician specify the need to extract a tooth due to spreading inflammation. [...] In the Roman Empire, wider consumption of cooked foods led to a small increase in caries prevalence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the effect of music vs. the sound of a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> paired with or without the vibrotactile stimulation of a Somatron™, on continuous, com puterized recording of subject comfort and heart rate and intermittent recording of peripheral finger temperature. Sub jects ware 130 music majors divided into five auditory stimuli conditions (N= 26) with 13 ma/es and 13 females in each group: (a) vibrotactile stimulation with music followed by den tal drill; (b) vibrotactile stimulation with <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> followed by music; (c) free field music then <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> (no vibrarion); (d) free field <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> then music (no vibration); and (e) no auditory or vibrotactile stimuli. Each condition lasted 6. 5 min utes. Results showed that the vibrotactile stimulation blunted perception, thereby reducing levels both of comfort and dis comfort; this stimulation also reversed the effects of the two auditory stimuli on heart rate from those caused by free field presentation, and raised significantly finger temperature for both auditory strimuli. Overall, music preceding the <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> genera//y reduced the drill’s aversive effects while the drill preceding music generally enhanced music’s positive effects. Heart rate responses to music were varied. The initiation of all stimuli created an arousal response with acclimation oc curring in approximately 30 seconds. Neither music nor the <b>dental</b> <b>drill,</b> alone or in combination with vibrotactile stimu lation, produced a consistent heart rate response. Changes in heart rate seemed to be affected most by the sequence of stimuli across time. When music followed the drill, music decreased heart rate; however, when used in combination with the Somatron™, heart rate was increased. These results were identical to the effects of the drill following music whe...|$|R
40|$|Guided {{surgeries}} {{are becoming}} common in modern dental industry, {{and are used}} {{for a variety of}} treatments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply a dental software toolkit for virtual simulation of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided surgery. The hypothesis is that if a virtual simulation of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided surgery can be done, then the preplanned surgery can also be verified before the actual surgery. The <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided concept is a planning and surgical implementation system that enables surgery with the help of a drill guide based on planning supported by computer aided design tools and CT-scan. The variation simulation predicts the final positions of the pre-defined critical production dimension at the apical part of the fixture. The results are based on variation simulation of two <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided surgeries: Maxilla, seven implants and Mandible, nine implants. Maxilla resulted in a safe surgery while Mandible needed an optimization of the implant positions before the surgery. By analyzing the results, it was also found that both plans could be optimized in order to minimize the geometrical variation. Finally, it was found that the method used was suitable for predicting guided surgeries to achieve safer treatments...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> or dentist's drill is a small, {{high-speed}} <b>drill</b> {{used during}} <b>dental</b> procedures, usually to remove decay and shape tooth structure {{prior to the}} insertion of a filling or crown.

The term [...] "dental drill" [...] is considered the more colloquial form of the term [...] "dental handpiece," [...] although it can also be construed as to include the power source for one or more handpieces, a [...] "dental engine."

5000|$|The Indus Valley Civilization {{has yielded}} {{evidence}} of dentistry being practiced {{as far back}} as 7000 BC. This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. Cavities of 3.5 mm depth with concentric groovings indicate use of a drill tool. The age of the teeth has been estimated at 9000 years. In later times, mechanical hand drills were used. Like most hand drills, they were quite slow, with speeds of up to 15 rpm. In 1864, British dentist George Fellows Harrington invented a clockwork <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> named Erado. [...] The device was much faster than earlier drills, but also very noisy. In 1868, American dentist George F. Green came up with a pneumatic <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> powered with pedal-operated bellows. James B. Morrison devised a pedal-powered burr drill in 1871.|$|R

5000|$|Pulpitis may {{be caused}} by dental caries that {{penetrate}} through the enamel and dentin to reach the pulp, or it may be a result of trauma, such as physical abuse of the tooth or thermal insults, including overheating from insufficiently cooled <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> and use of dental curing lights.

40|$|Abstract –The {{application}} of noise reduction methods requires {{the integration of}} acoustics engineering and digital signal processing, which is well served by a mechatronic approach as described in this paper. The Normalised Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithm is implemented on the Texas Instruments TMS 320 C 6713 DSK Digital Signal Processor (DSP) as an adaptive digital filter for <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> noise. Blocks within the Matlab/Simulink Signal Processing Blockset and the Embedded Target for TI C 6000 DSP family are used. A working model of the algorithm is then transferred to the Code Composer Studio (CCS), where the desired code can be linked and transferred to the target DSP. The experimental rig comprises a noise reference microphone, a microphone for the desired signal, the DSK and loudspeakers. Different load situations of the <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> are considered as the noise characteristics change when the drill load changes. The result is that annoying drill noise peaks, which occur in a frequency range from 1. 5 kHz to 10 kHz, are filtered out adaptively by the DSP. Additionally a schematic design for its implementation in a dentist’s surgery will also be presented. I...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} that {{can benefit from}} Active Noise Control (ANC) such as in aircraft cabins and air conditioning ducts, i. e. in situations where technology interferes with human hearing in a harmful way or disrupts communication. Headsets with analogue ANC circuits {{have been used in}} the armed forces for attenuating frequencies below 1 kHz, which when combined with passive filtering offers protection across the whole frequency range of human hearing. A dental surgery is also a noisy environment; in which <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> noise is commonly off-putting for many patients and is believed to harm the dentist’s hearing {{over a long period of}} time. However, dealing with <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> noise is a different proposition from the applications mentioned above as the frequency range of the peak amplitudes goes from approximately 1. 5 kHz to 12 kHz, whereas conventional ANC applications consider a maximum of 1. 5 kHz. This paper will review the application of ANC at low frequencies and justify an approach for dealing with dental noise using digital technologies at higher frequencies. The limits of current ANC technologies will be highlighted and the means of improving performance for this dental application will be explored. In particular, technicalities of implementing filtering algorithms on a Digital Signal Processor will be addressed...|$|R
