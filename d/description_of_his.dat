5|$|Today, Beebe's 1915 <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{hypothetical}} four-winged bird ancestor {{is regarded}} as prescient, {{and there is no}} doubt that Microraptor looks startlingly similar to the almost-century old Tetrapteryx illustrations. After its discovery, Microraptor had the effect of both reinvigorating the arboreal hypothesis as well as finally putting an end to the widespread acceptance of Heilmann's disregard for the Tetrapteryx theory.|$|E
5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E
5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E
5|$|By his own <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early family life, Cody grew up poor. His {{mother worked}} two jobs, as a {{traveling}} nurse and a bus driver, {{to care for}} him and his seven younger siblings. His parents were not married, but his father, a construction worker, {{was a big part of}} his life until he died in a car accident when Cody was 11. At the end of his junior year of high school, Cody moved in with the family of a high school teammate.|$|E
5|$|From 1994 to 1995 Tomlinson {{worked in}} the {{operational}} counter-proliferation department. His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in penetrating the Iranian Intelligence Service. He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included Nahum Manbar. The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.|$|E

5|$|He {{also wrote}} essays on film, {{published}} as the collections: Our Films, Their Films (1976), Bishoy Chalachchitra (1976), and Ekei Bole Shooting (1979). During the mid-1990s, Ray's film essays and {{an anthology of}} short stories were also published in English in the West. Our Films, Their Films is an anthology of film criticism by Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book {{is presented in two}} sections: Ray first discusses Indian film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and movements such as Italian neorealism. His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as Speaking of Films. It contains a compact <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> philosophy of different aspects of the cinemas.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, LaBeouf {{spoke about}} the {{plagiarism}} accusations with Bleeding Cool writer Rich Johnston, where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and {{that it did not}} allow for ideas to flow freely. LaBeouf later tweeted a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> next project, Daniel Boring (a reference to David Boring, another comic created by Clowes). The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|Richard Armitage {{secured the}} role of Lee {{when he arrived at}} his {{audition}} wearing a pair of old boots, something that greatly impressed producer Spencer Campbell. In order to match the scripted <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character, Armitage began a heavy workout regimen and took aqua-aerobics lessons to better understand Lee's profession. His first scene was a sex scene with Ramona. Despite leaving the series in 2001, Fay Ripley was persuaded to return to the programme for one last appearance as Jenny in the final episode. To make sure the rest of the cast agreed to return, their salaries were increased to £75,000 per episode, a 50% increase on their pay for the fourth series (though Joseph earned less).|$|E

5|$|Stela 40 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} Temple 29. It has been dated to AD 468 and depicts 5th-century king K'an Chitam. He is holding up a Teotihuacan-style headdress in one hand. The sides of the {{monument}} are sculpted with depictions of his father, Siyaj Chan K'awill II, and his mother, Lady Ayiin. A lengthy hieroglyphic text on the back details his birth in 415, his promotion to a junior rank in 434 and his accession to the throne in 458, as well as a brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's reign.|$|E
5|$|Circus 108A cost Fighter Command 8 fighters for 15 claims. The {{squadron}} {{celebrated with}} {{a night of}} drinking. Walking back to their quarters Finucane jumped Croydon Town hall's stone balustrade parapet which hid an 18-foot drop the other side which broke his heel bone {{and put him in}} hospital for several weeks. Finucane was treated in Horton Hospital which specialised in combat wounds. While recovering Finucane was sent messages of congratulations by Trafford Leigh-Mallory AOC 11 Group. The Air Ministry sought to take advantage of Finucane's reputation by asking him to assist with morale and propaganda activities. On 22 October he read out an Air Ministry-approved <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> service for the BBC radio programme The World Goes By from his hospital bed. Finucane was moved to RAF Halton in Wendover, Buckinghamshire on 14 November 1941. On 22 November he moved to the former luxury Palace Hotel in Torquay. Upon arrival Finucane was asked to leave for London to receive the DSO and two bars to the DFC on 25 November with his brother and parents. That day King George VI personally decorated Finucane at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives a brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not}} have sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this account}} is {{extremely}} short, particularly compared to Paul the Apostle's much fuller <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own circumcision {{in the third}} chapter of his Epistle to the Philippians.

25|$|Adam Helmer was an {{important}} but fictionalized character in Edmonds' novel, Drums Along the Mohawk. Although Helmer's military actions were generally portrayed with accuracy, including his famous run, Edmonds' <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> person varies from historic description. The book pictures Helmer as a large, unschooled, bachelor womanizer with long blonde hair, while historic descriptions indicate he was a lean , married farmer, seeming to {{have more in common}} with the book's main character, Gil Martin.|$|E
25|$|Given that Richard's {{name for}} the kadam tree is incorrect, the {{earliest}} name is William Roxburgh's 1824 Nauclea cadamba. In 1984, Jean Marie Bosser created the new generic name Neolamarckia, honouring Lamarck, for the Asian genus which matched Richard's <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Anthocephalus, transferring Nauclea cadamba as Neolamarckia cadamba (Roxb.) Bosser. However, not all botanical sources have accepted this taxonomic analysis and the name Anthocephalus is still in use for the Asian genus.|$|E
