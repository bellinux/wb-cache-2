50|$|Tourists rent homes <b>and</b> cabanas <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> in hostels <b>and</b> small hotels. Most of {{the hotels}} and hostels are open only during the high season; however, some like El Diablo Tranquilo are open year-round to {{accommodate}} {{the increasing number of}} visitors to the seaside village. In response several restaurants including fine-dining options are also open off-season.|$|R
50|$|The plot culminates with Tarika {{having to}} make a {{decision}} to either run away with the unpredictable <b>and</b> fun Tricia <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> attempt to build a life with a more stable, yet seemingly incompatible Charlotte.|$|R
50|$|In Iran, {{there are}} {{different}} sections {{for men and women}} on public buses. Women enter buses from the back door, which is separated from the men’s entrance, <b>and</b> should sit <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> in a limited zone {{at the end of the}} buses which is separated from men’s zone. But Farahnaz Shiri, the first female bus driver in Tehran, has made her own little society in her bus. In this bus everything is vice versa. Mrs. Shiri is the governor and the only law maker of her own little society. In her bus, men must enter from the backdoor entrance <b>and</b> must sit <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> in the limited zone at the end of the bus.|$|R
40|$|The BCG 1619 c gene of Mycobacterium bovis {{bacillus}} Calmette-Guérin (BCG) encodes for a 24 kDa invasin-like {{protein and}} {{is identical to}} the Rv 1566 c gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To assess whether this protein was necessary for <b>entry</b> <b>and</b> (<b>or)</b> intracellular persistence in professional phagocytes <b>and</b> (<b>or)</b> in lung epithelial cells, a BCG 1619 c knockout mutant of M. bovis BCG was generated and compared with the parental BCG strain for its ability to infect and multiply in human monocyte derived THP- 1 cells and in the lung epithelial cell line A 549. No significant difference between the mutated and the parental BCG strain was observed in either of these in vitro infection systems, indicating that the BCG 1619 c gene is not essential for cell invasion and intracellular growth of BCG...|$|R
50|$|In February 1993 the Commission {{supported}} the Murrays' application in part.

The case went to a public hearing on 24 January 1994.|$|R
30|$|We {{time the}} {{analysis}} in two ways, whether the individual starts a business {{within five years}} of graduating, which we refer to as early entrepreneurial entry. We then redo the analysis defining as lifetime entrepreneurs those who ever started a business after graduating. Academic diversity should be more important for early <b>entry,</b> <b>and</b> occupational <b>or</b> industrial diversity should matter more for lifetime entry.|$|R
50|$|Tourism is also {{significant}} because many visitors spend {{time on the}} Lake Huron shore, including three beaches near Goderich, <b>and</b> may shop <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> overnight in town. Goderich has festivals and events each year that appeal to some visitors {{as well as local}} attractions.|$|R

5000|$|When {{they began}} work on the new album in 2005, Thes One and Double K were feeling that sample-based hip hop was {{becoming}} repetitive and gravitating increasingly toward overused jazz samples. They {{even went so far}} as to feel critical of the success of their final Om releases, O.S.T. <b>and</b> ...<b>Or</b> <b>Stay</b> Tuned. The group was also unhappy with the rise in internet music piracy and the drive by music companies to push artists toward [...] "hot singles" [...] and away from themed albums. Due to all these factors, People Under the Stairs made a conscious decision to be as different and unique as possible in their attempt to create a cohesive album with a broader, less jazzy sound palette. They felt they had to step away from what they perceived as a stale hip hop scene as it existed in Los Angeles.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{some models}} for vehicular traffic flow based on hyperbolic balance laws. We focus in particular on source terms for modeling highway <b>entries</b> <b>and</b> exits <b>or</b> local {{changes of the}} traffic flow due to inhomogeneities of the road. Rigorous well-posedness results and numerical investigations are presented. We show in particular how real phenomena (e. g. {{the formation of a}} queue) that are not captured by conservative systems are instead observable with our models...|$|R

The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to emphasize those advantages as well as presenting the different types of Database Replication and the cases in which their use is recommended...|$|R
5000|$|Stray Dogs (2001). Stray Dogs is Crouch's first feature-length film. IMDB {{describes}} the film as: [...] "A mother must choose between love and devotion to her sons <b>and</b> unborn child <b>or</b> <b>staying</b> with her sexy, maniacal husband and his patriarchal sister, who respectively fulfill her {{physical and emotional}} needs." [...] The film starred Guinevere Turner.|$|R

Nay, {{he would not be}} butchered like a bird on a bough, he would fall fighting.|$|R
40|$|The Undecided-State Dynamics is a {{well-known}} protocol that achieves Consensus in distributed systems formed {{by a set of}} n anonymous nodes interacting via a communication network. We consider this dynamics in the parallel communication model on the complete graph for the binary case, i. e., when every node can either support one of two possible colors (say, <b>and)</b> <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> in the undecided state. Previous work in this setting only considers initial color configurations with no undecided nodes and a large bias (i. e., Θ(n)) towards the majority color. A major open question here is whether this dynamics reaches consensus quickly, i. e. within a polylogarithmic number of rounds. In this paper we present an unconditional analysis of the Undecided-State Dynamics which answers to the above question in the affermative. Our analysis shows that, starting from any initial configuration, the Undecided-State Dynamics reaches a monochromatic configuration within O(^ 2 n) rounds, with high probability (w. h. p.). ...|$|R
50|$|Viruses are {{extremely}} diverse in nature. Even their method of storing genetic information differs tremendously, from double-stranded DNA to negative sense RNA, as denoted in the Baltimore Classification System. Other features, such as <b>entry</b> <b>and</b> release details, <b>or</b> capsid structure {{may be important}} in classifying and understanding viruses.|$|R

50|$|Motorway service {{areas in}} the United Kingdom, also known as 'service stations' or 'services', are places where drivers can leave a {{motorway}} to refuel/recharge, rest, eat <b>and</b> drink, shop <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> in an on-site overnight hotel. The vast majority of motorway services in the UK are owned by one of three companies: Moto, Welcome Break and Roadchef. Smaller operators include Extra, Westmorland and EuroGarages.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} the effect of market {{concentration}} on firm survival is different according to whether an industry is static (low <b>entry</b> <b>and</b> exit) <b>or</b> dynamic. In our empirical analysis we find support for this hypothesis. Industry concentration rates reduce the survival of new plants but only in markets marked by low <b>entry</b> <b>and</b> exit rates. Specifically, a 10 percent increase in the 5 -firm concentration ratio in a dynamic market raises the survival rate of new ventures by approximately 2 percent. Our results have implications for the antitrust/competition law indicating less need for regulation of dominant firms in dynamic industries characterized by high <b>entry</b> <b>and</b> exit rates. We use a unique dataset comprising the population of new ventures that enter the UK market in 1998 new firms, start-ups, survival, dynamism, competition policy, industry concentration...|$|R
50|$|His {{concerns}} end {{up being}} well-founded after Ronk uses the party to remove any memories of the fake distress call and Suko discovers a subterranean mine where Ronk forces captives to work as slaves. The Cynro crew is unable {{to decide whether they}} should return to their ship <b>and</b> escape <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> help the slaves gain freedom. This choice is ultimately made for them when the slaves revolt and the ensuing battle forces the crew to leave the planet, leaving behind their commander and Suko, who is dying. The film ends with the natives burying Suko.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} alien grandfather, Scrooge has such fun reliving his younger {{days in the}} Yukon that he is torn between two choices - go back to Earth with family <b>and</b> friends <b>or</b> <b>stay</b> in space <b>and</b> have the {{adventure}} of his life. This dilemma is cut abruptly short when an alien police patrol appears, having come after the unlicensed warp speed device that was {{the root cause of}} the whole adventure. The police are decidedly unfriendly to ugly, evil aliens such as the ducks, so the ducks take the warp speed device back into the Money Bin and flee back to Earth.|$|R
