25|$|Bluespotted {{trevally}} are occasionally {{caught by}} recreational fishermen on various baits and lures, and {{are considered to}} a <b>good</b> <b>sport</b> fish, but tend to be overshadowed by giant trevally and bluefin trevally in reputation.|$|E
25|$|Yellowfin whiting {{have become}} a major target for anglers in both South and Western Australia {{for a number of}} reasons: they are very good table fish, they provide <b>good</b> <b>sport</b> on light line, and are easily {{accessible}} from beaches and jetties, with a boat not necessary for their capture. Yellowfin whiting are actually most commonly targeted from beaches, estuaries and jetties constructed over shallow waters, with good catches often made on the ingoing and outgoing period of the tide. Due to their easily spooked nature, tackle used to capture the fish is usually very light, with lines kept below 6kg, hooks below size 4, and sinkers to an absolute minimum as heavy lines and sinkers often scare away the fish. Specialist whiting fishermen often attach a red bead or piece of tubing directly above the hook to attract the fish, although the usefulness of this is debated. The most common bait used is 'beach worms', which may be from a variety of families, with prawns, cockles and squid occasionally taking good catches also. Lure and fly fishing for the species is poorly developed, with their shy nature preventing these methods from being effectively used.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is of major {{importance}} to commercial fisheries {{in the central}} Indo-Pacific region (including India), and of moderate to minor importance elsewhere. Statistics recorded by the FAO do not include India, however even without this country the annual take of torpedo scad has increased from 70 000 t in 1997 to 107 000 t in 2007. On {{the basis of these}} statistics, the biggest utiliser of the species is Indonesia, with a take of 42 000 t followed by Malaysia with a take of 22 000 t. Thailand and the Philippines also take large quantities of the fish, with around 18 000 t each annually. Middle Eastern countries also record this species in their hauls, but at lower amounts of between 50 and 5000 t. In more southerly regions such as South Africa, it is a rare catch, usually appearing in beach seines. The species is taken by a variety of netting methods such as beach seines, trawls, purse seines and other types of trap including hook and line. It is usually marketed fresh, dried or salted. Torpedo scad are often caught by recreational fishermen throughout their range, however are not considered a target for gamefishing. They readily take small lures and are <b>good</b> <b>sport</b> on light tackle. Torpedo scad are said to have fair to good quality flesh, however are not very popular. Some chefs recommend frying or steaming the fish, although grilling is also acceptable. In polluted waters it has been demonstrated the fish contain higher than acceptable levels of heavy metals, and should be avoided in such regions. Torpedo scad are often used as live baits for larger gamefish.|$|E

[...] Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski of IGN marked Hamill's guest appearance second {{on a list of}} [...] "Top 25 Simpsons Guest appearances" [...] saying that much of the episode's humor came from Hamill being [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>sport</b> about his past". In addition, Hamill ranked 18th on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars, and Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked his performance as the third-best guest appearance in the show's history.

500|$|In 2007, Paige made {{a return}} to the West End stage {{for the first time in}} six years, as the Chaperone/Beatrice Stockwell in The Drowsy Chaperone at the Novello Theatre. The {{production}} ran for a disappointing 96 performances, although it had opened to a standing ovation from the audience and a generally optimistic reaction from critics. The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Elaine Paige is a <b>good</b> <b>sport...</b> enduring jokes about her reputation for being 'difficult' with a grin that doesn't seem all that forced.... Only the self-importantly serious and the chronically depressed will fail to enjoy this preposterously entertaining evening". Paul Taylor from The Independent was less impressed and wrote [...] "a miscast Elaine Paige manages to be unfunny to an almost ingenious degree as the heroine's bibulous minder". For her performance, Paige was nominated for a What's On Stage Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Musical.

[...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented that Damon was [...] "incredibly charming" [...] and funny. Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: [...] "If it weren't for some inspired guest stars — Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning {{it up on the}} dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot — this season would be an awfully sad misfire." [...] Wales on Sundays Wil Marlow called Damon's performance {{one of the most memorable}} guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he [...] "held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode [...] "flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo", but [...] "Damon is a <b>good</b> <b>sport</b> with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom than he has in his last three films." [...] Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, said Damon was [...] "magnificent" [...] in the episode and a [...] "great experience" [...] for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E
500|$|The Red Sox were {{presented}} with their World Series rings on April 11, 2005, at a ceremony before the team's first home game of the 2005 season. Former Red Sox players Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Carl Yastrzemski were all present, as were the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Boston Pops Orchestra. During the ceremony, five red pennants were first unfurled {{at the top of}} the Green Monster, showing the years of each of the Red Sox' previous World Series wins. A much larger banner was unfurled that covered the entire wall and read [...] "2004 World Series Champions." [...] James Taylor, himself a Boston native and a Red Sox fan, performed [...] "America the Beautiful", and 19 members of the United States Army and Marine Corps who had fought in the Iraq War walked onto the field. Moments of silence were held to honor the deaths of Pope John Paul II, who had died nine days earlier, and former Red Sox relief pitcher, Dick Radatz. The rings were handed out by the team's owner, John W. Henry. Former Red Sox players Lowe and Dave Roberts, who had joined the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres respectively during the off-season, were also present to collect their rings. The ceremony, which lasted around an hour, ended with stars from other Boston sports teams, including the Celtics' Bill Russell, the Bruins' Bobby Orr and the Patriots' Tedy Bruschi and Richard Seymour, throwing ceremonial first pitches. The presence of Bruschi and Seymour made evident the recent success of Boston-area teams. The day after the Red Sox won the Series, Shaughnessy and the rest of the news media said of the Red Sox home opener: [...] "The team in the third-base dugout? The New York Yankees, Sweet." [...] In a sign of respect, the Red Sox rivals came to the top step of the visitors dugout and gave the Red Sox a standing ovation. The Fenway Park crowd burst into cheers when Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera was introduced, breaking from the tradition of fans booing opposing players, due to him having blown save opportunities in Games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS. Rivera was a <b>good</b> <b>sport</b> about it and laughed while waving his arms in mock appreciation of the fans.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Approximately 4. 5 million Australians are {{involved}} in community sports clubs. A high level of alcohol consumption tends to be commonplace in this setting. The only program of its type in the world, the <b>Good</b> <b>Sports</b> program was designed to reduce harmful alcohol consumption in these Australian community sports clubs. The program offers a staged accreditation process to encourage the implementation of alcohol harm-reduction strategies. Method: We conducted a postintervention adoption study to evaluate whether community sports club accreditation through the <b>Good</b> <b>Sports</b> program was associated with lower rates of alcohol consumption. We examined alcohol consumption rates in 113 clubs (N = 1, 968 participants) and compared these to consumption rates in the general community. We hypothesized that members of clubs with more advanced implementation of the <b>Good</b> <b>Sports</b> accreditation program (Stage Two) would consume less alcohol than those with less advanced implementation (Stage One). Results: Multilevel modeling (MLM) indicated that on days when teams competed, Stage Two club members consumed 19 % less alcohol than Stage One club members. MLM also indicated that {{the length of time}} a club had been in the <b>Good</b> <b>Sports</b> program was associated with reduced rates of weekly drinking that exceeded Australian short-term risky drinking guidelines. However consumption rates for all clubs were still higher than the general community. Higher accreditation stage also predicted reduced long-term risky drinking by club members. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that community sports clubs show evidence of higher levels of alcohol consumption and higher rates of risky consumption than the general community. Implementation of the <b>Good</b> <b>Sports</b> accreditation strategy was associated with lower alcohol consumption in these settings. <br /...|$|R
