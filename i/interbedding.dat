40|$|<b>Interbed</b> {{multiple}} reflections contain valuable informa-tion about the subsurface reflectivity distribution that can complement information obtained from primary re-flections and free-surface multiples. In this report two methods are developed {{and used to}} migrate <b>interbed</b> mul-tiples. The first method applies Fermat’s principle to find the specular reflection point along the <b>interbed</b> mul-tiple generating interface; the second method sums all the diffractions bouncing off the multiple generating interface. The first method is more computationally efficient, while the second method utilizes the full Fresnel zone along the <b>interbed</b> multiple generating interface. Numerical tests with synthetic VSP data and field data show that <b>interbed</b> multiples can illuminate areas below salt and can image salt boundaries. One challenge is that <b>interbed</b> {{multiple reflections}} are usually weak, thus the <b>interbed</b> multiple generating interface needs to be strong, and the reflector to be imaged also must be strong in or-der to generate noticeable <b>interbed</b> multiple reflections...|$|R
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>interbeds</b> in thick oil formations {{in one of}} the main reasons that cause the difference of remaining oil distribution. A quantitative method for predicting <b>interbeds</b> was proposed and the sedimentary origin and division criterion were demonstrated. The distribution of <b>interbeds</b> in different types of sedimentary sand bodies were predicted and analyzed by combining the theory of sedimentology and reservoir bed architectural-element analysis. The <b>interbeds</b> in a single well were recognized from high resolution well logs, and inter-well <b>interbeds</b> were predicted by using the methods of cyclothem correlation, physical properties truncation, and conditional simulation. Finally a 3 -D model of <b>interbed</b> was built. Application to the Gudao Oilfield was successful.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCusp {{displacement}} {{catastrophe theory}} can {{be introduced to}} propose a new method about instability failure of the <b>interbed</b> for gas storage cavern in bedded salt in solution mining. We can calculate initial fracture drawing pace of this <b>interbed</b> to obtain 2 D and 3 D gas storage shapes at this time. Moreover, Stability evaluation of strength reduction finite element method (FEM) based on this catastrophe theory can used to evaluate this <b>interbed</b> stability after initial fracture. A specific example is simulated to obtain {{the influence of the}} <b>interbed</b> depth, cavern internal pressure, and cavern building time on stability safety factor (SSF). The results indicate: the value of SSF will be lower with the increase of cavern building time in solution mining and the increase of <b>interbed</b> depth and also this value remains a rise with the increase of cavern internal pressure Especially, we can conclude that the second-fracture of the <b>interbed</b> may take place when this pressure is lower than 6  MPa or after 6 days later of the <b>interbed</b> after initial fracture. According to above analysis, some effective measures, namely elevating the tube {{up to the top of}} the <b>interbed,</b> or changing the circulation of in-and-out lines, can be introduced to avoid the negative effects when the second-fracture of the <b>interbed</b> may occur...|$|R
50|$|The Diuri Formation is then overlain by the Setikhola Formation, {{which is}} {{characterized}} by feldspathic sandstone, shale, graywacke, coal lenses and plant fossils. One sequence consists of <b>interbedding</b> of sandstone and shale and is intensely bioturbated with flames structures observed as well. This indicates a depositional environment of beach or mudflat. Also, another sequence of <b>interbedding</b> calcareous greywacke and carbonaceous shale is found. Ripples and cross-laminae can be observed on the greywacke, while small-scaled sun cracks and slump folds {{can be seen on}} shale. It is proposed that this sequence has a depositional environment of semi-isolated basin. The marine fossils contained here indicate a Permian age of the Setikhola Formation.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} influencing factors {{on the distribution of}} incremental oil displaced by a polymer flood (extra-displaced oil) using numerical reservoir simulation. These factors include the location, area and permeability of a thin low-permeability <b>interbed,</b> and the perforation location relative to the <b>interbed.</b> Simulation results show the locations from where the incremental oil was displaced by the polymer solution. The <b>interbed</b> position from the oil formation top affects the location of extra-displaced oil. The <b>interbed</b> area has a slight influence on the whole shape of extra-displaced oil. Larger <b>interbed</b> area leads to higher partition extent of extra-displaced oil. Higher vertical permeability of <b>interbeds</b> contributes to worse partition extent of extra-displaced oil and the partition effect disappears if the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability is more than 0.05. The perforation location relative to the <b>interbed</b> affects polymer displacement efficiency, and also has a significant effect on the distribution of extra-displaced oil in polymer flooding.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} how {{the characteristics of}} <b>interbeds</b> affect hydraulic fracture propagation in the continental shale formation, a series of 300 mm × 300 mm × 300 mm concrete blocks with varying <b>interbeds,</b> based on outcrop observation and core measurement of Chang 7 - 2 shale formation, were prepared to conduct the hydraulic fracturing experiments. The results reveal that the breakdown pressure increases {{with the rise of}} thickness and strength of <b>interbeds</b> under the same in-situ field stress and injection rate. In addition, for the model blocks with thick and high strength <b>interbeds,</b> the hydraulic fracture has difficulty crossing the <b>interbeds</b> and is prone to divert along the bedding faces, and the fracturing effectiveness is not good. However, for the model blocks with thin and low strength <b>interbeds,</b> more long branches are generated along the main fracture, which is beneficial to the formation of the fracture network. What is more, combining the macroscopic descriptions with microscopic observations, the blocks with thinner and lower strength <b>interbeds</b> tend to generate more micro-fractures, and the width of the fractures is relatively larger on the main fracture planes. Based on the experiments, it is indicated that the propagation of hydraulic fractures is strongly influenced by the characteristics of <b>interbeds,</b> and the results are instructive to the understanding and evaluation of the fracability in the continental shale formation...|$|R

40|$|Most salt rock has <b>interbed</b> of {{mudstone}} in China. Owing to {{the enormous}} difference of mechanical properties between the mudstone <b>interbed</b> and salt rock, the stress-strain and creep behaviors of salt rock are significantly influenced by neighboring mudstone <b>interbed.</b> In order to identify the rules of wellbore shrinkage and casings equivalent stress in bedded salt rock stratum, three-dimensional finite difference models were established. The effects of thickness and elasticity modulus of mudstone <b>interbed</b> on the open wellbore shrinkage and equivalent stress of casing after cementing operation were studied, respectively. The {{results indicate that the}} shrinkage of open wellbore and equivalent stress of casings decreases with the increase of mudstone <b>interbed</b> thickness.

50|$|Basement rocks {{consist of}} Ordovician clastic sediments {{consisting}} of phyllite with some sandstone <b>interbedding.</b> At about 13.8 Ma, the dome was extruded.

The dacite dome is 1700 m by 1200 m at the surface and narrows down to the 100 m wide dike at depth. Hydrothermal circulation and fracturing soon followed, altering the dacite and depositing ore minerals and gangue in the veins.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{appearance}} of glacial diamictite and index plant fossils found in the Lower and Upper Gondwanas respectively, it has been proposed that the Lesser Himalaya had {{been a part of}} Gondwanaland during the Permian to Cretaceous. Later on, the presence of basaltic lava flows indicate a tectonic setting related to basaltic volcanism as the volcanic clasts were derived from the underlying lava and transported by rivers from Gondwana land. The <b>interbedding</b> layers of fluvial sediments and basaltic lava bands imply that there was repeated occurrence of basaltic eruption and erosion and sedimentation of fluvial deposits alternatively.

5000|$|The {{formation}} of badlands {{is a result}} of two processes: deposition and erosion. The process of deposition describes the accumulation, over time, of layers of mineral material. Different environments such as seas, rivers, or tropical zones, deposit different sorts of clays, silts, and sand. For instance, the badlands formations in Badlands National Park, South Dakota, underwent a 47-million year period of deposition which spanned three major geologic periods (the Cretaceous Period, the Late Eocene, and the Oligocene Epochs), resulting in clear, distinct layers of sediment which serve as a dramatic display of the law of superposition. Once the deposited sediments have solidified, the sedimentary material becomes subject to erosion. It is sometimes erroneously taught that badlands erode at a steady rate of about 1 inch per year. [...] In actuality, the precise processes by which the erosion responses take place vary depending on the precise <b>interbedding</b> of the sedimentary material. In 2010, researchers at Badlands National Park initiated a 3-year project {{to learn more about the}} actual erosion rate of the specific badlands found in that park.|$|E

Glacial dropstones are found in the <b>interbedding,</b> suggesting Cryogenian age, however carbon isotope results suggest Ediacaran age instead.

5000|$|... "Sag-wide Oil-Bearing Theory" [...] in the hydrocarbon-rich {{depression}} was the conclusion drew by Zhao and his research team in 2004, after he paid long research of nearly 10 years. This theory is {{the extension of}} the “Source kitchen Control Accumulation” and “Composite Plays of Hydrocarbon Accumulations” conducted by previous Chinese geologists in the 1970s-1980s. Sag-wide oil-bearing theory means that there is everywhere for oil/gas accumulation occurrence in the source-rich sag and depression, due to the frequent contact of reservoir and source rock, and formation of lithological traps as well. This theory emphasizes that the following conditions are necessary for sag-wide oil-bearing pattern formation: ①existence and widespread distribution of good quality source rocks; ②large-scale sandwich-type association of source rock <b>interbedding</b> with reservoirs;③suitable geothermal evolution leading to huge amount of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion to provide sufficient source for accumulation in all porous sandbodies. Based on his research, the major mechanism for the sag-wide oil-bearing distribution in the flat and tectonic low areas is: ①the pressure difference between source and reservoir caused by the oil/gas generation and provide the major force to drive the hydrocarbon moving in the permeability-low reservoirs;②the density difference of hydrocarbons between source beds and reservoirs, which help oil/gas moving quantitatively in the diffusive way from the source to the reservoir and ③the strong heterogeneity and discontinuity of reservoirs, which help to reduce oil/gas’s energy escaping from the traps and keep the accumulation stable even in the poor sealing condition environment.The major contribution of this theory to the further and future exploration activity is to expand the exploration play from previous local limited structural highs to the whole sags or depressions where are occupied by good-quality source rocks. It is revealed by Dr. Zhao that the formation of lithology-related reservoirs is mainly controlled by three “surfaces”, e.g. the maximum lake flooding surface, unconformities and faulted surface. And most of the hydrocarbon accumulations are dominantly distributed in “five zones”, e.g. favorable sedimentary faces zone, lithological or stratigraphic pinch out belts, slope-breaks at syn-depositional stages, fracture zones and secondary pore zones. The theory also pointed out that further exploration in the hydrocarbon-rich sags or depressions should cover the whole sags and depressions and focus on searching for sweet points.|$|E

A multiphase fluid flow code, TOUGH 2 /EOS 8, was adapted to model the processes of gas generation, disposal room creep closure, and multiphase (brine and gas) fluid flow, {{as well as the}} coupling between the three processes. System response to gas generation was simulated with a single, isolated disposal room surrounded by homogeneous halite containing two anhydrite <b>interbeds,</b> one above and one below the room. The <b>interbeds</b> were assumed to have flow connections to the room through high-permeability, excavation-induced fractures. System behavior was evaluated by tracking four performance measures: (1) peak room pressure; (2) maximum brine volume in the room; (3) total mass of gas expelled from the room; and (4) the maximum gas migration distance in an <b>interbed.</b> Baseline simulations used current best estimates of system parameters, selected through an evaluation of available data, to predict system response to gas generation under best-estimate conditions. Sensitivity simulations quantified the effects of parameter uncertainty by evaluating the change in the performance measures in response to parameter variations.
