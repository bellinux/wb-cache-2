In 2011, S. Theodore Baskaran said, [...] "Tamil films have scant regard for history. Almost always, they confuse between history and folklore," [...] and added, [...] "Kattabomman was not even a king. His arsenal <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> three to four guns." [...] In 2014, Ramu Manivannan, the HOD of politics and public administration at University of Madras, told The Times of India, [...] "The popular images of [...] characters have been constructed from oral descriptions and accounts. In some cases, the popular image overtakes the historical one as in the case of Sivaji Ganesan's portrayal of Kattabomman on the screen." ...|$|E

Allen <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E
