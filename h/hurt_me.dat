It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you <b>hurt</b> <b>me</b> very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world...

I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can <b>hurt</b> <b>me?</b> You don't know about power.

500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others.

500|$|Lynott's second solo album, The Philip Lynott Album, {{was delayed}} until 1982 while Renegade was {{completed}} and released in November 1981. Renegade was not successful, only reaching no. 38 in the UK and no. 157 in the US. A single, [...] "Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)", also flopped, {{although it did}} reach no. 24 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Despite only two songs from the album being written solely by Lynott, {{and other members of}} the band contributing more to the compositions, both Gorham and Wharton have since stated their dissatisfaction with some of the songs, such as [...] "Angel of Death", [...] "Fats" [...] and [...] "Mexican Blood". Wharton was omitted from the band photos on the back of the record sleeve, despite the fact that he was by this time a permanent member of the band. [...] "It <b>hurt</b> <b>me</b> a great deal", he later said.|$|E
500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't <b>hurt</b> <b>me.</b> But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Turning Tables" [...] {{is a song}} of {{domestic}} dispute, where its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative ex-lover. Reconciling herself with the termination of a contentious relationship, she vows emotional distance to shield herself from future heartbreak. Bryan Boyd of The Irish Times likened the singer to 1980s Welsh rocker Bonnie Tyler in delivering the vocals {{with a mixture of}} anger, pain and pathos. According to Paste magazine, cinematic strings [...] "serve as fitting counterpoint to [...] heartbroken, hollowed-out lyrics." [...] "Turning Tables" [...] opens with a piano sequence after which Adele sings the first lines: [...] "Close enough to start a war/All that I have is on the floor". The chorus consists of the lyrics: [...] "So I won't let you / Close enough to <b>hurt</b> <b>me</b> / No, I won't rescue / You to just desert me / I can't give you / The heart you think you gave me / It's time to say goodbye / To turning tables." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it <b>hurt</b> <b>me,</b> but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E
500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't <b>hurt</b> <b>me</b> now, I got away from you, I never thought I would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you <b>hurt</b> <b>me,</b> baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
