50|$|In 1953, Martin E. Ismert, Jr., (Ed), {{left his}} father-in-law's {{plumbing}} supply business and partnered with his brother, Jerry, to form Double I Supply (Double I for the initials {{of their last}} name), in Kansas City, Missouri. Ed, Jerry and others formed Sioux Chief in 1957. The company's first proprietary product was the foldable magnesium rod, designed to replace conventional rods for water heaters, which were made of straight pipe {{and had to be}} cut out of the heaters in sections when replaced. Typically inserted from the tops of the units, the long rods could not clear the ceilings of the locations where the majority of the hot water heaters were installed. The same was true of the replacements rods. Ed's <b>folding</b> <b>rod</b> allowed them to be inserted into the heaters a fold at a time.|$|E

50|$|The Model 1886 {{featured}} the new sight created by Lieutenant Colonel R. A. Buffington {{that had been}} incorporated into the Springfield Model 1884 rifle. The stock had a storage compartment for a three piece <b>folding</b> cleaning <b>rod</b> and a ruptured case extractor. The upper barrel band also had a curved swivel sling design that allowed it to fit close to the stock when the rifle {{was placed in a}} saddle boot. The Model 1886 did not have the lower barrel band that had been present on the Model 1882 short rifle. The rifle was fitted with a 24 inch barrel and a full walnut stock.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Drawing of Yagi - Uda VHF {{television}} antenna from 1954, {{used for}} analogue channels 2 - 4, 54 - 72 MHz (USA channels). It has five elements: three directors (to left) one reflector (to right) and a driven element {{which is a}} <b>folded</b> dipole (double <b>rod)</b> to match the 300 Ω twin lead feedline. The beam direction (direction of greatest sensitivity) is to the left.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{anti-aircraft}} artillery projectiles {{were designed to}} fragment into long, thin pieces {{in an attempt to}} inflict damage on the airframe. Holes made by such fragments were more likely to cause destructive disruption of airflow around high-speed aircraft, but the hit probability was lowered for the smaller number of fragments from a warhead of equal size. The problem became more significant as anti-aircraft missiles were developed to replace guns after World War II. A smaller number of missiles would require an improved warhead to match the aircraft destruction probability of the larger number of artillery projectiles potentially carried by a weapon of the same size and cost. Some [...] to increase the probability of aircraft destruction. The concept of a <b>folded</b> continuous <b>rod</b> warhead was suggested in 1952.|$|R
50|$|The {{barrel of}} the mortar was steel. Aasen mortar was a breech loading weapon so a shell was loaded {{separately}} and the bolt action discharging a blank rifle round connected to a barrel. This device was a modified form of the obsolete Gras rifle, which was transferred to Russia by France in substantial numbers. The hoisting mechanism was made of two slats, attached {{to the rear of}} the barrel, and <b>rod</b> <b>folding</b> rack. The weight of the mortar in firing mode was approximately 1.5 pood (54.2 lbs).|$|R
5000|$|During {{its service}} life, the weapon was modernized several times. Initially, the gas block was {{modified}} {{as was the}} rear sight, where the windage adjustment knob for the rear sight {{was moved to the}} left side of the notch. Later, the RPD was modified with a non-reciprocating cocking mechanism with a folding charging handle (replacing the fixed charging handle connected to the bolt carrier) that does not move during firing. The feed port received a dust cover, which when open, serves as a feeding ramp for the ammunition belt. This version of the light machine gun was produced mainly in China and Poland. A further modified variant (sometimes referred to as the RPDM) includes an extended gas cylinder and a recoil buffer mechanism in the stock. Late production RPD variants also had the fixed drum attachment removed (instead, the ammunition container was [...] "hung" [...] from the feed port cover) and feature a <b>folding</b> cleaning <b>rod,</b> that is stored in the weapon's butt (in the Chinese Type 56-1 variant).|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{polyurethane}} or vinyl {{materials are}} {{used to make the}} bag. A tube shaped bag is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into the bag and the ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of the bag is by placing a clamp on each end of the bag. A plastic rod is laid across the end of the bag, the bag is then <b>folded</b> over the <b>rod.</b> A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal {{at both ends of the}} bag, when the vacuum is ready to be drawn.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the integrability of the {{stationary}} Kirchhoff equations describing {{an elastic}} <b>rod</b> <b>folded</b> {{in the shape}} of a circular helix was proven. In this paper we explicitly work out the solutions to the stationary Kirchhoff equations in the presence of a long-range potential which describes the average constant force due to a Morse-type interaction acting among the points of the rod. The average constant force results to be parallel to the normal vector to the central line of the folded rod; this condition remarkably permits to preserve the integrability (indeed the solvability) of the corresponding Kirchhoff equations if the elastic rod features constant or periodic stiffnesses and vanishing intrinsic twist. Furthermore, we discuss the elastic energy density with respect to the radius and pitch of the helix, showing the existence of stationary points, namely stable and unstable configurations, for plausible choices of the featured parameters corresponding to a real bio-polymer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe epitope {{recognised}} by the anti-dystrophin monoclonal antibodies MANDYS 141 and MANDYS 142 {{has been}} characterised using a phage display peptide library and a bacteriophage lambda cDNA library. Using a phage display library of random 15 -mer peptides, the epitope recognised {{by the two}} antibodies was identified as EEXF. A λgt 11 clone obtained by screening a human muscle cDNA library was shown to contain part of the out-of-frame human mitochondrial succinyl CoA synthetase (α-subunit) cDNA sequence which contains the sequence EEPL, suggesting a minimum requirement of EEXF/L for antibody binding. The sequence EEDF {{is located in the}} helical rod region of dystrophin and the N-terminal domain of α-actinin; this may explain why native dystrophin is not detected, since the α-helical, coiled-coil <b>folding</b> of the <b>rod</b> region of dystrophin may obscure the epitope in the native protein. The antibody cross-reaction between dystrophin and α-actinin is likely to be fortuitous and not due to any structural homology that exists between these two members of the spectrin superfamily...|$|R
40|$|Background:Myosin VI plays diverse {{cellular}} roles {{ranging from}} intracellular transport to mechanical anchor. Results:Myosin VI LAE undergoes reversible, lipid membrane-dependent conformational changes from compact bundle <b>fold</b> to extended <b>rod</b> shape. Conclusion: LAE functions as the “knee joint ” of myosin VI and provides both space and flexibility for stepping. Significance: The membrane-induced expansion of LAE provides a mechanistic base for myosin VI {{to walk with}} large and variable step sizes. Myosin VI, the only known minus-ended actin filament-de-pendent motor, plays diverse cellular roles both as a processive motor and as a mechanical anchor. Although myosin VI has a short lever arm containing only one “IQ-motif ” and a unique insertion for CaM binding, the motor walks with large and vari-able step sizes of 30 – 36 nm. Here, we show that the previously predicted coiled-coil domain immediately following the IQ-mo-tifs (referred to as the lever arm extension (LAE)) adopts a stable monomeric, three-helix bundle fold in solution. Importantly...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{materials}} that are active at nanometer scales and adaptive to environment have been highly desirable for a huge array of novel applications ranging from photonics, sensing, fuel cells, smart materials to drug delivery and miniature robots. These bio-inspired features imply that the underlying structure {{of this type of}} materials should possess a well-defined ordering as well as the ability to reconfigure in response to a given external stimulus such as temperature, electric field, pH or light. In this thesis, we employ computer simulation as a design tool, demonstrating that various ordered and reconfigurable structures can be obtained from the self- and directed-assembly of soft matter nano-building blocks such as nanoparticles, polymer-tethered nanoparticles and colloidal particles. We show that, besides thermodynamic parameters, the self-assembly of these building blocks is governed by nanoparticle geometry, the number and attachment location of tethers, solvent selectivity, balance between attractive and repulsive forces, nanoparticle size polydispersity, and field strength. We demonstrate that higher-order nanostructures, i. e. those for which the correlation length is much greater than the length scale of individual assembling building blocks, can be hierarchically assembled. For instance, bilayer sheets formed by laterally tethered <b>rods</b> <b>fold</b> into spiral scrolls and helical structures, which are able to adopt different morphologies depending on the environmental condition. We find that a square grid structure formed by laterally tethered nanorods can be transformed into a bilayer sheet structure, and vice versa, upon shortening, or lengthening, the rod segments, respectively. From these inspiring results, we propose a general scheme by which shape-shifting particles are employed to induce the reconfiguration of pre-assembled structures. Finally, we investigate the role of an external field in assisting the formation of assembled structures that would not be accessible from self-assembly. As an example, we show the assembly of magnetic Janus particles with a highly ordered alignment and a tunable gradient density, which are likely to be applicable to photonic band gap materials. Our results and proposed methods serve not only as proofs of concept for designing functional nanostructured materials via "bottom-up" approaches, but also to inspire further theoretical and experimental investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the feasibility of producing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) from the waste during wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedling juice processing by using different concentration of alkaline, acid treatments and drying methods and then measure the physicochemical properties of wheat seedling pomace MCC powders as well as the effects on the texture of jelly products. The results showed that the amount of crude fiber was 39 % and α-cellulose content through purification procedure was 72 - 77 %, so it was adequate to produce wheat seedling pomace MCC. By the manufacturing procedure of this study, either the X-ray diffraction angle or FTIR spectrum of wheat seedling pomace MCC were almost the same as the commercial one so that it represented that the method of this study was available to produce MCC. When using 17. 5 %NaOH, it would cause transformation from cellulose Ⅰto cellulose Ⅱ, besides, 17. 5 %NaOH-treated samples (cellulose Ⅱ) had higher crystallinity index by XRD and FTIR, and it also had properties of high heat stable abilities, bulk desities and etc,. The DP of 17. 5 %NaOH-treated samples (cellulose Ⅰ) was close to the commercial one and its freeze-dried samples could maintain better long rod shape on SEM graph. According to different acid treatments, HCl-treated samples had better CrI, higher heat degradation temperature, and bulk and tapping densities than H 2 SO 4 -treated samples. On the aspect of different drying methods, vacuum-dried samples were spherical-like because of the <b>folding</b> of <b>rod</b> fibers, and the 1. 5 % NaOH-treated following freeze-dried samples had two to four folds of WRC compared with the other ones. Furthermore, when applying to the jelly products for texture analysis, almost all the hardness, gumminess, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness and resilience of wheat seedling MCC jelly were higher than the commercial one. At last, according to the result of sensory evaluation, almost all of the samples were better than the commercial one on all the parameters, but there were no differences between them. In summary, we could know that producing wheat seedling MCC was available, and in addition to improve the quality of food, it could achieve the goal of utilization of agricultural wastes as well. 本研究擬探討利用不同鹼濃度、酸處理及乾燥方法製備小麥草渣微晶纖維素之可行性，並探討小麥草微晶纖維素物化特性及添加於果凍中對其質地之影響。結果發現，小麥草渣之粗纖維含量約占 39 %，且經純化處理可得約 72 - 77 %之α-纖維素含量，可用來製作小麥草渣微晶纖維素。利用本實驗的微晶纖維素製作方法，不管在X-ray繞射角度或FTIR圖譜上皆和市售樣品極為相似，顯示以本實驗之方法製備微晶纖維素之可行性。使用 17. 5 %NaOH可有效使cellulose Ⅰ轉換到cellulose Ⅱ，另外也使 17. 5 %NaOH處理樣品 (cellulose Ⅱ) 在X-ray及FTIR上都有較高的結晶度產生，而其也具有熱穩定性高、體積密度高等特性。 1. 5 %NaOH處理樣品 (cellulose Ⅰ) 的聚合度與市售樣品較相近類似，而其冷凍乾燥樣品在SEM上可維持較好的纖維長條形狀。在不同酸處理方面，鹽酸處理樣品比起硫酸樣品具有較好結晶度、高熱裂解溫度、高體積和振實密度。在不同乾燥方法，真空乾燥樣品多呈因棒狀纖維堆疊的球狀，而冷凍乾燥在 1. 5 %NaOH處理下，保水力是其他組的 2 - 4 倍。從果凍上應用來看，幾乎所有小麥草渣MCC果凍於質地分析之硬度、膠性、彈性、黏聚性、咀嚼度跟回復性都要比市售質地來得高。最後由感官品評結果發現，添加市售和小麥草渣微晶纖維素之果凍樣品於混濁度、硬度、Q度及整體接受度皆優於未添加微晶纖維素之果凍樣品，不過各樣品間較無顯著差異。因此，綜合上述，可知利用搾汁剩餘的小麥草渣製作微晶纖維素是可行的，除了可達到改善食品品質外，也達到農業廢棄物回收利用的目的。摘要	I Abstract	III 目錄	V 表目錄	X 圖目錄	XI 壹、前言	 1 貳、文獻回顧	 2 一、小麥草簡介	 2 二、纖維素及其衍生物	 5 (一) 纖維素 (Cellulose) 、木質素 (Lignin) 及半纖維素 (Hemicellulose) 介紹	 5 a、纖維素 (Cellulose) 	 5 b、木質素(Lignin) 	 7 c、半纖維素 (Hemicellulose) 	 7 (三) 不同cellulose type之介紹	 9 a、Cellulose I,Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ之定義	 9 b、Cellulose I和Ⅱ之差異	 10 c、鹼作用對纖維素之影響	 10 d、Cellulose I和Ⅱ之x-ray之繞射	 12 e、Cellulose I和Ⅱ之FTIR光譜	 13 三、微晶纖維素 (Microcrystalline Cellulose) 	 20 (一) 背景	 20 (二) 簡介	 20 (三) 來源及功用	 21 (四) 不同微晶纖維素之理化特性	 24 a、粉末級MCC (Powder type MCC) 	 24 b、膠態級MCC (Colloidal type MCC) 	 24 四、不同乾燥方法介紹	 25 (一) 	真空乾燥	 25 (二) 	冷凍乾燥	 25 參、	研究目的 	 27 肆、	材料與方法	 28 一、	試藥	 28 二、	小麥草	 29 三、	搾汁	 31 四、	熱風乾燥	 31 五、	小麥草渣粉製備	 31 六、	小麥草渣微晶纖維素之製備	 31 七、	基本成分分析	 32 (一) 	水分	 32 (二) 	灰分	 32 (三) 	粗脂肪	 34 (四) 	粗蛋白	 34 (五) 	粗纖維	 35 (六) 	金屬離子含量	 35 八、	小麥草渣MCC粉末特性測定	 36 (一) 	α- 纖維素含量測定	 36 (二) 	場發式電子顯微鏡 (Field-emission scanning electron microscope, FE-SEM) 微結構觀察	 37 (三) 	結晶度 (Crystallinity index, CrI) 及結晶大小 (Crystallite size) 測定	 37 (四) 	聚合度 (Degree of polymerization, DP) 	 39 (五) 	傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜儀 (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, FTIR) 測定	 40 (六) 	熱重分析 (Thermogravimetric analysis) 	 40 (七) 	粒徑分析 (Particle size analysis) 	 41 (八) 	體積密度 (Bulk density) 和 振實密度 (Tapping density) 測定		 41 (九) 	保水力 (Water Retention Capacity, WRC) 	 42 (一) 	小麥草渣MCC果凍樣品的製備	 42 (二) 	小麥草渣MCC應用於果凍樣品對其理化性質影響之測定			 43 a、糖度 (Brix, %) 測定	 43 b、pH值之測定	 43 c、質地剖面分析 (Texture profile analysis, TPA) 	 43 d、感官品評 (Sensory Evaluation) 	 44 九、	統計分析	 44 伍、	結果與討論	 46 一、 基本成分分析	 46 二、小麥草MCC粉末性質測定	 48 (一) α- 纖維素含量測定	 48 (二) SEM微結構觀察	 50 (三) 結晶度 (Crystallinity index, CrI) 及結晶大小 (Crystallite size) 測定	 51 (四) 聚合度 (Degree of polymerization, DP) 	 55 (五) 傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜儀 (FTIR) 測定	 58 (六) 熱重分析 (Thermogravimetric analysis, TGA) 	 69 (七) 粒徑分析 (Particle size analysis) 	 70 (八) 體積密度 (Bulk density) 和 振實密度 (Tapping density) 測定	 74 (九) 保水力 (Water Retention Capacity, WRC) 	 78 (十) 小麥草渣MCC應用於果凍樣品對其理化性質之影響	 81 陸、結論	 88 柒、參考文獻	 9...|$|R
