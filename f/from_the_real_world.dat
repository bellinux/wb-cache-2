The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

50|$|One {{science fiction}} scholar {{points out that}} Rocannon's World, along with Planet of Exile and City of Illusions {{exhibits}} Le Guin's struggle as an emerging writer {{to arrive at a}} plausible, uniquely memorable and straightforward locale for her stories. The tropes in Rocannon's World adhere closely to those of high fantasy, with Clayfolk resembling Dwarves and the Fiia resembling Elves, especially in their dialogue. Additionally, Rocannon's World is noted to be a lightly disguised fantasy in which the legendary characters are easily interpreted by the readers as characters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world's</b> future.|$|R

5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised and seen full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship {{with his wife and}} feelings of sexual desire. The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E

25|$|The Hybrid III {{dummy for}} three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, {{and does not}} provide the same {{physical}} outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When using data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model {{is based on a}} male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.|$|E
25|$|The trio {{visit the}} Wyrmberg, an {{upside-down}} mountain which {{is home to}} dragon-riders who summon their dragons by imagining them, and are separated when the riders attack them. Rincewind escapes capture but is forced by Kring, Hrun's sentient magical sword, to attempt to rescue his friends. Twoflower is imprisoned within the Wyrmburg, and because of his fascination with dragons, is able to summon one greater {{than those of the}} Wyrmberg riders, who he names Ninereeds, allowing him to escape captivity and save Rincewind from being killed in a duel with one of the three heirs of the Wyrmburg. Hrun meanwhile is enlisted by Liessa, another of the heirs, to defeat the other two heirs in mortal combat so that he may rule the Wyrmberg alongside her, with Liessa intending to use him as a puppet ruler. Despite refusing to ride a dragon, Hrun defeats both the brothers and has them banished from the Wyrmburg. Unaware of these events, Twoflower, Rincewind and Ninereeds snatch Hrun, but as they attempt to escape into the skies, Twoflower passes out from the lack of oxygen, causing Ninereeds to disappear. Hrun is saved by Liessa, but Rincewind and Twoflower find themselves falling to their deaths. In desperation, Rincewind manages to use the Wyrmberg's power to temporarily summon a passenger jet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> before he and Twoflower fall into the ocean.|$|E

500|$|Lutyens' design {{predominantly}} {{draws on}} a cleaner, more streamlined {{version of the}} classical symbolism used in earlier monuments. Earlier monuments of the Second Boer War typically included figures of soldiers, sometimes falling in conflict, but always passing away heroically in a [...] "beautiful death" [...] with classical symbolism often used to distance the event of death from the observer, as typified in William Colton's work at Worcester. Lutyens' work at Southampton reacted to the criticism of this sometimes cluttered approach by adopting cleaner architectural forms, but still retaining the ideal of a peaceful, [...] "beautiful death". The Southampton Cenotaph makes use of an abstract, beautiful design intended to remove the viewer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice and death.|$|E
500|$|Some inter-war architects {{developed}} this approach further. Some traditional classical memorials had been criticised in both England and Germany as being fussy and overly ornate. Men such as Lutyens took the classical principles, but simplified {{them until the}} design became almost abstract. These memorials used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice, {{a continuation of the}} principle of a [...] "beautiful death". In many ways the simplified, but still classical, forms of memorials like the Cenotaph meant that mourners could read their own thoughts and concerns onto the memorial. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a high platform, the entire effect reflected by the silence that traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E

The techniques developed over centuries of stage magic by magicians may also be utilized by neuroscience as powerful probes of human cognition.|$|R
