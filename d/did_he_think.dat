5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
25|$|The prime {{minister}} of the day, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, {{did not want to}} concentrate too much power in one province, which might grow to rival Quebec and Ontario, but neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> three provinces were viable, and so opted for the two-province plan. Alberta became a province along with her sister Saskatchewan on September 1, 1905.|$|E
25|$|The Seder Olam (xx.), however, and the Talmud, include Baruch {{among the}} Prophets, and state that he prophesied {{in the period}} {{following}} the destruction. It was in Babylonia also that Ezra studied the Torah with Baruch. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> of returning to Judea during his teacher's lifetime, since he considered {{the study of the}} Torah more important than the rebuilding of the Temple; and Baruch could not join the returning exiles by reason of his age.|$|E

25|$|The case of R. v. Sussex Justices, {{ex parte}} McCarthy (1923) {{provides}} {{an illustration of}} the differences. In that case, the person who acted as clerk to certain magistrates {{was a member of}} a law firm that represented a party with an interest in the outcome of a matter being decided by the magistrates. When the magistrates withdrew to consider the matter, the clerk went with them in case they needed advice on any legal issues. However, the magistrates reached a decision without consulting the clerk. Thus, on the facts of the case, there was no possibility of actual bias whatsoever. Yet the decision in question was set aside because justice had to be seen to be done. Judicial Commissioner Menon highlighted that the underlying principle protected the appearance of justice being done, and reasoned that it would not be relevant under such a principle to consider whether justice was actually done. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> that Gough could be reconciled with ex parte McCarthy, despite the attempt in Gough attempt to confine the latter case to its own facts. In his view, the two tests were therefore different in substance, in addition to the different perspective that each test adopted. Furthermore, those differences were sometimes material in deciding a case; for example, the choice of the real likelihood test was a deciding factor of the result in Gough.|$|E
25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E

In the episode, however, Mulder is unable to identify a Jewish book, states {{that he does not}} know Hebrew, and quips that Jesus returned from the dead. When asked whether or not Mulder is Jewish, Gordon said that he did not think that he is, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> he is [...] "even half-Jewish".
