25|$|There is a {{significant}} disparity between the railways of the Abruzzo coast and the inland areas, which badly need modernisation to improve the service, in particular the Rome-Pescara line. Some services have schedules {{similar to those of}} a century ago. The situation <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that often it is faster to travel by road, normally bus.|$|E
500|$|Steve Jackson {{reviewed}} Bunnies & Burrows in The Space Gamer No. 10. Jackson {{concluded that}} [...] "B & B is probably with the retail price [...] {{at least to}} a FRP fan.

500|$|Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole {{wrote that}} while the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2 was disappointing, the {{campaign}} of Halo 3 was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was {{highly critical of the}} eighth level, stating [...] "the penultimate chapter <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth." [...] The New York Times Charles Herold said the game had a [...] "throwaway" [...] plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in Halo 2.|$|E

500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it reminds me of a string of wet sponges, it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2010, Arpaio and Thomas {{sought to}} have a grand jury indict a number of Maricopa County judges, Maricopa County supervisors, and {{employees}} of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. The grand jury, in an unusual rebuke, ordered the investigation ended. This action {{has been described as}} meaning that [...] "the case <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> there's no further evidence that could be brought" [...] to substantiate it. Legal experts agreed this was a rare move.|$|E
2500|$|The codex {{contains}} the entire New Testament with four lacunae (Matthew 1:1-18:15; Acts 10:45-14:17; Jude 7-25; Apocalypse 19:10-22:21) on 213 leaves (...) [...] The {{text of the}} manuscript skips from Acts 10:45 to 14:17 without a break; possibly a scribe rewrote it from a defective manuscript. The codex is written on 91 leaves of parchment and 122 of paper. Usually two parchment leaves are followed by three paper leaves. The paper was very poor quality. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that four of the leaves were written only on one side.|$|E

Most students {{of his books}} would hesitate about accepting Renan's judgment, that he [...] "was certainly the most remarkable man in the French clergy of our day" [...] (op. cit., 273). Robert Irwin states that Renan said his own grasp of Arabic <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> because his teacher's <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In August, 2010, a Greenlee County Judge ordered Grand Jury {{transcripts}} released {{that showed}} Thomas, in January, 2010, {{had tried to}} indict {{several members of the}} Maricopa Board of Supervisors, as well as the Maricopa County Mangager, his assistant, an attorney working for the Board of Supervisors, and Judge Donahoe. [...] Based on the ruling by Judge Leonardo, Thomas, through his assistant, requested that the Grand Jury return the case to his office, to be forwarded to a special prosecutor. [...] Instead, the Grand Jury took the rare action of ordering the inquiry ended. One of Thomas' own prosecutors had explained to the jury during orientation that to [...] "end the inquiry" [...] meant [...] "the case <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> there's no further evidence that could be brought to you folks." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Cambron {{the allies}} marched to Moulbay and to within {{the sound of}} the siege guns at Tournai. Even now Cumberland was still unsure of the {{situation}} facing him, [...] "I cannot come at any certain knowledge of the enemy's numbers, but I have concurring information that the body on this side the Schelde does not exceed 31 battalions and 32 squadrons. The reports vary of the progress of the siege, the weather <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that, tho' we are within a distance to hear the canon very distinctly, yet no true judgement can be formed from thence whether the enemy are retir'd over the Schelde or not." [...] On the evening of 9 May the allies at last reached the final stage of their tiring march, encamping their left wing on Maubray, and their right on Baugnies, almost within musket-shot of the French outposts. Tournai lay six miles (~10km) to the north-west.|$|E
2500|$|In the group's early {{experimental}} demos, {{the band}} created {{a sound that}} {{was different from the}} many death-metal groups that were performing in Las Vegas at the time. The band signed a recording contract without having performed a live show. [...] "We never went out and played shows before we got signed because the music scene in Las Vegas <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad.</b> There's not a lot going on," [...] Smith said. [...] "In our practice space, there were something like 30 bands, and every day we'd walk into that room and hear the exact same death-metal bands. So it kind of influenced us to be different. And to get out of Las Vegas." [...] Urie began working at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Summerlin to afford rent for the band's new practice space. The four left their educations behind to concentrate on music; Ross had a falling out with his father when he dropped out of college, and when Urie {{dropped out of high school}} his parents kicked him out of the house. He stayed with friends until he could afford to rent an apartment.|$|E
