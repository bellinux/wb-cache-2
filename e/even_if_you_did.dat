6000|$|... "Whatever your crime may be, {{remember}} {{that there is a}} Saviour from sin. Stay! You cannot leap the creek, and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> you would be caught, for I hear voices near us. Come with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a new law}} now, and {{the asylum}} powers are greatly extended. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> escape now, any {{policeman}} would take you {{up in the next}} town if you couldn't show a certificate of sanity from us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But that's nonsense," [...] I says; [...] "unless you {{packed the}} dog {{yourself}} in mistake for your baby. Now {{think it over}} quietly. I'm not your wife, I'm only trying to help you. I shan't say anything <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> take your eyes off the thing for a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> can't, you can't!"--he lay beautifully staring. [...] "My uncle {{must come}} down, {{and you must}} {{completely}} settle things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still I {{very much}} doubt, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> get any {{statement}} from the woman, whether it can be depended upon without verification," [...] said Clement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] she said, [...] "he doesn't {{promise to}} take the play, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{everything}} to a 't.' Did he ask you to lunch again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I replied, [...] "as you say, it cannot {{amount to}} much. You are impotent, bound {{hand and foot}} in honour. You know {{me to be a}} man falsely accused, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know it, from your {{position}} as my rival you have only the chance to stand quite still or to be infamous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rent of {{the house}} is seven and sixpence a week, mother, with rates and taxes, and we can afford that out of Bill's {{earnings}} and mine, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not do any work at all; and as to the furniture, it is every bit paid for out of our savings since we went to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> I {{imagine that}} wouldn't stop Bosomer. He's an ugly fellow. He's {{one of the}} few gunmen I've met who wants to kill {{somebody}} all the time. Most men like that are fourflushes. But Bosomer is all one color, and that's red. Merely for your own sake I advise you to hit the trail." ...|$|E

Your tracks would get washed out <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> go south. An' Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the scent. Leave it to me, Milt. You're a hunter. But I'm a hoss-tracker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} {{particular}} piece of knowledge would, O'Grady," [...] Terence agreed, with a hearty laugh; [...] "still, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> learn Portuguese, I couldn't ask for you. I don't mind Dicky, because he is only a year senior to me; but if they made me commander-in-chief of the Portuguese army, I could never have the cheek {{to give you an}} order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, don't you {{see what}} it says? The fellers down-town are pretty nigh wild 'cause you've showed the firemen that you ain't any slouch, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> black boots for a livin'. I reckon Sam Barney will get green when he sees it, an' Bill's hangin' 'round so's {{to make certain that}} duffer hears 'bout it the first thing. Say, can't you come down by the post-office now?" ...|$|E

60|$|And yet, do you know, Robert {{says that}} you might peradventure, by the {{dedication}} of your book to me, mean a covert lecture, or sarcasm, who knows? <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> the kindness of the personal address would make up for it. Who wouldn't bear both lecture and sarcasm from anyone who begins by speaking so? Therefore I am honoured and pleased and grateful all the same--yes, and will be.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care twopence {{whether you}} do or don't," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff. [...] "It's {{nothing to me}} whom you love. I should have been {{inclined}} to say at first sight that a man groping in the dirt for diamonds wouldn't love any one. And <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> though you might break your heart and die, it would be nothing to me. Had you done so, I should not have heard of you, nor should I have wished to hear of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man {{threw an}} arm across his companion's shoulder. [...] "Don't worry, kid," [...] he said. [...] "You're not a murderer <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> kill Dopey Charlie, which I hope you did. You're a benefactor {{of the human}} race. I have known Charles for years. He should have been killed long since. Furthermore, as you shot in self defence no jury would convict you. I fear, however, that you didn't kill him. You say you could hear his screams {{as long as you}} were within earshot of the barn--dead men don't scream, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you're the youngest----Your {{eyes are}} like a girl's. They're so--well, I mean, like <b>you</b> {{believed}} everything. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> teach me, I feel a thousand years older than you, instead of maybe a year younger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're all right, old man, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{look like}} a pirate. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can manage to capture that city, so I can get my {{electrical}} devices back, I'll consider you a trump as long as I live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should load with {{round shot}} now, Rawlins, and open fire {{into the wood}} {{on both sides of}} the landing-place. The sound of the shot {{crashing}} among the trees will demoralize the scoundrels <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not hit anyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man don't need but one friend. The {{fellow who}} drinks your liquor and hangs around you, {{slapping}} {{you on the}} back and taking up your time, telling you how much he likes you, ain't a friend, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> play marbles at school and fish in the same creek with him. As long as you don't need a friend one of that kind may answer. But a friend, to my mind, is one you can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and George have always done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} afraid of this," [...] he said. [...] "I have, {{been afraid of}} it. And if {{circumstances}} had so arranged themselves that I should have command of money, I should have been glad to assume the expense of deeper explorations. I have been thinking {{a great deal about}} the matter, and I feel quite sure that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not get water or anything else that might prove of value to you, it would be a great advantage to have a pipe sunk into the earth to the depth of, say, one thousand feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much happier, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{nothing but}} wander. Remember, however, that I shall have {{an object in}} view; but if you only went on and on, like some enchanted lady in a fairy tale, you might be happier than now. In a day's {{wandering}} you would pass many a hill, wood, and watercourse, each perpetually altering in aspect as the sun shone out or was overcast; as the weather was wet or fair, dark or bright. Nothing changes in Briarfield rectory. The plaster of the parlour ceilings, the paper on the walls, the curtains, carpets, chairs, are still the same." ...|$|E
