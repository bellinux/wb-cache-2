500|$|The Chinese {{had long}} taken an {{interest}} in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD the Xin Dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses. Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, [...] "When liquid and solid are imbibed together, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be that in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?" [...] Shen maintained that the larynx {{was the beginning of}} a system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach. Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three. [...] Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186–1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.|$|E

This is a contradiction into which neither true religion nor the Creator could possibly fall.

2500|$|The first {{significant}} renewal {{of learning in}} the West came when Charlemagne, advised by Peter of Pisa and Alcuin of York, attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by imperial decree in 787 AD established schools in every abbey in his empire. [...] These schools, from which the name Scholasticism is derived, became centres of medieval learning.Johannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815 - 877), successor of Alcuin of York {{as head of the}} Palace School, was an Irish theologian and Neoplatonic philosopher. He is notable for having translated and made commentaries upon the work of Pseudo-Dionysius, initially thought to be from the apostolic age. [...] Around this period several doctrinal controversies emerged, such as the question of whether God had predestined some for salvation and some for damnation. [...] Eriugena was called in to settle this dispute. [...] At the same time, Paschasius Radbertus raised an important question about the real presence of Christ at the Eucharist. [...] Is the host the same as Christ's historical body? [...] <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be present at many places and many times?

2500|$|In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' {{do is not}} a {{limit on}} its actual agency, but an {{epistemological}} boundary without which omnipotence could not be identified (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, [...] "I am a liar", then <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an epistemological paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. [...] Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning {{with the addition of}} the two words, [...] "God can" [...] before it. Lewis additionally said that, [...] "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." [...] This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.|$|E

It was a vast claim which elicited excitement at the time: the Dutch translator of First Fleet officer and author Watkin Tench's A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay wrote: [...] "a single province which, beyond all doubt, is the largest on the whole surface of the earth. From their definition it covers, in its greatest extent from East to West, virtually a fourth of the whole circumference of the Globe."

But later it was {{announced}} that she has been dropped and Kangana Ranaut took her place. Even Amrita Rao was also considered but she passed the opportunity. Emraan Hashmi joined the cast taking over from Dino Morea. Dino expressed his disappointment with the decision by saying [...] "I'm not disappointed but definitely baffled. How can they make a Raaz 2 without anyone from the original cast? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>it</b> be a sequel, then?" [...] Later it was announced that Raaz – The Mystery Continues is not a sequel to the original movie. Adhyayan Suman plays Yash, a documentary filmmaker who is perceived as an atheist and believes in scientific rationale behind everything. His beliefs are challenged in the film. He reportedly called this film his debut, although he debuted in Bollywood with the 2008 film Haal-e-dil. Actress Sonal Chauhan was also reported to play a part in the movie, however she could not {{be a part of the}} final cast. Incidentally, Kangana again plays a supermodel called Nandita in this film, right after Fashion. Since playing a supermodel, she had to reportedly undergo many types of looks and even changed her hair colour to red. Emraan Hashmi plays a dark character as the painter, Prithvi, who has no contact with the outside world. His character is the main link to the fate of Kangana's character. According to the actor, though comparisons are evident with the earlier Raaz, this film has a different plot and will give a new definition to the horror genre. Veteran actor Jackie Shroff was reported to be playing Kangana's father in the movie, which after release was revealed to be Emraan's father's character.|$|E
