50|$|Alarms are {{normally}} {{produced by the}} receiving terminal equipment when the framing is compromised. There are three defined alarm <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> states, identified by a legacy color scheme: red, yellow and blue.|$|E
5000|$|Blue alarm, {{also known}} as alarm <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> (AIS) {{indicates}} a disruption in the communication path between the terminal equipment and line repeaters or DCS. If no signal is received by the intermediary equipment, it produces an unframed, all-ones signal. The receiving equipment displays a [...] "red alarm" [...] and sends the signal for [...] "yellow alarm" [...] {{to the far end}} because it has no framing, but at intermediary interfaces the equipment will report [...] "AIS" [...] or Alarm <b>Indication</b> <b>Signal.</b> AIS is also called [...] "all ones" [...] because of the data and framing pattern.|$|E

50|$|CSUs can be {{categorized}} by the class of service they support (DS1, DS3, DDS, etc.) and by the capabilities within that class. For example, basic DS1 (T1) CSUs support loopback of each interface and will produce Alarm <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> to the provider's NIU (Network Interface Device) {{in the event of}} loss of signal from the customer-premises equipment (CPE). More advanced units will include internal monitors of the performance of the carrier in both directions and may have test pattern generation and monitor capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had Carrier Group Alarms {{by which}} {{the failure of a}} pilot signal was alerted to {{telephone}} exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent plesiochronous and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards.As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M function has {{led to the development of}} a similar Ethernet alarm <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> (EthAIS).|$|E

5000|$|Alarm <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> (AIS) (also called “all ones” {{because of}} the data and framing pattern) is a signal {{transmitted}} by an intermediate element of a multi-node transport circuit {{that is part of}} a concatenated telecommunications system to alert the receiving end of the circuit that a segment of the end-to-end link has failed at a logical or physical level, even if the system it is directly connected to is still working. The AIS replaces the failed data, allowing the higher order system in the concatenation to maintain its transmission framing integrity. Downstream intermediate elements of the transport circuit propagate the AIS onwards to the destination element.|$|E
50|$|In this {{protection}} scheme, {{a primary}} and a backup LSP are computed and setup at the provisioning time prior to failures. The backup LSP {{does not necessarily}} {{need to have the}} same constrain in terms of bandwidth as the primary; it is possible to reserve less bandwidth on the backup LSP and not incur in packet loss when in use. This is because the bandwidth of the link is shared among the different LSPs and the reason why the previous explained protection scheme is not preferred. It is also true that the Backup LSP does not necessarily carry traffic unless the primary LSP fails. When this occurs, a fault <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> (FIS) is sent back to the head-end LSR that will immediately switch the traffic to the backup LSP. The drawback in this protection scheme is that the longer the LSPs, the longer the recovery time will be because of the travel time of the FIS notification.|$|E

40|$|The {{start of}} the digital {{revolution}} came through the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) in 1959 followed by massive integration onto a silicon die by means of constant down scaling of individual components. Digital systems for certain applications require fault-tolerance against faults caused by temporary or permanent influence. The most widely used technique is triple module redundancy (TMR) {{in conjunction with a}} majority voter, which is regarded as a passive fault mitigation strategy. Design by functional resilience has been applied to circuit structures for increased fault-tolerance and towards self-diagnostic triggered self-healing. The focus of this thesis is therefore to develop new design strategies for fault detection and mitigation within transistor, gate and cell design levels. The research described in this thesis makes three contributions. The first contribution is based on adding fine-grained transistor level redundancy to logic gates in order to accomplish stuck-at fault-tolerance. The objective is to realise maximum fault-masking for a logic gate with minimal added redundant transistors. In the case of non-maskable stuck-at faults, the gate structure generates an intrinsic <b>indication</b> <b>signal</b> that is suitable for autonomous self-healing functions. As a result, logic circuitry utilising this design is now able to differentiate between gate faults and faults occurring in inter-gate connections. This distinction between fault-types can then be used for triggering selective self-healing responses. The second contribution is a logic matrix element which applies the three core redundancy concepts of spatial- temporal- and data-redundancy. This logic structure is composed of quad-modular redundant structures and is capable of selective fault-masking and localisation depending of fault-type at the cell level, which is referred to as a spatiotemporal quadded logic cell (QLC) structure. This QLC structure has the capability of cellular self-healing. Through the combination of fault-tolerant and masking logic features the QLC is designed with a fault-behaviour that is equal to existing quadded logic designs using only 33. 3...|$|E

Trademarks indicate the commercial origin {{of a good}} or service while geographical <b>indications</b> <b>signal</b> the geographic origin. Both tools also legally grant exclusive rights to certain uses of a word or symbol. Tension arises when the tools overlap on the same subject matter. The thesis asks: is coexistence between the devices in the TRIPS Agreement possible? Are the concepts of trademarks and geographical indications related? If so, how? If not, how? Does the marketing literature of business recognize both registered trademarks and geographical indications as aspects of the same branding exercise? The thesis finds that as trademarks and geographical indications are unique devices that are not interchangeable {{and it is possible}} for legislation to simultaneously protect both, trademarks and geographical indications are therefore not in conflict and can instead be viewed as harmonious tools...|$|R
