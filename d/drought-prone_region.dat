Aggregate income varied little, but there were considerable fluctuations in individual household incomes across seasons, the main sources of which were idiosyncratic shocks. This suggests that although current programmes are effective in stabilizing aggregate income against drought, massive additional intervention along the same lines is not an efficient way to combat a drought's effects. Rather, it is desirable to promote suitable insurance arrangements to deal with idiosyncratic shocks, measures which would complement those designed to raise incomes permanently. poverty, natural hazards, income variability, India,...|$|E

By doing so, the relatively new procedure known as empirical orthogonal teleconnection analysis (EOT) was validated as an effective way for identifying the impact of atmospheric patterns in remote oceanic basins on rainfall trends at a particular location. Rainfall trends were investigated, and trend analysis on optimally interpolated rain gauge data (1948 - 2013) shows no significant decrease for kiremt rainfall (June-September) in North Ethiopia. However, EOT analysis of assimilated mean sea level pressure data reveals that not only El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) /La Nina, but also the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) has a significant impact in North Ethiopia. Including the variability of the Southwest Monsoons (SWM), subsequent multivariate regression could model North Ethiopian kiremt rainfall from these three teleconnections (R- 2 = 0. 64), representing 89 % of all dry years. In particular, the interaction between these three teleconnections was {{a major contributor to}} the 1983 - 1985 droughts and famine.

The land cover types derived from MODIS and Landsat images were resampled to 250 m to match all datasets used. Significant differences between cover types are observed, with cropland and shrubland most highly correlated with 64 days' earlier rainfall and evergreen forest most responsive to rainfall 90 days earlier, indicating a need to consider detailed land cover information for accurate integrated drought indices.

However, impacts of extreme events are not only dependent on their variability, but also on management and governance. In Brazil, its semi-arid region is vulnerable to extreme events, especially droughts, for centuries. Actually, other Brazilian regions that have been mostly concerned with floods are currently also experiencing droughts. This article evaluates how a combination between climate variability and water governance might affect water scarcity and increase the impacts of extreme events on some regions.

These five regions should be the key areas in which China fights against drought disaster and develops improved coping strategies. The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain drought region, which is a heavily populated and rapidly developing economic region {{as well as the}} main grain production base in China (Table  1), may suffer much greater economic loss from the same degree of drought threat to which the other four comparable <b>drought-prone</b> <b>regions</b> are exposed. Judged by various drought-related statistics (ADF, MDD, MDS, and MDI), Northeast China and Southwest China drought regions both indicate a relatively high degree of drought frequency and intensity. In contrast, droughts in Southern China coastal region impact a small area, have a short duration (from 1.8 to 3.0  months), and are relatively high intensity events (between − 0.30 and − 0.45). Overall, the ADF of the Yangtze River basin ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 occurrences per year, and the MDI of the region varies from − 0.13 to − 0.3. This indicates that the Yangtze River basin is the area with smallest drought risk in China. Temporal variations of drought for the five main <b>drought-prone</b> <b>regions</b> indicate that the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain region has been mainly dominated by spring and winter droughts, which exert a significant impact on regional agriculture. Northwest China has mainly suffered from spring, autumn, and winter droughts, while drought always hit Northeast China consecutively in the winter and spring, with a relatively low contribution (less than 20  %) from the summer. Southwest China generally experienced drought in the winter and spring, which imposes a huge threat to agriculture and human and livestock drinking water. Southern China coastal region was often struck by drought in autumn and winter, but only occasionally by spring and summer droughts. Although the Yangtze River basin presents the smallest drought risk at an annual scale, the seasonal analysis reveals that the incidence of summer drought in this region is higher than other regions. China is located in the East Asian Monsoon region; this sets the pattern for seasonal meteorological drought in China because the region’s large interannual variations in drought intensity and timing are controlled by the rhythm and activity level of the monsoon (Zhang and Zhou 2015). North China, for example, usually warms up rapidly in the spring and this temperature increase leads to spring drought due to reduced precipitation, strong winds, and a large amount of evaporation. As the Pacific Subtropical High moves northward in the summer, a rain belt center is formed north of the Yellow River basin, which controls the ending time of the spring drought (Zhai and Feng 2008).|$|R
