5|$|Yoga {{concepts}} {{begin to}} <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> {{the texts of}} c. 500–200 BCE such as the Pali Canon, the middle Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata.|$|E
5|$|As would <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> later {{testimony}} at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to {{confusion in the}} cockpit during the final flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as pilot in command, and who was operating the engine and fuel controls as flight engineer.|$|E
50|$|Malicorne, a French {{electric}} folk group <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1973, {{starting with}} traditional music {{and then later}} blended it with pop. Canadian Stan Rogers wrote and performed folk music with strong historical and nautical themes, <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> 1976. Si Kahn <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1974 at the more political and topical end of the folk music spectrum.|$|R
50|$|In the book, Oppenheimer {{supports}} {{the theory that}} modern humans first <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Africa and that modern human behavior <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Africa prior to the out of Africa migration.|$|R

5|$|In January 1988, {{during an}} {{interview}} with United Press International, McGovern confirmed that he was considering entering the 1988 Democratic primaries {{in the event that}} a front-runner did not <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> the race {{in the aftermath of the}} Super Tuesday primaries, though admitted he believed a candidate would take the lead.|$|E
5|$|Many of the North American {{species are}} in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because they <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These {{periodical}} cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E
50|$|Direct carrier/bank co-operation, <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> Haiti.|$|R
50|$|Around the 7th {{century the}} Kabara Nation {{under the control}} of the Kabara's <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Northern Nigeria. Around the 9th century an {{upheaval}} of unexplained origins saw a transference of power from these matriarchal monarchs and a new set of nations <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> their place.|$|R
50|$|The plaza <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1559 and was {{originally}} called Plaza Nueva (New Square). It was {{built as a}} popular alternative to Plaza de Armas, the military and government main center, the name changed when another important square <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> town, the Plaza del Santo Cristo.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, several hardships {{struck the}} band in 2014. In May, bassist David Ellefson lost a brother to cancer, {{following}} which, the band cancelled {{a number of}} scheduled shows. On October 4, Mustaine's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were discovered on November 26. Furthermore, drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick announced their resignations from the band that November. The pair would later <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> a new band, Act of Defiance.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, {{black metal}} scenes {{had begun to}} <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> areas outside Scandinavia, {{including}} Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.|$|E
5|$|During Mubarak's presidency, Nasserist {{political}} parties began to <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> Egypt, the first being the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP). The party carried minor political influence, and splits between its members beginning in 1995 {{resulted in the}} gradual establishment of splinter parties, including Hamdeen Sabahi's 1997 founding of Al-Karama. Sabahi came in third place during the 2012 presidential election. Nasserist activists were among the founders of Kefaya, a major opposition force during Mubarak's rule. On 19 September 2012, four Nasserist parties (the ADNP, Karama, the National Conciliation Party, and the Popular Nasserist Congress Party) merged to form the United Nasserist Party.|$|E
5000|$|Periodical cicadas {{are grouped}} into [...] {{based on the}} {{calendar}} year when they emerge (see chart below and maps on www.magicicada.org). For example, in 2014, the 13-year brood XXII <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Louisiana and the 17-year brood III <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> western Illinois and eastern Iowa.|$|R

5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence—related specifically to the parachutes or the ransom money—that may <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Pre-{{philosophical}} speculations of yoga {{begin to}} <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> {{the texts of}} c. 500–200 BCE. Between 200 BCE–500 CE philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga {{came to the attention}} of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.|$|E
50|$|Deep {{fissures}} quickly <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Lloyd George's coalition.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concepts}} of [...] "science" [...] and [...] "religion" [...] are a recent invention: [...] "religion" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 17th {{century in the}} midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation, [...] "science" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century {{in the midst of}} attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature, and the phrase [...] "religion and science" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts. It was in the 19th century that the terms [...] "Buddhism", [...] "Hinduism", [...] "Taoism", and [...] "Confucianism" [...] first <b>emerged.</b> <b>In</b> the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (scientia) and religion (religio) were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Environmental {{informatics}} <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> early 1990 in Central Europe.|$|R
5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots began to <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> the professional era, taking {{the place of}} everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|These repressive {{measures}} included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To {{avoid being}} {{taken as a}} hostage, Stojanović paid 100,000 dinars to the Ustaše in Prijedor. Resistance began to <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> occupied Yugoslavia; royalists and Serbian nationalists {{under the leadership of}} then-Colonel Draža Mihailović founded the Ravna Gora Movement, whose members were called Chetniks. The KPJ, led by Josip Broz Tito, prepared to rise to arms at a favourable moment. In the view of the KPJ, the fight against the Axis and its domestic collaborators would be a common fight of all Yugoslav peoples.|$|E
5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E
