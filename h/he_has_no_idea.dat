5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{what to do and}} starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E
500|$|After Peter recovers, the Fringe team {{starts a}} search for Fauxlivia. Walter Bishop (John Noble) is distressed that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how to find Fauxlivia and {{no idea how to}} bring Olivia back. However, Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) discovers Fauxlivia brought Walter malasadas from a bakery in the Bronx. Peter, Walter, Farnsworth and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) search the nearby area, Peter finds the {{typewriter}} store and the team finds the typewriter used to contact the other universe (a [...] "quantum entanglement" [...] device). There, the team realizes that Fauxlivia is going to a train station in Newark for a 4:00 PM pick-up.|$|E

2500|$|Mal {{was raised}} by his mother and [...] "about 40 hands" [...] on a ranch on the planet Shadow. Though Mal usually seems more {{practical}} than intellectual, he occasionally surprises his friends by displaying familiarity with disparate literature varying from the works of Xiang Yu to poems by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> [...] "who" [...] Mona Lisa is.|$|E
2500|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Harry {{comes across}} Lockhart in St Mungo's while visiting the Weasley father Arthur Weasley at Christmas. Lockhart is childishly {{proud of being}} able to write in [...] "joined-up letters". He still enjoys signing autographs and still {{receives}} fan mail, although <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> why. For his part, Harry feels a slight twinge of guilt for Lockhart's amnesia, but he consoles himself with {{the fact that it was}} Lockhart's own fault. Lockhart never fully recovers, despite all efforts to cure him, and remains in St. Mungo's with amnesia. Harry and Ron never reveal that Lockhart was a fraud.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} Detroit {{productions}} to receive wider attention was Derrick May's [...] "Strings of Life" [...] (1987), which, together with May's previous release, [...] "Nude Photo" [...] (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 house music boom (see Second Summer of Love). It became May's best known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, [...] "just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record {{when it was first}} heard. Mike Dunn says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline." ...|$|E

2500|$|Essex {{has said}} {{that there is a}} [...] "massive rift" [...] between Eddie and his estranged son, Michael. He explained: [...] "When [...] arrives, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that Michael is around! Eddie and Michael haven't really spoken for years, but as a father does, Eddie reaches out and reaches out, trying to mend that." [...] Essex opined that Eddie and Michael may be quite similar, but Eddie would not be as {{manipulative}} as [...] "the ages are different—with age comes a certain attitude for Eddie that's a bit more philosophical and not so hot-headed." [...] It was revealed by Inside Soap that the rift between Michael and Eddie is because Michael's mother committed suicide and Michael found her body but he is convinced that Eddie killed her. Essex confirmed that Michael blames Eddie for the death.|$|E
2500|$|A {{third major}} theme is inconstancy, {{particularly}} as manifested in Proteus, [...] whose very name hints at his changeable mind (in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Proteus is a sea-god forever changing its shape). At {{the start of}} the play, Proteus has only eyes for Julia. However, upon meeting Silvia, he immediately falls in love with her (although <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> why). He then finds himself drawn to the page Sebastian (Julia in disguise) whilst still trying to woo Silvia, {{and at the end of}} the play, he announces that Silvia is no better than Julia and vows he now loves Julia again. Indeed, Proteus himself seems to be aware of this mutability, pointing out towards the end of the play; [...] "O heaven, were man/But constant, he were perfect. That one error/Fills him with faults, makes him run through all th'sins;/Inconstancy falls off ere it begins" [...] (5.4.109–112).|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of the Apple I, Wozniak {{designed}} the Apple II, the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built-in. Inspired by [...] "the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games", Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a $1 chip, while colors in the PAL system were achieved by [...] "accident" [...] when a dot occurred on a line, and to this day <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how it works. During the design stage, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted six. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak had threatened for Jobs to 'go get himself another computer', they decided to go with eight slots. The Apple II {{became one of the first}} highly successful mass-produced personal computers.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
2500|$|When Larry announces his {{leave of}} absence to board the International Space Station (in the episode [...] "Brutus"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in denial about Larry's ambitions and he thinks reason of the risks {{involved}} will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered. Amita says to Larry, [...] " [...] has never dreamt of something he couldn't reach, so <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{what it is like}} to want something he is not able to get. So how could he understand how much [...] you would give up when this chance comes along?" [...] Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In [...] "Killer Chat", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus steam tunnels. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the academic firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky T-shirt.|$|E

60|$|He was {{beginning}} to come to himself. He became silent. But he still strained her fast, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of letting her go.|$|R
60|$|Chairs and benches were found, and John Gayther {{brought his}} stool unasked {{and joined the}} party. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of missing that conversation.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of {{business}} hours, has the stage lawyer--to make the thing as unpleasant as possible {{seems to be}} his only anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... "But why go {{near him}} at all? He thinks {{that you are}} dead. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{that you are in}} England. Why should he know? Why do you risk ruin like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] she murmured. [...] "I {{would not}} have brought him here if I had known. You two are better apart. Talk to me as {{naturally}} as you can. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who you are." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed. In many ways, I owe him a {{good deal}} more. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of this, but it doesn't lessen my obligation. By the way, {{it struck me that}} in many respects Miss Vane is rather like her brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's deuced shabby of him, not hunting {{here in his}} own county. He escapes all {{the bore}} of going to lectures, and giving feeds to the neighbours; that's why he treats us so. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of his duty, has he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we have," [...] Percy said. [...] "He was to {{have met}} us {{in front of the}} railway station at nine o'clock and, of course, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where to find us. I will go there. Very likely the poor fellow is waiting still." ...|$|E
