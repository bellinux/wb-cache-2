5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean and began {{developing}} his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. He planned to return to college eventually to pursue a master's degree in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. While he was there, he initially <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{would lead to the}} creation of SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation.|$|E
25|$|His first evil deed was {{the murder}} of the Norwegian petty king Vikar (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a Viking {{expedition}} with Vikar, but they found themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> they could appease the gods by performing a blót with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of willow and put it around the king's neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1780s, Wells and a {{few others}} <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> dew and frost {{occurred}} when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of water vapor in the air caused by just the right combination of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and heat conductivity of materials.|$|E
60|$|But {{the boys}} put very little faith {{in what he}} said, seeming to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he simply {{wanted to get rid}} of them, and, instead of going away, they {{surrounded}} him more closely.|$|R
60|$|Glascow was mistaken: she did {{not take}} it, <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he would soon {{conclude}} {{that it would be}} wiser for him to read it than to let it stand idly on the shelf.|$|R
60|$|It was {{too soon}} for me to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it would be bad if he did: that only came later. So I remarked that, not having seen him for so many years, it was very {{possible}} I shouldn't know him.|$|R
25|$|Bogart gained {{his first}} real romantic lead in 1942's Casablanca, playing Rick Blaine, a hard-pressed {{expatriate}} nightclub owner hiding from a shady past while negotiating {{a fine line}} among Nazis, the French underground, the Vichy prefect and unresolved feelings for his ex-girlfriend. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Hal Wallis, and featured Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. An avid chess player, Bogart reportedly <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Rick Blaine be portrayed as one, {{a metaphor for the}} sparring relationship he maintained with friends, enemies, and tenuous allies. In real life Bogart played tournament level chess one division below master, often enjoying games with crew members and cast, but finding his better in the superior Paul Henreid.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994, CDNow {{launched}} its BuyWeb program. CDNow <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors {{might be interested}} in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website, but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist's music page.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Jarre was {{contacted}} by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday {{of the city of}} Houston and NASA's 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair. Together they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> for the celebrations, Jarre would create a piece of music that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the Challenger Space Shuttle, would perform (and record onto video) the new piece of music, which would then be projected (through video playback) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings.|$|E

The largest things we saw were the braces which are especially strong—they were about {{one and a half}} or two meters long and 50–60 centimeters wide. As for the rest—broken into tiny pieces..." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{the track}} was {{supposedly}} done, Beyoncé <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be}} [...] "perfect" [...] if Jamaican reggae artist Sean Paul contributed a vocal track. Beyoncé contacted Paul about a possible collaboration for [...] "Baby Boy". Sean Paul agreed, and flew in from Jamaica to join the recording sessions of the song. He contributed a toast verse, and they finished recording [...] "Baby Boy" [...] in March 2003, during the later stages of the album's recording.|$|E
500|$|Sakanaction {{was first}} formed in August 2005 in Sapporo, Hokkaido. It was {{originally}} a two-member unit, consisting of vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi and guitarist Motoharu Iwadera. Yamaguchi first worked together with Iwadera {{in the band}} Dutchman, that formed at their high school in 1998 and performed British rock-inspired music. In 2004, the band broke up, and Yamaguchi took the name for his solo project, where he created techno and club music. Yamaguchi <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be interesting}} to mix electronic music with Japanese-style [...] "folky melodies", so formed Sakanaction with Iwadera.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} initial {{proposal}} for [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", Barrett {{felt that she}} could play the woman who went into space to find her fiance. She dyed her hair blonde {{in an attempt to}} fit the role. Barrett sought to surprise Roddenberry at his office, but he walked right past her, not recognizing who she was. It was only when he came back out give his secretary some papers that he realized it was Barrett. They <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it might get her past the NBC executives and back onto the show. The character of Christine Ducheaux was subsequently changed to Christine Chapel by Roddenberry, as a play on the Sistine Chapel. No other actresses were considered for the role.|$|E

While he was there, he initially <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{would lead to the}} creation of SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone. The host of the comic was [...] "Bob the Sponge" [...] who, unlike SpongeBob, resembled an actual sea sponge. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue an animation career.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Horace Avory {{became a}} judge. Hastings first found {{out when he}} read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again have {{to search for a}} tenancy at another {{chambers}}. He instead <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money. Despite Avory's reputation as [...] "cold and hard" [...] he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.|$|E
60|$|However, she did no {{more than}} urge me to be cautious, never running my head in danger {{when there was no}} real need for it, and seemed to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> such {{information}} as we lads could pick up concerning the movements of the Britishers in Boston, would be of but little value to those brave men at Cambridge.|$|R

500|$|Each episode took {{approximately}} {{two months to}} edit, and editing usually began as the episodes were still being shot. The editors would work on two episodes simultaneously. Following {{the completion of the}} episodes, Muskett added the score for them. The episodes include split screen sequences. Although the sequences were presented in a similar vein to the American action series 24, the split screen idea did not come from the show itself; Nalluri thought of it independently after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up. The series also introduced the premise of not including any production credits. The producers agreed that adding credits would be a waste of time, and that the viewers would pay no attention to them. However, they also saw this as an opportunity; as Spooks is a spy show, Wolstencroft <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it would be [...] "cool" [...] to have a show that was anonymous, and it would fit the spirit of the series.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Benn {{said in his}} diaries that [...] "Today I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> I would resign my Privy Councillorship, my MA and all my honorary doctorates {{in order}} to strip myself of what the world had to offer". While he {{acknowledged}} that he [...] "might be ridiculed" [...] for doing so, Benn said that [...] "But 'Wedgie Benn' and 'the Rt Honourable Anthony Wedgwood Benn' {{and all that stuff}} is impossible. I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time." [...] In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to [...] "Tony Benn". Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that [...] "Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie {{in the case of the}} tabloids, for years to come (some older Tories were still doing so three decades later)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not all {{reasons for}} seeking asylum {{in another country}} satisfy the {{definition}} of [...] "refugee" [...] according to article 1A of the 1951 Refugee Convention. In 1951, the parties of the treaty <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> slavery was a thing {{from the past and}} therefore escaped and fleeing slaves are a group not mentioned in the definition. Fleeing droughts and hunger, fleeing economic hardship, natural disasters and not even war or terror satisfied the definition of 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, astronomers <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{the arms}} of a spiral galaxy were material. [...] However, if this were the case, then the arms would become more and more tightly wound, since the matter nearer {{to the center of the}} galaxy rotates faster than the matter at the edge of the galaxy. [...] The arms would become indistinguishable from the rest of the galaxy after only a few orbits. [...] This is called the winding problem.|$|E

The program was originally broadcast from the WOR studios, but Pegeen's illness brought about the temporary need to broadcast the show from the Fitzgerald's apartment. After the couple became the owners of their program, they elected to continue broadcasting from their home.|$|E
