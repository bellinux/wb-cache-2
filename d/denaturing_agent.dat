50|$|Butanone is an {{effective}} and common solvent and is used in processes involving gums, resins, cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose coatings and in vinyl films.

It has similar solvent properties to acetone but boils at a higher temperature and has a significantly slower evaporation rate.

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} common ketone solvents, acetone and MEK, MIBK has quite low {{solubility}} in water, making it useful for liquid-liquid extraction.

Diisobutyl ketone (DIBK), a related lipophilic ketone, is also used for this purpose. Methyl isobutyl ketone is also used as a <b>denaturing</b> <b>agent</b> for denatured alcohol.

50|$|In the {{laboratory}} it {{is a common}} precipitant and cryoprotectant in protein crystallography. Since hexylene glycol is compatible with polar and nonpolar molecules, it competes with the solvent in a crystallography experiment causing the protein to precipitate. Hexylene glycol is so effective in protein crystallography because its amphiphilic nature and small, flexible structure allows it to bind to many different locations on a protein secondary structure including alpha helices and beta sheets. When hexylene glycol binds to these different locations, water is removed and the protein crystals anneal, which prevents ice formation during cryocrystallography techniques. Incorporation of hexylene glycol into solution has been known to improve the resolution of X-ray diffraction making protein structures easily identifiable. Additionally hexylene glycol is not a strong <b>denaturing</b> <b>agent</b> and thus does not significantly alter the structure of a protein during the crystallography procedure.|$|E

[...] An RNA ladder is often run alongside the samples on an electrophoresis gel to observe the size of fragments obtained but in total RNA samples the ribosomal subunits can act as size markers.

40|$|Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} experiments {{were performed on}} dilute solutions of a high molecular weight protein (fibronectin, M = 580 kg/mol) in four cases: native conditions; unfolded state obtained by a <b>denaturing</b> <b>agent</b> (urea); and two badly refolded (or collapsed) states obtained by progressive elimination of the <b>denaturing</b> <b>agent</b> in salt-containing or salt-free solutions. Our main result is concerned by the conformation of the protein as the attempt for refolding is driven with or without salt. In salt-containing solution, we observe unambiguously that the protein chain collapses at large length scales but still obeys to a Gaussian statistics at short length scales. In other words, the globule embodies a large quantity of solvent compared to the compact situation. In salt-free solutions, the badly refolded protein is not globular but displays both a coil-like and an open conformation at large length scales and a local high density area. This behavior is discussed {{with respect to the}} scaling theories for polymers and polyampholytes. ...|$|E
