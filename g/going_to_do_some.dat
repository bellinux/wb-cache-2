5000|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{architect}} of Caterpillar's fiscal strategy, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) came also under scrutiny, owing this to a conflict of interest, acting as Caterpillar's global tax consultant and controller.

2500|$|Additional {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the fact that the circumstances O'Brien found himself in recalled a similar dilemma that faced Leno toward the end of 1992. [...] Only months into his hosting job on The Tonight Show, NBC considered reversing their decision to choose Leno over Letterman. Leno was aghast and angry that NBC refused to exhibit clear commitment to him as the franchise's new host, and expressed this disappointment publicly. He also made explicit that he would leave the network if he was asked to move back an hour to accommodate Letterman. [...] "Of course.

Also referenced in the article is Williams' cover of the Al Green classic, [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] that was not only featured in a Gap commercial {{but also on the}} Roll Bounce soundtrack. In 2006, Williams confirmed her change of musical direction and sound explaining, [...] "I know my first two albums were gospel, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> soul music because I love R music, so I'm excited about that opportunity" [...] at Clive Davis's annual pre-Grammy party.

2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Some</b> of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time.

500|$|NBC had renewed Homicide for {{a second}} season to assess how the show {{performed}} in the Nielsen ratings and make a determination whether to continue the series.

5000|$|The PC version keeps {{a lot of}} data {{resident}} whilst you go between areas. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spool a {{lot more}} between the areas.
