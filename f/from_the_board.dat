5|$|In the 197778 season Villa {{reached the}} quarter-final of the UEFA Cup {{where they went}} out 43 on {{aggregate}} against Barcelona. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his team {{in the summer of}} 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board.</b> The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board.</b> Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. Allan Evans, Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were brought into the defence and Des Bremner was brought into the midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans. Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership. When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United in the summer of 1980, Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years.|$|E

5|$|Tourist {{accommodation}} {{ranges from}} luxury lodges to apartments and villa units. The currency is the Australian dollar, {{and there are}} two banks. There are no camping facilities on the island and remote-area camping is not permitted. To protect the fragile environment of Ball's Pyramid (which carries the last remaining wild population of the endangered Howe Island stick insect), recreational climbing there is prohibited. No pets are allowed without permission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board.</b> Islanders use tanked rainwater, supplemented by bore water for showers and washing clothes.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> upon contact. Colored balls occasionally {{appear at the}} second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|After {{fulfilling}} her one-year {{commitment to}} the University of Louisville, Collins was named {{a fellow of the}} Harvard Institute of Politics' John F. Kennedy School of Government, teaching non-credit classes on leadership styles once a week. Concurrent with her position at Harvard, Collins was named to the board of regents for Midway College in 1989; the following year, she was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> of regents of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Her removal was automatically triggered after she missed three consecutive board meetings between 1986 and 1989. In 1990, Collins accepted the presidency of Saint Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky, becoming the first president of the small, Catholic college who was not a Dominican nun. College officials stated that Collins was recruited for the presidency to raise the college's profile.|$|E

5|$|Between 1926 and 1927, Cooper {{discussed}} {{the plans for}} Pan American Airways with John Hambleton, which was formed during 1927. Cooper {{was a member of}} the board of directors of Pan American Airways. During his tenure at Pan Am, the company established the first regularly scheduled transatlantic service. While he was on the board, Cooper did not devote his full attention to the organization; he took time in 1929 and 1930 to work on the script for King Kong. By 1931, he was back in Hollywood. He resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> of directors in 1935, following health complications.|$|E
5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from {{the first edition of}} the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, completely different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> game that had inspired the computer game in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not hidden <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was {{informed of the}} rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

Under licence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations.

During that time, NBN and ABC Newcastle were asked to leave the VHF band to accommodate FM radio. NBN would have been on UHF channel 51, and ABC on UHF channel 48, however this did not eventuate. A proposal to launch a radiated subscription television service with community broadcasting during the daytime hours had also failed that year.|$|E
