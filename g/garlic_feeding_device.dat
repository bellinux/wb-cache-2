An automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the automatic feeding system. A new type of automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|In general, demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> are {{equipped}} with a mechanical trigger switch. Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> (the automatic feeder (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other <b>feeding</b> <b>devices,</b> because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks. We conclude that IRDF is a useful feeding system for aquaculture...|$|R

40|$|Foraging {{behaviours}} used by {{two female}} Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) were documented during controlled feeding trials. During these trials the seals {{were presented with}} prey either free-floating in open water or concealed within a mobile ball or a static box <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> When targeting free-floating prey both subjects primarily used raptorial biting in combination with suction, which was used to draw prey to within range of the teeth. When targeting prey concealed within either the mobile or static <b>feeding</b> <b>device,</b> the seals {{were able to use}} suction to draw out prey items that could not be reached by biting. Suction was followed by lateral water expulsion, where water drawn into the mouth along with the prey item was purged via the sides of the mouth. Vibrissae were used to explore the surface of the <b>feeding</b> <b>devices,</b> especially when locating the openings in which the prey items had been hidden. The mobile ball device was also manipulated by pushing it with the muzzle to knock out concealed prey, which was not possible when using the static <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> To knock prey out of this static device one seal used targeted bubble blowing, where a focused stream of bubbles was blown out of the nose into the openings in the device. Once captured in the jaws, prey items were manipulated and re-oriented using further mouth movements or chews so that they could be swallowed head first. While most items were swallowed whole underwater, some were instead taken to the surface and held in the teeth, while being vigorously shaken to break them into smaller pieces before swallowing.

40|$|Much {{interest}} has developed {{in recent years}} in a procedure to rear neonatal pigs by use of automatic <b>feeding</b> equipment. Several <b>devices</b> of similar design have been used for both sterile, disease free environments utilizing hysterectomy or cesarean-derived pigs and for pigs born normally and taken from the sow at 8 - 36 hours post-partum. The purpose of the research reported herein was to determine if an automated <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> could be used to rear naturally-farrowed and hysterectomy-derived pigs with good performance and survival rate. Three experiments were conducted using 34 crossbred neonatal piglets to determine the feasibility of rearing newborn pigs with an automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, three trials were conducted with 49 crossbred hysterectomy-derived pigs to study the requirements of disease-free pigs in terms of diets and management considerations. The major problem encountered throughout the six tests was microbial scours. Rotation of the drugs being used apparently countered the buildup of resistance in the organism(s) responsible. The hysterectomy pigs were more susceptible to scours {{due to a lack of}} passive immunity. Pig weight at birth appeared to be the most significant factor affecting survival. This relationship was true for both normal birth and hysterectomy-derived pigs. Advisor:E. R. Peo, Jr...|$|R

40|$|Current feeding {{practices}} in the confined domestic cat do not commonly mimic those observed in the free-ranging cat population. While attempts have recently been made to modify feeding practices {{with the aim of}} increasing species-appropriate behavioural repertoires, scientific investigation in the field is lacking. The current study investigated the effects of a novel <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> on the <b>feeding</b> behaviour of 22 domestic cats housed in a cattery facility. Cats were provided with their usual morning food ration split evenly between their normal feeding method (food bowl) and a novel <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> for a period of 80 minutes in a single exposure. Durations and frequencies of food interest, food consumption, exploration of <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> and remaining weights of food left at the end of observation period were measured. While 19 of the 22 cats showed olfactory exploration towards the device, only 7 cats acquired food from it. Within-subjects analysis of the sub-population of 7 cats using the device revealed no significant differences in weight of food acquired from bowl versus device (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, P= 0. 180) suggesting these cats were as successful at gaining their food ration from the device as they were from the food bowl. However, it took cats significantly longer to gain food from the device than the bowl (Paired-samples t-test, P< 0. 01) and they did so in a significantly greater number of visits to the device (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, P< 0. 05). Two behavioural styles of obtaining food from the device were also observed; 1) pushing device with the head and 2) pawing the device. Six of the 7 cats used pawing as a favoured strategy; behaviour often observed in cats manipulating real prey items. For those cats that learned to use the device, it proved a useful means of increasing feeding time, number of feeding bouts and encouraging species-appropriate feeding behaviour...|$|R
