Prices have increased relative to the increasing demand for the older audio tuners. Those with the most value are the best sounding, most rare (collectible), the best DX capable (distance reception) and the known build quality of the component, as it left the factory.|$|E

50|$|Increased {{competition}} in the aerospace market has placed additional demands on aerospace manufacturers to reduce costs, increase product flexibility and improve manufacturing efficiency. There is a knowledge gap within the sphere of digital to physical dimensional verification and on how to successfully achieve dimensional specifications within real-world assembly factories that are subject to varying environmental conditions. The DfV framework is an engineering principle to be used within low rate and high value and complexity manufacturing industries to aid in achieving high productivity in assembly via the effective dimensional verification of large volume structures, during final assembly. The DfV framework has been developed to enable engineers to design and plan the effective dimensional verification of large volume, complex structures {{in order to reduce}} failure rates and end-product costs, improve process integrity and efficiency, optimise metrology processes, decrease tooling redundancy and increase product quality and conformance to specification. The theoretical elements of the DfV methods were published in 2016, together with their testing using industrial case studies of representative complexity. The industrial tests published on ScienceDirect proved that by using the new Design for Verification methods alongside the traditional ‘Design for X’ toolbox, the resultant process achieved <b>improved</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis and synthesis, optimized large volume metrology and assembly processes and more cost effective tool and jig design.|$|E

40|$|Drought {{and salt}} stress are major abiotic {{constraints}} affecting crop productivity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). These {{are thought to}} be the most promising traits to improve and stabilize crop yield to meet the demand of increasing population. Wheat like other cereals is recalcitrant to in vitro manipulation. Keeping in view the above mentioned facts, present studies were aimed to develop an efficient reproducible regeneration protocol for gene delivery to develop transgenic wheat lines with <b>improved</b> <b>tolerance</b> against drought and salinity. Different combinations of phytohormones, carbon sources and calli age were evaluated to maximize regeneration. DREB 1 A transcription factor was isolated from rice and transferred to wheat through Agrobacterium mediate transformation. The ectopic expression of DREB 1 A in transgenic plants did not result in growth retardation or visible phenotypic alterations.

40|$|Background: Relapse of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) is universal. Tolerance for treatment with pegylated-interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) is suboptimal and withdrawals due to adverse events frequent. We sought to <b>improve</b> <b>tolerance</b> for treatment to improve outcome. Methods: We used concentration-guided RBV dosing {{to achieve an}} intended 10 mu mol/L concentration with darbepoetin support in combination with peg-IFN alfa- 2 a, 180 mu g for genotype 1 and 135 mu g for genotype 2 / 3 to <b>improve</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Results: A total of 51 / 54 patients (94 %) completed a full treatment course. In the per-protocol analysis 43 % of patients (22 / 51) achieved sustained virological response (SVR), 82 % with HCV genotype 2 / 3 and 22 % with genotype 1, p = 0. 0001. Patients with IL 28 B CC achieved SVR in 73 % (8 / 11) and patients with non-CC in 33 % (14 / 43), p = 0. 016. Patients with mild fi brosis (fi brosis stage 1 - 2) achieved SVR in 56 % (15 / 27), and patients with advanced fi brosis (fi brosis stage 3 - 4) in only 26 % (7 / 27), p = 0. 0267. Conclusions: Concentration-guided RBV dosing with darbepoetin support substantially <b>improves</b> <b>tolerance</b> and offers high adherence to a full peg-IFN and RBV treatment course in patients with post-transplant HCV relapse. With this approach genotype 2 and 3 infections can be treated cost-effectively post-transplant. Genotype 1, IL 28 B non-CC genotype, and advanced fi brosis predicted a low SVR rate...|$|R
