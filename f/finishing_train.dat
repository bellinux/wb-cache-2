50|$|Online {{computer}} control of steel making processes became a reality {{with the first}} use of computers on a hot strip mill in 1962. McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was {{to set up the}} initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> started running under continuous {{computer control}} on November 1, 1962.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Genetic {{algorithms}} and {{simulated annealing}} {{have been evaluated}} for the optimisation of the set-up of the <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> in a hot strip mill. Genetic algorithms proved unsuited to this optimisation problem, despite {{the development of a}} non-linear rank-based genetic algorithm that counters the effects of premature convergence and stalled evolution. The limitations of the genetic algorithm are believed to arise from epistasis, i. e. the interdependencies between input parameters. Simulated annealing, on the other hand, overcame this problem and was used for the final optimisation of the <b>finishing</b> <b>train.</b> The quality of the strip from a simulated mill was increased significantly as a result...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> of a {{hot strip}} mill has been {{modelled}} by using a constant volume element model. The accuracy of the model has been increased by using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A non-linear Rank Based Genetic Algorithm has been developed for the optimization of the work roll profiles in the finishing stands of the simulated hot strip mill. It has been compared with eight other experimental optimization algorithms: Random Walk, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing (SA) and five different Genetic Algorithms (GA). Finally, the work roll profiles have been optimized by the non-linear Rank Based Genetic Algorithm. The quality of the strip from the simulated mill was significantly improved. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} steel strip {{produced}} {{in a wide}} strip rolling mill depends heavily on the careful selection of initial ground work roll profiles {{for each of the}} mill stands in the <b>finishing</b> <b>train.</b> In the past, these profiles were determined by human experts, based on their knowledge and experience. In this research, a self-organising migration algorithm (SOMA), a heuristic optimisation algorithm, has been used to find optimum profiles for a simulated rolling mill. The resulting strip quality produced using the profiles found by the optimisation algorithm and the quality produced using the original specifications are compared. The best set of profiles found by SOMA clearly outperformed the original se...|$|E

Measurements of the ferrite grains and pearlite colonies were conducted with the use of Met-Ilo program supplemented by additional procedures dedicated to structure analysis of ferritic-pearlitic steel. The process of rolling was conducted in simulation in semi-continuous <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> arrangement with different temperature and cooling rate.

The methodology of quantitative description of pearlite morphology in steels {{with the use of the}} method on which a new computer program “PILS” - Pearlite Inter-Lamellar Spacing is based was presented. In order to verify the method, some quantitative tests of microstructure in samples after physical simulation of heat-plastic treatment were conducted on a deformation dilatometer device with diverse cooling rate for steel C 70 D. The process of rolling was conducted in simulation in continuous <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> arrangement.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an integrated model for computing the thermo-mechanical parameters (cross-sectional shape of workpiece, the pass-by-pass strain and strain {{rate and the}} temperature variation during rolling and cooling between inter-stands) and metallurgical parameters (recrystallisation behaviour and austenite grain size—AGS), to assess the potential for developing “Thermo-Mechanical Controlled Process” technology in rod (or bar) rolling, {{which has been a}} well-known technical terminology in strip (or plate) rolling since 1970 s. The advantage of this model is that metallurgical and mechanical parameters are obtained simultaneously in a short computation time compared with other models. The model has been applied to a rod mill to predict the exit cross-sectional shape, area and AGS per pass by incorporating the equations for AGS evolution being used in strip rolling. At the <b>finishing</b> <b>train</b> of rod mills, the strain rates reach as high as 1000 – 3000 s− 1 and the inter-pass times are around 10 – 60 ms. The results show that the proposed model is an efficient tool for evaluating the effects of process-related parameters on product quality and dimensional tolerance of the products in rod (or bar) rolling. The results of the simulation demonstrated that the equation for AGS evolution being used in strip rolling might have limitations when applied directly to rod rolling at a high strain rate. <br /...|$|E
