40|$|Abstract: The {{traction}} {{infinitely variable}} transmission (TIVT) used in the power train of electric vehicles(EVS) was designed. Firstly, based on the analysis of basic structure and working principle, the mathematic models were established on the transmission ratio, slipping ratio, transferring torsion and transmission efficiency; Secondly, Transmission characteristics of the TIVT were analyzed and calculated using ADAMS software. The calculation results show that: the export torsion varies with sway angle of steer ring as the import torsion is fixed. The transmission efficiency of TIVT is large when the motion of <b>driving</b> <b>parts</b> is pure-rolling or the slipping ratio is less. The efficiency could be reached more than 99 % by rational designing. Theoretically, the driving distance of EVS matched with TIVT could be increased...|$|R

50|$|In other words, the SEF {{does not}} {{immediately}} or directly contribute to saccade initiation. But, the SEF {{is thought to}} improve saccade production by using prior knowledge of anticipated task requirements to influence saccadic eye movements. It does so by balancing gaze holding and gaze shifting actions, yielding a modest improvement in performance in stop signal tasks by delaying saccade initiation when necessary. It can be thought that the FEF does the <b>driving</b> <b>part</b> of saccade initiation, while the SEF acts as a backseat passenger, advising the driver {{as to what to}} do based on past insights.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} a sealed wave power {{generator}} has been proposed, whose <b>driving</b> <b>parts</b> are sealed in a closed outer covering {{to protect them from}} corrosion by sea water. Wave energy is collected using a pendulum. Overrunning roller clutches are used to convert the swing of the pendulum to unidirectional rotation of generators. A design method based on the Principle of Conservation of Energy has been proposed. A guide plate is equipped on the platform where the wave power generator sits on, to ensure the swing plane of the pendulum parallel to the main vibration plane of the wave. Power processing circuit has also been equipped, which can perform automatic current and voltage regulation under the condition of large variation of wave height and cycle. Experiments have demonstrated that the sealed wave power generator is applicable...|$|R
50|$|Charlie puts an {{advertisement}} in a lonely hearts column {{and becomes a}} member of an internet dating website, meeting and falling for Brenda Boyle (Carmel Cryan), a Salvation Army member from Clacton. However, their romance begins to fizzle out. After not seeing each other for several weeks, Brenda ends the relationship, telling Charlie that she and her brother are moving to Madeira. Not wishing to end the relationship, Charlie gets approval from Stacey and Mo to go with her. He returns not long after with a Russian woman named Orlenda (Mary Tamm). Mo is suspicious of her and follows her around. On seeing her with another man, Mo takes a photo to show Charlie. Charlie confronts Orlenda who admits that she was using Charlie for his money and he asks her to leave. When Stacey stops taking medication for her bipolar disorder, Charlie insists that she has to start again as she almost lost her baby Lily. Charlie asks Dot Branning (June Brown) to speak to Stacey as he believes that Lily's father is Stacey's deceased husband Bradley (Charlie Clements), Dot's step-grandson. Dot then reveals that Lily is not Bradley's. Charlie asks Stacey why she has not told the truth and begs her to take her pills, trying to force one into her mouth. Stacey says she has already taken them and Charlie apologises, then walks out of the house in tears. He spends the night at Patrick Trueman's (Rudolph Walker) house, and invites Patrick and Jim Branning (John Bardon) for drinks. Later, Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) asks Charlie {{to take her to the}} hospital because she is worried her baby Richard is unwell, however after <b>driving</b> <b>part</b> way, Charlie tells her the symptoms are normal. As he turns around, he reverses into some boxes in front of a van, and is then stopped by a police officer (Laurence Mitchell). The next day, Mo opens a letter for Charlie and learns was caught driving over the limit. They argue as he could lose his driving licence, and Charlie later apologises to Stacey for forcing her to take her pills.|$|E
50|$|On the 9h {{the command}} {{advanced}} {{in the direction}} of the gap in Rocky Faced Ridge. After marching two miles the Eighty-Fourth Indiana and Ninety-Sixth Illinois were ordered to unsling knapsacks and prepare for an assault on the enemy's works. Three companies of the Eighty-Fourth, under Major Boyd, were thrown forward as skirmishers, with orders to press up the hill as far as possible, the regiment following in close support. The skirmishers became warmly engaged, and, being pressed by the heavy skirmish line of the enemy, two companies, under Captain Miller, were sent to reinforce them. The rebels had a decided advantage in position and shelter, and, as our men pressed forward, they took advantage of every rock and tree to cover them from the deadly fire blazing forth from the summit of the Ridge. At six p.m., the Eighty-Fourth charged the enemy's works, but were met by such a fierce and deadly fire as to be repulsed, with a loss of fourteen killed and wounded. Major William A. Boyd was mortally wounded while gallantly leading his companies. The main portion of the command retired a short distance and bivouacked, leaving four companies on the skirmish line till morning. On the 10th, the command moved to the left in support of a battery, and remained until night of the next day, when they moved to the right of the gap to relieve a portion of the Fourteenth Corps. The Eighty-Fourth took position behind temporary works on the front line. One company of fifty-two men, under Captain Carter, was advanced as skirmishers. The skirmishing was quite brisk during the twelfth. On the 13th it was ascertained by our advance that the rebels had evacuated Rocky Faced Ridge during the night, and the Eighty-Fourth moved through the Gap, passing through Dalton, and halting for the night nine miles south. The next morning they advanced towards Resacca, and found the enemy in force. The regiment at once formed in line of battle on the right of the road, forming the right of the Second Brigade. The Third Brigade was in front, and they moved forward to their support, taking a hill in front of the enemy's works. They then started to reform the Second Brigade, but while making the movement the enemy made an assault upon our front line, <b>driving</b> <b>part</b> of the Second Brigade in confusion from its position. The Eighty-Fourth, however, stood firm, and was soon formed in a strong position by General Stanley in person. The enemy was approaching in heavy force, four columns deep. The command was in a critical situation. The weight of the enemy's columns was irresistible. Yet the command awaited the shock with the calmness of heroes. At this thrilling moment, rescue came. New columns of Union troops marched through the woods, and the fighting Twentieth Corps of General Hooker fell upon the rebel columns like an avalanche, hurling them back in dismay and confusion.|$|E
40|$|A tilting {{calibration}} {{mechanism is}} periodically deployed {{to view the}} reference temperature target during on-board calibration of a spaceborne imaging sensor and stowed after calibration. In the present work, we have proposed a new design strategy using a shape memory alloy (SMA) spring as an actuator that provides a fail-safe function to prevent the blocking of the main optical path when the mechanical <b>driving</b> <b>part</b> of the mechanism is stopped at a certain position during on-board calibration. Although a launch locking device was not considered in the design, this approach {{makes it possible to}} impose mechanical constraints on the <b>driving</b> <b>part</b> of the mechanism in severe launch vibration environments. The effectiveness of the proposed design was experimentally validated by a deploying and stowing function test and launch vibration environment tests such as a sine burst test, a random vibration test, and a pyroshock simulating impulse shock test. The test results demonstrated that the mechanism fulfills all the required functions for on-board calibration. The use of an SMA spring actuator was proved effective for implementing the dual function of a fail-safe in an emergency phase and a mechanical constraint on the <b>driving</b> <b>part</b> of the mechanism in severe launch vibration environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Parallel robots {{are widely}} used in the {{manufacturing}} industry. In this paper, a planar 3 -RRR parallel robot is studied. The inverse kinematics mathematical model is established {{for this kind of}} mechanism. Furthermore, a physical simulation model is established by virtue of MATLAB/SimMechanics and a relevant inverse kinematics simulation is implemented at the assumption of known conditions of the end-effector of robot. Through inverse kinematics simulation, the motion rules of <b>driving</b> <b>parts</b> of the planar 3 -RRR parallel robot are obtained, and visualization of simulation process is realized in the system. The simulation results show that this method is much more effective and convenient when a certain simulation is implemented for the parallel mechanisms. Meanwhile, it provides a theoretical foundation and a better analytical approach of simulation for the controller design and further analysis of complex multi-linkage mechanisms in the future...|$|R
