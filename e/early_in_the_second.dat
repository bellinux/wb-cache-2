This disaster also reached the Silvan Elves of Lórien, many of whom also fled the [...] "Nameless Terror" [...] (it was not recognized as a Balrog at the time). The Elves called the place Moria, the [...] "Black Pit" [...] or [...] "Black Chasm" [...] (though the name Moria also appears on the West Gate of Moria, constructed thousands of years <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Age).|$|R

50|$|Lee {{would later}} call on {{subordinates}} to submit reports on <b>the</b> battle <b>in</b> {{an effort to}} determine what had gone wrong, but {{on the night of}} November 7 more pressing matters demanded his attention. Loss of the bridgehead destroyed his plans for an offensive and left his army dangerously extended on a now indefensible front. Meade, acting quickly, might pin Lee's army against the Rapidan River just as Lee had tried to pin Maj. Gen. John Pope's army against the Rappahannock River one year <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Battle of Bull Run. Lee immediately canceled his plans for an attack on French and within hours had his army marching south.|$|R

25|$|Mike Brearley, {{the captain}} Botham had replaced, resumed the reins {{for the third}} Test, at Headingley. This started out very badly: Australia scored 401 (John Dyson 102; Kim Hughes 89; but Botham took 6–95), and asked England to follow on after bowling them out for 174 (Lillee took 4 for 49; Lawson 3 for 32). The one bright point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> innings came from Botham, who top scored with 50 (his first since he had been made captain 13 matches <b>earlier).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> innings, Botham came to the crease with England on 105 for 5, still 126 behind. Matters did not improve: Geoffrey Boycott and Bob Taylor soon followed, and with England 135 for 7 and still 92 runs behind an innings defeat looked likely.|$|R
