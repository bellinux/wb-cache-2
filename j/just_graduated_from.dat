500|$|During the 1950s {{the synagogue}} had been [...] "traditional" [...] (Conservadox), rather than {{strictly}} Orthodox; for example, the Monroe Street building had seating for {{men on the}} left, seating for women on the right, and mixed seating in the middle.

500|$|After {{the game}} was renamed, Doug Church {{recruited}} Dan Schmidt, a college friend who had <b>just</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>from</b> MIT, as a programmer. The team abandoned the Space Rogue engine and created a new one that could display a believable 3D world—one with varying heights and texture-mapped floors and ceilings. Church estimated that {{the first year of}} production was dedicated to creating the game's technological base. However, Neurath stated that the team spent [...] "comparatively little" [...] time on the game's technology, and that [...] "most was spent working on game features, mechanics, and world building". Their ultimate goal was to create the [...] "finest dungeon game, a game that was tangibly better than any of the long line of dungeon games that came before it." [...] Each member of the small team assumed multiple roles; for example, the game's first two levels were designed by Paul Neurath, while the rest were built by artists, designers and programmers. According to Schmidt, Neurath contracted a writer to create the game's story and dialogue, but the relationship was a [...] "mismatch"; and so the team decided to write the plot themselves. Alongside his programming work, Church co-wrote the game's story with Dan Schmidt, and he gradually took on project leader responsibilities. Writing duties for each level were given to the person who created that level; Schmidt's role was to edit the dialogue of each level to fit with that of the others. Schmidt also created the game's sound effects, which were synthesized—no recorded sounds were used—in a graphical sound editor. Neurath, who Church said was [...] "very day to day {{at the beginning of the}} project", became more involved with the company's business and finances.|$|E
