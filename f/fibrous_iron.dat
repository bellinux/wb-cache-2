40|$|The fine {{iron ores}} from Chile are reduced in a {{laboratory}} fluidized bed at 973 - 1173 K with CO-H- 2 -CO 2 mixtures to investigate the influence of reduction condition on the morphology of newly formed metallic iron and its corresponding agglomeration behavior. The results reveal that the addition of H- 2 in CO accelerates the moving rate of the Fe/Fe 1 -xO interface and increases {{the amount of the}} iron nucleus formed during the initial reduction period, which induce the transformation of iron morphology from fibrous to dense. The presence of CO 2 in CO makes the <b>fibrous</b> <b>iron</b> shorter and sparser, especially when the content of CO 2 is 30 % (by volume), the iron appears as "cactus-like. " The increase of reduction temperature makes the <b>fibrous</b> <b>iron</b> stronger and more active. The sticking index indicates that the long and strong iron whiskers are prone to form stable agglomerates even at a low metallization degree, but the dense iron trends to behave separate. Furthermore, based on the precipitation mechanism of iron proposed by the authors, it is manifested that the agglomeration behavior of the fine iron ores could be controlled by pre-reduction in H- 2 -rich reducing gas (H- 2 /(H- 2 + CO) >= 30 %, by volume). </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{previously}} unknown, complex {{crystal structures}} of two fibrous ferric iron phosphate minerals have been solved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The {{structure of a}} slightly arsenatian kidwellite has been refined in space group P 2 /c (a = 20. 117 (4), b = 5. 185 (1), c = 13. 978 (3) Å, b = 107. 07 (3) º, V = 1393. 8 (5) Å 3, Z = 2) to R 1 = 5. 21 %; a revision of both space group symmetry and chemical formula is proposed. The idealized formula is Na(Fe 3 +,M) 9 +x(OH) 11 (H 2 O) 3 (PO 4) 6, where M = Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + or other metal cation, and x & 0. 3. The structure of a slightly arsenatian ‘laubmannite ’ (as defined by Moore, 1970) has been refined in space group Pbcm (a = 5. 172 (1), b = 13. 999 (3), c = 31. 083 (6) Å, V = 2250. 5 (8) Å 3, Z = 4) to R 1 = 3. 14 %. The revised, idealized formula is (Fe 3 +,Fe 2 +,M) 8 +x(OH,H 2 O) 9 (-H 2 O) 2 (PO 4) 5, where M = Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + or other metal cation, and x & 0. 1. The framework structures of both minerals are similar. Dominant building units are dimers composed of face- and edge-sharing FeO 6 octahedra. Whereas kidwellite contains an additional trimer built of three corner-sharing FeO 6 octahedra, ‘laubmannite ’ instead contains a dimer built of two corner-sharing FeO 6 octahedra. Kidwellite contains only trivalent iron, while one of the Fe sites in ‘laubmannite ’ is occupied by a mixture of Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + in a 1 : 1 ratio. In both structures, the FeO 6 -based building units are linked via corners to PO 4 tetrahedra; the M sites are located in narrow channels and have very low occupancies (~ 2 to 7 %) and strongly distorted [6]- or [5 + 1]-coordinations. Close structural relations between kidwellite and ‘laubmannite’, and other <b>fibrous</b> <b>iron</b> phosphates explain observations of epitaxial intergrowths of them...|$|E
5000|$|The neurokinetic {{user-controlled}} morphologic nanoparticle bundles {{that form}} the suit reside in Stark's body, and form a <b>fibrous</b> wetweb of <b>iron</b> and platinum, that can be commanded to form any type of structure upon Stark's skin, such as large boxing gloves, or weapons, including large guns extending from his arms or a lightsaber-like energy sword with which Iron Man was actually able to harm one of the Worthy during the 2011 [...] "Fear Itself" [...] storyline. The nano-machines can even mimic the appearance of clothes, and then dissociate to transform into the Iron Man armor whenever Stark wishes. The suit adds less than twenty-five pounds to Stark's body mass, and can stop a howitzer shell.|$|R
30|$|The SAR value plots show that, {{irrespective}} of the method of conjugation, BSA improves the heating efficiency of the system. While here we report the phenomenon, we are to further investigate the possible reasons behind this interesting phenomenon. It is stated elsewhere that isotropic clusters of BSA are formed under AC magnetic field [63]. Isotropic clusters might have possibly prevented the <b>fibrous</b> aggregation of <b>iron</b> oxide nanoparticles under the AC magnetic field. In general, fibrous aggregation increases the critical size of the nanoparticles in a solution and hence decreases the specific heat of the system. It is well reported that aggregation of nanoparticles decreases the SAR value significantly [40, 64]. Prevention of aggregation by BSA conjugation might have thus enhanced the SAR value of the system. As reported by Samanta et al. in similar studies with SPIONs, this phenomenon could also {{be attributed to the}} increased colloidal stability of the BSA-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles [37]. The BSA-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were well separated and well suspended, even under applied magnetic field, whereas the hydrophilic iron oxide nanoparticles without BSA conjugation aggregate in the presence of magnetic field. This interesting phenomenon of improved heating efficiency relating to the colloidal stability imparted by the BSA to the iron oxide nanoparticles will be studied further.|$|R
40|$|The present {{project work}} on “Reduction and Swelling Behaviour of Fired Iron Ore Pellets” was {{undertaken}} {{with a view}} to promote the effective utilization of iron ore and coal fines in sponge iron making. Presently, India has become the world leader in sponge iron production and the production of steel by DR-EAF route is increasing day by day. In the present project work, the effect of addition of concentrated sugarcane juice binder on the physical properties of fired iron ore pellets was investigated. The crushing strength and drop number were found to be maximum at 2 % binder addition, followed by a decrease with further increase in binder concentration. A reverse trend was observed in the case of porosity, i. e. porosity of fired pellets increased with rise in binder concentration from 2 % to 6 %. The pellets fired at 13000 C were processed for reduction and swelling studies in different types of coal. The degree of reduction of fired iron ore pellets increased with increase of reduction temperature and time up to the range studied. The extent of swelling in fired iron ore pellets during their production increased with increase of reduction time, most probably due to the structural changes and <b>fibrous</b> growth of <b>iron</b> particles. SEM images of few reduced iron ore pellets were also taken...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{generation}} of {{huge amount of}} iron ore and coal fines {{there is a need}} to develop a technique to utilize these fines. The present project work has been undertaken to study reduction and swelling characteristics of hematite iron ore pellets made from iron ore fines under different conditions. The physical properties of fired iron ore pellets were studied. The compressive strength and drop number of fired pellets increased with the increase of firing temperature due to the enhancement in the extent of sintering and consolidation of iron ore fines. The main objectives of the present work have been to study the effects of (i) Firing temperature (ii) Reduction temperature and time (iii) Addition of concentrated sugarcane juice on the reduction and swelling behaviours of fired iron ore pellets. The results indicated a decrease in the extent of reduction with increase of firing temperature. The reduction rate of fired iron pellets were found to increase with rise of reduction temperature from (800 °C- 950 °C). The degree of reduction of fired pellet increased with increase of reduction time, the rate being faster in the initial 20 - 30 minutes followed by a decrease thereafter. Reduction at a temperature of 850 °C, in general, gave lowest degree of swelling in the reduced pellets. The highest degree of swelling at a reduction temperature of 850 °C appears to be due to <b>fibrous</b> growth of <b>iron</b> in the reduced pellets. Slightly lower values swelling in the fired iron ore pellets reduced at 900 °C and 950 °C appear to be due to sintering of iron particles in the pellets, as indicated by their SEM micrographs. Effect of reduction time in the range studied on the extent of swelling was not found to be distinguishable...|$|R
