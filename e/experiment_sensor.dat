40|$|A {{lunar surface}} sampler {{essentially}} {{identical to that}} operated from Surveyor 3 was mounted on Surveyor 7 and performed flawlessly on the moon throughout a range of operating temperatures from + 180 °F to − 167 °F. The motor current was sampled during lunar bearing and trenching tests, and these data, together with preflight calibrations enabled us to calculate the forces involved in these tests. After minimal lunar surface testing, the surface sampler was employed to release the sensor head of the α-scattering instrument, which had jammed in its background position. Subsequently, the sensor head was relocated to analyze a rock and, still later, to analyze some subsurface lunar material. The mechanical tests of the surface {{in the vicinity of}} Tycho indicated that the surface behaved in a manner that was quantitatively similar to the behavior of the material close to Surveyor 3, but the surface near Tycho appeared qualitatively to be more deformable and less brittle. A rock was weighed and found to have a density between 2. 4 and 3. 1 g/cm^ 3 (earth basis). Another rock was broken by a moderately hard blow from the sampler. The soil varied in depth from 1 to at least several inches over underlying rock fragments near Surveyor 7.

40|$|In-line sensors {{were used}} to measure quarter milk {{conductivity}} and milk temperature in the milking claw for monitoring mastitis in dairy cows. In a preliminary <b>experiment,</b> <b>sensor</b> data {{were used to}} develop algorithms and threshold values {{for the detection of}} mastitis. In a later experiment, these thresholds were implemented in a monitoring system. Thresholds were determined in order to detect severe (clinical) mastitis in an early stage and subclinical mastitis, respectively. Daily milk yield and temperature served to establish the severity of mastitis. Nearly all cases of clinical and 50 % of the cases of subclinical mastitis were detected. From results of measurements it appeared that onset and cessation of oestrus-related mounting activity could be predicted by pedometers. This information was used to correlate oestrus-insemination interval and conception rate. The probability of conception was highest between 6 and 17 h after increased pedometer activity with an estimated optimum at 12 h. To improve the reliability a detection model has been developed to process the measured variables in a combined way. It can be concluded that the detection model improves the sensitivity of oestrus detection by 10 - 20 %. The sensitivity of detection of clinical and subclinical mastitis appeared to be 90 % and 76 %, respectively. However, the demands concerning the specificity (defined as: percentage of truly negatives indicated correctly) may not be met...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{total ozone}} {{measurements}} from five Brewer spectroradiometers {{located at the}} Iberian Peninsula with satellite observations given by the GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring <b>Experiment)</b> <b>sensor.</b> The analyzed period covers simultaneous ozone values from July 1995 until December 2004. The regression analysis shows an excellent agreement between Brewer-GOME values in the five locations; the coefficient of correlation is always higher than 0. 92 and the {{root mean square error}} is about 3 %. Moreover, the comparison shows that the satellite retrieval accuracy is within the uncertainty of current ground-based instruments. In addition, the effects of several variables, such as cloudiness, solar zenith angle (SZA), effective temperature and total ozone values in Brewer-GOME differences are analyzed. The results indicate that clouds induce a minor dependence of GOME values on the SZA. For example, during heavy cloudy conditions in Madrid station, GOME observations overestimate ground-based Brewer data for low AMF (low SZA values) by 2 % while for high AMF (high SZA values) the satellite underestimates ground-based ozone values by 1 %. Moreover, the dependence of Brewer-GOME differences with respect to SZA for cloud-free conditions {{may be due to the}} variability of effective temperature. This fact could indicate that the effective temperature estimated by GOME does not fully reflect the actual atmospheric temperature variability. Finally, GOME ozone observations slightly underestimate the highest values measured by the Brewer spectrophotometers and overestimates the lowest ground-based measurements...|$|E

The report is by no means an exhaustive examination of all the relevant activities, which occurred during the time span mentioned above for two reasons. First, the time span being considered in this report is rather short since the MAMS was not active throughout the time span being considered to allow a detailed characterization. Second, as the name of the report implied, it is a quick look at the acceleration data. Consequently, a more comprehensive report, the ISS Increment- 2 report, will be published following the conclusion of the Increment- 2 tour of duty.
