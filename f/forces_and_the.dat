5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> headquarters of the U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also {{the headquarters of the}} CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt {{confident}} that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{presents the}} integration of <b>the</b> surface roughness <b>and</b> chip formation monitoring by using <b>the</b> cutting <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cutting temperature during the in-process turning. The surface roughness prediction model is proposed by utilizing the response surface analysis with the Box-Behnken design. The effects of cutting parameters on <b>the</b> cutting <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cutting temperature are investigated. <b>The</b> cutting <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cutting temperature are measured to help analyze the relation between <b>the</b> surface roughness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cutting conditions. The models of <b>the</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cutting temperature are also proposed based on the experimental data. The in-process monitoring of chip formation is developed to detect <b>the</b> continuous chip <b>and</b> <b>the</b> broken chip by utilizing the power spectrum density of dynamic cutting <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> variance of the dynamic cutting temperature. The broken chip formation {{is required for the}} reliable turning operation. The algorithm is proposed to obtain the broken chip by changing the cutting conditions during the cutting process based on <b>the</b> cutting <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cutting temperature. It has been proved by series of cutting experiments that the proposed surface roughness model can be effectively used to predict <b>the</b> surface roughness, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> broken chip is well identified by the proposed method...|$|R

5|$|By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria {{ended its}} {{war with the}} Ottoman Empire and {{prepared}} to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though his}} {{military}} career begun {{almost as an}} afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered {{as one of the}} most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown him to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field.|$|E

One more Hungarian civilian was murdered by the Serbian State Security Service—with SDG assistance—after inquiring about her relatives {{who were killed in}} November 1991. Her body was thrown down a well in Dalj Planina. With her murder, the total number of civilians killed in Erdut between November 1991 and June 1992 reached 37, of which 22 were Hungarians and 15 were Croats.|$|E
