500|$|Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food {{division}} as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met {{used the}} proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being [...] "lax" [...] in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it had kind of lost its way. We felt we could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under-resourced their R and done {{a number of things}} to make the number, make the number. Cost reduction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> {{but you have to be}} responsible about it. You have to protect the seed today because that will be the tree that bears fruit in the future. I don't think Pillsbury had done that.|$|E

[...] "The task of democracy", Dewey concludes, [...] "is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute".|$|E
