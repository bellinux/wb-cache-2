5000|$|<b>Formulary</b> <b>apportionment,</b> {{also known}} as unitary taxation, is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a {{corporation}} or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with {{other parts of the}} corporation or group to be assigned according to the arm's length standard commonly used in transfer pricing. In contrast, <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> {{does not}} reflect the {{economic}} profit or loss of each entity. For example, a profitable group that incurs a loss in a particular territory has taxable profit apportioned to that territory, and conversely a loss-making group which makes profits in a particular territory has no taxable profits in that territory.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> in the United States {{dates back}} to the late 19th century. At that time, there was no state or federal {{corporate}} income tax, but the states did assess property and capital stock taxes. With the growth of the transcontinental railroads, state taxation authorities faced companies which had not just immovable property (tracks) but also non-trivial movable property (rolling stock) operating across state lines. The property value of a company assessable to state tax was thus assessed by examining the proportion of value of railway lines within the state, and then taking that proportion of the company's total value (including the movable property) as the portion of value located within a certain state. When Wisconsin adopted a state income tax in 1911, it also used <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> (based on property, cost of manufacture, and sales), pointing to the impracticality of otherwise calculating separate accounts for companies operating in multiple states.|$|E
5000|$|When {{applied to}} a {{corporate}} group, <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> requires combined reporting of the group's results. The parent {{and all of its}} subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity (unitary combination), and the method is then also known as worldwide unitary taxation. In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes [...] "overseas business organization", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents.|$|E
5000|$|A frequently-proposed {{alternative}} to arm's-length principle-based transfer pricing rules is <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment,</b> under which corporate profits are allocated according to objective metrics of activity such as sales, employees, or fixed assets. Some countries (including Canada and the United States) allocate taxing rights among their political subdivisions in this way, {{and it has}} recommended by the European Commission for use within the European Union. According to the amicus curiae brief, filed by the attorney generals of Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon {{in support of the}} state of California in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board, the <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> method, which is also known as the unitary apportionment method, has at least three major advantages over the separate accounting system when applied to multi-jurisdictional businesses. First, the unitary method captures the added wealth and value resulting from economic interdependencies of multistate and multinational corporations through their functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale. A unitary business also benefits from more intangible values shared among its constituent parts, such as reputation, good will, customers and other business relationships. See, e.g., Mobil, 445 U.S. at 438-40; Container, 463 U.S. at 164-65.|$|E
5000|$|Formulary {{methods are}} used in both the United States and Canada to {{apportion}} income of corporations between the sub-national jurisdictions in which they operate. In many U.S. states <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> {{is also used to}} apportion the combined income of a related group of companies. Tax in each US state is thus assessed based on the unitary combination of all related entities. [...] The related entities included in the unitary combination may be worldwide entities or only entities within the United States, depending on the state. The latter is known as water's edge combined reporting.|$|E
5000|$|Under the U.S. Constitution, {{states are}} {{prohibited}} from taxing income of a resident of another state unless the connection with the taxing state reach a certain level (called “nexus”). [...] Most states do not tax non-business income of out of state corporations. Since the tax must be fairly apportioned, the states and localities compute income of out of state corporations (including those in foreign countries) taxable in the state by applying <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> to the total business taxable income of the corporation. Many states use a formula based on ratios of property, payroll, and sales within the state to those items outside the state.|$|E
50|$|Forty-three states {{impose a}} tax on the income of individuals, {{sometimes}} referred to as personal income tax. State income tax rates vary widely from state to state. The states imposing an income tax on individuals tax all taxable income (as defined in the state) of residents. Such residents are allowed a credit for taxes paid to other states. Most states tax income of nonresidents earned within the state. Such income includes wages for services within the state as well as income from a business with operations in the state. Where income is from multiple sources, <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> may be required for nonresidents. Generally, wages are apportioned based on the ratio days worked in the state to total days worked.|$|E
50|$|OFII traces {{its roots}} back to 1990 {{when a group}} of US {{subsidiaries}} of Foreign-Owned Corporations worked together to fight a tax in California on global profits. In 1994, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of California against Barclays Bank, a foreign based multinational corporation by a vote of 7-2 (and by a vote of 9-0 against Colgate-Palmolive, a US-based multinational corporation) - sanctioning a state's right to tax the worldwide profits of a multinational corporation via unitary worldwide combined reporting and <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment.</b> The original group included Nestle, Sony, Unilever and four other non-US-based corporations. Its current President and CEO is Nancy McLernon, formerly with Citizens for a Sound Economy (later renamed Freedom Works) and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation (later renamed Americans for Prosperity) established by David and Charles Koch, of Koch Industries.|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-20th century, the [...] "Massachusetts Formula" [...] {{had become}} a {{commonly}} used standard of <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment.</b> The formula placed an equal weight on three factors: group sales, payroll, and property within each jurisdiction. Out of the forty-four states (plus one more jurisdiction, the District of Columbia) which imposed a corporate income tax in 1978, all but Iowa used the Massachusetts Formula. Iowa's formula ignored payroll and property, looking solely at sales; the constitutionality of this formula was challenged in the Moorman case in Iowa, and it was held invalid by a trial court under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{as well as the}} Commerce Clause of Article One; however, the Iowa Supreme Court reversed the trial court in 1978. This marked the beginning of a trend towards increasing weight on sales {{at the expense of the}} other two factors; by 2004, there were only twelve states still using an equally weighted formula.|$|E
5000|$|Several US states allow, {{but do not}} mandate, that a {{corporate}} group include foreign entities {{for the purpose of}} assessing factors used in <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> ("worldwide unitary combination"). California, for example, began to accept worldwide unitary combination in the 1940s. However, its attempt to require such combination led to strong protests from US trading partners. The UK-US double taxation treaty signed in 1975 included a provision to prohibit US states from [...] "taking into account the income, deductions, receipts, or out-goings of a related enterprise" [...] in the United Kingdom or any other country for the purpose of determining tax liability. However, the US Senate, whose consent was required to ratify the treaty, rejected this provision, and the treaty was amended by a protocol in 1979. [...] The Supreme Court explicitly held worldwide unitary combination as constitutional in separate cases in 1983 and 1994 (Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board). [...] In 1985 the United Kingdom passed retaliatory legislation which would have overridden the UK-US tax treaty and denied significant UK tax benefits to corporations headquartered in US states which applied worldwide unitary taxation. This and further pressure from foreign governments, the executive branch and multinational corporations led US states to adopt a [...] "water's edge" [...] limitation on unitary combination, allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves whether or not to include foreign entities in their combined reporting.|$|E

40|$|From an {{international}} perspective, <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> {{has traditionally been}} viewed {{as little more than}} transfer pricing’s “poor relation” as a division-of-income methodology. It receives only grudging recognition as a method of attributing the profits to a permanent establishment under Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention; it receives no mention at all in Article 9 as a method for distributing the profits of associated enterprises among the contracting states in which they conduct their activities; and it was assailed by the international business community and by the EU Member States as out of step with internationally excepted norms in the litigation in the United States over the constitutionality of the application of California’s worldwide combined reporting regime to multinational enterprises. With the European Commission’s proposal for the use of <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> as a means of dividing the consolidated corporate tax base for companies’ EU-wide activities among the Member States, <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> may have acquired a new respectability in the international tax arena.

40|$|The {{taxation}} {{of multinational}} banks currently {{is governed by}} the general principles of international tax. However, it is arguable that there are characteristics exclusive to multinational banks that may warrant the consideration of a separate taxing regime. This article argues {{that because of the}} unique nature of multinational banks, the traditional international tax rules governing jurisdiction to tax and allocation of income do not produce a result which is optimal, as it does not reflect economic reality. That is, the current system does not produce a result that accurately reflects the economic source of the income or the location of the economic activity. The suggested alternative is unitary taxation using global <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment.</b> <b>Formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> is considered as an alternative that reflects economic reality by recognising the unique nature of multinational banks and allocating the income to the location of the economic activity. The unique nature of multinational banking is recognised in the fact that <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> does not attempt to undertake a transactional division of a highly integrated multinational entity. Rather, it allocates income to the jurisdictions based on an economically justifiable formula. Starting from this recognition, {{the purpose of this article}} is to demonstrate that <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> is a theoretically superior (or optimal) model for the taxation of multinational banks. An optimal regime, for the purposes of this article, is considered to be one that distributes the taxing rights in an equitable manner between the relevant jurisdictions, while, simultaneously allowing decisions of the international banks to be tax neutral. In this sense, neutrality is viewed as an economic concept and equity is regarded as a legal concept. A neutral tax system is one in which tax rules do not affect economic choices about commercial activities. Neutrality will ideally be across jurisdictions as well as across traditional and non-traditional industries. The primary focus of this article is jurisdictional neutrality. A system that distributes taxing rights in an equitable manner between the relevant jurisdictions ensures that each country receives its fair share of tax revenue. Given the increase in multinational banking, jurisdictions should be concerned that they are receiving their fair share. Inter-nation equity is concerned with re-determining the proper division of the tax base among countries. Richard and Peggy Musgrave argue that sharing of the tax base by countries of source should be seen as a matter of inter-nation equity requiring international cooperation. The rights of the jurisdiction of residency will also be at issue. To this extent, while it is agreed that inter-nation equity is an essential attribute to an international tax regime, there is no universal agreement as to how to achieve it. The current system attempts to achieve such equity through a combined residency and source regime, with the transfer pricing rules used to apportion income between the relevant jurisdictions. However, this article suggests, that as an alternative to the current regime, equity would be achieved through <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment.</b> Opposition to <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> is generally based on the argument that it is not a theoretically superior (or optimal) model because of the implementation difficulties. Yet these are two separate issues. As such, this article is divided into two core parts. The first part examines the theoretical soundness of the <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> model concluding that it is theoretically superior to the arm’s length pricing requirement of the traditional transfer pricing regime. The second part examines the practical implications of accepting <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> as an optimal model with a view to disclosing the issues that arise when a <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> regime is adopted. Prior to an analysis of the theoretical and practical application of <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> to multinational banks, the unique nature of these banks is considered.

40|$|In 2001, the European Commission {{endorsed}} a future company tax strategy {{that would allow}} EU companies the option of calculating their EU profits on a common consolidated tax base and allow Member States to tax their share of that base at national rates.

40|$|In this {{symposium}} Essay, I {{explore the}} instrumentality of corporate tax-residence determination in territorial tax systems. Using the United States {{as a case}} study, I show that tax-residence determination had a historic “positive functionality”. Namely, tax-residence positively pointed {{to the source of}} income earned, and distributed by, a corporation. However, in current economic environment the positive functionality is obsolete. Instead, the modern functionality of corporate tax residence is a “negative” one. That is, to assure that income is not sourced at a jurisdiction in which income could not have possibly been produced. Under such a view, corporate tax-residence should be constructed as an anti-income-shifting mechanism. One way to achieve such result is to base corporate tax-residence determination on <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> that takes into account the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s real economic attributes, as well as the proportional part of corporation’s contribution to the control-group earnings. The functionality of <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment</b> in this context is not to allocate tax jurisdiction (the traditional use of <b>formulary</b> <b>apportionment),</b> but rather to assure that a corporation is not a resident where it has no economic existence. Current territorial reform proposals in the United States ignore the important function of tax-residence in supporting source-taxation.
