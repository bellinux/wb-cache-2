5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was a typeI fireball, i.e. {{an ordinary}} chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44kg, which was estimated {{on the basis}} of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. <b>It</b> <b>lost</b> approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6km. <b>It</b> <b>lost</b> mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} {{variant of}} the B-52H was the EB-52H, which would have consisted of 16 modified and augmented B-52H airframes with additional electronic jamming capabilities. This variant would have restored USAF airborne jamming capability that <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> on retiring the EF-111 Raven. The program was canceled in 2005 following the removal of funds for the stand-off jammer. The program was revived in 2007, and cut again in early 2009.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} last in {{the previous}} season, the Daredevils added players such as Mahela Jayawardene, Andre Russell, Kevin Pietersen and Ross Taylor to the squad. Eric Simons succeeded Greg Shipperd as the head coach and T. A. Sekhar took the mentorship. The team won 11 of the 16 matches played in the league stage of the IPL and topped the point table. However, <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> both its two matches in the playoffs and finished at the third place. In the CLT20, they won two of its four group stage matches, while {{the other two were}} abandoned due to rain. It topped its group and reached the semi-final, where <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> to the Highveld Lions. Morné Morkel was the highest wicket-taker in the IPL, whereas skipper Virender Sehwag became the first batsman to score five consecutive fifties in the league. After the CLT20, the team released fourteen of its players, including Robin Bist, Aaron Finch and Venugopal Rao, signing Jesse Ryder, Johan Botha and Jeevan Mendis.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> {{usefulness}} {{for long}} distances, the National Roads system has acquired local importance: EN13 that cuts {{the city in}} half, in a north-south direction, is used by commuters originating from the northern suburbs and from Vila do Conde, in the south, to travel downtown. The EN205 and the EN206 are used by commuters starting from {{the interior of the}} municipality.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> its identity the following day {{off the coast of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|At around 0000 UTC on July 31, Brenda {{moved into}} Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> its {{tropical}} characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the rank pyramid were the common soldiers: pedes (infantryman) and eques (cavalryman). Unlike his 2nd-century counterpart, the 4th-century soldier's food and {{equipment}} was not deducted from his salary (stipendium), but was provided free. This is because the stipendium, paid in debased silver denarii, was under Diocletian worth far less than in the 2nd century. <b>It</b> <b>lost</b> its residual value under Constantine and ceased to be paid regularly in mid-4th century.|$|E
5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> power quickly.

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. <b>It</b> <b>lost</b> more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

The next day, 14 August, they would lose their Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Alois Stoeckl.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before <b>it</b> <b>lost</b> too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
