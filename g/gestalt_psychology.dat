5|$|Asch {{was exposed}} to <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> through Gardner Murphy, then a young faculty member at Columbia.

5|$|Asch {{began his}} {{teaching}} career at Brooklyn College. In 1947, {{he moved to}} Swarthmore College, where he stayed for 19 years (1947-1966). Swarthmore was the major center for scholars of <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> {{at that time in}} the United States. Wolfgang Kohler, a German immigrant; W. C. H. Prentice, and Hans Wallach were faculty members at that time as well.|$|E
5|$|Whorf's views {{have been}} {{compared}} to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also {{been compared to}} the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology,</b> and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E

25|$|<b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, which is only peripherally linked to <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology.</b> A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy, developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist Hans-Jürgen Walter and his colleagues in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

25|$|Fuzzy-trace theory, a dual {{process model}} {{of memory and}} reasoning, was also derived from <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology.</b> Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode {{information}} into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be).

40|$|In {{this brief}} note I {{want to address}} the problem of {{translating}} into English the Russian word, obuchenie, as it concerns ongoing discussions of Vygotsky’s ideas about the arrangement of children’s experience by adults for the purposes of education and the relationship between learning and development that such arrangements engender. My current concern with this topic is part of an ongoing international re-examination of the ideas of L. S. Vygotsky in light of relatively recent, extensive translations of a large proportion of his works. These retranslations and this re-examination, particularly Chaiklin (2003), have for some years now enlivened the ongoing discussion held amongst members of the far-flung, international discussion that accompanies publication of Mind, Culture, and Activity, so it seems most appro-priate to publish this note here. 1 My present comments are occasioned by the efforts of Andy Blunden, David Kellogg, and myself to work through the implications of such a reconsideration for Vygotsky’s general theory of development. 2 This discussion, although productive, has not yet led to agreement sufficient to warrant publication of a full-fledged article, but the importance of getting people to rethink the issues of learning and development in light of the translation of the key term, obuchenie, seems too important to await the fate of our more extensive effort to re-evaluate and rearticulate a number of related key concepts and their interrelationships, including the relation of “wholes and parts,” which bespeaks the importance of German <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology’s</b> influences on Vygotsky’s thinking, 1 The discussion is available for inspection a...|$|R

40|$|The {{historical}} {{roots of}} cognitive styles are traced in differential psychology, psychoanalytic ego <b>psychology,</b> <b>gestalt</b> and cognitive-developmental <b>psychology</b> {{to illuminate the}} varied theoretical issues that energize (and fragment) style research. Optimal measurement of cognitive styles as information-processing regularities and as intra-individual contrasts of abilities or other attributes is {{discussed in terms of}} both typical performance and contrasted performance on measures of opposing ends of bipolar style dimensions, with special emphasis on the contrasted measurement of field independence versus field dependence. The role of styles as both performance variables and competence variables in learning and teaching is examined, as are various critiques of style research that appear to be excessively polarized in either supporting or undercutting styles as meaningful constructs. This polarization appears to reflect different stances not just with respect to scientific evidence but with respect to ideology. Concluding remarks broach the issue of how styles are organized, not just within an information-processing framework, but within the structure of personality. (Contains 1 figure and 128 references.)

Nonetheless, the Soviet avant-garde school Vkhutemas started an architectural wing in 1921, which {{was led by}} the architect Nikolai Ladovsky, which was called ASNOVA (association of new architects). The teaching methods were both functional and fantastic, reflecting an interest in <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology,</b> leading to daring experiments with form such as Simbirchev's glass-clad suspended restaurant.

25|$|However, {{considerations}} of how unified conscious representations are formed {{are not the}} full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact {{in order to maximize}} how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain, the physiological processes underlying the formation of percepts and conscious experience have been vastly understudied. Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the superior colliculus (SC) and various cortical structures such as the superior temporal gyrus (GT) and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the ventriloquism effect, rapid localization of stimuli and the McGurk effect; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions.|$|E
50|$|Behaviorists fully {{rejected}} {{even the}} idea of the conscious experience as a worthy topic in psychology, since they believed that the subject matter of scientific psychology should be strictly operationalized in an objective and measurable way. Because the notion of a mind could not be objectively measured, it was not worth further inquiry. Structuralism also believes that the mind could be dissected into its individual parts, which then formed conscious experience. This also received criticism from the <b>Gestalt</b> school of <b>psychology,</b> which argues that the mind cannot be broken down into individual elements.|$|R
50|$|Perception {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fields in psychology. The oldest {{quantitative}} laws in psychology are Weber's law - which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference - and Fechner's law which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart (for example, testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices). The study of perception gave rise to the <b>Gestalt</b> school of <b>psychology,</b> with its emphasis on holistic approach.|$|R
50|$|Stout was {{appointed}} to a new lectureship in Comparative Psychology at the University of Aberdeen in 1896, before becoming reader in mental philosophy at the University of Oxford (1898-1902), where he published his Manual of Psychology in 1899. This work formulated many principles later developed experimentally by the <b>Gestalt</b> school of <b>psychology.</b> Leaving Oxford, from 1903 to 1936, Stout served as professor of logic and metaphysics at St. Andrews, Fife, where he published another major work, Mind and Matter in 1931. He remained at St. Andrews until his retirement thirty years later, in 1936.|$|R
500|$|Whorf {{was also}} {{influenced}} by <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology,</b> believing that languages require their speakers to describe the same events as different gestalt constructions, which he called [...] "isolates from experience". An example is how the action of cleaning a gun is different in English and Shawnee: English focuses on the instrumental relation between two objects {{and the purpose of}} the action (removing dirt); whereas the Shawnee language focuses on the movement—using an arm to create a dry space in a hole. The event described is the same, but the attention in terms of figure and ground are different.|$|E
500|$|Solomon Eliot Asch (September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a Polish gestalt {{psychologist}} and pioneer in social psychology in the United States. He created seminal pieces {{of work in}} impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. [...] His work follows a common theme of <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> that the whole is not only {{greater than the sum}} of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: [...] "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" [...] (Asch, 1952, p.61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{founders of}} Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, {{had worked with}} Kurt Goldstein, a {{neurologist}} who had applied principles of <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> to {{the functioning of the}} organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls. The extent to which <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology.</b> On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term [...] "Gestalt" [...] to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object to it; on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work. Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology.</b>|$|E

2500|$|<b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> or {{gestaltism}} ( [...] "shape, form") is {{a philosophy}} of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> {{is an attempt to}} understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of <b>gestalt</b> <b>psychology</b> is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies. The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking. The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception. In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception, the authors concluded that [...] "even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists, there is little theoretical coherence.

2500|$|Mary Henle {{noted in}} her presidential address to Division 24 {{at the meeting}} of the American Psychological Association (1975): [...] "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology,</b> stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no {{substantive}} relation to scientific <b>Gestalt</b> <b>psychology.</b> To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is not Gestalt psychology" [...] With the [...] however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general.|$|E
40|$|Interdisciplinary work is of {{the essence}} of {{pastoral}} theology, most obviously where theology and the human sciences interact. Such work carries with it a number of risks that are not always addressed or even recognised. The principal risk is that a facile attempt to forge links between disciplines may lead to serious distortions of the meanings of both. This thesis examines gestalt therapy and feminist theology as possible candidates for interdisciplinary work. By reading and interrogating the literature of both disciplines, it identifies their origins and analyses their core ideas. The thesis affirms disputed links between <b>gestalt</b> philosophy, <b>psychology</b> and the later therapy, and examines other contributors to the development of gestalt and its core ideas. It next examines the development and scope of feminist theology before analysing core ideas across the range of voices in feminist writing. From these core ideas it is possible to establish the values that writers and practitioners find important in their lives (practical-values). On this basis, it is shown that these two disciplines, despite differences of history and purpose, are compatible with each other and therefore suitable candidates for interdisciplinary work...|$|R
