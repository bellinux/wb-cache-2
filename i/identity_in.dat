40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} polynomial identities {{satisfied by}} nonhomogeneous subalgebras of Lie and special Jordan superalgebras: we ignore the grading and regard the superalgebra as an ordinary algebra. The Lie {{case has been}} studied by Volichenko and Baranov: they found <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degrees 3, 4 and 5 which imply all the <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degrees ≤ 6. We simplify their <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degree 5, and show {{that there are no}} new <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degree 7. The Jordan case has not previously been studied: we find <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degrees 3, 4, 5 and 6 which imply all the <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degrees ≤ 6, and demonstrate the existence of further new <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> degree 7. Our proofs depend on computer algebra; we use the representation theory of the symmetric group, the Hermite normal form of an integer matrix, the LLL algorithm for lattice basis reduction, and the Chinese remainder theorem. 1...|$|R

5|$|A legal {{claim of}} {{discrimination}} rests upon a group agreeing {{that a particular}} term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage {{who say they are}} not offended.

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} women's <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> seventeenth-century Ireland, whether they identifed themselves as Catholics or Protestants, as political actors, as spinsters, wives and widows, or with one or other racial group. It also argues that if historians of Ireland looked at family and household rather than at religious, political and racial identities, they would be nearer to understanding women's <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> particular and collective <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> general. ...|$|R

5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> the fifteenth century.|$|E

30|$|<b>Identities</b> <b>in</b> loops {{also produce}} <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> Sabinin algebras. In principle, {{there is a}} {{straightforward}} way to find all the <b>identities</b> <b>in</b> a Sabinin algebra that are implied by a given loop identity. Namely, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula expresses the loop product {{in terms of the}} operations in the corresponding Sabinin algebra; imposing an identity on a loop, therefore, imposes an infinite set of identities on its Sabinin algebra. This set can be hugely redundant and choosing a subset consisting of independent <b>identities</b> is difficult <b>in</b> practice. Nevertheless, this is not necessarily an impossible task: Kuzmin [26] used this method to show that a Malcev algebra integrates to a local Moufang loop.|$|R
5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender <b>identity.</b> <b>In</b> a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.|$|E
5|$|Crime {{rates are}} below average—there were 5.4 burglaries per 1000 {{households}} in 2009 and 2010; which {{is lower than}} South West England (7.6 per 1000) and significantly lower than England and Wales (11.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are very low, at 1.9 percent in July 2011, compared to the United Kingdom average of 7.7 percent. The most common religious <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> Weymouth and Portland is Christianity, at 61.0 percent, which is slightly above the England and Wales average of 59.3 percent. The next-largest sector is those with no religion, at 29.3 percent, also slightly above the average of 25.1 percent.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen escapees were {{captured}} on the day, including four who were discovered hiding underwater {{in a river}} near the prison using reeds to breathe. Four more escapees {{were captured}} {{over the next two}} days, including Hugh Corey and Patrick McIntyre who were captured following a two-hour siege at an isolated farmhouse. Out of the remaining 19 escapees, 18 ended up in the republican stronghold of South Armagh where two members of the IRA's South Armagh Brigade were in charge of transporting them to safehouses, and given the option of either returning to active service in the IRA's armed campaign or a job and new <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E

5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises {{himself with}} a beard and monocle and assumes a new <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to court Allen.

At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Davies {{completed}} his O-Levels and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the University of Oxford; he abandoned his aspirations {{of becoming a}} comic artist after a careers advisor convinced him that his colour-blindness would make that path unlikely. During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create Welsh-language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, including Pair Dadeni, a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle, and Perthyn, a drama about community belonging and <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> early-1980s West Glamorgan. In 1981, he was accepted by Worcester College, Oxford to study English literature. At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially 19th-century literature such as Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E

5|$|Many petroglyphs or carved {{images of}} dogs were found near {{religious}} centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and {{importance in the}} culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N. Millerstrom noted {{that a majority of}} dog petroglyphs have been found in the valleys of ʻAʻakapa, Haʻatuatua, and Hatiheu on the northern coast of Nuku Hiva, the meʻae Vaikivi on Ua Huka, and the meʻae Iʻipona and Eiaone Valley on Hiva Oa. Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role of dogs as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty and <b>identity</b> <b>in</b> the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Nakiʻi tribe.|$|E

5|$|Religion {{and worship}} are {{cornerstones}} of the South Side communities. The nearby hub of Bronzeville at 47th and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive (known as King Drive and formerly Grand Boulevard) was a cultural {{center of the}} rising ghetto that fostered a cultural <b>identity.</b> <b>In</b> keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and religious institutions, including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted to African American institutions. The DuSable Museum of African American History, founded in 1961, moved to Washington Park in 1973. It is a Washington Park landmark {{and one of the}} largest African American museums in the country.|$|E
