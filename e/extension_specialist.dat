Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 56 - 60). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of selected electronic transfer technology, i. e., digital imagery, utilized by Range <b>Extension</b> <b>Specialists</b> in Texas to assess rangeland conditions. The study was conducted near College Station, Texas during the Spring semester of 1999. Rangeland sites were assessed by three Range Extension Specialists; these sites represented actual quantity of forage tonnage per acre, height, stem diameter of woody species, percent weed and woody species, and weed and woody species identification. One objective was to determine the relationship between ''on-site'' and ''in-office'' recommendations made by Range <b>Extension</b> <b>Specialists</b> using digital images. The findings were: 1. No statistically significant differences existed among the five ''in-office'' Range <b>Extension</b> <b>Specialists</b> when making quantitative rangeland observations for tonnage per acre, while using only 35 mm digitized images. However, there was a high degree of variation in the observations. 2. "In-office'' Range <b>Extension</b> <b>Specialists</b> were extremely variable and tended to underestimate when assessing forage biomass per acre, although their estimates corresponded with an increase in actual forage tonnage per acre. Additional findings were: 1. Only the height of mesquite observation gave evidence to suggest any differences among "in-office'' specialists. 2. Much variation existed in all observations within and among specialists, except for height of mesquite. 3. "In-office" specialists varied extremely in assessing all the range sites, except for mesquite height and stem diameter sites. 4. The species of plants significantly affected accuracy in correctly identifying plants. The second objective was to determine the relationship between the quality of 35 mm camera digitized images and digital camera images. The finding was that no statistically significant difference existed for the type of camera used when making rangeland observations in this study. Overall conclusions were that Range <b>Extension</b> <b>Specialists</b> cannot accurately make rangeland recommendations from digital images using existing technology and no difference existed for the type of camera used when making estimations in this study...|$|R

50|$|Row spacing is {{the second}} factor that determines canopy closure and yield components. Row spacing can either refer to the space between plants in the same row or the {{distance}} between two rows. Row spacing determines the degree of plant to plant competition. Rows planted closer together in a population will decrease the space between plants. Closer row widths increase plant to plant competition for nutrients and water but also increase sunlight use efficiency. According to former Iowa State University Soybean <b>Extension</b> <b>Specialist</b> Palle Pedersen, current recommendations are to plant rows that are less than 30” apart. This increases light interception and decreases weed competition.|$|E

Participants? perception of distance between themselves and <b>extension</b> <b>specialists</b> could affect their satisfaction with the instructors and the program overall.

The measure of distance relating to {{the availability of the}} specialists was not significantly correlated to the customer satisfaction rating of the instructors and of the Beef Cattle Short Course overall.
