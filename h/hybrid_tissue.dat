40|$|Engineering new tissues using cell {{transplantation}} {{may provide a}} valuable tool for reconstructive surgery applications. Chondrocyte transplantation in particular has been successfully used to engineer new tissue masses due to the low metabolic requirements of these cells. However, the engineered cartilaginous tissue is too rigid for many soft tissue applications. We propose that <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> engineered from chondrocytes and smooth muscle cells could reflect mechanical properties intermediate between these two cell types. In this study, rat aortic smooth muscle cells and pig auricular chondrocytes were co-cultured on polyglycolic acid fiber-based matrices to address this hypothesis. Mixed cell suspensions were seeded by agitating the polymer matrices and a cell suspension with an orbital shaker. After seeding, cell-polymer constructs were cultured in stirred bioreactors for 8 weeks. The cell density and extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycan) content of the engineered tissues were determined biochemically. After 8 weeks in culture, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> had a high cell density (5. 8 × 108 cells/cm 3), and elastin (519 μg/g wet tissue sample), collagen (272 μg/g wet tissue sample), and glycosaminoglycan (GAG; 10 μg/g wet tissue sample) content. Mechanical testing indicated the compressive modulus of the hybrid tissues after 8 weeks to be 40. 8 ± 4. 1 kPa and the equilibrium compressive modulus to be 8. 4 ± 0. 8 kPa. Thus, these hybrid tissues exhibited intermediate stiffness; they were less stiff than native cartilage but stiffer than native smooth muscle tissue. This tissue engineering approach {{may be useful to}} engineer tissues for a variety of reconstructive surgery applications...|$|E
40|$|When {{chimeric}} A strain mice {{tolerant of}} (A x C 57 BL/ 1) F 1 hybrid skin grafts are injected with spleen cells from normal A donors the recipients develop weight loss, clinical evidence of runting, {{and death in}} some animals. Similar recipients injected with spleen cells from A strain donors immunized against C 57 BL/ 1 tissue show a more rapid onset of the runting process and increased mortality. Runting in. these experiments therefore results from an immune attack by the injected A strain lymphoid cells against the (A x C 57 BL/ 1) F 1 <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> harbored by the chimeric recipients. Since the hybrid tissues of the chimeric recipients were derived from spleen cell populations we conclude that the immunologic rejection of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue is sufficient to cause the runting syndrome. C 3 H mice tolerant of A strain skin grafts because of the prior injection of viable or disrupted A strain spleen material were given 400 r of x-irradiation and an injection of C 3 H spleen cells. Only the chimeric C 3 H mice harboring viable A strain cells developed weight loss and clinical evidence of disease, showing again that runting occurs only when an attack can be made against viable lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue. Normal A strain mice injected intravenously with 850 million (A x C 57 BL/ 1) F 1 hybrid spleen cells reject hybrid skin grafts and do not develop runting, whereas the rejection of similar <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> present in chimeric A strain mice results in runting. It is concluded that runting will occur only when the immunologic attack is directed against lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue which has become established within host tissues. The possibility that runting may result from hypersensitivity reactions occurring in the lymphoid tissues is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Spatiotemporal {{delivery}} of incorporated biological modifiers from synthesised tissue scaffolds has higher speculation {{to stimulate the}} complex tissue regeneration process via controlling the extracellular matrix. In this research, we consider the matrix material degradation profile, impregnated biological modifier and permeability of the structure to build <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> scaffolds based on tissue engineering requirements. Such hybrid structures are modelled, designed and fabricated to control release kinetics spatiotemporally for guided tissue regeneration. Firstly, a computer-aided biodegradation model is developed to simulate the degradation process of micro-patterned polymeric scaffolds. Secondly, scaffolds are biomimetically designed to control internal porous architecture with varying porosity. An optimised internal architecture scheme is developed to enhance permeability i. e. fluid transport to mediate release kinetics through the internal regions. Thirdly, heterogeneous scaffolds are developed with control composition of biomaterials and biological modifiers to synchronise the release kinetics with tissue regeneration. Proposed methods are implemented and illustrative examples are presented...|$|E

These defects range from simple tooth decay to radical oncologic craniofacial resection. Regeneration of oral and craniofacial tissues presents a formidable challenge that requires synthesis of basic science, clinical science and engineering technology. Identification of appropriate scaffolds, cell sources and spatial and temporal signals (the tissue engineering triad) is necessary to optimize development of a single <b>tissue,</b> <b>hybrid</b> organ or interface. Furthermore, combining {{the understanding of the}} interactions between molecules of the extracellular matrix and attached cells with an understanding of the gene expression needed to induce differentiation and tissue growth will provide the design basis for translating basic science into rationally developed components of this tissue engineering triad. Dental tissue engineers are interested in regeneration of teeth, oral mucosa, salivary glands, bone and periodontium. Many of these oral structures are <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues.</b> For example, engineering the periodontium requires growth of alveolar bone, cementum and the periodontal ligament. Recapitulation of biological development of <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues</b> and interfaces presents a challenge that exceeds that of engineering just a single tissue. Advances made in dental interface engineering will allow these tissues to serve as model systems for engineering other tissues or organs of the body. This review will begin by covering basic tissue engineering principles and strategic design of functional biomaterials.

40|$|Intra- and {{interspecific}} {{differences in}} cytokinin requirement were detected in callus cultures of Phaseolus vulgaris L. and P. lunatus L. Of the ten genotypes of P. vulgaris {{tested in the}} present study, one required cytokinin for callus growth, six exhibited some to moderate growth on cytokinin-free medium, and the remaining three grew uniformly {{in the absence of}} cytokinin. In contrast, six of the P. lunatus genotypes were strictly cytokinin-dependent, while four genotypes displayed irregular amount of callus growth on cytokinin-free medium. The genotype-specific behavior of Phaseolus callus tissues was independent of the tissue of origin and the time in culture. The inheritance of the cytokinin requirement of Phaseolus tissue cultures was studied in <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues</b> resulting from crosses between a strictly cytokinin-dependent genotype (P. I. 200960) and two independent genotypes (cv. G 50 and P. I. 286303) of P. vulgaris. Fresh weights of <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues</b> on cytokinin-free medium were intermediate between and significantly different from the parental tissues. No differences were found between reciprocal hybrids. These results suggest that cytokinin autonomy in tissue cultures of P. vulgaris is a genetic trait under nuclear control. Both parental and intermediate phenotypes were recovered in the F 2 progeny. The frequency distribution of cytokinin-dependent progeny in F 2 and backcross populations indicates that the cytokinin requirement of P. vulgaris callus tissue may be regulated by one set of alleles...|$|R

The intimate interaction between fungal hyphae and plant roots results in a new symbiotic "organ" called the ECM root tip. Little is understood concerning the metabolic reprogramming that favors the formation of this <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> in compatible interactions and what prevents the formation of ECM root tips in incompatible interactions. We show here that the metabolic changes during favorable colonization between the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor and its compatible host, Populus trichocarpa, are characterized by shifts in aromatic acid, organic acid, and fatty acid metabolism. We demonstrate that this extensive metabolic reprogramming is repressed in incompatible interactions and that more defensive compounds are produced or retained. We also demonstrate that L. bicolor can metabolize a number of secreted defensive compounds and that the degradation {{of some of these}} compounds produces immune response metabolites (e. g., salicylic acid from salicin). Therefore, our results suggest that the metabolic responsiveness of plant roots to L. bicolor is a determinant factor in fungus host interactions...|$|E

The material properties of human cadaveric auricular cartilage and fabricated implants have been tested using three points flexure method. The biocompatibility and maintainability of fabricated auricular implant size and geometry have been texted in nude rats. The patient specific porous polyurethane auricular implants have been fabricated using fused deposition modeling. The optimal material properties comparable with native cadaveric human auricular cartilage have been achieved using rational design approach based on finite element analysis. The original shape and geometry of implant have been maintained up to 3 months after implantation with optimal level of biocompatibility. The patient-specific biocompatible porous polyurethane auricular implant with optimal material properties sustainable after implantation could be fabricated using fused deposition modeling.

40|$|Mandibular {{condylar}} cartilage is {{the center}} of greatest growth in the craniofacial complex, and is associated with maxillofacial skeleton morphogenesis and temporomandibular joint function. The condylar process grows {{in a wide range of}} directions from anterosuperior to posterior, resulting in highly diverse mandibular growth and morphology. Condylar growth direction is closely related to mandibular displacement direction and vertical jaw deviations (i. e., high or low angle). Condylar cartilage, which is ontogenetically designated secondary cartilage, differs from other primary cartilage (e. g., articular cartilage and growth plate of a long bone cranial base cartilage, nasal septal cartilage) in the following ways. (1) Condylar cartilage is a heterogeneous tissue containing fibroblasts, osteochondral progenitor cells, and chondrocytes. (2) Type I collagen, which is derived from progenitor cells, and cartilage-characteristic type II collagen are colocalized in the cartilaginous cell layer. Colocalization of both collagen types may be an adaptation to the complex biomechanical environments of condylar cartilage. (3) Peripheral condylar cartilage contains chondroid bone, a specialized calcified tissue with morphological properties intermediate between those of bone and cartilage. This <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> may play an important role in regulating different rates of bone formation in intramembranous and endochondral ossification, allowing for highly diverse growth directions and condylar and maxillofacial morphology...|$|E

40|$|Cardiac and uterine muscle {{cells and}} tissue {{can be either}} autorhythmic or excitable. These {{behaviours}} exchange stability at bifurcations produced by changes in parameters, which if spatially localized can produce an ectopic pacemaking focus. The effects of these parameters on cell dynamics have been identified and quantified using continuation algorithms and by numerical solutions of virtual cells. The ability of a compact pacemaker to drive the surrounding excitable tissues depends on both {{the size of the}} pacemaker and the strength of electrotonic coupling between cells within, between, and outside the pacemaking region. We investigate an ectopic pacemaker surrounded by normal excitable tissue. Cell–cell coupling is simulated by the diffusion coefficient for voltage. For uniformly coupled tissues, the behaviour of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> can take one of the three forms: (i) the surrounding tissue electrotonically suppresses the pacemaker; (ii) depressed rate oscillatory activity in the pacemaker but no propagation; and (iii) pacemaker driving propagations into the excitable region. However, real tissues are heterogeneous with spatial changes in cell–cell coupling. In the gravid uterus during early pregnancy, cells are weakly coupled, with the cell–cell coupling increasing during late pregnancy, allowing synchronous contractions during labour. These effects are investigated for a caricature uterine tissue by allowing both excitability and diffusion coefficient to vary stochastically with space, and for cardiac tissues by spatial gradients in the diffusion coefficient. ...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{engineered}} tissue scaffolds {{with superior}} control over cell-protein interactions {{is still very}} much infancy. Advancing through heterogeneous multifold scaffolds with controlled release fashion enables synchronization of regenerating tissue with the release kinetics of loaded biomolecules. This might be an engineering challenge and promising approach for improved and efficient tissue regeneration. The most critical limitations: the selection of proper protein(s) incorporation, and precise control over concentration gradient and timing should be overcome. Hence, tissue scaffolds need to be fabricated in a way that proteins or growth factors should be incorporated and released in a specific spatial and temporal orientation to mimic the natural tissue regeneration process. Spatial and temporal control over heterogeneous porous tissue scaffolds can be achieved by controlling two important parameters: (i) internal architecture with enhanced fluid transport, and (ii) distribution of scaffold base material and loaded modifiers. In this research, heterogeneous tissue scaffolds are designed considering both the parameters. Firstly, the three-dimensional porous structures of the scaffold are geometrically partition into functionally uniform porosity regions and controlled spatial micro-architecture has been achieved using a functionally gradient porosity function. The bio-fabrication of the designed internal porous architecture has been performed using a single nozzle bioadditive manufacturing system. The internal architecture scheme is developed to enhance fluid transport with continuous base material deposition Next, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> scaffolds are modeled with varying material characteristics to mediate the release of base material and enclosed biological modifiers are proposed based on tissue engineering requirements.

However, {{it is also}} essential to develop procedures allowing efficient cell seeding independent of scaffold geometry and pore size. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a method for seeding the scaffolds using photopolymerizable cell-laden hydrogels. The latter facilitates convenient preparation, and handling of cell suspension, while distributing the hydrogel precursor throughout the pores, before it is cross-linked with light. In addition, encapsulation of living cells within hydrogels can produce constructs with high initial cell loading and intimate cell-matrix contact, similar to that of the natural extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Three dimensional scaffolds were produced from poly(lactic) acid (PLA) by means of fused deposition modeling. A solution of methacrylamide-modified gelatin (Gel-MOD) in cell culture medium containing photoinitiator Li-TPO-L was used as a hydrogel precursor. Being an enzymatically degradable derivative of natural collagen, gelatin-based matrices are biomimetic and potentially support the process of cell-induced remodeling. Preosteoblast cells MC 3 T 3 -E 1 at a density of 10 ? 106 cells per 1 mL were used for testing the seeding procedure and cell proliferation studies. Obtained results indicate that produced constructs support cell survival and proliferation over extended duration of our experiment. The established two-step approach for scaffold seeding with the cells is simple, rapid, and is shown to be highly reproducible. Furthermore, it enables precise control of the initial cell density, while yielding their uniform distribution throughout the scaffold.

We have applied two microwell-based immunoassays which are capable of quantitating hybrid receptors in small samples of human tissues and cells.

The comparison was made among Bio-Oss® (BO), Engipore® (EP), and PepGen P- 15 ® (P- 15). Five biopsies for each group of biomaterial, retrieved 6 months after sinus lift augmentation, were analyzed. The investigation was carried out using light microscope (LM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and circularly polarized light microscope (CPLM). Under LM, the amount of newly formed bone was significantly higher in BO than P- 15 (P <. 05), while the amount of residual graft material was significantly higher in P- 15 than BO (P <. 05). The extension of marrow spaces was significantly higher in EP than both BO and P- 15 (P <. 05). SEM-EDS analysis showed a Ca/P ratio of 1. 8 for BO, 2. 2 for EP, and 1. 5 for P- 15.

More than 100 androgenic monoploids derived from diploid (2 n= 2 x= 24) Solanum phureja Juz. & Buk. and S. chacoense Bitt. x S. phureja clones were evaluated in field trials during 1996 and 1997 to identify the most promising genotypes for protoplast fusion experiments. Compared to the total population, the 1996 selected genotypes had higher means for tuber number (30. 1 vs 11. 2 tubers/plant), average tuber weight (3. 0 vs 1. 8 g/tuber) and total yield (66. 1 vs 20. 4 g/plant). Similarly, the 1997 selected genotypes had higher means for tuber number (42. 8 vs 25. 4 tubers/plant), average tuber weight (3. 6 vs 2. 5 g/tuber) and total yield (114. 0 vs 63. 4 g/plant) compared to the total population.

Extracting features from cellular behaviors can facilitate decision making in medical diagnoses and represents an important aspect {{in the development of}} biomedical engineering. Previous studies have just focused on either the individual cell or cell clusters separately, which leads to a great lack of information. Microwell technologies could address the challenges of in vitro cellular studies, from individual cell studies to 3 D functional assays, by providing more information from smaller sample volumes and enabling the incorporation of low-cost high-throughput assays in the drug discovery process. To this end, the present study describes an easy-to-use method for fabricating a versatile microwell chip that utilizes a digital micro-mirror device printing system, and the chip can be employed in multidimensional cellular analysis, ranging from the single cell to the 3 D spheroid level. The microwell manufacturing process, using a digital mask in place of a conventional physical mask, is based on shadowed light and is full of flexibility. Three different dimensions (single cell (1 D), cell monolayer (2 D) and cell spheroid (3 D)) of one cell type can be formed using a microwell array and the analyses of biological characteristics are achieved separately. Single cells and cell clusters can be controlled via customized geometries of microfabricated selectively adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) wells.

40|$|Here we {{describe}} a novel method in which embryonic kidneys are dissociated into single-cell suspensions and then reaggregated to form organotypic renal structures. Kidney cell reaggregates were transiently cultured with small-molecule Rho kinase inhibitors, which caused ureteric bud structures {{to form and}} induced formation of nephrons. These structures displayed normal morphology, expressed appropriate differentiation markers, and were connected at their distal ends to the ureteric buds, thus forming artificial tissues {{very similar to those}} found in normal embryonic kidneys. Using this culture method, it was straightforward to make fine-grained chimeras by mixing different cell types or by mixing cells transfected with different constructs before reaggregation. Chimeric renal cultures were formed using mixtures of unmarked normal host embryonic kidney cells and CellTracker-marked WT 1 siRNA-carrying cells to test the hypothesis that WT 1 is important to a cell's ability to contribute to nephron formation. We found a significant reduction in the ability of WT 1 knockdown cells to contribute to nephron formation. This dissociation and reaggregation procedure can also be applied to embryonic lungs and to form coarse-grained <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues</b> from mixtures of lung and kidney cells.

40|$|Current somatic {{embryogenesis}} (SE) protocols for many pine species remain suboptimal {{for the purpose}} of reforestation. Some of the bottlenecks include losses of lines through the SE process due to lack of continued proliferation, poor embryo maturation or poor conversion of somatic embryos to ex vitro conditions. There is often significant variation among genotypes with respect to productivity and SE protocol improvements do not always benefit all genotypes. There is often the desire to propagate specific cell lines, for example from top-ranked families. Selected lines may show desirable characteristics such as disease resistance or a high ability to be genetically engineered. There is also a need to propagate cell lines from species that are in general recalcitrant to {{somatic embryogenesis}} (e. g. Pinus densiflora). Cell lines from hybrid crosses, where there can be incompatibility issues between parent species, also present several challenges. In particular there are no protocols available for these new hybrid crosses which are often less responsive to all steps in the SE process. An example of this recalcitrance could be a cell line which is highly transformable but only produces a limited number of good quality mature somatic embryos. This makes direct planting of somatic embryos to ex vitro conditions an unviable option. If the desired cell line will not respond positively to modification of the standard SE protocols or media for the species then the options for bulking up this material are limited. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissue</b> culture system combining germinated somatic embryos with organogenesis allows the flexibility to work with these desirable cell lines and allows the best aspects of the component propagation methods to be exploited. In conclusion, we have a propagation protocol that takes advantage of the benefits of SE, which include cryopreservation to ensure juvenility while field testing takes place and the potential for genetic engineering. These features combined with organogenesis, which provides the advantages of increased early multiplication, uniformity of shoots and high rooting and conversion to planting stock/stoolbeds is a winning strategy for some conifer species.

This integration of strong but brittle inorganic with tough but compliant organic also enables these <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues</b> to have remarkable mechanical properties considering the starting materials. Unfortunately, this complexity also makes {{is difficult to}} isolate the individual effects of structure and composition on the mechanical response of the system. Here, we develop methods using synthetic mineralization {{to examine the effects}} of crystallographic orientation and additive content, on the hardness of single crystal calcite to gain insight into biomineralization. Using quasistatic depth sensing nanoindentation, we compare the hardness of synthetic calcite crystals incorporating magnesium, amino acid, or agarose additives to biogenic calcite from the prismatic layer of the mollusk Atrina rigida and geologic calcite in the form of Iceland spar. The hardness of single crystal calcite on the (001) face, varies with azimuthal angle; about 7 % for Iceland spar and 20 % for biogenic calcite. Additionally, this range in hardness increases with higher additive content. Hardness also increases by 30, 70 and 20 % by adding magnesium, amino acids, and agarose polysaccharides, respectively, equaling the ~ 70 % difference between biogenic and geologic calcite. Hardness can be reduced by thermal decomposition of the polysaccharide reinforcement, though the final hardness is still greater than pure geologic calcite. The variations in hardness with azimuthal angle and additive content are consistent with a hardening mechanism based on hindered dislocation motion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} <b>hybrid</b> soft <b>tissue</b> model that {{consists}} of a multilayer structure and many spheres for sur-gical simulation system based on meshless. To improve accuracy of the model, tension {{is added to the}} three-parameter viscoelastic structure that connects the two spheres. By using haptic device, the three-parameter viscoelastic model (TPM) produces accurate deformationand also has better stress-strain, stress relaxation and creep properties. Stress relaxation and creep formulas have been obtained by mathematical formula derivation. Comparing with the experimental results of the real pig liver which were reported by Evren et al. and Amy et al., the curve lines of stress-strain, stress relaxation and creep of TPM are close to the experimental data of the real liver. Simulated results show that TPM has better real-time, stability and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Isolates {{of citrus}} exocortis viroid (CEV) {{from a single}} sweet orange citrus source have been {{selected}} by sequential passage through the alternative hosts citron, Gynura aurantiaca, a hybrid tomato Lycopersicon esculentum × L. peruvianum, and from disorganized callus culture of the hybrid tomato. The distinctions in symptom expression, titre and electrophoretic mobility among the CEV isolates, operationally termed CEVc (citron), CEVg (Gynura), CEVt (tomato) and CEVcls (callus) are supported by characteristically different nucleotide sequences. The nucleotide sequence of fulllength cDNA clones of CEVc purified from citron shows exchanges not reported for any previously described CEV variant. An unusual number of exchanges have been localized in the terminal domains of all the isolates analysed here. A common pattern of nucleotide exchanges, described as a 'tomato signature', can be detected {{in all of the}} isolates derived from <b>hybrid</b> tomato <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
40|$|Insulin receptors (IR) and IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR) {{have been}} shown to form <b>hybrid</b> receptors in <b>tissues</b> coexpressing both molecules. To date there is no {{information}} about the distribution of <b>hybrids</b> in <b>tissues</b> of normal or diabetic subjects. We developed a microwell-based immunoassay to quantitate hybrids in small human tissues samples. Microwells were coated with MA- 20 anti-IR antibody or alpha-IGF-IR-PA antibody directed against the IGF-IR alpha-subunit, and incubated with skeletal muscle extracts of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and normal controls. Immobilized receptors were incubated with 125 I-insulin or 125 I-IGF-I in {{the presence or absence of}} the two unlabeled ligands. Hybrids were quantified as the fraction of 125 I-IGF-I binding immunoadsorbed with MA- 20 and expressed as percentage of total IGF-IR (type I+hybrids) immobilized with alpha-IGF-IR-PA. The immunoassay was validated using Western blotting analysis. Relative abundance of hybrids detected in NIDDM patients was higher than in controls. The percentage of hybrids was negatively correlated with IR number and in vivo insulin sensitivity measured by an insulin tolerance test, whereas the percentage was positively correlated with insulinemia. Insulin binding affinity was lower in NIDDM patients than in controls, and was correlated with the percentage of hybrids. Maximal IGF-I binding was significantly higher in muscle from NIDDM patients compared to controls and was positively correlated with the percentage of hybrid receptors whereas IGF-I binding affinity did not differ between the two groups. These results raise the possibility that alterations in expression of hybrid receptors may contribute to decreased insulin sensitivity, and to increased sensitivity to IGF-I. Because IGF-I has been proposed as a hypoglycemic agent in NIDDM, these results are relevant to the development of new approaches to the treatment of insulin resistance of NIDDM...|$|R

Our aim was to engineer a <b>hybrid</b> inorganic/soft <b>tissue</b> construct by inducing pancreatic islets to grow an inorganic shell. We created pancreatic islets surrounded by porous silica, which has potential application in the immunoprotection of islets in transplantation therapies for type 1 diabetes. The new method {{takes advantage of the}} islet capsule surface as a template for silica formation. Mouse and human islets were exposed to medium containing saturating silicic acid levels for 9 - 15 min. The resulting tissue constructs were then cultured for up to 4 wk under normal conditions. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to monitor the morphology and elemental composition of the material at the islet surface. A cytokine assay was used to assess biocompatibility with macrophages. Islet survival and function were assessed by confocal microscopy, glucose-stimulated insulin release assays, oxygen flux at the islet surface, expression of key genes by RT-PCR, and syngeneic transplant into diabetic mice...|$|R
40|$|The {{interspecific}} hybrid between almond and peach, ‘Garfield x Nemared’ (Prunus dulcis (Mill) D. A. Webb x Prunus persica (L.) Batsch.) {{has become very}} important as rootstocks for peach in Bolivia, but propagation by traditional methods of this hybrid has been very difficult. In the present study {{the aim was to}} in vitro establishment of this hybrid. As initial explants, nodal segments from mother plants, growing under controlled culture conditions, were used. For disinfection two concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (0. 5 and 0. 75 %) and time (10 and 12 min) were tested. The greatest percentage of establishment was achieved using 0. 75 % NaClO for 12 min in an MS culture medium free of growth regulators. A 100 % control of the phenols oxidation was achieved with the combination of mother plants growing under 50 % shade, young buds, use of 150 mg l- 1 citric acid {{at the end of the}} disinfection process and into the culture medium and then place the test tubes with the nodal segments one week in the dark.   Keywords: interspecific <b>hybrid,</b> Prunus, <b>tissue</b> cultur...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogels are {{three-dimensional}} polymeric networks {{very similar}} to biological tissues. Many synthetic polymers {{can be used in}} preparing hydrogels. Among them poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), physically crosslinked by repeated freeze-thawing cycles of polymer aqueous solutions, is widely employed to make hydrogels for biomedical applications. To increase the similarity between hydrogels and natural tissues and to obtain 'polymeric hybrid tissues', we attempted to incorporate 3 T 3 cells, from a mouse fibroblast cell line, into PVA hydrogels obtained by one freeze-thawing cycle using as a solvent complete culture medium. Hydrogels were also made using eight freeze-thawing cycles from PVA solutions prepared using as a solvent either complete culture medium or water. Cell adhesion experiments were performed by seeding 3 T 3 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on to the hydrogel surface. The effect of the solvent and of the different number of freeze-thawing cycles on the mechanical characteristics of the PVA hydrogels were investigated by dynamic-mechanical techniques. A scanning force microscope analysis of the hydrogel surface viscoelastic properties was also carried out. Our results show that PVA is not cytotoxic. Although PVA hydrogel surface characteristics do not seem to favour the adhesion of substrate-dependent cells, encouraging results were obtained with the 3 T 3 cells incorporation. DMA analysis indicates that the networks prepared by eight freeze-thawing cycles possess a mechanical consistency comparable, even slightly better, than the ones prepared by only one freeze-thawing cycle and used for the cell incorporation studies. Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks {{very similar to}} biological tissues. To approximate the nature of biological tissues in the best way possible - in the process obtaining polymeric <b>hybrid</b> <b>tissues</b> - 3 T 3 cells from a mouse fibroblast cell line were incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels obtained by one freeze-thawing cycle using a solvent complete culture medium.

40|$|A pH {{microelectrode}} {{has been}} used to investigate the auxin effect on free space pH and its correlation with auxin-stimulated elongation in segments of pea (Pisum sativum) stem and maize (Zea mays var. Bear <b>Hybrid)</b> coleoptile <b>tissue.</b> Auxin induces a decrease in free space pH in both tissues. In maize coleoptiles, free space pH begins to fall within about 12 minutes of exposure to auxin and decreases by about 1 pH unit by approximately 30 minutes. In pea, pH begins to decrease within an average of 15 to 18 minutes of exposure to auxin and falls by about 0. 9 pH unit by approximately 40 minutes. Auxin-stimulated elongation, measured in the same two tissues similarly prepared, appears in maize at the earliest 18 minutes after auxin application, while in pea it appears at the earliest 21 to 24 minutes after auxin application. The auxin analogs p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid and phenylacetic acid do not stimulate elongation above control levels in maize or pea tissue segments and do not cause a decrease in free space pH in either tissue. These findings are consistent with the acid secretion theory of auxin action...|$|R
