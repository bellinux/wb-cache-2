Starkad promised Hather all his gold and <b>imperviousness,</b> should Hather cut off his head and run between the head and the body as he fell. Hather cut off Starkad's head but avoided running, as he feared being crushed by Starkad's huge body.

500|$|As {{in other}} Mario sports titles such as Mario Power Tennis, the player can use itemsbananas, red shells, etc.to impede the opponent. Some [...] "power ups" [...] can aid the user by {{granting}} temporary <b>imperviousness</b> while others immobilize and hinder the opponent. The central antagonist of the Mario universe, Bowser, will also appear occasionally as a non-player character to obstruct the players from each side. Strikers include six stadia, each having barriers {{to prevent the}} ball going out of play. These stadia only vary aesthetically and do not affect gameplay, featuring different surfaces such as grass and wood. The player can adjust the match settings to limit or expand the match time and select whether features such as the Super Strike will be included. As the player advances through the game, further adjustments can be made called [...] "cheats", that can render goalkeepers weaker and grant {{an infinite number of}} items.|$|E

His use of 3-D is itself the film's big idea." [...] MacCabe wrote that Godard [...] "uses [...] to distance as well as engage" [...] the audience instead of simply enhancing realism, which is influenced by Bertolt Brecht. Armond White wrote that Godard [...] "uses the digital 3D fad to consider how men and women communicate... and then, playfully, observes their dog's loyalty... to demonstrate pure faith, pure curiosity, and his own <b>imperviousness</b> {{in an era when}} Reality and Digital Reality are confused." [...] White believes that the film's use of 3D mocks the technique's supposed visual depth and instead uses it to examine the depth of human experience, such as [...] "the dynamics of sexual, political, and artistic relations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harry M. Benshoff {{writes that}} Bergler's claim that {{homosexuality}} {{had become more}} widespread through the [...] "creation of new recruits {{as a result of}} the dissemination of misleading statistics" [...] is an expression of the paranoia about homosexuality that was typical of the time Bergler was writing, adding that Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?, as well as Bergler's other writings, [...] "seem fueled by a neurotic hysteria found more regularly among Fundamentalist preachers and right-wing politicians." [...] Kenneth Lewes, author of a survey of psychoanalytic views on homosexuality, writes that he was surprised and shocked by Bergler's comments about homosexuals in Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?, which he describes as one of a number of works in which Bergler [...] "provided a whole bestiary of homosexual monstrosities". Lewes characterized Bergler's views as extreme, but nevertheless identified him as [...] "the most important analytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s" [...] and wrote that his statements about homosexuals represent the general psychoanalytic consensus at the time his book was written, which he summarizes as maintaining that homosexuals were incapable of [...] "achieving any peace of mind, any satisfying relations with other people, or any genuine artistic accomplishment." [...] Lewes writes that of all psychoanalysts it was Bergler who waged [...] "the most vigorous campaign against connecting homosexuality with creativity", with Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? being a continuation of Bergler's previous efforts. Lewes criticized Bergler for his [...] "insularity and <b>imperviousness</b> to criticism", giving as an example Bergler's insistence on the representativeness of his clinical experience.|$|E

I had already drawn attention by my aloofness and <b>imperviousness</b> to the attacks of the ki-sang, so that many were looking on at the eunuch's baiting of me. I gave no sign, made no move, until I had located him and distanced him. Then, like a shot, without turning head or body, merely by my arm I fetched him an open, back-handed slap. My knuckles landed flat on his cheek and jaw. There was a crack like a spar parting in a gale. He was bowled clean over, landing in a heap on the floor a dozen feet away.|$|E

60|$|A {{few steps}} {{brought him into}} the little main street. The chilly, stilted aspect of it shocked him. Everything seemed frosty and pinched, just as the cutting air did after the warm balminess of California. Only several persons, strangers to his recollection, were abroad, and they favoured him with incurious glances. They were wrapped in an uncongenial and frosty <b>imperviousness.</b> His first {{impression}} was surprise at his surprise. Through the wide perspective of twelve years of Western life, he had consistently and steadily discounted the size and importance of East Falls; but this was worse than all discounting. Things were more meagre than he had dreamed. The general store took his breath away. Countless myriads of times he had contrasted it with his own spacious emporium, but now he saw that in justice he had overdone it. He felt certain {{that it could not}} accommodate two of his delicatessen counters, and he knew that he could lose all of it in one of his storerooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Beaton, gloomily; and he {{went away}} profoundly {{discouraged}} by this last analysis of Christine's character. The angelic <b>imperviousness</b> of Miss Vance to properties of which his own wickedness was so keenly aware in Christine might have made him laugh, {{if it had not}} been such a serious affair with him. As it was, he smiled to think how very differently Alma Leighton would have judged her from Miss Vance's premises. He liked that clear vision of Alma's even when it pierced his own disguises. Yes, that was the light he had let die out, and it might have shone upon his path through life. Beaton never felt so poignantly the disadvantage of having on any given occasion been wanting to his own interests through his self-love as in this. He had no one to blame but himself for what had happened, but he blamed Alma for what might happen in the future because she shut out the way of retrieval and return. When be thought of the attitude she had taken toward him, it seemed incredible, and he was always longing to give her a final chance to reverse her final judgment. It appeared to him that the time had come for this now, if ever.|$|E

The building was an early adopter of green building principles, but apart from automobiles and bicycles, remains inaccessible by other modes of transportation.|$|E
