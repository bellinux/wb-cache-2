5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important in}} different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A {{small number of}} species such as herring, cod, pollock, anchovy, tuna and mackerel provide people with {{millions of tons of}} food per year, while many other species are fished in smaller amounts. They provide {{a large proportion of the}} <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> for sport. Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} features {{thin and}} acidic soil, and hosts plants like witherod, Indian pear, Labrador tea, wintergreen, and blueberry shrubs. It is a woodland area, with birch, tamarack, maple, oak, beech, and white pine trees. Given {{the development of}} the land by the Armdale Yacht Club, plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits; most of the peninsula was paved in 1971. <b>Fish</b> <b>caught</b> from Melville Island include cod and mackerel. Local birds include grebes, loons, and alcids.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Maurice oversaw early preparations, {{although}} it was primarily under his successor, Richard de Beaumis, that construction work fully commenced. Beaumis was assisted by King Henry I, who gave the bishop stone and commanded that all material brought up the River Fleet for the cathedral should be free from toll. To fund the cathedral, Henry gave Beaumis rights to all <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> within the cathedral neighbourhood and tithes on venison taken in the County of Essex. Beaumis also gave a site for the original foundation of St Paul's School.|$|E

40|$|Our study {{reports on}} the total mercury (HgT) {{concentrations}} measured in the muscles and livers of several benthic, demersal and pelagic <b>fish</b> species <b>caught</b> {{inside and outside of}} Augusta Bay (southern Italy), a semi-enclosed marine area, highly contaminated by the uncontrolled (since the 1950 s to 1978 s) discharge of the largest European petrochemical plant. Mercury levels in fish tissues are discussed with regard to specific habitat, size and/or age of the specimens and HgT distribution in the bottom sediments. Results suggest a still active Hg release mechanism from the polluted sediments to the marine environment. Also, the high HgT concentrations measured in <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> in the external area of the bay imply a potential role of Augusta Bay as a pollutant source for the Mediterranean ecosystem. Finally, values of hazard target quotient (THQ) and estimated weekly intake (EWI) demonstrate that consumption of <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> inside the bay represents a serious risk for human health. Also, data indicate that intake of <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> from the external area of the bay, especially for that concern demersal and benthic species, could be represent a significant component of risk for the local population...|$|R
50|$|Some of the <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> in its {{waters are}} Oncorhynchus mykiss, an {{introduced}} species, Barbus anoplus and Anguilla mossambica; others, such as Micropterus salmoides and Cyprinus carpio, are invasive species.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>caught</b> off {{the coast}} of Newfoundland and Labrador are {{required}} to have a minimal level of processing done in provincial fish plants. The objective is to ensure that the province’s fishery generates the maximum economic and employment benefits for the province.These requirements are known as minimum processing requirements, or MPRs. These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost of processing, labour availability and because some markets are interested in less processed fish. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Japan ranked {{fourth in}} the world in tonnage of <b>fish</b> <b>caught.</b> Japan {{captured}} 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000, 9,558,615 tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970, 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.|$|E
5|$|Mercury was {{ingested}} {{through the}} consumption of homemade bread, meat and other animal products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread {{is thought to have}} been the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.|$|E
50|$|Classes {{of organisms}} found in marine {{ecosystems}} include brown algae, dinoflagellates, corals, cephalopods, echinoderms, and sharks. <b>Fishes</b> <b>caught</b> in marine ecosystems {{are the biggest}} source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.|$|R
40|$|Rod and line, hand-line, {{trolling}} line and fish-traps are {{the different types}} of fishing gears wherein suitable fish baits are employed with a view to luring the catch. The coastal fishermen of India mostly use different types of natural fish-baits to catch fishes like Perches, Carangids, Sciaenids, Scombroids and Elasmobranchs. The reactions of the <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> to the different baits used are quite varied. Successful line fishing operations very much depend on the fish-baits.

5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely <b>fish,</b> <b>caught</b> by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
50|$|Some of the <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> in its {{waters are}} Labeobarbus aeneus, Barbus pallidus, Barbus anoplus, Myxus capensis, Anguilla marmorata and Anguilla mossambica. Labeobarbus aeneus is an {{invasive}} species, now widely {{present in the}} river system.|$|R
50|$|This species reaches 40 cm SL and {{originates}} {{from the}} Amazon and Orinoco River basins. This species {{is reported to}} commonly attack the <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> in fishermen's nets and seines {{as well as those}} hooked on trotlines or gaffed.|$|R
30|$|Oxidative enzymes were assayed in the gill {{and liver}} {{of the fish}} samples. The <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> from both {{stations}} were immediately dissected, and the livers and gills were collected into labelled sampling bottles and preserved at 4  °C prior analysis.|$|R
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationships between visual counts of fishes and the catch from gill-nets on rocky reefs in southern New Zealand. Visual censuses were done and then gill-nets of three mesh sizes (2. 5 ”, 3. 5 ” and 4. 5 ”) were set in the surveyed areas. There were significant differences among habitats in the assemblages of reef fishes. The number and species of <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> by the gill-nets had little overlap with those recorded in visual surveys. The standard lengths of <b>fishes</b> <b>caught</b> in gill-nets were significantly larger than those recorded in the visual surveys, primarily because of differences in the species composition of fishes sampled by the two methods. Resident reef fishes, especially labrids, comprised most of the visual surveys, while transient pelagic species and wide-ranging reef fishes made up the largest proportion of the gill-net catch. The three mesh sizes caught different size fractions of fish populations, but all mesh sizes <b>caught</b> <b>fishes</b> larger than those seen in the visual surveys. There was a significant species x mesh size interaction {{in the number of}} <b>fishes</b> <b>caught,</b> indicating that some species were more vulner-able to particular mesh sizes. Both the number of fishes and number of species caught declined sequentially with increasing mesh size. This study shows that visual surveys and the more pas-sive gill-netting sample different fractions of fish populations, and that gill-netting is ineffective at targeting individual species in complex reef habitats...|$|R
