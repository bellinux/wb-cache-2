These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting <b>ignition</b> <b>pulses.</b> Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|R

In particular, our study indicates that at a specific hohlraum-to-capsule radius ratio, i. e., the golden ratio, the flux asymmetry on capsule can be significantly reduced. From our study, this golden octahedral hohlraum has robust high symmetry, low plasma filling and low backscattering. Though the golden octahedral hohlraum needs 30 % more laser energy than traditional cylinder for producing the <b>ignition</b> radiation <b>pulse</b> of 300 eV, it is worth for a robust high symmetry and low backscattering.

The high density pellet is surrounded by an underdense corona and is isolated by a vacuum region from the simulation box boundary. The laser pulse is shown to filament and create density channels on the laser-plasma interface. The density channels increase the laser absorption efficiency and help generate an energetic electron distribution with a large angular spread. The combined distribution of the forward-going energetic electrons and the induced return electrons is marginally unstable to the current filament instability.
