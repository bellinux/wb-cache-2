5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>curation</b> {{is a broad}} {{term used}} to {{indicate}} processes and activities related to the organization and integration of data collected from various sources, annotation of the data, and publication and presentation of the data such {{that the value of}} the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. <b>Data</b> <b>curation</b> includes [...] "all the processes needed for principled and controlled data creation, maintenance, and management, together with the capacity to add value to data". In science, <b>data</b> <b>curation</b> may indicate the process of extraction of important information from scientific texts, such as research articles by experts, to be converted into an electronic format, such as an entry of a biological database.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>curation</b> is {{typically}} user initiated and maintains metadata {{rather than the}} database itself. According to the University of Illinois' Graduate School of Library and Information Science, [...] "Data curation is the active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time." [...] The <b>data</b> <b>curation</b> workflow is distinct from data quality management, data protection, lifecycle management and data movement.|$|E
