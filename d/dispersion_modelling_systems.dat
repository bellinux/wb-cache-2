40|$|Short-range impacts to {{sensitive}} ecosystems as {{a result}} of ammonia emitted by livestock farms are often assessed using atmospheric <b>dispersion</b> <b>modelling</b> <b>systems</b> such as AERMOD. These assessments evaluate mean annual atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and nitrogen deposition rates at the ecosystem location for comparison with ecosystem damage thresholds. However, predictions of mean annual atmospheric concentrations can be dominated by periods of stable night-time conditions, which can contribute significantly to mean concentrations. AERMOD has been demonstrated to overestimate concentrations in certain stable low-wind conditions and so the model could potentially overestimate the short-range impacts of livestock ammonia emissions. This paper tests several modifications to the parameterisation of AERMOD (v 12345) that aim to improve model predictions in low-wind conditions. The modifications are first described and then are applied to three pig farm case studies in the USA, Denmark and Spain to assess whether the modifications improve long-term mean ammonia concentration predictions through improved model performance. For these three case studies, most of the modifications tested improved model performance {{as a result}} of reducing the long-term mean concentration predictions, with the largest effect for low- or ground-level sources (e. g. slurry lagoons or naturally ventilated housing) ...|$|E

Although NARAC continues to develop and maintain a state-of-the-art atmospheric <b>dispersion</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>system,</b> <b>model</b> predictions are constrained by the availability of information to properly characterize the source term. During an actual atmospheric release, very little may be known initially about the source material properties, amount, or release time and location. Downwind measurements often provide the best information about the scope {{and nature of the}} release. The timely integration of field measurement data with model calculations is an obvious approach toward improving the model consequence predictions. By optimizing these predictions a more accurate representation of the consequences may be provided to (a) predict contamination levels which may be below the detectable limit of sensors, but which may still pose a significant hazard, (b) determine contamination is areas where measurements have not yet been made, and (c) prioritize the locations of future measurement surveys. By automating and streamlining much of the related field measurement data processing, these optimized predictions may be provided within a significantly reduced period, and with a reduction in potential errors. The associated operational shortfalls were resolved by completing the following major tasks under this technology integration project: (1) The definition and implementation of a standard Extensible Markup Language (XML) measurement data transmission format, (2) Modification to the NARAC system Graphical User Interface (GUI) to streamline field measurement manipulation and processing within the NARAC system, (3) Modification to the NARAC graphical visualization capabilities to display, filter, and select target measurement data for further processing, (4) Improved access to statistically-oriented comparisons between model calculations and field measurement data aimed at developing a refined source term used to optimize model predictions, and (5) Rewriting of a limited legacy code which performs the calculations necessary to compare model results with field measurement data.

A comparison of the model predictions with those of the corresponding scheme of Berkowicz and Brahm, using the same synoptic input data is presented. The comparison shows the basic physical differences between these two models. Some numerical results calculated by these two pre-processors differ substantially, while the results for net radiation are statistically nearly identical. Meteorological profile data from Finnish sounding stations is compiled and the inversions (the temperature of the atmosphere increases with altitude) are classified according to the total depth of the inversion and the stability of the boundary layer, which was estimated directly from the temperature gradient in the layer from the ground up to 100  meters. The persistence of the inversions and the influence of cloudiness and wind speed on the temperature gradient are also addressed. The specific problems of an urban area is tackled, using measurements from a meteorological mast situated in the Helsinki metropolitan area by comparing them to those from the radiosonde profiles at the rural site of Jokioinen. Several common schemes for the height of the stable boundary layer are compared to results from our own method developed at Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).

The major pollutant accumulation at the leeward side was also predicted by the ADMS-Road model, {{on the basis of}} the prevailing wind direction that determines different exposure of the street canyon sides to pollutants emitted by vehicular traffic. A clear vertical (3, 6 and 9 m) distribution gradient of pollutants was not observed, so that both the model and biomonitoring results suggested that local air turbulences in the street canyon could contribute to uniform pollutant distributionat different heights...|$|R

As a result, there is a strong push to develop innovative formulations for the delivery of such compounds so that the desired oral bioavailability and pharmacological effects are achieved. An increasingly popular class of formulations to improve the dissolution properties of poorly soluble drugs is represented by amorphous solid dispersions, whereby the drug is molecularly dispersed in a carrier matrix. One of the key challenges for developing amorphous solid dispersions in real-world formulations is the understanding of the dissolution performance.

This thesis investigates the dissolution performance of three solid <b>dispersions</b> <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> including felodipine, bicalutamide and indomethacin, all poorly soluble drugs, with copovidone, a water-soluble polymer. The complexity of the <b>model</b> <b>systems</b> increases through the chapters, starting by testing the dissolution of a well-documented poorly soluble drug model, i. e. felodipine, as a function of the drug loading (5...|$|R
40|$|The Danish AirGIS {{modelling}} system: {{input data}} and application. Input {{data for the}} AirGIS system were obtained from various sources and were integrated into the model. A GIS-based road network, including construction year and traffic during the period 1960 onwards, was developed, and a database on emission factors for the Danish car fleet, with data on light- and heavy-duty vehicles back to 1960, was built and entered into the emission module of the street pollution model. The national topographic GIS database of buildings was supplemented by the construction year and building height from the national Building and Dwelling Register, which provided the correct street and building geometry for a given year at a given address. The geocode of an address reflects {{the location of the}} front door, usually within 5 m. Air pollution is calculated for 2 m height at the façade of the address building. The <b>dispersion</b> <b>modelling</b> <b>system</b> has been used in several large epidemiological studies in Denmark [1 - 6], and the street pollution model, OSPM, which is a core part of AirGIS, has been used in many other countries [7]. The AirGIS <b>modelling</b> <b>system</b> cannot provide reliable estimates of past particulate matter concentrations because the necessary data on previous urban background concentrations an...|$|R
