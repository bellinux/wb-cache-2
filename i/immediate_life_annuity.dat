40|$|This article compares wealth {{management}} strategies for individuals in retirement, focusing on trade-offs regarding wealth creation and income security. Specifically, it compares the following six strategies: (1) systematic withdrawal from mutual funds, (2) fixed payout <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> (3) immediate variable annuity for life, (4) variable annuity plus guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (VA+GMWB), (5) mix of withdrawals from {{mutual funds and}} fixed payout <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> one-time wealth split at retirement, and (6) mix of mutual fund withdrawals and fixed payout life annuity, gradual annuitization at certain ages. Systematic withdrawals from mutual funds usually give opportunities for greater wealth creation {{at the risk of}} large investment losses and income shortfalls. Fixed and variable life annuities forgo bequest considerations and distribute the highest incomes. A variable annuity with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (VA+GMWB) somewhat addresses both income need and wealth preservation. Mixes of mutual funds and fixed life annuities deliver solutions broadly similar to, and even more flexible than, a VA+GMWB strategy...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the longevity {{effects on the}} portfolio valuations. This is a re levant topic, in particular {{from the perspective of}} insurers/sponsors of pension funds. The models chosen for actuarial calculations have to capture the survival trend and to pr oject its forecasted future impr ovements. The uncertainty in the choice is a huge concern and constitutes a relevant systematic risk driver itself, called unc ertainty risk therein. Aim of the paper is to measure the uncertainty risk and to show its trend in severa l contexts, meaningful in portfolio valuations. To this purpose the authors provide a suitable risk index and apply it in three different valuations: the initial value of an <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> portfolio; the fund of a pension annuity portfolio; the surplus of a portfolio consisting of deferred life annuities.

40|$|When {{comparing}} {{investment in}} an <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> with a payout-equivalent investment fund decumulation plan (self-annuitization), previous research focused on shortfall probabilities of self-annuitization. Chances of self-annuitization (i. e., bequests) typically {{have not been}} addressed. We argue that heirs {{might be willing to}} bear the shortfall risk of the retiree’s self-annuitization since they might benefit from a bequest. Our article proposes a “family strategy ” in which heirs receive the remaining investment fund on the retiree’s death, but are obliged to finance the re-tiree if the fund becomes exhausted. We estimate the chance and risk profile of this “family strategy ” from the heirs ’ perspective using German capital and annuity market data. We show that in many cases, our “family strategy ” offers enormous chance potential with low shortfall risk. Finally, we discuss some limitations of the proposed “family strategy ” when putting the concept into practice...|$|E

The annuity we examine is the single premium <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> an insurance product that pays out a nominal level sum {{as long as the}} covered person lives, in exchange for an initial lump-sum premium. This annuity offers protection against the risk of someone outliving his saving, given uncertainty about longevity. For reasonable estimates of behavioral parameters, we calculate that individual annuities are currently priced so that retirees without bequest motives should find these policies of substantial value in configuring their portfolios to smooth retirement consumption. We also find that the expected present discounted value of payouts, relative to the initial cost of the annuity, has increased over the last decade. These findings bear on the policy debate regarding the role of individual choice and self-reliance in retirement planning. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors analyze a tax {{arbitrage}} opportunity {{that results from}} engaging in two seemingly counterintuitive transactions in the Canadian insurance market. Specifically, if an individual acquires a fixed <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> and then uses the periodic annuity income to fund a term-to-life insurance policy, these two transactions, which the authors refer to as a “mortality swap, ” will generate a payoff pattern that is risk-free. In other words, a mortality swap replicates a risk-free security, albeit one with a stochastic liquidation date. The authors show theoretically {{that the rate of}} return on a mortality swap is equal to the risk-free rate on a before-tax basis, but exceeds it on an after-tax basis. This is confirmed by the results of the empirical test, which uses observed annuity and insurance quotes that already reflected adverse-selection and transaction costs.

40|$|In {{comparing}} an <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> with a payout-equivalent {{investment fund}} payout plan (self-annuitization), research {{to date has}} focused mainly on shortfall probabilities of self-annuitization. An exception {{can be found in}} Schmeiser and Post (2005). They propose a family strategy where the chances of self-annuitization (i. e., bequests) are taken into consideration as well. In such a family strategy, potential heirs must bear shortfall risks, but in return have a chance of receiving a bequest. This paper analyzes under which conditions heirs will be willing to agree to a family strategy. The idea of a family strategy is integrated into a realistically calibrated intertemporal expected utility framework taking into account risks arising from stochastic life span, asset returns, and nontradable labor income. A family strategy is shown to be accepted for many parameter combinations, especially in families with low marginal tax rates, if the heirs are wealthy, or in a case where the retiree has an average population life expectancy. For such families, a family strategy should be seriously considered as retirement arrangement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Asset {{allocation}} {{during the}} retirement years {{has not received}} {{as much attention as}} allocation prior to retirement. Within the context of financial planning {{towards the end of the}} life-cycle, the economics literature is puzzled over the extremely low levels of voluntary annuitization exhibited amongst the elderly. This phenomenon is inconsistent with a strict interpretation of the Modigliani life-cycle hypothesis. Although many plausible explanations have been suggested to reconcile theory and practice, none seem to contain any rigorous normative financial advice on when and if one should purchase an immediate annuity. This is particularly relevant given the increasing number of Defined Contribution pension plans in the U. S., within which the participants have to manage the risk of outliving their resources, and the corresponding trend away from Defined Benefit plans. In contrast to a classical economic approach — and motivated by the financial derivatives literature — this paper focuses attention on the Real Option embedded in the decision to annuitize. Indeed, a fixed <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> can be viewed as a project with a positive net-present value when compared to maintaining liquid wealth in nonannuitize...|$|E

For each model, with the aid of the bootstrap technique we control for the parameter risk. Forecasts are necessary for decision making: the recognition of different sources of uncertainty is the starting point for the calculation of the solvency capital requirements in Solvency II project.

40|$|The {{mortality}} dynamics {{experienced in}} the latest decades, especially at adult and old ages, has motivated the introduction of major innovations in the modeling of mortality for actuarial applications; such innovations concern, in particular, {{the representation of the}} uncertainty relating to aggregate mortality. In this paper, we first provide a description of the traditional mortality model which is deterministic but also allows quite easily for a representation of the uncertainty relating to individual mortality. Then, we discuss a stochastic approach to the modeling of the uncertainty relating to aggregate mortality. Due to the importance of mortality evolution in respect of post-retirement liabilities, we refer to a portfolio of <b>immediate</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> (or pension annuities). We assume that a (projected) life table which provides a best-estimate assessment of annuitants’ future mortality is available. We show that the life table, from which a deterministic description of future mortality can be obtained, can be used as the basic input of appropriate stochastic models. In particular, we consider a Bayesian-inference setting for updating the parameters of the stochastic model according to the experienced mortality...|$|R
40|$|The cost {{of capital}} {{is a key element}} of the {{embedded}} value methodology for the valuation of a life business. Further, under some solvency approaches (in particular, the Swiss Solvency Test and the developing Solvency 2 project) assessing the {{cost of capital}} constitutes a step in determining the required capital allocation. Whilst the cost of capital is usually meant as a reward for the risks encumbering a given life portfolio, in actuarial practice the relevant parameter has been traditionally chosen, at least to some extent, inconsistently with such risks. The adoption of market-consistent valuations has then been advocated to reach a common standard. A market-consistent value usually acknowledges a reward to shareholders' capital as long as the market does, namely if the risk is systematic or undiversifiable. When dealing with a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> portfolio (or a pension plan), an important example of systematic risk is provided by the longevity risk, i. e. Â the risk of systematic deviations from the forecasted mortality trend. Hence, a market-consistent approach should provide appropriate valuation tools.

For the median retiree, the expected present value of the incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments is 1. 50 times the lump sum payout, and demand for lump sums is low. This pattern is consistent with value-maximizing decisions by retirees. However, when we exploit variation {{in the value of}} the incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments arising from how PERS calculates retirement benefits, we find robust evidence that demand for lump sum payouts is higher when the forgone <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments are more valuable.

Collectively, these findings suggest that retirees value incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments at less than their expected present value, either because they do not know how to accurately value <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> or because they have strong demand for large lump sum payouts.
