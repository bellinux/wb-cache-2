40|$|The <b>forest</b> {{operations}} <b>engineering</b> {{and management}} {{community has been}} facing the problem of improving its scientific visibility, realigning its research efforts to the future challenges, and of strengthening its self-confidence. The paper aims at exploring the paradigms that shaped the development of forest operations as a scientific discipline, sketching a vision how forest operations could look like in 2020, establishing a common understanding for future of the discipline, and discussing the major challenges ahead. The investigation identified five periods of steady state development (paradigms) and developed a vision of network-based forest operations systems, built of »self-organizing« cells. It then discusses the challenges that we will probably been faced with {{in the fields of}} »harvesting and transportation engineering«, »forest operations management«, »forest ergonomics«, and »forest operations ecology«. The study intended to trigger a broad discussion on the future directions of <b>forest</b> operations <b>engineering</b> and management, and to build a basis for a redesign of corresponding curricula in higher education...|$|R

The structures' original builders used stone and mud walls to carefully carve and construct terraces that could hold flooded pond fields for the cultivation of rice.

30|$|A {{focus on}} non-equilibrium, dynamic systems {{points to a}} {{different}} response - one centred on flexibility, adaptive management, responsive care and resilience, not control and technocratic intervention.

But of course, realizing the alternative paradigm is difficult. Institutional biases, procedures and routines reinforce control, especially when funding agencies and governments have fewer and fewer people in the field, connecting {{with the real world}} of the drylands.|$|R

40|$|Environmentally sound {{technologies}} {{are a key}} to reduce resource use and environmental impact. The paper reviews the state of knowledge of an analysis tool, life cycle assessment (LCA), by addressing three issues: 1) methodological foundations of LCA, 2) lifecycle inven­tory modeling, and 3) environmental performance indicators for wood supply systems. The study results in the following findings: 1) LCA is still not widely used and accepted in the <b>forest</b> operations <b>engineering.</b> 2) Only a few studies are based on state-of-the-art life cycle inventory analysis. 3) The boundaries of the studied systems are often too narrow, limiting comparability with standard LCA studies. 4) Most forest-related studies are based on direct process energy input only and are neglecting environmental burdens of upstream processes. 5) »Truncated LCAs«, neglecting embodied burdens of road infrastructure and forest machines always result in an underestimation of environmental impacts or an overestimation of envi­ronmental performance, respectively. There {{is a need for}} LCA capacity building in the forest operations community, on the basis of which forest-related LCA studies should become more comprehensive and comparable with studies of the core LCA community...|$|R

40|$|Forests cover a signifi cant {{proportion}} of mountain regions around the world, except {{those that are}} particularly dry or cold yearround. In Europe, for instance, forests cover 41 % of the total mountain area and are the prevalent land cover except in the mountains that extend into the Arctic regions. Mountains are fragile and often remote regions, whose human communities are often vulnerable to environmental, economic, and social changes both locally and globally. In recent decades, {{there have been two}} distinct trends in the area covered by mountain forests: 1) gradual rarefaction of rural activities, including sometimes forest exploitation, in industrialized countries, and 2) maintenance of high dependency of communities on their forests in developing countries. Faced with these contrasting trends, <b>forest</b> operation <b>engineering</b> and management (FOEM) can play an important role developing solutions that are fi t to the specifi c mountain forest situation. Two different situations are considered in order to evaluate the potential of FOEM in offering approaches to sustainably manage and use mountain forests: Italian northeastern Alps (Italy) and Sagarmatha area (Nepal). Technical proposals are mainly targeted to the economic and socio-cultural aspects connected to the management and use of forest resources...|$|R
