25|$|Macleod {{described}} his policy over North Rhodesia (modern Zambia) as “incredibly devious and tortuous” but “easily the one <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> proud of”. Macleod's initial {{plan for a}} Legislative Council with an African majority (16 African members to 14 Europeans) was strongly opposed by Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central African Federation. After a long battle {{in the first half}} of 1961, and under pressure from cabinet colleagues, Macleod accepted Welensky's proposal for a council of 45 members, 15 of whom would be elected by a largely African electoral roll, 15 by a largely European roll, 14 by both rolls jointly (with a further stipulation that successful candidates had to gain at least 10% of the African votes and 10% of the European ones) and 1 by Asians. Macleod's role in these negotiations attracted damaging and much-remembered criticism of Macleod by the party grandee, the Marquess of Salisbury, who had resigned from a senior position in the Cabinet over Cyprus in 1957. In a speech in the House of Lords on 7 March 1961 Salisbury denounced Macleod as “too clever by half” and accused him of bridge-table trickery. The new constitution, which was equally disliked by both Africans and Europeans, helped to weaken the Central African Federation, which was later wound up by Rab Butler at the Victoria Falls Conference on 5 July 1963.|$|E

500|$|The Lost Tapes compiles {{previously}} unreleased {{tracks that}} Nas recorded during 1998 to 2001 in the sessions for both his 1999 album I Am... and Stillmatic. Several {{songs from the}} sessions for the former album, including [...] "Blaze a 50", [...] "Drunk by Myself", and [...] "Poppa Was a Playa", were bootlegged prior to its release and leaked to the Internet through MP3 technology, which led to their exclusion from <b>I</b> <b>Am....</b> <b>Most</b> of the compiled songs first became available as bootlegs on underground mixtapes before being selected and mastered for The Lost Tapes.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} John Wayne {{again in}} Ford's romantic comedy-drama film, The Quiet Man. Shot {{on location in}} Cong, County Mayo, Ireland, O'Hara cited the film to be her [...] "personal favourite of all the pictures I have made. It is the one <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> proud of, and I {{tend to be very}} protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her." [...] Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O'Hara was disconcerted with Ford's harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing. Though Ford generally treated her very well, on one occasion when filming a cart scene in which the wind in her eyes made it difficult to see, Ford yelled [...] "Open your damn eyes" [...] and O'Hara flipped, responding with [...] "What would a bald-headed son of a bitch like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs".|$|E
500|$|Rupert first {{travelled}} to the Royal {{court in}} exile at St Germain but found it still {{dominated by the}} Queen and her favourite, Rupert's enemy Digby. Instead, Rupert moved on, accepting a well paid commission from Anne of Austria to serve Louis XIV as a mareschal de camp, subject to Rupert being free to leave French service to fight for King Charles, should he {{be called upon to}} do so. In 1647 Rupert fought under Marshal de Gassion against the Spanish. After a three-week siege, Rupert took the powerful fortress of La Bassée through quiet negotiations with the enemy commander—an impressive accomplishment, and one that won him favour in French court circles. Gassion and Rupert were ambushed shortly afterwards by a Spanish party; during the resulting fight, Rupert {{was shot in the head}} and seriously injured. Afterwards, Gassion noted: [...] "Monsieur, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> annoyed that you are wounded." [...] "And me also," [...] Rupert is recorded as replying. Gassion was himself killed shortly afterwards, and Rupert returned to St Germain to recuperate.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{the soul}} of Kara Zor-El {{appeared}} twice during Peter David's run, specifically in issues #48 and #49 when she appears before a defeated and imprisoned then-Supergirl, Linda Danvers from Earth, and comforts her. Linda acknowledges she has been helped three times by her phantom-friend, and when she asks her name she is told by the smiling figure: [...] "I have gone by many names, but the one <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> fond of is: Kara!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Felt reacted by saying, [...] "I {{feel very}} excited and just so pleased that I can hardly contain myself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> {{grateful}} to the President. I don't know how I'm {{ever going to be}} able to thank him. It's just like having a heavy burden lifted off your back. This case has been dragging on for five years." [...] Miller told a press conference the day of the announcement, [...] "I certainly owe the Gipper one." [...] Their attorney, Thomas Kennelly, said, [...] "We thank God and we thank President Reagan that these two good men have been vindicated at last." [...] Carter Attorney General Griffin Bell said he did not object to the pardons, as the convictions showed that behavior such as Felt and Miller's was no longer tolerated.|$|E

2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me what I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt's first American tour {{carried her}} to 157 {{performances}} in 51 cities. She traveled {{on a special}} train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maitre d'hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour. From New York, she made a side trip to Menlo Park, where she met Thomas Edison, who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from Phèdre [...] She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos {{on the back of}} a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the Methodist press, which only increased ticket sales. She performed Phedre six times and La Dame Aux Camilias (which Jarrett had renamed [...] "Camille" [...] to make it easier for Americans to pronounce) 65 times. On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of Camelias in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins [...] She described the result of her trip to her friends: [...] "I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. I planted the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, and it is that of which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>most</b> proud." ...|$|E
