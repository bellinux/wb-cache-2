5|$|The <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> or {{external}} interface {{at the rear}} of the ZX81 is an extension of the main printed circuit board. This provides a set of address, control, and data lines that can be used to communicate with external devices. Enthusiasts and a variety of third-party companies make use of this facility to create a wide range of add-ons for the ZX81.|$|E
25|$|Installing a 64-bit PCI-X card in a 32-bit slot {{will leave}} the 64-bit portion of the card <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> not {{connected}} and overhanging.

Most SNK-pinout units were put into Ikari Warriors cabinets, while most JAMMA-pinout units were supplied as conversion kits. The SNK-pinout boards have a 22/44-pin <b>edge</b> <b>connectors.</b> The JAMMA-pinout PCBs have a 28/56-pin <b>edge</b> <b>connectors.</b> Both types consist of a stack of three boards, with interconnects.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{flip-chip}} modules mated with single-sided 18-contact card <b>edge</b> <b>connectors</b> with contacts on 1/8 inch centers. Circuit boards were 2 7/16 {{inches wide}} by 5 inches long, with a handle adding 1/2 inch. Double modules with two connectors {{end to end}} were 5 3/16 wide. [...] Later, when two-sided boards were introduced, compatible double-sided 36-contact <b>edge</b> <b>connectors</b> were used, but the basic board dimensions were unchanged.|$|R

25|$|MSX {{standard}} requires {{at least}} 1 cartridge slot, most MSX models have 2. These slots are interchangeable, so {{in most cases}} {{it makes no difference}} in which slot a cartridge is inserted. The physical connector is a 50 pin (2 x 25 contacts), standard 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pitch <b>edge</b> <b>connector.</b> Using these cartridge slots, a wide variety of peripherals could be connected.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} card form factors: Type I, Type II, and Type III cards. The card {{connector}} used {{for each type}} include: Type I and II use a 100-pin stacking connector, while Type III uses a 124-pin <b>edge</b> <b>connector,</b> i.e. the connector for Types I and II differs from that for Type III, where the connector is {{on the edge of}} a card, like with a SO-DIMM. The additional 24 pins provide the extra signals required to route I/O back through the system connector (audio, AC-Link, LAN, phone-line interface). Type II cards have RJ11 and RJ45 mounted connectors. These cards must be located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the RJ11 and RJ45 ports can be mounted for external access.|$|E
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card <b>edge</b> <b>connector.</b> These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E

50|$|The Unibus {{consists}} of 72 signals, usually connected via two 36-way <b>edge</b> <b>connectors</b> on each printed circuit board. When {{not counting the}} power and ground lines, it is usually {{referred to as a}} 56-line bus. It can exist within a backplane or on a cable. Up to 20 nodes (devices) can be connected to a single Unibus segment; additional segments can be connected via a bus repeater.|$|R
500|$|Removal {{of several}} {{lines on the}} {{expansion}} bus <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> (video, power, and IORQGE); caused many external devices problems; some such as the VTX5000 modem could be used via the [...] "FixIt" [...] device.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{released}} {{only two}} official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> {{at the rear of}} the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the <b>edge</b> <b>connector.</b> It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|E
500|$|Sound {{output is}} through a beeper on the machine itself, capable of {{producing}} one channel with 10 octaves. [...] Software was later available that could play two channel sound. The machine includes an expansion bus <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> and 3.5mm audio in/out ports for the connection of a cassette recorder for loading and saving programs and data. [...] The [...] "ear" [...] port can drive headphones and the [...] "mic" [...] port provides line level audio out which could be amplified.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} simplify the EMC {{screening}} process, the <b>edge</b> <b>connectors</b> of the previous models have been replaced with micro-ribbon connectors as previously used on the German Schneider CPC6128. As a result, {{a wide range of}} extensions for the original CPC range is connector-incompatible with the 464plus and 6128plus. In addition, the 6128plus does not have a tape socket for an external tape drive.|$|R

500|$|The back of {{the model}} 1 console {{provides}} a radio frequency output port (designed for use with antenna and cable systems) and a specialized 8-pin DIN port, both of which provide video and audio output. Both outputs produce monophonic sound; a headphone jack {{on the front of}} the console produces stereo sound. [...] On the model 2, the DIN port, radio frequency output port, and headphone jack are replaced by a 9-pin mini-DIN port on the back for composite video, RGB and stereo sound, and the standard RF switch. [...] Earlier model 1 consoles have a 9-pin extension port, although this was removed in later production runs and is absent in the model 2. An <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> on the bottom-right of the console allows it to be connected to a peripheral.|$|E

50|$|In 1979, during {{development}} of the Motorola 68000 CPU, one of their engineers, Jack Kister, decided to set about creating a standardized bus system for 68000-based systems. The Motorola team brainstormed for days to select the name VERSAbus. VERSAbus cards were large, 14+1/2 by 9+1/4 in, and used <b>edge</b> <b>connectors.</b> Only a few products adopted it, including the IBM System 9000 instrument controller and the Automatix robot and machine vision systems.|$|R

2500|$|DDR4 {{memory is}} {{supplied}} in 288-pin dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), similar {{in size to}} 240-pin DDR3 DIMMs. The pins are spaced more closely (0.85mm instead of 1.0) to fit the increased number within the same 5¼ inch (...) standard DIMM length, but the height is increased slightly ( [...] instead of [...] ) to make signal routing easier, and the thickness is also increased (to 1.2mm from 1.0) to accommodate more signal layers. [...] DDR4 DIMM modules have a slightly curved <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> so {{not all of the}} pins are engaged at the same time during module insertion, lowering the insertion force.|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the product}} life of the Lisa, there were {{third-party}} hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3½ inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa features expansion slots. Like the Apple II, it was an [...] "open system". The Lisa 2 motherboard had a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of <b>edge</b> <b>connector</b> sockets/slots. There were two RAM slots, one CPU slot and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there were three [...] "Lisa" [...] slots, parallel to each other. This flexibility provided {{the potential for a}} developer to create a replacement for the CPU [...] "card" [...] to upgrade the Lisa to run a newer CPU, albeit with potential limitations {{from other parts of the}} system.|$|E
2500|$|Other platings {{used are}} OSP (organic surface protectant), {{immersion}} silver (IAg), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating (ENIG), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold (ENEPIG) and direct gold plating (over nickel). [...] <b>Edge</b> <b>connectors,</b> placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then gold-plated. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.|$|R
50|$|Boards for the SS-50 bus were {{typically}} 9 {{inches wide and}} 5.5 inches high. The board had Molex 0.156 inch connectors while the motherboard had the pins. This arrangement made for low cost printed circuit boards that did not need gold plated <b>edge</b> <b>connectors.</b> The tin plated Molex connectors were only rated for a few insertions and were sometimes a problem in hobbyist systems where the boards were being swapped often. Later systems would often come with gold plated Molex connectors.|$|R
50|$|The Enterprise came {{included}} {{an array of}} connectors far beyond what was common on home computers of the time. There is an RGB output, a RS232 / RS423 serial port, a Centronics printer port, two external joystick ports, two cassette interfaces, a ROM cartridge slot, and an ordinary expansion port. To save expense, many of the connectors did not use sockets, but instead had simple <b>edge</b> <b>connectors</b> that used the exposed traces {{at the edge of}} the printed circuit board.|$|R
