25|$|Following {{the victory}} of al-Mu'tazz, Wasif and Bugha {{initially}} remained in Baghdad. The new caliph, however, initially took a hostile attitude toward the two officers, and ordered Muhammad to drop their names, together with those they had registered, from the diwans. When Wasif and Bugha discovered in April 866 that one of Muhammad's deputies had been contracted to kill them, they went on the defensive, gathering their troops, purchasing weapons and distributing funds <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite {{perceptions}} by {{the public}} and media that people with mental disorders released into the community {{are more likely to}} be dangerous and violent, a large study indicated that those without substance abuse symptoms are no more likely to commit violence than others without substance abuse symptoms <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> which were usually economically deprived and high in substance abuse and crime. The study also reported that a higher proportion of the patients than of the others in the neighborhoods reported symptoms of substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the present}} {{situation}} has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans {{has been unable to}} upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and Palo Alto. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern Alameda County (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to Silicon Valley), thus increasing traffic <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> to the south and west of U.S. 101.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} the skateboarder as a rebellious, {{non-conforming}} youth has faded in recent years. Certain cities still oppose the building of skateparks <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as Thrasher portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to punk, while other publications, Transworld Skateboarding as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. Furthermore, as more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.|$|E

25|$|Under the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, {{primary schools}} {{were to be}} tuition-free and {{reasonably}} located {{for the convenience of}} children attending them; students would attend primary schools <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food, and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.|$|E
500|$|The system, {{which was}} first {{supposed}} {{to start in}} fall 2011, got pushed back to summer 2012 due to uncertainties about where to place the rental stations. The city had originally intended to place Citi Bike stalls mostly on sidewalks and public plazas, {{but there were some}} locations where stalls would take up parking spaces. The 2012 implementation date was only for Phase 1 of Citi Bike, with more phases to come later. Software problems delayed the [...] planned July 2012 start until March 2013. These problems were also reported by Alta programs in Chicago and in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The problems reportedly occurred because the Public Bike System Company, a Canadian affiliate of Alta, was involved in a dispute with software supplier 8D Technologies. Then, Hurricane Sandy damaged 1,000 bicycles and 60 stations in storage at Brooklyn Navy Yard. As planning progressed, some residents expressed dismay at the lack of docking stations <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> while others fought against stations on their blocks.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of French rule, al-Kharrat was al-Shaghour's qabaday (pl. qabadayat), the {{traditional}} leader of a neighborhood's local toughs. The qabaday was informally charged with redressing grievances and defending a neighborhood's honor against local criminals or the encroachments of qabadayat from other neighborhoods. He was popularly characterized as an honorable man, noted for his personal strength, and protection of minorities and the poor. The qabaday was considered an [...] "upholder of Arab traditions and customs, the guardian of popular culture", according to historian Philip S. Khoury. Khoury asserts that al-Kharrat was [...] "probably the most respected and esteemed qabaday of his day". Qabadayat normally shunned formal education, and historian Michael Provence maintains that al-Kharrat was likely illiterate. Qabadayat were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> Al-Kharrat was allied with Nasib al-Bakri, a Damascene politician and landowner. The al-Bakri family was the most influential in al-Shaghour, and al-Kharrat served as the family's principal connection and enforcer in the quarter.|$|E

2500|$|An eruv ( [...] ; , [...] "mixture", also transliterated as eiruv or erub, plural: eruvin [...] ) is {{a ritual}} {{enclosure}} that some Jewish communities, and especially Orthodox Jewish communities, construct <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> {{as a way}} to permit Jewish residents or visitors to carry certain objects outside their own homes on Sabbath and Yom Kippur. An eruv accomplishes this by integrating a number of private and public properties into one larger private domain, thereby avoiding restrictions on carrying objects from the private to the public domain on Sabbath and holidays.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{social work}} has been {{historically}} defined by these institutionalized and deinstitutionalized periods, informal community design programs have always existed. In fact, informal community-based programs predate human service applications of this approach. In 1990, Bernice Harper illustrated {{this point in the}} book Social Work Practice with Black Families: A Culturally Specific Perspective in regards to African American communities, by writing that: Blacks have always cared for the sick at home, yet it was never labeled 'home care.' Blacks have been dying at home and receiving care in the process, yet it was never called 'hospice care.' Blacks have relieved each other from the caring and curing processes, yet it was never seen as 'respite care.' Blacks have cared for each other in their homes, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> and throughout their communities, yet it was never referred to as 'volunteerism.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the motive}} of the rioters was {{attributed}} to racial tensions {{but now they are}} considered one factor in a larger status quo conflict. Urban sociologist Joel Kotkin agrees, [...] "This wasn't a race riot, it was a class riot." [...] Supporting this is the large misconception that rioters were only African-American; many groups in fact participated. Newsweek reported that [...] "Hispanics and even some whites—men, women and children—mingled with African-Americans." [...] "When residents who lived near Florence and Normandie were asked why they believed riots had occurred <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> they responded of the perceived racist attitudes they had felt throughout their lifetime and empathized with the bitterness the rioters felt. Residents who had respectable jobs, homes, and material items still felt like second-class citizens. A poll by Newsweek asked whether black people charged with crimes were treated more harshly or more leniently and results revealed that 75% of blacks voted more harshly versus 46% of whites.|$|E
