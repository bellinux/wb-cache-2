40|$|A pile-supported {{embankment}} {{constructed on}} TH 241 near St. Michael, MN was instrumented with 48 sensors, including strain gages on the piles {{and on the}} geogrid, as well as earth pressure cells and settlement systems near {{the base of the}} embankment. Pile supported embankments are relatively novel structures employed largely at bridge approaches and highway expansions where soft soils would otherwise lead to unacceptably large differential settlements. The structure typically consists of a number of capped piles, well-compacted gravel, and one or more layers of geogrid reinforcement above the piles. Analyses of the data suggest that the redistribution of the <b>embankment</b> <b>load</b> to the piles occurs within and above the so-called load transfer platform, a 1 m layer of geogrid-reinforced gravel. Arching seemed to take place within the embankment, such that the stress {{at the top of the}} platform was concentrated above the piles. 17. Document Analysis/Descriptors 18.

A series of reinforcement method were applied in the field under a trial embankment with 4, 5 m high. Field instrumentation was set up on the site to observe the movement and settlement behaviour of reinforced soil under <b>embankment</b> <b>load.</b> Pile reinforcement of soft soil made from galam timber with 6 m length and 10 cm in diameter. The settlement monitored by using settlement plate during the construction stage and the lateral displacement measured by using inclinometer. Piezometer was used in order to monitor the change of pore water pressure during the preloading test. It was concluded that construction of embankment using inclined pile as reinforcement on soft soil can reduce the settlement and the lateral movement significantly and can be used as an alternative soil reinforcement material...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of soft clay {{deposits}} by {{the installation}} of stone columns {{is one of the}} most popular techniques followed worldwide. The stone columns not only act as reinforcingmaterial increasing the overall strength and stiffness of the compressible soft soil, but they also promote consolidation through effective drainage. The analytical and numerical solutions available for ascertaining the response of column-reinforced soil have been developed on the basis of the equal strain hypothesis. For typical surcharge (<b>embankment)</b> <b>loading,</b> the free strain analysis appears to give more realistic results comparable to field data. The paper presents a novel numericalmodel (finite-differencemethod) to analyze the response of stone column-reinforced soft soil under <b>embankment</b> <b>loading,</b> adopting the free strain approach and considering both arching and clogging effects. Apart from predicting the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the resulting consolidation settlement with time, the load transfer mechanismand the extent of ground improvement are some of the salient features captured by the proposedmodel. The proposedmodel is validated by comparing with existingmodels and field data, which indicate the suitability and accuracy of the solutions. The proposed model is also applied successfully to selected case studies...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{examination}} of existing field results, an empirical equation {{has been suggested}} for estimating the likely range of the maximum value of the net lateral displacement (δ nm) of ground improved by the installation of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) and subjected to the combined effects of vacuum pressure and <b>embankment</b> <b>loading.</b> The effects on lateral displacement of the magnitudes of <b>embankment</b> <b>loading,</b> {{as well as the}} vacuum pressure, the loading rate, and the undrained shear strength and consolidation properties of the soil deposit, have been explicitly included in a newly defined parameter, which is given by the ratio of an index pressure to the representative soil shear strength (RLS). The ratio of δ nm to the surface settlement under the embankment centreline, S f, is also defined as the normalised maximum (net) lateral displacement (NLD). A direct relationship between RLS and NLD has been proposed, with a prescribed range, {{based on the results of}} 18 field case histories from 12 different project sites in five countries. It is suggested that the proposed relationship can be used as a preliminary design tool for preloading projects involving combinations of a vacuum pressure and an embankment pressure as well as PVD improvement...|$|R
40|$|Two methods, {{namely the}} {{air-tight}} sheet method and the vacuum-drain method (sheetless), are generally used to conduct vacuum consolidation in the field. The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of both methods and the techniques for preventing vacuum leakage through a middle sand layer in a deposit, as well as the method for maintaining vacuum pressure when large settlement occurs, have been described. Vacuum pressure is an isotropic consolidation pressure applied to a soil deposit, and the deformation induced is different from that induced by a surcharge (e. g. the weight of an embankment). Two typical case histories in Japan are presented and deformation analyses were conducted. In one case history the vacuum-drain method was used with vacuum pressure alone, and in the other a combination of embankment loading and vacuum pressure was applied employing the air-tight sheet method. It is shown that under vacuum pressure loading, the ground deformation (settlement and lateral displacement) can be calculated reliably using a method proposed previously. For the case involving a combination of vacuum pressure and <b>embankment</b> <b>load,</b> the settlements under the embankment centreline can be estimated reasonably assuming one-dimensional deformation conditions...|$|E
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly necessary to construct on land that was previously considered inappropriate for construction, such as soft clay. The properties of soft clay make it highly compressible and low in shear strength, meaning that bearing capacity failure and excessive settlement are of concern. Piled embankments are a ground improvement technique that can provide a solution for this problem. Piled embankments {{have the ability to}} transfer the greater part of the <b>embankment</b> <b>load</b> and any surcharge to more competent material at greater depth due to the 'arching' concept. Consequently, the soft foundation soil has little direct impact on the performance of the embankment. The concept of 'arching' of granular soil over an area where there is partial loss of support from underlying strata has long been recognised in the study of soil mechanics (e. g. Terzaghi, 1943). However, a number of competing theories exist to quantify this behaviour in piled embankments. In addition, the use of geotextile reinforcement in piled embankments placed above the pile caps in principle provides a number of technical as well as economical benefits. As the embankment fill is placed, tension is created in the reinforcement and it is the vertical component of this tension that transfers the <b>embankment</b> <b>load</b> onto the piles and reduces the load carried by the soft clay hence transferring the load of the embankment on to the piles. Differential settlement can be a problem for piled embankments of low height. Significant differential settlement can cause undesirable effects on any structures constructed on the embankment. 'Arching' limits the amount of differential settlement in embankments and the use of geotextile geogrid can also potentially have additional benefits. This thesis presents a series of centrifuge tests examining the performance of unreinforced and reinforced piled embankments constructed over soft subsoil in terms of stress acting on the subsoil, and differential movement at the surface of the embankment. A large range of embankment heights are considered, and the results for stress on the subsoil are compared with existing predictive methods, allowing generic conclusions to be drawn regarding the predictions of various methods. The effect of a 'working platform' below pile cap level and thus directly loading the subsoil is also considered, and used to examine the concept of a 'Ground Reaction Curve' (Iglesia et al, 1999) for arching in the embankment. In principle this can be used to consider compatibility of displacements {{at the base of the}} embankment, and thus improve design simultaneously considering the effect of arching in the embankment and underlying support from the subsoil and layers of reinforcement acting in tension.

40|$|A {{full scale}} test {{embankment}} was constructed {{to evaluate the}} performance {{of different types of}} load transfer platforms (LTP) supported on geopiers. LTP is defined as a region from the base in the embankment that behaves like a platform where partial or full <b>embankment</b> <b>load</b> is transferred to the columns. Three types of LTP were constructed, they include reinforced concrete LTP, geosynthetic-reinforced LTP with two layers of geogrid (catenary LTP), and geosynthetic-reinforced LTP with three or more layers of geogrid (beam LTP). Because very few studies on LTPs supported on less stiff columns such as geopiers are available, this full-scale embankment experiment aspires to shed more light on the suitability of using such columns together with geosynthetic-reinforced LTP to support embankments on soft soils. The results indicate that the differential settlement between the geopier and the matrix soil is smaller in the reinforced concrete and beam LTP than in catenary LTP. Although the differential settlement in the beam LTP is small, tension in the geogrid can be as high as 27 % of the allowable design strain (5 %). In the catenary LTP, the strain in the geogrid was approximately 10 % of the allowable design strain (6 %). The cost of the different LTPs is also discussed...|$|E

The primary objective {{of this study is}} to validate the ability of the proposed method to simulate actual ground behavior by comparing the simulation results with the actual measurements of the <b>embankment</b> <b>loading</b> of a soft peat ground improved with vertical drains and vacuum consolidation. It was found that the proposed method is capable of comprehensively and closely simulating not only the magnitude of settlement, but also various ground behaviors, including the deformation of the surrounding ground and pore water pressure distributions. Furthermore, additional simulations were performed to elucidate the effect of a continuous middle sand layer found to exist and to span the entire improved area at an actual embankment site. The next objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of ground improvement, using vertical drains and vacuum consolidation with <b>embankment</b> <b>loading</b> on a soft ground, placing a particular focus on the effect of drain spacing. In this case, an ultra-soft ground with alternating peat and clay layers was modeled to represent a typical ground to which vacuum consolidation would be applied. Based on a series of simulations, it was found that, although the use of vacuum consolidation in combination with vertical drains is effective in cases where it is necessary to limit the deformation of the surrounding ground, the same reduction in residual settlement can be achieved using vertical drains alone, provided that the drains are deployed at a sufficient frequency...|$|R

An analytical solution was derived for calculating the consolidation process of this composite foundation by considering coefficients of horizontal permeability in smear zone, the radial flow within the sand-gravel shell, and the impervious property of concrete-cored pile. The results show that Terzaghi’s one-dimensional consolidation solution and the consolidation analytical solution of ordinary composite foundation were special cases of this solution. Curves of the average consolidation degree of the composite foundation under various nondimensional parameters were observed using the program based on the theoretical formula. Meanwhile, a series of in situ measurements including the settlement of pile and soil, the pore water pressure, and the total stress under <b>embankment</b> <b>load</b> were obtained on the CCSG pile composite foundation on a section of Zhenjiang-Liyang highway. The analyzed results show that the new style composite foundation patent technology has many advantages such as small differential postconstruction settlement (differential is not good, small is), reliable quality, high bearing capacity, and stability. And the consolidation of composite foundation is largely affected by the nondimensional parameters. The analytical solution is finally verified with the actual measurement data...|$|E

Constructions that built on this soil; such as embankment; face some obstructions, for {{instance}} long period consolidation, difficult soil compaction, unstable slope of embankment and high settlement value for long period. Consolidation related to particle size of soil grains, soil permeability coefficient and pore size between soil particles.

The numerical method analysis was conducted using finite element method utilizing a commercial program package. Trial embankment was performed in several fill stages followed by observation of embankment stability and ground settlement. Field observation indicated that embankment using bamboo pile-mattress system showed adequate stability against slope failure and bearing capacity failure and actual settlement was also close to predicted settlement.

40|$|The {{settlement}} pattern of an embankment {{may not always}} be the typical one in which the maximum settlement occurs at the center.

40|$|Two methods, {{namely the}} {{air-tight}} sheet method and the vacuum-drain method, are generally used to conduct vacuum consolidation in the field. The air-tight sheet method involves {{the placement of}} an air-tight sheet on the ground surface and embedding its periphery in the ground. A vacuum is then applied to the air or water in the soil below the sheet to induce soil consolidation. In the vacuum-drain method a surface or subsurface clayey soil layer {{is used as a}} sealing layer without the need for an air-tight sheet. These two methods have their various advantages and disadvantages. For example, for the case where an underwater clay deposit is consolidated by application of a vacuum pressure, the vacuum-drain method has an obvious advantage; while for the case requiring consolidation of a soil layer that extends from the ground surface, the air-tight sheet method should be used. Two typical case histories in Japan are presented: one in which the vacuumdrain method was adopted, and the other which involved pre loading. as part of a highway construction, using a combination of embankment loading and vacuum pressure employing the air-tight sheet method. It is shown that under vacuum pressure loading, the ground deformation can be calculated reliably using the method proposed by Chai et al. in 2005. For the case involving a combination of vacuum pressure and <b>embankment</b> <b>load,</b> the settlements under the embankment centreline can be reasonably calculated assuming one-dimensional (1 D) deformation conditions. However, it is also noted that there is no well-established method for calculating lateral displacements of the ground associated with these ground improvement methods and further research in this area is needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of road and rail infrastructure on weak foundation soils presents many challenges for Geotechnical Engineers. Construction of embankments over soft soils, such as peat and soft clay, {{may result in}} large, often differential, surface settlements and expensive long-term maintenance costs. An innovative solution {{is the use of}} geosynthetic reinforced piled embankments (GRPE), which can reduce surface settlements, cost and construction time. In GRPEs, a redistribution of <b>embankment</b> <b>load</b> occurs whereby much of the vertical load on the soft soil is transferred to the piles, and hence to a firm stratum at greater depth. This redistribution of load is aided by a natural phenomenon known as arching that occurs in the granular embankment material. The design of piled embankments involves estimating the magnitude of arching that occurs in the fill over the piles. Factors that must be considered include the embankment geometry, shear strength of granular embankment material and support from the subsoil and the geosynthetic reinforcement. In this study, plane strain physical models of a piled embankment were investigated in a geotechnical centrifuge at up to 150 times Earth’s gravity (g). The centrifuge model facilitated the capturing of photographic images in-flight to allow the deformational response of the piled embankment to be assessed. Numerical analyses, using Plaxis 2 D, replicated the centrifuge model testing to allow further assessment of the deformational response, as well as the tensile stress along the geosynthetic and stress in the embankment fill above the reinforcement. Direct comparison of the data from the physical and numerical models largely validated Plaxis for use in piled embankment design. The study highlighted the importance of certain parameters on the performance of GRPEs. Reduced surface differential settlements were observed for increased embankment height to clear spacing ratio, subsoil stiffness and geosynthetic tensile strength. The location of the piled embankment critical height, determined using the centrifuge model testing and Plaxis analyses, was influenced by the embankment fill density and subsoil stiffness. Good agreement was found between the critical heights determined in this study and those associated with BS 8006 (2010), Naughton (2007), Collin (2004), Horgan & Sarsby (2002) and Hewlett & Randolph (1988) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{full scale}} test {{embankment}} was constructed on soft Bangkok clay using rubber tire chip-sand mixtures as lightweight geomaterials reinforced with geogrid under working stress conditions. The wall/embankment was constructed with solid modular concrete facing units and rock filled gabion boxes on both sloping {{sides of the}} embankment. This paper attempts to simulate {{the behavior of the}} full scale test embankment using PLAXIS finite element 2 D program. The important considerations for simulation and sensitivity analyses of the behavior of reinforced wall/embankment were the method of applying the <b>embankment</b> <b>loading</b> during the construction process, the assumed soil permeability values during the consolidation process, and the selection of the appropriate models and properties at the interface between the soil and the reinforcement. The effect of settlement predictions are weathered crust thickness and over-consolidation ratio of soft clay because the lightweight backfill loading is much lower compared to conventional backfill. The computed excess pore water pressure is more accurate in shallow depth than deeper depth. The predicted lateral wall movement agreed well with observed field data...|$|R

Elastic solutions are obtained for an equivalent force {{per unit length}} ps of the soil movement. They are repeated {{for a series of}} linearly increasing ps (with depth) to yield the nonlinear response. The parameters underpinning the model are determined against pertinent numerical solutions and model tests on passive free-head and capped piles. The solutions are presented in non-dimensional charts and elaborated through three examples. The study reveals the following: On-pile pressure in rotationally restrained, sliding layer reduces by a factor α, which resembles the p-multiplier for a laterally loaded, capped pile, but for its increase with vertical <b>loading</b> (<b>embankment</b> surcharge), and stiffness of underlying stiff layer: α= 0. 25 and 0. 6 for a shallow, translating and rotating piles, respectively; α= 0. 33 - 0. 5 and 0. 8 - 1. 3 for a slide overlying a stiff layer concerning a uniform and a linearly increasing pressure, respectively; and α= 0. 5 - 0. 72 for moving clay under <b>embankment</b> <b>loading.</b> Ultimate state is well defined using the ratio of passive earth pressure coefficient over that of active earth pressure. The subgrade modulus for a large soil movement may be scaled from model tests. The normalised rotational stiffness is equal to 0. 1 - 0. 15 for the capped piles, which increases the pile displacement with depth. The three-layer model solutions well predict nonlinear response of capped piles subjected to passive loading, which may be used for pertinent design...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{a measure}} to reduce lateral {{deformation}} and settlement due to road <b>embankment</b> <b>loading</b> on the soft clay ground, the column type Deep Mixing method used at a low improvement ratio of around 10 - 20 % (LiDM) {{has been found to}} have sufficient performance and to save total costs. The main features of this method can be summarized as follows: 1 Since the whole bottom surface of embankment is improved all over, shear deformation toward outside of embankment due to settlement at the center part can be reduced compared with the conventional type (Figure 1). 2 Since the volume of embankment can be saved due to sufficient reduction of settlement, LiDM is considered to be environment-friendly. 3 When the column diameter is small (60 - 80 cm), small sized installation equipment and a simple loading test for quality control can be used. A rational design procedure for the LiDM has been formulated {{based on the results of}} laboratory model test (Miki, 1997). This paper reports on a study of this design procedure's suitability, using some cases of numerical analysis and case study of the expressway widening project near Bangkok in Thailand.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of a test}} embankment {{constructed on}} a soft clayey deposit in Saga, Japan, was simulated by both three-dimensional (3 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) finite element analyses (FEA). Floating soil-cement columns had been installed in the clay prior to construction of the embankment. Comparing the results of 3 D and 2 D FEA indicates that 2 D analysis predicts incorrect results {{in terms of the}} lateral displacement and bending moment in the columns under the toe of the embankment. In the 2 D analysis, the rows of columns were modelled by continuous walls, which partially block the interaction between the soil layers and the columns and influence the simulated lateral displacement and bending moment in the column. It has been postulated that compaction of fill material during the construction process has a significant influence on both the magnitude and pattern of the lateral displacement of the column under the toe of the embankment. Pragmatically, this influence can be indirectly simulated by reducing the stiffness and increasing Poisson's ratio of the embankment fill material. Finally, both the measured and FEA results indicate that the columns not only reduced the total settlement but also accelerated the settlement rate of the deposit under the <b>embankment</b> <b>loading,</b> due to the much higher stiffness of the column material...|$|R

The subsurface soils consist of soft silty clays and very loose to medium dense silty sand alluvial soils extending to 15 m depth.

For comparison, two centrifugal modeling tests are conducted on the embankment, one involving only soil–cement columns and the other involving only PVDs. The <b>embankment</b> <b>loads</b> are applied in four stages using a hydraulic jack mounted on top of a strongbox. Scaled-down model columns and a kind of wool strings are used to simulate the prototype soil–cement columns and PVDs, respectively. The load sharing ratio, defined as the proportion of external loads carried by the columns, is used to evaluate the load transfer between the columns and the surrounding soil. The test results indicate that the load sharing ratio increases with an increase in column length and a decrease in column spacing. The ground settlement and the lateral displacement decrease with an increase in column length and a decrease in column spacing. Finally, the use of the combined method to mitigate differential settlements at a bridge approach is discussed...|$|R

The subsurface soils consist of soft silty clays and very loose to medium dense silty sand alluvial soils extending to 15 m depth. Analysis {{of the results of}} a comprehensive geotechnical investigation carried out showed that the naturally occurring soils possess low bearing capacity and are expected to undergo excessively large settlements under the proposed <b>embankment</b> <b>loads</b> in case such soils have been treated. The soil investigation results also revealed that they have a very high potential for liquefaction {{in the event of an}} earthquake occurrence. A theoretical evaluation of the ‘sand compaction piles, SCP’ method for soil treatment is made in this study for improving the geotechnical characteristics to attain foundation soils adequately capable of supporting the proposed embankment safely. This has been resolved through the installation of sand piles with 1. 1 m diameter spaced at 2. 5 m interval distances in a square pattern. This design of SCP was found to improve the soil bearing capacity of originally weak foundation soils by 190 %, to reduce consolidation settlement is reduced by 35 %, to increase the safety factor against embankment slopes failure by 155 % and significantly reduce the risk of soil liquefaction during any earthquake event...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{suitability}} of three soil improvement techniques {{for the construction of}} a high earth embankment on thick weak and highly compressible clay soil. The eastern approach embankment of Alhalfaya Bridge on the River Nile linking Khartoum North and Omdurman cities was chosen as a case study and a comprehensive site investigation program was carried out to determine the properties the subsurface soils. The study results showed that unless the subsurface soils have been improved they may fail or undergo excessively large settlements due to the embankment construction. Three ground improvement techniques based on the principles of the “staged construction method, SCM”, “vertical sand drain, VSD” and “sand compaction piles, SCP” of embankment foundation soil treatment are discussed and evaluated. Embankment design options based on applications of the above methods have been proposed for foundation treatment to adequately support <b>embankment</b> <b>loads.</b> A method performance evaluation based on the improvement of soil properties achieved; the time required for construction and compared estimated costs criteria was made to assess the effectiveness and expected overall performance. Adoption of any of the soil improvement techniques considered depends mainly on the most critical and decisive factor governing the embankment design. Based on the overall performance for the embankment case studied, the sand drains is considered as the most appropriate improvement method followed by the sand compaction piles technique whereas the staged construction method showed the poorest overall performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{approach}} road embankments {{to the new}} Shannon bridge rise up to 8 ´ 6 m {{above the}} marshlands of the River Shannon {{to the north of}} the town of Athlone in the Irish Midlands. These embankments are located on very soft glacial lake clay, highly compressible organic clay and calcareous marls, the geotechnical properties of which were largely unknown at the commencement of design in the early 1980 s. Comparisons between compressibility, consolidation and shear strength parameters derived during the site investigation and those measured by monitoring the works are presented in this paper. It was found, for example, that the installation of vertical drains can significantly alter consolidation behaviour, that held compressibility was greater than that expected from laboratory testing, and that lateral movement monitoring was a useful indicator of embankment instability. Data from the construction of the Athlone embankments also confirm that the held vane strength underestimates the operational strength of the clays, owing to a combination of anisotropic and vane insertion disturbance effects. Good estimates of the operational strength are given by the piezocone. Details of some investigative work carried out on the soils beneath the embankments, some nine years after completion of construction, are also presented. It was shown that this testing confirms the findings of Mesri (1989) that the increase in shear strength is approximately equal to 0 : 22 Äó 9 v. Also, the piezocone is capable of defining zones of anisotropy induced by <b>embankment</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractPermanent {{settlement}} of the subsoil induced by traffic load has been paid more and more attention recently. Predicting the traffic-load-induced permanent settlement correctly especially on saturated soft clay ground {{has been an important}} issue for the highway construction. For this propose, simplified methods based on empirical models for predicting the accumulative deformations of soft clays are usually preferred. Numerous experimental studies have been conducted by cyclic triaxial tests. However, little is known concerning the effects of principal stress direction, where the major principal stress direction is rotated away from the vertical by an angle due to undrained <b>embankment</b> <b>loading.</b> In this paper, a series of undrained cyclic tests with the hollow cylinder apparatus have been performed on Shanghai soft clay samples that involved different directions of the principal stress. In order to create explicit (empirical) models for predicting cyclic cumulative strain and pore water pressure, undrained static tests were also conducted under different directions of the principal stress. Test results show that the cumulative plastic strain and pore water pressure depend not only on the effective confining pressure, applied cyclic stress ratio and number of cycles, but also on the direction of principal stress. The improved explicit (empirical) models previously proposed to calculate the cumulative axial plastic strain and pore water pressure of saturated clay from the cyclic triaxial tests are further verified by the cyclic hollow cylinder tests under fixed directions of the principal stress. Such improved explicit (empirical) models will provide an effective approach to calculating the long-term {{settlement of}} highway embankment built on the soft ground caused by traffic load...|$|R
