5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and <b>degrade</b> misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to <b>degrade</b> the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E

5|$|The Central Intelligence Agency {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of Operation Deliberate Force and Operations Maestral 2 and Sana, and noted that the NATO air campaign did not <b>degrade</b> VRS combat capability as much as was expected, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units but at command and control infrastructure. This analysis noted that, while the NATO air campaign did <b>degrade</b> VRS capabilities, the final offensives by the HV, HVO and the ARBiH did the most damage. The analysis further concluded that the ground offensives, rather than the NATO bombardment, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiation table and the war to its end. However, author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV would not have advanced as rapidly as it did had NATO not intervened and hampered the VRS defence by denying it long-range communications.|$|E
5|$|The gate {{formed by}} the α {{subunits}} prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering {{the interior of the}} 20S particle.

Passage of the unfolded substrate through the opened gate occurs via facilitated diffusion if the 19S cap is in the ATP-bound state.|$|E

40|$|In healthy forests, {{vertebrate}} frugivores move {{seeds from}} intact to <b>degraded</b> forests, aiding in the passive regeneration of <b>degraded</b> forests. Yet vertebrate frugivores are declining around the world, and {{little is known}} about the impact of this loss on regeneration of <b>degraded</b> areas. Here, we use a unique natural experiment to assess how complete vertebrate frugivore loss affects native seed rain in <b>degraded</b> forest. All native vertebrate frugivores (which were primarily avian frugivores) have been functionally extirpated from the island of Guam by the invasive brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), whereas the nearby island of Saipan has a relatively intact vertebrate frugivore community. We captured seed rain along transects extending from intact into <b>degraded</b> forest and compared the species richness, density and condition of the seed rain from native bird-dispersed tree species between the two islands. Considering seeds from native bird-dispersed species, approximately 1. 66 seeds landed per 26 days in each square meter of <b>degraded</b> forest on Saipan, whereas zero seeds landed per 26 days per square meter in <b>degraded</b> forest on Guam. Additionally, on Saipan, 69 % of native bird-dispersed seeds in intact forest and 77 % of seeds in <b>degraded</b> forest lacked fleshy fruit pulp, suggesting ingestion by birds, compared to 0 % of all seeds on Guam.

Grassland degradation in alpine steppe is severe, but the influence of grassland degradation on AM fungi composition in Tibetan Plateau is still not well understood. This research studied the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in <b>degraded</b> alpine steppe, dominated by Stipa purpurea. The results showed that the species richness and abundance of AM fungi in <b>degraded</b> grasslands significantly decreased. In different typical grasslands species, diversity of AM fungi genus Glomus was much higher than other genera (Acaulospora and Scutellospora). Compared with normal grassland, the AM fungal species diversity in moderately <b>degraded</b> grassland decreased by 30 %, but in lightly <b>degraded</b> and severely <b>degraded</b> grassland, it highly increased with 15. 3 % and 13. 3 %, respectively. The species diversity of genus Glomus in moderately <b>degraded</b> grassland and lightly <b>degraded</b> grassland were higher than for normal grassland.
