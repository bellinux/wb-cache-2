The mechanical and optical properties of this material have been investigated in several studies. However, there is a lack of information and consensus regarding the optical properties of IPS e. max® LD glass-ceramic materials. Objectives: 1) To investigate the optical properties as translucency parameters (TP), Contrast ratio (CR), light transmissions (Lt) and color changes (CC) between high-translucent (<b>HT)</b> and low-translucent (<b>LT)</b> IPS e. max® CAD LD glass-ceramic materials with different crystalline phases and thickness in different firing stages. 2) To investigate the optical properties as TP, CR, Lt and CC of each translucent (<b>HT</b> and <b>LT)</b> IPS e. max® CAD LD glass-ceramic materials with different crystalline phases and thickness in different firing stages. 3) To determine the mathematical relationships of thicknesses of IPS e. max® CAD LD glass-ceramics materials with TP and Lt. Materials and methods: The total of 120 of shade A 2 IPS max CAD samples (<b>HT</b> and <b>LT)</b> were prepared into square shape (15. 25 mm X 15. 25 mm) and were divided into two main groups according to the material translucency (<b>HT</b> and <b>LT)</b> (n= 60). Each main group was further divided into 5 sub-groups according to the thickness (1. 00, 1. 25, 1. 5, 1. 75, and 2. 00 mm) (n= 12). Each thickness group was assigned into three groups based on different crystallization (firing) temperatures (750, 820 °C in single stage heating schedule with 1 second and 10 second holding times, respectively, and 840 °C with two-stage heating schedule (RECOM) (820 °C, 840 °C with 10 second and 7 min holding time, respectively) as recommended by manufacturer (n= 4). CIEL*a*b*, TP, CR, and Lt were measured and calculated for all samples. Statistical analysis: The effects of the test results were evaluated using 3 -way ANOVA with factors for Translucency (<b>HT</b> and <b>LT),</b> Firing Temperature (750, 850, and RECOM) and Thickness (1, 1. 25, 1. 5, 1. 75, and 2), as well as all two-way and three-way interactions among the factors. Pair-wise comparisons were made using Least Significant Differences to control the overall significance level at 5 %. Results: The mean irradiance and TP for both <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> decrease as the thickness of the samples increases from 1 to 2 mm with significant difference between the thickness groups within each material translucency groups (<b>HT</b> and <b>LT)</b> and between both <b>HT</b> and <b>LT.</b> The coefficients of absorption (c) of the two materials were calculated. The effective incidence irradiance when material thickness approaches zero (Ie) was also calculated. There is an unexpected spectral peak shift as the thickness of the samples increases. There is no statistically significant difference in Ie at 750 ˚C and 820 ˚C between the <b>HT</b> and <b>LT.</b> However, there is a statistically significant higher Ie in HT at the recommended firing temperature as expected. Coefficients of translucency parameter (p) of the materials in various firing temperature were defined and the TP of the material as the thickness approaches zero were calculated (TP 0). The TP of the materials is directly correlated to the mean irradiance passing through the samples. There is no statistically significant difference in the TP 0 and Ie of the <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> groups at the recommended firing temperature. Conclusion: In this project we developed modified Beer-Lambert law to describe the parameters governing the effect of thickness on light transmission in dental ceramic material. We also applied the same equation to describe the translucency parameter. The parameters defined in these equations allow us to compare the optical property of dental ceramic material independent of the thickness of the samples. 1 yea...|$|R

Efforts to estimate distribution losses by suitable metering are very limited in our country. Practical experience in one of the distribution companies show that reliability of load survey type energy meters used to record energy input to <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> distribution feeders is poor and the scenario may not be much different in many other distribution companies. Effort is made in this paper to estimate the total energy loss in three types of distribution feeders, namely, urban, industrial and rural with data as collected by utilities to highlight the need for deriving common time duration (data time synchronization) for the collected data at different schedules by different agencies to be used for loss estimation. Simple method is proposed to estimate the energy input to <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> feeders where the meters are not functional. With the estimated energies and time synchronization of data, the estimated total <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> losses are found to be much different and appear reasonable. It is also found that the new method is effective only if the number of defective meters is limited within a certain range. I...|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Scheduling {{is one of the}} most {{important}} resource allocation for networked systems. Conventional scheduling policies are primarily developed under light-tailed (LT) traffic assumptions. However, recent empirical studies show that heavy-tailed (HT) traffic flows have emerged in a variety of networked systems, such as cellular networks, the Internet, and data centers. The highly bursty nature of HT traffic fundamentally challenges the applicability of the conventional scheduling policies. This paper aims to develop novel throughput-optimal scheduling algorithms under hybrid <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> traffic flows, where classic optimal policies (e. g., maximum-weight/backpressure schemes), developed under LT assumption, are not throughput-optimal anymore. To counter this problem, a delay-based maximumweight scheduling policy with the last-in first-out (LIFO) service discipline, namely LIFO-DMWS, is proposed with the proved throughput optimality under hybrid <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> traffic. The throughput optimality of LIFO-DMWS gives that a networked system can support the largest set of incoming traffic flows, while guaranteeing bounded queueing delay to each queue, no matter the queue has <b>HT</b> or <b>LT</b> traffic arrival. Specifically, by exploiting asymptotic queueing analysis, LIFO-DMWS is proved to achieve throughout optimality without requiring any knowledge of traffic statistic information (e. g., the tailness or burstiness of traffic flows). Simulation results validate the derived theories and confirm that LIFO-DMWS achieves bounded delay for all flows under challenging HT environments...|$|R

Eleven men were categorized into two groups having high (HT, N = 6) or low (LT, N = 5) tolerance based on their total time before the onset of presyncopal symptoms. <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> groups were similar in physical characteristics, fitness, and baseline cardiovascular measurements. Atropine treatment had no effect on LBNP tolerance or mean arterial pressure at presyncope, despite an atropine-induced increase in heart rate. Propranolol treatment reduced (p< 0. 05) LBNP tolerance in both groups. Diminished LBNP tolerance after propranolol administration was associated with reductions in cardiac output, whereas increase in systemic peripheral resistance from baseline to presyncope was unaffected by propranolol. Reduction in cardiac output and LBNP tolerance after beta blockade reflected a chronotropic effect because lower LBNP tolerance for the HT (- 50 %) and LT (- 39 %) groups was associated with dramatic reductions (p < 0. 05) in the magnitude of LBNP-induced tachycardia without significant effects on stroke volume at presyncope. Absence of an atropine-induced difference in cardiac output and systemic peripheral resistance between <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> groups failed to support the notion that cardiac vagal withdrawal represents a predominant mechanism that could account for differences in orthostatic tolerance. Because a reduction in LBNP tolerance in both <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> groups after propranolol treatment was most closely associated with reduced tachycardia, the data suggest that a primary autonomically mediated mechanism for maintenance of mean arterial pressure and orthostatic tolerance in healthy subjects is beta adrenergic-induced tachycardia...|$|R

In this work, we evaluated the effects on berry ripening of two thermal regimes, imposed from veraison to harvest. Potted vines were grown in two air-conditioned greenhouses with High Temperature (HT) and Low Temperature (LT) regimes characterized by 26 and 21 °C as average and 42 and 35 °C as maximum air daily temperature, respectively. We conducted analyses of the main berry compositional parameters, berry skin flavonoids and berry skin transcriptome on <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> berries sampled during ripening. The two thermal conditions strongly differentiated the berries. HT regime increased sugar accumulation at the beginning of ripening, but not at harvest, when HT treatment contributed to a slight total acidity reduction and pH increase. Conversely, growing temperatures greatly impacted on anthocyanin and flavonol concentrations, which resulted as strongly reduced, while no effects were found on skin tannins accumulation. Berry transcriptome was analyzed with several approaches in order to identify genes with different expression profile in berries ripened under <b>HT</b> or <b>LT</b> conditions. The analysis of whole transcriptome showed that the main differences emerging from this approach appeared to be more due to a shift in the ripening process, rather than to a strong rearrangement at transcriptional level, revealing that the LT temperature regime could delay berry ripening, at least in the early stages. Moreover, the results of the in-depth screening of genes differentially expressed in <b>HT</b> and <b>LT</b> did not highlight differences in the expression of transcripts involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids (with the exception of PAL and STS) despite the enzymatic activities of PALs and UFGT being significantly higher in <b>LT</b> than <b>HT.</b> This suggests only a partial correlation between molecular and biochemical data in our conditions and the putative existence of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms playing significant roles in the regulation of flavonoid metabolic pathways and in particular of anthocyanins...|$|R

The effect on LH is partly a consequence of a direct, steroid-dependent action on pituitary function. Although androgen action has been well studied in vivo, in vitro cell models of androgen action on pituitary gonadotropes have been scarce. Recently, an LH-expressing <b>cell</b> line, <b>LT</b> 2, was generated by tumori-genesis targeted to the LH-producing cells of the mouse pituitary. The purpose of these studies was to determine the presence of androgen receptor (AR) and establish its function in this cell line. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the <b>LT</b> 2 <b>cell</b> line expresses AR mRNA. Transient transfection assays, using the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, showed that a functional AR is also present.

A spectrophotometer (Lambda 20) was used to measure T% on the wavelength range of 400 – 780 nm. Another spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade® Advance) was used to measure the CIE L*a*b* coordinates and the reflectance value (Y) of samples on white and black backgrounds. TP, CR and the opalescence parameter (OP) were calculated. Data were statistically analysed using VAF (variance accounting for) coefficient with Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's test, Bonferroni correction and Pearson's correlation. ResultsT% of some ceramic systems is dependent on the wavelength. The spectral behaviour showed a slight and constant increase in T% up to approximately 550 nm, then some ceramics changed the behaviour as the wavelength gets longer.

They are spread across Delhi, Haryana (Faridabad), Bihar (Patna, Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Bhagalpur), Jharkhand (Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad), Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut, Agra, Allahabad, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, Moradabad, Aligarh, and Kanpur) and Uttarakhand (Dehradun, Haridwar, Haldwani). Apart from these, the paper is also available in key towns like Mathura, Saharanpur, Faizabad.|$|R
30|$|The {{data used}} {{was based on}} 61 sheep breeds which {{comprises}} the crosses, the Djallonke and the West African Longed Legged (WAD) breeds with eight measured morphological traits namely Height at withers (<b>Ht),</b> Body Length (<b>Lt),</b> Ear Length (EL), Weight (Wt), Chest girth (Chst), Hook Length (HL), Tail Length (TL) and Difference between Hook length and Tail length (HL-TL) which was collected from the College of Science Animal farm at Mampong Ashanti.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effects of ceramic opacity and {{thickness}} on delivered radiant exposure and degree of conversion and microhardness of the light-cured resin cement. Materials and Methods: IPS e-Max ceramic discs (Ivoclar Vivadent) were fabricated in 3 thicknesses (0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 mm) and 4 opacities (<b>HT,</b> <b>LT,</b> MO, HO) (n= 3 /per group). Light-cured resin cement (Variolink Veneer Luting Cement - shade MVO, Ivoclar Vivadent) 50 µm thick was cured through these ceramics disks using a quartz tungsten halogen curing light unit (Optilux 501, Kerr) with its radiant exposure measured by MARC from a fixed distance (1. 5 mm). Knoop microhardness {{was used to evaluate}} the bottom degree of cure and was correlated with the radiant exposure deliverd. Descriptive statistics were conducted. One- and two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD test, Pearson correlation test, the simple linear regression analysis were used for the statistical analyses (alpha= 0. 05). Results: Significant interaction was found between ceramic thickness and opacity on radiant exposure (p= 0. 0078). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that there was a significant simple effect for opacity and for thickness on radiant exposure under different conditions of thickness and opacity. A significant relationship was found between resin cement microhardness and radiant exposure (p= 0. 0001) below 4. 5 J/cm 2. Moreover, the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 93 indicated a strong correlation between the two variables below 4. 5 J/cm 2 of radiant exposure delivered. Conclusion: Ceramic opacity and thickness affect the polymerization of light-cured resin cements and need to be considered and compensated for when bonding indirect restorations. Based upon the findings of this preliminary study, the final study is ongoing...|$|R
40|$|Urea induces {{the release}} of heat-labile {{enterotoxin}} (<b>LT)</b> from <b>cells</b> of LT-producing Escherichia coli strains. Optimal conditions were defined by using the checkerboard immunoblotting system. LT release was highest when E. coli cells were incubated in 8 M urea, pH 8. 0, at 37 degrees C in a water bath for 30 min. Urea was more effective than polymyxin B in inducing {{the release of}} LT antigen from E. coli; the activity of <b>LT</b> from urea-treated <b>cells</b> was seven times that of LT from polymyxin B-treated cells. Urea also increased the antigenic and biological reactivities of purified LT. This procedure is potentially applicable {{for the detection of}} LT-producing E. coli strains in the clinical laboratory...|$|R
