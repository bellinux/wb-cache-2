5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did {{make it into the}} series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E

Henry takes a bite of the turnover, collapses to the floor unconscious, and proves to Emma the curse is real. Emma, who now starts to believe after seeing flashbacks of her true past, is forced to forge an alliance with Regina and retrieves Rumplestiltskin's true love potion from underneath the Clock Tower, only to <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gold steal it leaving Emma halfway up the elevator shaft and Regina tied to a chair and gagged.|$|E
500|$|When Stephen Hillenburg first created Mr. Krabs, his and Pearl's surname was spelled with a C {{rather than}} a K. Thus, the name of Krabs' {{restaurant}} was the [...] "Crusty Crab." [...] Hillenburg changed the name shortly before production began on the show's pilot episode, deciding that K's were funnier and more memorable. The decision to <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production on the first season had started. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives {{as part of his}} pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both of the characters' residence.|$|E

500|$|Two {{day after}} the game, Crusinberry wrote a column in the Chicago Daily Tribune opining that Michigan's offense was the {{culmination}} of the new, less brutish game of football:"The old time player, who did his stuff by brute strength, has given way to the modern man with a head full of tricks[...] [...] [...] And now we <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Yost's new Michigan team, with not a Grange on it, but with one of the brainiest players of the age in Benny Friedman and a lot of smart fellows to work with him.

500|$|Coolbrith's {{difficulties}} in Oakland followed by her trip to Chicago unsettled her friends {{who did not}} wish to see her move away and [...] "become an alien" [...] to California. John Muir had long been in the habit of sending Coolbrith letters, and the occasional box of fruit such as cherries picked from the trees on his Martinez estate, and he made such an offering in late 1894, accompanied by a suggestion for a new career which he thought would keep her in the area—she could fill the position of San Francisco's librarian, recently vacated by John Vance Cheney. Coolbrith sent a response to Muir, thanking him for [...] "the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your brain". After signing the letter [...] "your old-time friend", she added a post-script comment: [...] "No, I cannot <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cheney's place. I am disqualified by sex." [...] San Francisco required that their librarian be a man.|$|E
500|$|With the {{financial}} and critical success of Jaws, Spielberg earned {{a vast amount of}} creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted. Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, [...] "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director. It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." [...] Titled Kingdom Come, the script's protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. [...] " [...] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." [...] Schrader continued. [...] "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." [...] Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg [...] " [...] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Everyday Regular Fella." [...] Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on Jaws. He reflected, [...] "they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Duke of Hamilton was the Patron of Cambuslang and {{he wanted}} to {{nominate}} (or [...] "present") another candidate, one Mr Finlater, when the Reverend Archibald Hamilton, Minister of Cambuslang, died in 1724. The Kirk Session was determined to <b>have</b> <b>Mr</b> William M’Culloch and a struggle lasting eight years only ended when Mr Finlater found a post elsewhere. During the interval, the parish was neglected. On 18 February 1731 Mr M’Culloch received the official call from Cambuslang was ordained by the Presbytery of Hamilton for the Church and Parish of Cambuslang on 29 April. It was at this time that he went in distress to Mr Wodrow of Eastwood and it was perhaps because of his physical and mental state that he did not fulfil his duties immediately. For three years and three months no communion services were held and the schooling was neglected.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the stadium}} {{is owned by}} the City of Toronto, their consent is {{required}} for any modifications. [...] The City insisted that any renovations included making the playing surface longer to fit a CFL field so it could house the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the end of 2017 season. [...] Mark Grimes, Chairman of Exhibition Place's Board, began negotiating with MLSE on the project and said [...] "I think I <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Leiweke's ear in that I am a big CFL fan and that {{we need to get the}} Argos on stable ground."

[...] On February 25 Grimes said that a deal was [...] "getting close" [...] and could be reached [...] "in the next couple weeks". [...] Preliminary plans were released to the public on March 5.|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, Friedman threw two {{touchdown}} passes in a 54–0 victory over Navy. Friedman also kicked five extra {{points in the}} game. Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry wrote: [...] "If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that would make any general envious." [...] Crusinberry later added: [...] "And now we <b>have</b> <b>Mr.</b> Yost's new Michigan team, with not a Grange on it, but {{with one of the}} brainiest players of the age in Benny Friedman and a lot of smart fellows to work with him.

2500|$|When the {{assassination}} of Henry IV gave full rein to the Ultramontane party at court, Duperron became more importunate, even menacing. Casaubon began {{to pay attention to}} overtures from the bishops and the court of England. In October 1610 he came to England in the suite of the ambassador, Lord Wotton of Marley (brother of Casaubon's early friend Henry Wotton), an official invitation having been sent him by Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury. He had the most flattering reception from King James I, who often sent for him to discuss theological matters. The English bishops were delighted to find that the great French scholar was a ready-made Anglican, who had arrived, by independent study of the Fathers, at the very via media (middle way) between Puritanism and Catholicism which was becoming the fashion in the English Church. Casaubon, though a layman, was collated to a prebendal stall in Canterbury, and a pension of £300 a year was assigned him from the exchequer. King James insisted that [...] "I will <b>have</b> <b>Mr</b> Casaubon paid before me, my wife, and my barnes." [...] Casaubon still retained his appointments in France, and his office as librarian: he had obtained leave of absence for the visit to England, where he was not supposed to settle permanently. In order to retain their hold on him, the queen regent, Marie de Medici refused to allow his library to be sent over. It required a specific request from James himself to allow Madame Casaubon to bring him a part of his most necessary books. Casaubon continued to speak of himself as the servant of the regent, and to declare his readiness to return when summoned to do so.|$|E
