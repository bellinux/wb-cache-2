Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, given the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
60|$|A still {{stronger}} {{argument against}} ascribing an objective existence to force or power, {{on the strength}} of our supposed direct intuition of power in voluntary acts, may be urged from the unquestionable <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know, and cannot know, that volition does cause corporeal motion; while {{there is a great deal}} to be said in favour of the view that it is no cause, but merely a concomitant of that motion.

[...] So do all the comrades in America, and all the 7,000,000 comrades in the world.

[...] Here again our ignorance is employed to play the part of knowledge. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know distinctly how an alleged transition has taken place, is transformed into the assumption that no transition has taken place.

And, this is no more than what we do every day in the works of nature, upon the credit of men of learning. Without faith we can do no works acceptable to God; for, if they proceed from any other principle, they will not advance our salvation; and this faith, as I have explained it, we may acquire without giving up our senses, or contradicting our reason. May God of his infinite mercy inspire us with true faith in every article and mystery of our holy religion, so as to dispose us to do what is pleasing in his sight; and this we pray through Jesus Christ, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, the mysterious, incomprehensible ONE GOD, be all honour and glory now and for evermore!

60|$|But the {{important}} matter was this, that it entirely reversed {{the reason for}} optimism. And the instant the reversal was made {{it felt like the}} abrupt ease when a bone is put back in the socket. I had often called myself an optimist, to avoid the too evident blasphemy of pessimism. But all the optimism of the age had been false and disheartening for this reason, that it had always been trying to prove that we fit in to the world. The Christian optimism is based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> NOT fit in to the world. I had tried to be happy by telling myself that man is an animal, like any other which sought its meat from God. But now I really was happy, for I had learnt that man is a monstrosity. I had been right in feeling all things as odd, for I myself was at once worse and better than all things. The optimist's pleasure was prosaic, for it dwelt on the naturalness of everything; the Christian pleasure was poetic, for it dwelt on the unnaturalness of everything {{in the light of the}} supernatural. The modern philosopher had told me again and again that I was in the right place, and I had still felt depressed even in acquiescence. But I had heard that I was in the WRONG place, and my soul sang for joy, like a bird in spring. The knowledge found out and illuminated forgotten chambers in the dark house of infancy. I knew now why grass had always seemed to me as queer as the green beard of a giant, and why I could feel homesick at home.|$|E

The only token he immediately gave was to get up and approach Mitchy, before whom he stood a minute laughing kindly enough, though not altogether gaily. As if then for a better proof of gaiety he presently seized him by the shoulders and, still without speaking, pushed him backward into the chair he himself had just quitted. Mrs. Brook's eyes, from the sofa, while this went on, attached themselves to her visitors. It took Vanderbank, as he moved about and his companions waited, a minute longer to produce what he had in mind. [...] "What IS splendid, as we call it, is this extraordinary freedom and good humour of our intercourse and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> care--so independently of our personal interests, with so little selfishness or other vulgarity--to get at the idea of things. The beautiful specimen Mrs. Brook had just given me of that," [...] he continued to Mitchy, [...] "was what made me break out to you about her when you came in." [...] He spoke to one friend, but he looked at the other. [...] "What's really 'superior' in her is that, though I suddenly show her an interference with a favourite plan, her personal resentment's nothing--all she wants is to see what may really happen, to take in the truth of the case and make the best of that. She offers me the truth, as she sees it, about myself, and with no nasty elation if it does chance to be the truth that suits her best. It was a charming, charming stroke." ...|$|E

6000|$|Exactly in {{the same}} way the ruder or more {{sluggish}} races regard the civilisation of Christendom. If they have any respect for it, it is precisely because it does not use their own coarse and cruel expedients. According to some modern moralists whenever Zulus cut off the heads of dead Englishmen, Englishmen must cut off the heads of dead Zulus. Whenever Arabs or Egyptians constantly use the whip to their slaves, Englishmen must use the whip to their subjects. And on a similar principle (I suppose), whenever an English Admiral has to fight cannibals the English Admiral ought to eat them. However unattractive a menu consisting entirely of barbaric kings may appear to an English gentleman, he must try to sit down to it with an appetite. He must fight the Sandwich Islanders with their own weapons; and their own weapons are knives and forks. But {{the truth of the matter}} is, of course, that to do this kind of thing is to break the whole spell of our supremacy. All the mystery of the white man, all the fearful poetry of the white man, so far as it exists in the eyes of these savages, consists in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not do such things. The Zulus point at us and say, [...] "Observe the advent of these inexplicable demi-gods, these magicians, who do not cut off the noses of their enemies." [...] The Soudanese say to each other, [...] "This hardy people never flogs its servants; it is superior to the simplest and most obvious human pleasures."

6000|$|Now if we {{dip into}} this {{miscellany}} {{of things that}} figure and have figured in schools, if we turn them over and look at them, and seek to generalize about them, we shall begin {{to see that the}} most persistently present, and the living reality of it all, is this: to expand, to add to and organize and supplement that apparatus of understanding and expression the savage possesses in colloquial speech. The pressing business of the school is to widen the range of intercourse. [Footnote: This way of putting it may jar a little upon the more or less explicit preconceptions of many readers, who are in reality in harmony with the tone of thought of this paper. They will have decided that the school work is to [...] "train the mind," [...] to [...] "teach the pupil to think," [...] or upon some similar phrase. But I venture to think that most of these phrases are at once too wide and too narrow. They are too wide because they ignore the spontaneous activity of the child and the extra-scholastic forces of mind-training, and they are too narrow because they ignore the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not progress far with our thoughts unless we throw them out into objective existence by means of words, diagrams, models, trial essays. Even if we do not talk to others we must, silently or vocally or visibly, talk to ourselves at least to get on. To acquire the means of intercourse is to learn to think, so far as learning goes in the matter.] It is only secondarily--so far as schooling goes--or, at any rate, subsequently, that the idea of shaping, or, at least, helping to shape, the expanded natural man into a citizen, comes in. It is only as a subordinate necessity that the school is a vehicle for the inculcation of facts. The facts come into the school not for their own sake, but in relation to intercourse. It is only upon a common foundation of general knowledge that the initiated citizens of an educated community will be able to communicate freely together. With the net of this phrase, [...] "widening the range of intercourse," [...] I think it is possible to gather together all that is essential in the deliberate purpose of schooling. Nothing that remains outside is of sufficient magnitude to be of any importance in the small-scale sketch of human development we are now making:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Nothing,” says Goethe, “is more {{significant}} of men’s character {{than what they}} find laughable.” The truth of this observation would perhaps have been more apparent if he had said culture instead of character. The last thing in which the cultivated man can have community with the vulgar is their jocularity; and we can hardly exhibit more strikingly the wide gulf which separates him from them, than by comparing the object which shakes the diaphragm of a coal-heaver with the highly complex pleasure derived from a real witticism. That any high order of wit is exceedingly complex, and demands a ripe and strong mental development, has one evidence in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not find it in boys at all in proportion to their manifestation of other powers. Clever boys generally aspire to the heroic and poetic rather than the comic, and the crudest of all their efforts are their jokes. Many a witty man will remember how in his school days a practical joke, more or less Rabelaisian, was for him the ne plus ultra of the ludicrous. It {{seems to have been}} the same with the boyhood of the human race. The history and literature of the ancient Hebrews gives the idea of a people who went about their business and their pleasure as gravely as a society of beavers; the smile and the laugh are often mentioned metaphorically, but the smile is one of complacency, the laugh is one of scorn. Nor can we imagine that the facetious element was very strong in the Egyptians; no laughter lurks in the wondering eyes and the broad calm lips of their statues. Still less can the Assyrians have had any genius for the comic: the round eyes and simpering satisfaction of their ideal faces belong to a type which is not witty, but the cause of wit in others. The fun of these early races was, we fancy, of the after-dinner kind—loud-throated laughter over the wine-cup, taken too little account of in sober moments to enter as an element into their Art, and differing as much from the laughter of a Chamfort or a Sheridan as the gastronomic enjoyment of an ancient Briton, whose dinner had no other “removes” than from acorns to beech-mast and back again to acorns, differed from the subtle pleasures of the palate experienced by his turtle-eating descendant. In fact they had to live seriously through the stages which to subsequent races were to become comedy, as those amiable-looking preadamite amphibia which Professor Owen has restored for us in effigy at Sydenham, took perfectly au sérieux the grotesque physiognomies of their kindred. Heavy experience in their case, as in every other, was the base from which the salt of future wit was to be made.|$|E

[1996]), the majority of births took place {{at home with the}} help of a traditional birth attendant and it was therefore impossible to record birth weight for our study sample. Birth weight deviating from the normal is known to affect early child growth rates, representing catch-up or catch-down growth (WHO [2009]). Births were almost evenly distributed throughout the year in our study, so varying growth rates in early childhood are not expected to change the relationship between season and growth velocities to a substantial extent.|$|R
