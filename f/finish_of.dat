5|$|Britain entered three skiers, {{two men and}} one woman, {{into the}} Games. Russell Docker, {{one of only two}} athletes to have competed for Britain at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, {{appeared}} in his second Games, this time in sitting events having switched to the use of a monoski. Sean Rose, also a sit-skier, and Liz Miller, a standing skier who uses a prosthetic leg, were the other British participants. The three athletes were members of the British Adaptive Ski Team, which is run by national ski charity Disability Snowsport UK. Each of the three skiers raced in four events in their respective categories; downhill, giant slalom, slalom and Super-G. Rose had the highest <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> the three; he placed sixth in the men's sitting downhill, 0.7 seconds outside of the medal positions. Russell Docker crashed in the same event and did not finish. Docker also failed to finish in the slalom, as did Rose in the giant slalom. Miller completed the course in each of her events with a best <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> tenth in the downhill.|$|E

5|$|Once the 1976 Formula One World Championship season {{got under}} way Pryce {{instantly}} added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in Brazil. This came {{at the expense of}} continuing team mate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt's McLaren. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at Kyalami and Long Beach. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their airboxes and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised Goodyear tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B lost much of its competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> the season in Britain. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at Zandvoort, where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring <b>finish</b> <b>of</b> his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.|$|E
