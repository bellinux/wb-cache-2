5|$|Hormones: {{hypoparathyroidism}} (failure of the parathyroid glands {{leading to}} low calcium levels), <b>infertility,</b> and habitual abortion.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd and Meredith {{had decided}} to adopt, due to Meredith's <b>infertility,</b> which was {{diagnosed}} in season seven.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{situations}} {{arise in}} deficiencies of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; <b>infertility</b> in hypopituitarism may {{be treated with}} subcutaneous infusions of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin–which mimics the action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, she {{revealed}} her {{struggles with}} endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, {{which led to}} <b>infertility.</b> King suffered five miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy prior to her first successful pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>infertility</b> affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek {{assisted}} reproductive technology (ART) for <b>infertility.</b> In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|Childfree couples {{choose to}} not have {{children}}. These include: young couples, who plan to have children later, {{as well as those}} who do not plan to have any children. Involuntary childlessness may be caused by <b>infertility,</b> medical problems, death of a child, or other factors.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent <b>infertility</b> in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans {{experience}} {{their first}} ovulatory cycle around 5.8–11.1years. These occur earlier in females with more body fat. Like other great apes, female orangutans enter {{a period of}} <b>infertility</b> during adolescence which may last for 1–4years. Female orangutans also have a 22– to 30-day menstrual cycle. Gestation lasts for 9 months, with females giving birth to their first offspring {{between the ages of}} 14 and 15years.|$|E
5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates the figure with fertility. In the past locals would erect a maypole on the earthwork, around which childless couples would dance to promote fertility. According to folk belief, a woman who sleeps on the figure will be blessed with fecundity, and <b>infertility</b> may be cured through sexual intercourse {{on top of the}} figure, especially the phallus.|$|E
5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, <b>infertility,</b> ectopic pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Without medical intervention, {{the male}} {{fertility}} rate after SCI is 5–14%, but the rate increases with treatments. Even with all available medical interventions, {{fewer than half}} of men with SCI can father children. Assisted insemination is usually required. As with erection, therapies used to treat <b>infertility</b> in uninjured men are used for those with SCI.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and <b>infertility.</b> While {{the procedure is}} inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and could cause impotence and <b>infertility</b> in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is most prevalent in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region, where {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, <b>infertility,</b> low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men is a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film {{directed}} and co-written by Alfonso Cuarón. The screenplay, based on P. D. James' 1992 {{novel of the}} same name, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human <b>infertility</b> have left society {{on the brink of}} collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and <b>infertility.</b> Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible <b>infertility</b> and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} <b>infertility</b> in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, <b>infertility</b> and decreased libido.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including <b>infertility,</b> ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Century Falls {{is driven}} by a legend that no {{children}} {{had been born in}} the eponymous village for more than forty years. The lead protagonist, Tess Hunter (Catherine Sanderson), is an overweight teenager who moves to the village with her mother {{at the beginning of the}} serial. She quickly befriends the psychic Ben Naismith (Simon Fenton) and his twin sister Carey (Emma Jane Lavin). The three teenagers examine the waterfall that gave Ben his powers and the disaster that caused the legendary <b>infertility.</b> The serial climaxes in a confrontation between Tess and the deity Century, who is attempting to fuse with Tess's unborn sister.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her <b>infertility</b> was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he always seems to be watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his <b>infertility</b> to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, <b>infertility,</b> and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her <b>infertility.</b> Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for <b>infertility.</b> Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{had written}} to the Glidden Company, a {{supplier}} of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his {{starting point for the}} synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from <b>infertility).</b> After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Shawn and Gus {{are locked}} in the library and it is lit on fire, but they are rescued by Father Peter Westley (Ray Wise). Bob, who is {{revealed}} to be Paula's biological father, explains that after World War I, his great-grandfather established the town with two other soldiers, intending to create a secluded utopia. After the sawmill fire in 1958, the town began {{to look at all}} outsiders as a threat. When Doc Gooden and Sheriff Jackson enter and hold him at gunpoint, Shawn deduces that they are the leaders of the other two founding families. Due to Gooden's <b>infertility</b> and Jackson's terminal cancer, Randy was the only known direct descendant and therefore the sole future leader. To stop Randy from leaving town with a paranoid Paula, the sheriff and doctor drowned her. After Lassiter and O'Hara arrive and arrest Gooden and Jackson, the group celebrates at the diner, only to be repulsed by a number of oddities referencing Twin Peaks.|$|E
5|$|The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, {{compiled}} in the 9th century, mentions cubeb as {{a remedy}} for <b>infertility,</b> showing it was already used by Arabs for medicinal purposes. Cubeb was introduced to Arabic cuisine around the 10th century. The Travels of Marco Polo, written in late 13th century, describes Java as a producer of cubeb, along with other valuable spices. In the 14th century, cubeb was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast, {{under the name of}} pepper, by merchants of Rouen and Lippe. A 14th-century morality tale exemplifying gluttony by the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis describes the eating habits of a worldly cleric who consumes a bizarre concoction of egg yolks with cinnamon and cubeb after his baths, probably as an aphrodisiac.|$|E
5|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterial}} disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{the only place}} in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes <b>infertility,</b> abortions and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as undulant fever, producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), <b>infertility,</b> and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum <b>infertility</b> which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes <b>infertility</b> in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and <b>infertility</b> when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, <b>infertility</b> has {{profound}} {{effects on}} individuals in developing countries, as {{the production of}} children is often highly socially valued and is vital for social security and health networks {{as well as for}} family income generation. <b>Infertility</b> in these societies often leads to social stigmatization and abandonment by spouses. <b>Infertility</b> is, in fact, common in sub-Saharan Africa. Unlike in the West, secondary <b>infertility</b> is more common than primary <b>infertility,</b> being most often the result of untreated STIs or complications from pregnancy/birth.|$|E
25|$|However, {{salpingitis}} {{can also}} lead to <b>infertility</b> because the eggs released in ovulation can't get contact with the sperm. Approximately 75,000-225,000 cases of <b>infertility</b> in the US are caused by salpingitis. The more times one has the infection, the greater the risk of <b>infertility.</b> With one episode of salpingitis, the risk of <b>infertility</b> is 8-17%. With 3 episodes of salpingitis, the risk is 40-60%, although the exact risk depends on the severity of each episode.|$|E
