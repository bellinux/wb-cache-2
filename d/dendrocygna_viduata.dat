40|$|A bumblefoot {{outbreak}} {{with different}} prognosis according to host species was studied in captive aquatic avian species. Six wood ducks (Aix sponsa), three scarlet-ibis (Eudocimus ruber), two black-swans (Cygnus atratus), five white-faced ducks (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>viduata)</b> and two roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja) {{were kept in}} a common pen with abrasive pavement pond margin, predisposing to podal skin wear. Incoordination and mortality occurred in the two roseate spoonbils and one black swan. Coagulase-positive penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the synovial fluid and from the liver. All birds sharing the pen presented active or cicatricial foot lesions, indicating a possible challenge to the environmental Staphylococci. However, except for the roseate spoonbill and the black swan, which had fatal disease, for all other species the case did not evolve to a clinically debilitating or fatal disease. The different susceptibility to a fatal Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive infection is discussed. Este trabalho relata um surto de esparavão em aves aquáticas cativas com prognóstico variado conforme a espécie de ave. Foram examinados um marreco carolina (Aix sponsa), três guarás (íbis vermelha) (Eudocimus ruber), dois cisnes negros (Cygnus atratus), cinco marrecas piadeiras (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>viduata)</b> e dois colhereiros (Platalea ajaja) mantidos em recinto comunitário, em cativeiro e em criatório. No recinto, a piscina é margeada por borda de cimento abrasivo que possibilita a abrasão da pele podal. Todas as aves apresentaram erosões da pele na face de apoio dos pés, indicando fator predisponente (erosão) similar e possível semelhante desafio infeccioso. Entretanto, incoordenação e mortalidade ocorreram em colhereiros e no cisne negro, mas não nas outras espécies. Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positivo e resistente à penicilina foi isolado do líquido sinovial e do fígado das aves recém-mortas e conservadas em geladeira. A susceptibilidade diferenciada das espécies aquáticas estudadas à infecção por S. aureus coagulase positivo é discutida...|$|E

40|$|The {{natural areas}} of the south of Benin under subequatorial climate are diversified in {{resident}} birds’ species as well as migratory one. Some of them are hunted for food and therapeutic purposes by grassroots communities. The most used are Guttera pucherani, <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>viduata,</b> Egretta alba, Egretta ardesiaca, Porphyrio alleni et Porphyrio porphyrio. In order to reduce pressure on biodiversity {{in this part of}} Benin and to implement the sustainable conservation of birds’ species, this study on ecology and ethno-zoological knowledge of hunted bird species was carried out in the forest areas and the Ramsar sites 1017 and 1018. Field prospections were conducted from 2009 to 2012. The birds’ inventory method used was based on listening point techniques of 15 minutes. Data analysis were analyzed through the computation of bird species abundances, the establishment of maps distribution of the species, the habitat description and the modeling of the climatic niche of these species under climatic models CCCMA (Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis) and CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) using MAXENT 3. 3. 2. The ethno-zoological knowledge of the birds species were assessed through individual and groups survey and allowed to calculate the use values of the different part of the birds’ species according to the socio-cultural groups, sex and age. Moreover a logistic binary regression was carried out to determine the socio-economic factors which affect bird species exploitation by the grassroots communities. Results of modeling showed that among the variables selected for the prediction of the climatic models, distance from river, altitude appeared as the environmental variable which more contributed to the prediction of the models (with an average of 74. 32 % and 12. 94 %). Projection under CCCMA and CSIRO in 2050, showed a progression of the favorable areas to <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>viduata,</b> Porphyrio alleni, Porphyrio alleni, Egretta ardesiaca while it showed a regression of the favorable areas to Egretta alba. The estimated uses values showed that the ethno-zoological knowledge on the bird species differed according to the ethnic groups. Birds are used for food, medicinal and magico-mystics purposes. The magico-mystics and food were the most frequent used categories. Homogeneity of knowledge was found among the informants regarding the ethnic group {{as well as for the}} sex with respectively 0. 66 and 0. 7 for the use diversity value (ID) and use equitability value (IE). No significant difference was found between the informant for the use diversity value (ID) and use equitability value (IE). This study helps to build a database on 6 birds’ species and can be used for bird game ranching and game farming in Benin...|$|E
40|$|Many white-faced {{whistling}} ducks (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>viduata)</b> {{have responded}} to European colonization by overwintering on irrigation and stock-watering ponds in the semi-arid interior of South Africa. I studied the body condition, diet, behaviour and moult intensity of whitefaced whistling ducks prior to departure for breeding areas during spring 1995. Other than higher protein levels in immature males than immature females, there were no sexual differences in body mass or levels of lipid, protein, or ash in adults or immatures. Adults were heavier than immatures and had higher levels of ash. There were no sex- or age-related differences {{in the proportion of}} individual food items consumed, 96. 6 % of which was maize. By foraging on neighbouring agricultural fields, birds were able to spend large portions (80 %) of the day/night in comfort-related activities (preen, loaf, sleep) and little time foraging (8. 8 %) while on ponds. There were no sex- or age-related differences in overall moult intensity score or intensity of moult in 20 feather areas. With exception of primaries and secondaries, birds were moulting moderately to heavily in all feather regions. Agricultural ponds permit whitefaced whistling ducks to overwinter close to breeding areas, while the high availability and energy content of maize enables them to attain higher spring fat levels than birds that overwinter on traditional sites closer to the coast. Intensive agriculture has probably contributed to the population increase and range expansion of white-faced whistling ducks in South Africa. </span...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{availability}} for Afrotropical waterbirds {{is highly}} dynamic with unpredictable rainfall patterns and ephemeral wetlands resulting in diverse movement strategies among different species. Movement strategies among waterfowl encompass resident, regional and intercontinental migrants, but little quantitative information exists on their specific movement patterns. We studied the movement ecology of five Afrotropical waterfowl species marked with satellite transmitters in Malawi, Mali and Nigeria. Resident species, including White-faced Whistling Ducks <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>viduata,</b> Fulvous Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna bicolor and Spur-winged Geese Plectropterus gambensis, remained sedentary {{during the rainy}} season and only flew limited distances during other months. In contrast, Knob-billed Ducks Sarkidiornis melanotos made short regional movements ? 50 km in all months and showed little site fidelity to previously used habitats in subsequent years. Garganey Anas quequedula followed an intercontinental strategy and made long-distance jumps across the Sahara and Mediterranean to their Eurasian breeding grounds. Most species flew farthest during the dry season, as mean daily movements varied from 1. 5 to 14. 2 km and was greatest in the winter months (January-March). Total distance moved varied from 9. 5 km for White-faced Whistling Ducks (October-December) to 45. 6 km for Knob-billed Ducks (April-June). Nomadic behaviour by Knob-billed Ducks was evidenced by long exploratory flights, but small mean daily movements suggested that they were relying on previous experience. Improving our understanding of these movement strategies increases our ability to assess connectivity of wetland resources that support waterfowl throughout their annual cycle and focuses conservation efforts on their most important habitats.
