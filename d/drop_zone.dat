5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 6June1944, Albermarle {{aircraft}} arrived, carrying the brigade's pathfinders, a company from the 1st Canadian Battalion {{to clear the}} <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> (DZ) of obstructions, a group from each battalion, and brigade headquarters. Some planes got lost and failed to reach the DZ or arrived late. Others were damaged before dropping all their paratroops and turned back, and one returned to base after failing to find the <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade Headquarters and {{the field}} {{ambulance}} main dressing station were established {{to the south of}} the bridge, where the brigade's casualties started arriving for treatment. Away from the main dressing station, the medics on the 2nd Battalion <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> had 29 wounded {{as a result of the}} parachute drop, and there were 15 wounded on <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> one from the 1st Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E

5|$|The 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, {{under the}} command of Colonel Edson Raff, was the lead assault {{formation}} for the 17th Airborne Division, and was consequently the first U.S. airborne unit to land as part of Operation Varsity. The entire regiment was meant to be dropped in <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> W, a clearing two miles north of Wesel; however, excessive ground haze confused the pilots of the transport aircraft carrying the 507th, and as such when the regiment dropped it split into two halves. Colonel Raff and approximately 690 of his paratroopers landed north-west of the <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> near the town of Diersfordt, {{with the rest of the}} regiment successfully landing in <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> W. The colonel rallied his separated paratroopers and led them to the <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> engaging a battery of German artillery en route, killing or capturing the artillery crews before reuniting with the rest of the regiment. By 14:00 the 507th PIR had secured all of its objectives and cleared the area around Diersfordt, having engaged numerous German troops and destroying a German tank. The actions of the regiment during the initial landing also gained the division its second Medal of Honor, when Private George J. Peters posthumously received the award after charging a German machine gun nest and eliminating it with rifle fire and grenades, allowing his fellow paratroopers to gather their equipment and capture the regiments first objective.|$|E
5|$|The {{airborne}} forces made several mistakes, most notably when pilot error caused paratroopers from the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a regiment of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, to miss their <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> and {{land on a}} British <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> instead. However, the operation was a success, with both divisions capturing Rhine bridges and securing towns {{that could have been}} used by Germany to delay the advance of the British ground forces. The two divisions incurred more than 2,000 casualties, but captured about 3,500 German soldiers. The operation was the last large-scale Allied airborne operation of World War II.|$|E

5|$|The divisional {{training}} exercise {{took place}} around Camp Mackall, North Carolina, and {{suffered from a}} number of difficulties and problems. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the exercise until the night of 25 September, and it was only then that the aircraft carrying the first three battalions of paratroopers could take off and attempt to drop the airborne troops on three separate drop zones. A combination of poor visibility, and a lack of sufficient training for the pilots of the transport aircraft, resulted in the paratroopers being dispersed widely when dropped. Only sixty-five percent of the airborne troops and equipment dropped on the first <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> were ready for action ninety minutes later, and in the second <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> the airborne troops were so scattered that by 10:00 the next morning the commander of the battalion only had control over twenty percent of his men. A similar number of paratroopers missed the third <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> although the majority were dropped in a relatively small area where they could gather. Further problems were encountered, as a plane crash killed eight paratroopers and four aircrew, and the glider-borne elements of the division due to land were delayed by poor weather. After the initial night, the exercise continued for a further three days and included a complex supply mission designed to test whether it was possible to supply an isolated battalion of airborne troops.|$|E
5|$|By 22:15 {{the brigade}} had secured {{all of its}} day one {{objectives}} {{and some of the}} missing men had arrived in the brigade area. However, there were many still unaccounted for. The 4th Parachute Battalion numbered around 200 men with almost no heavy weapons. The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion had 317 men. There were only enough men of the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion to guard the approach roads leading to the <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> from the north.|$|E
5|$|Most of the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion {{landed in}} several groups, some {{distance}} from their <b>drop</b> <b>zone.</b> One large group comprised the commanding officer, most of the battalion headquarters and 'C' Company. A second group was formed by 'D' Company. Twenty-one men, including the battalion intelligence officer, formed a third smaller group. The first group divided into three smaller units, all of which arrived at brigade headquarters by 22:30 on the same day.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} the brigades' {{scattered}} landing was that several small groups of men caused havoc among the Germans, ambushing men and vehicles. One lone sergeant arrived at brigade headquarters with eighty prisoners, having convinced {{them that they were}} surrounded and should surrender. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion's 'B' Company, which had landed on the correct <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> ambushed a convoy of five trucks, killing twelve Germans, then assaulted a château, killing another thirty men before the surviving fifty surrendered.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|The next British {{airborne}} unit to {{land was}} the 5th Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Nigel Poett. The brigade was designated {{to land on}} drop zoneB and achieved this, although not as accurately as 3rd Parachute Brigade due to poor visibility around the <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> which also {{made it more difficult}} for paratroopers of the brigade to rally. The <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> came under heavy fire from German troops stationed nearby, and was subjected to shellfire and mortaring which inflicted casualties in the battalion rendezvous areas. However, the 7th Parachute Battalion soon cleared the DZ of German troops, many of whom were situated in farms and houses, and the 12th Parachute Battalion and 13th Parachute Battalion rapidly secured the rest of the brigade's objectives. The brigade was then ordered to move due east and clear an area near Schnappenberg, as well as to engage German forces gathered {{to the west of the}} farmhouse where the 6th Airborne Division Headquarters was established. By 15:30 Brigadier Poett reported that the brigade had secured all of its objectives and linked up with other British airborne units.|$|E

25|$|The Germans, who had {{neglected}} to fortify Normandy, began constructing defenses and obstacles against airborne assault in the Cotentin, including specifically the planned <b>drop</b> <b>zones</b> of the 82nd Airborne Division. At first {{no change in}} plans were made, but when significant German forces were moved into the Cotentin in mid-May, the <b>drop</b> <b>zones</b> of the 82nd Airborne Division were relocated, even though detailed plans had already been formulated and training had proceeded based on them.|$|R
5|$|The {{second wave}} of {{parachute}} troops were dropped in two groups {{to the west of}} the cemetery at about midday. The <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> was within fields of fire of the Partisans to the west of Drvar, and they suffered many casualties during the drop. Collecting the remainder, Rybka mounted a second attack, but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy, and the assault again failed. Fighting continued throughout the afternoon with both sides taking heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Those {{men of the}} 1st Parachute Brigade {{that landed}} on the {{southern}} <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> were well within range of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion. In the darkness, the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing, but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire. Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> and about 100of them became prisoners of war {{as soon as they}} had touched ground. In the confusion of the landing, 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled, assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges. The Italians were taken prisoner, just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by Brigadier Lathbury arrived at the bridge. Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter. More paratroopers continued to gather at the bridge, and soon they numbered around 120men, who dug in to the north and south.|$|E
5|$|Troops of the 82nd Airborne began {{arriving}} around 02:30, {{with the primary}} objective of capturing two bridges over the River Merderet and destroying two bridges over the Douve. On {{the east side of}} the river, 75 per cent of the paratroopers landed in or near their <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> and within two hours they captured the important crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église (the first town liberated in the invasion) and began working to protect the western flank. Because of the failure of the pathfinders to accurately mark their <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> the two regiments dropped on the west side of the Merderet were extremely scattered, with only four per cent landing in the target area. Many landed in nearby swamps, with much loss of life. Paratroopers consolidated into small groups, usually a combination of men of various ranks from different units, and attempted to concentrate on nearby objectives. They captured but failed to hold the Merderet River bridge at La Fière, and fighting for the crossing continued for several days.|$|E

5|$|The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was {{the second}} American {{airborne}} unit to land after the 507th, {{under the command of}} Colonel James Coutts. En route to the <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> the transport aircraft carrying the 513th had the misfortune to pass through a belt of German antiaircraft weapons, losing 22 of the C-46 transport aircraft and damaging a further 38. Just as the 507th had, the 513th also suffered from pilot error due to the ground haze, and as such the regiment actually missed its designated <b>drop</b> <b>zone,</b> DZX, and was dropped on one of the landing zones designated for the British 6th Airlanding Brigade. Despite this inaccuracy the paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided the British glider-borne troops who were landing simultaneously, eliminating several German artillery batteries that were covering the area. Once the German troops in the area had been eliminated, a combined force of American and British airborne troops stormed Hamminkeln and secured the town. By 2pm, Colonel Coutts reported to Divisional Headquarters that the 513th Parachute Infantry had secured all of its objectives, having knocked out two tanks and two complete regiments of artillery during their assault. During its attempts to secure its objectives, the regiment also gained a third Medal of Honor for the 17th Airborne Division when Private First Class Stuart Stryker posthumously received the award after leading a charge against a German machine-gun nest, creating a distraction to allow the rest of his platoon to capture the fortified position in which the machine-gun was situated.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crossed the}} English Channel without incident, {{but as they}} reached the French coast they came under heavy anti-aircraft fire; however, none of them were hit, and they successfully delivered C Company to the designated <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> near the installation.

Once the other detachments had gathered their equipment and orientated themselves, they moved off to undertake their arranged tasks.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST {{that had not been}} completely unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a <b>drop</b> <b>zone</b> in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to define the casualty rates and anatomical distribution of injuries associated with military static line parachute (MSLP) descents conducted by an Australian Army Commando Battalion. This study was conducted to identify the strategies to reduce the injury burden related to MSLP activities. METHOD: A retrospective audit of injuries resulting from MSLP descents conducted by 4 th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (4 RAR) over a 13 -month period. RESULTS: A total of 554 MSLP descents over the time period were reviewed. The overall casualty rate was 5. 1 %. For MSLP descents onto land <b>drop</b> <b>zones,</b> the incidence of injury requiring hospital admission was 2. 6 %. Paratrooper bodyweight was associated with increased risk of injury (P = 0. 04) and hospital admission (P = 0. 003), particularly when conducting descents onto land <b>drop</b> <b>zones.</b> MSLP descents conducted onto land were associated with a higher incidence of casualties when compared with those conducted into water <b>drop</b> <b>zones</b> (P = 0. 001). CONCLUSION: During the period from February 2004 until February 2005, 4 RAR (Commando) experienced higher casualty rates during MSLP descents than expected when compared with the published report. Strategies to decrease the casualty rate of MSLP descents onto land <b>drop</b> <b>zones</b> may include more extensive ground training, increased frequency of MSLP descents, use of ankle braces and the development of purpose built <b>drop</b> <b>zones.</b> Consideration should be given to establishing a maximum bodyweight threshold for the conduct of MSLP activities or acquiring parachutes with decreased descent velocity for larger paratroopers.
