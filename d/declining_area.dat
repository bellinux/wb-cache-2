60|$|Having {{spoken of}} the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend into the VALES. Though {{these have been}} {{represented}} under the general image of the spokes of a wheel, they are, for the most part, winding; the windings of many being abrupt and intricate. And, it may be observed, that, in one circumstance, the general shape of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated Welsh vallies, by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other, leaving little more between than a channel for {{the passage of a}} hasty river; but the bottom of these vallies is mostly a spacious and gently <b>declining</b> <b>area,</b> apparently level as the floor of a temple, or the surface of a lake, and broken in many cases, by rocks and hills, which rise up like islands from the plain. In such of the vallies as make many windings, these level areas open upon the traveller in succession, divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills, leaving only passage for a river, sometimes by correspondent windings, without such approximation; and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain towards that which is opposite it. It may here be observed with propriety that the several rocks and hills, which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale, have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings. Where none of these are found, and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters, (as in the higher part of Langdale, for instance,) the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the vales, but confined to their sides, being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods. But where these rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale, (as in Grasmere, Donnerdale, Eskdale, &c.) the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage, or cluster of cottages, that will be almost always found under them, or upon their sides; dryness and shelter having tempted the Dalesmen to fix their habitations there.|$|E

40|$|Trends in Rio Grande {{wild turkey}} (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) {{abundance}} on the Edwards Plateau (EP), Texas, have been either stable or in decline since the 1970 s. Four study areas, 2 each within stable (Stable Area A, SAA; Stable Area B, SAB) and declining regions (<b>Declining</b> <b>Area</b> A, DAA; <b>Declining</b> <b>Area</b> B, DAB), were delineated to examine (1) both annual and seasonal survival, (2) relative mammalian predator mean abundance (RMA), and (3) potential effects of lunar phase on scent-station visitation. During February 2001 -March 2003, 257 turkeys were captured and instrumented with radio transmitters. Survival probabilities were generated using a Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator; a log-rank test tested for differences among sites. Annual survival was statistically different between regions (stable 0. 566 ? 0. 081; declining 0. 737 ? 0. 094; X 2 = 3. 68, P = 0. 055) in 2002. Seasonal survival differed between regions (stable 0. 812 ? 0. 103; declining 0. 718 ? 0. 130; X 2 = 3. 88, P = 0. 049) in spring 2003. Annual survival results during 2002 were counterintuitive with turkey trend data. Scent-station transects were established on non-paved ranch roads within study regions. Scent-station indices revealed higher (H = 19. 653, P ? 0. 001) RMA of opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and skunk (eastern spotted [Spilogale putorius], striped [Mephitis mephitis], or western spotted [S. gracilis]) (SAA, x? = 0. 0148; SAB, x? = 0. 0151; DAA, x? = 0. 0042; DAB, x? = 0. 0065) on stable areas. Higher RMA of coyotes (Canis latrans) on declining areas (SAA, x? = 0. 0067; SAB, x? = 0. 0022; DAA x? = 0. 0234; DAB x? = 0. 0434) suggested a possible causative factor of the decline, but abundance indices were not verified by empirical data though.

40|$|As {{soil erosion}} {{has become a}} serious threat to {{agriculture}} in China, the "Grain-for-Green" project was initiated in western and central China with the goal of reducing soil erosion and improving vegetation conditions. Eastern China was not included in this project, although soil erosion is a serious problem in areas with rapid urban expansion. This study analysed the effects of urbanization on cropping system changes, soil erosion, and farmland net primary production (NPP) in Shandong Peninsula using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA). The results show that parts of the mountainous regions in eastern Shandong Peninsula experience severe/heavy soil erosion. The percentage of cropland experiencing high, very high, and severe soil erosion decreased by 46. 1 %, 60. 3 %, and 33. 3 %, respectively, from 2000 to 2010. Although the mean annual unit NPP increased by 10. 8 % because of changes in climate, species, and management, the total NPP of cropland still dropped slightly on the Shandong Peninsula due to urbanization, and the area of single-cropping systems on lands that suffer higher soil erosion rates decreased.

As soil erosion has become {{a serious threat to}} agriculture in China, the "Grain-for-Green" project was initiated in western and central China with the goal of reducing soil erosion and improving vegetation conditions. Eastern China was not included in this project, although soil erosion is a serious problem in areas with rapid urban expansion. This study analysed the effects of urbanization on cropping system changes, soil erosion, and farmland net primary production (NPP) in Shandong Peninsula using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA). The results show that parts of the mountainous regions in eastern Shandong Peninsula experience severe/heavy soil erosion. The percentage of cropland experiencing high, very high, and severe soil erosion decreased by 46. 1 %, 60. 3 %, and 33. 3 %, respectively, from 2000 to 2010. Although the mean annual unit NPP increased by 10. 8 % because of changes in climate, species, and management, the total NPP of cropland still dropped slightly on the Shandong Peninsula due to urbanization, and the area of single-cropping systems on lands that suffer higher soil erosion rates decreased. However, this <b>declining</b> <b>area</b> in lands with higher soil erosion classes will help to reduce the soil erosion rate on the Shandong Peninsula, which indicates that implementing the "Grain-for-Green" project in this area is not necessary in the foreseeable future.

40|$|For {{more than}} a century, educated cities have grown more quickly than {{comparable}} cities with less human capital. This fact survives a battery of other control variables, metropolitan area fixed effects and tests for reverse causality. We also find that skilled cities are growing because they are becoming more economically productive (relative to less skilled cities), not because these cities are becoming more attractive places to live. Most surprisingly, we find evidence suggesting that the skills-city growth connection occurs mainly in <b>declining</b> <b>areas</b> and occurs {{in large part because}} skilled cities are better at adapting to economic shocks. As in Schultz (1964), skills appear to permit adaptation. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} harmful factors {{relevant to}} the health of regeneration on <b>decline</b> forest <b>areas</b> in the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains. It was found, that adverse atmospheric conditions and deer were the main reasons of damages occurring in most stands. Pest insects were only of marginal consequence, although they eliminated the large parts of regeneration. On <b>decline</b> forest <b>areas</b> there were distinguished three zones with different intensity of damages caused by atmospheric factors. These zones are linked to altitudinal gradient. The intensity of damages increase on higher elevations. In distinguished zones, there were specified forest management objectives and general rules for their implementation. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
