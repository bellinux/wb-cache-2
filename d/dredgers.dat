25|$|Around the mid-18th century, {{goods and}} {{passengers}} {{began to be}} transported by ship between London and Whitstable, and a toll road was built to the cathedral city of Canterbury. These improvements in transport led to the town's development as a seaside resort; the first advertisements for bathing machines at Whitstable appeared in 1768. In 1790 the manor was sold to private landowners, and three years later the rights to harvest the oyster beds were bought by the newly established Company of Free Fishers and <b>Dredgers</b> of Whitstable, the successor to the Whitstable Company of <b>Dredgers.</b> Between roughly 1775 and 1875 the well smacks or early longliners out of Barking and other local fishing ports would collect lugworms and whelks from Whitstable's bait-diggers and <b>dredgers</b> before beginning their tour for prime fish north to Iceland. Whelks suspended in net bags in the well could live for a while due to circulating fresh water.|$|E

25|$|Paving {{the way for}} {{recreational}} use of the canal has been the Gowanus <b>Dredgers</b> Canoe Club (founded in 1999), and The Urban Divers Estuary Conservancy (founded in 1998), two organizations that are dedicated to providing waterfront access and education related to the estuary and bordering shoreline of the canal. During the 2003 season, over 1,000 individuals, including more than 200 youths, participated in Dredger Canoe Club programs, logging over 2,000 trips on the Gowanus Canal. The NY Harbor report for that same year showed the Gowanus to have {{the highest level of}} pathogens in the entire harbor.|$|E
30|$|The {{ultimate}} {{shear stress}} of interface increases with increase of density of <b>dredger</b> fill. The difference of ultimate shear stress of interface with different density of <b>dredger</b> fill increases with increase of normal stress.|$|R
30|$|A large-size direct {{shear test}} was {{conducted}} to test the interface of <b>dredger</b> fill and concrete. The effect that concrete strength and the density of <b>dredger</b> fill have on the properties of interface is then analyzed. Digital photography was used to record soil particles of <b>dredger</b> fill moving near the interface, and the particle images were analyzed by particle image velocimetry technique. The results of the tests show that the shear strength of interface fit the model {{laid out in the}} Mohr–Coulomb theory. The relationship between shear displacement and shear stress fit the hyperbola model. Soil particles of <b>dredger</b> fill near the interface have large horizontal displacement and obvious vertical displacement of the particles. Under high normal stress, concrete strength has significant influences on the shear strength of interface. Density of <b>dredger</b> fill has great effects on the shear strength of interface.|$|R
30|$|Large shear {{displacement}} {{and obvious}} normal displacement of <b>dredger</b> fill particles appear near the interface. The maximum horizontal displacement of <b>dredger</b> fill particles near the interface is 2.4  mm and the maximum vertical displacement is 0.42  mm.|$|R

Maloja sank 24 minutes after being mined, followed by Empress of Fort William which sank about 40 minutes after being mined.|$|E
25|$|These {{ships were}} {{primarily}} designed for service in Southeast Asian waters, including the rivers, and Frolic and Kestrel {{spent at least}} one commission there. Their duties included protecting British lives and property and fighting pirates. Another major deployment area was the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa where Frolic and Rifleman served part {{of one or more}} commissions. Frolic, Ready, and Rifleman served at least one commission off the south-east coast of South America. Kestrel, Ready, and Rifleman each made one or more deployment to the East Indies Station where they helped to suppress the slave trade between East Africa and the Persian Gulf. At the beginning of the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882, Ready seized the assets of the Suez Canal Company, including its <b>dredgers.</b> At the end of 1873, Kestrel was on the China Station, Ready off South America, and Rifleman in the East Indies. A few months later, Frolic was one of the ships that blockaded the mouth of the Klang River in Malaysia in an attempt to suppress piracy supported by the local sultan. Together with the survey ship , Rifleman helped to suppress a rebellion in Mombasa against the British-supported Sultan of Zanzibar in 1875.|$|E
25|$|The Acorn Archimedes version, ArcElite (1991), {{written by}} Warren Burch & Clive Gringras and {{regarded}} by Stuff magazine {{as the best}} conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using polygon mesh graphics {{in place of the}} wire-frames. The game world no longer seems to be centred around the player; freighter fleets with escorts go about their own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual really {{can be found in the}} Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although <b>Dredgers</b> and Generation Ships are confirmed not to exist in Archimedes Elite). The Archimedes version of Elite was originally written to be a space trading game called Trojan - however the obvious similarities eventually meant that to avoid a potential lawsuit Trojan had to become an official Elite conversion. ArcElite was one of a number of games released for free by The Icon Bar website in 2006.|$|E

500|$|After {{receiving}} many {{complaints of}} dredging in the Yamuna and Hindon rivers banks, the UP Chief Minister's office in Lucknow asked the GB Nagar district administration {{to prevent further}} illegal activity. Nagpal, as the SDM, oversaw a large operation to stop illegal sand mining in the district, and used surprise and secrecy to arrest illegal miners and to confiscate their machinery. On 23 July 2013, Nagpal had {{said that she would}} take strict action against <b>dredgers</b> engaged in illegal mining, adding that such activity could affect the environmental adversely. Since April 2013, the Uttar Pradesh Police had filed 17 FIRs and the Chief Judicial magistrates had ordered the arrest of illegal sand miners in 22 cases. From April to June 2013, the police had impounded 297 vehicles and machinery used for illegal mining and collected Rs [...] in fines. Under Nagpal, a joint operation involving the revenue, police and transport departments was launched and villages of Asgarpur, Nangla Wajidpur, Gulavli, Kambakshpur, Jaganpur Chaproli were monitored. On 25 July, the government transferred the mining officer of the GB Nagar district Ashish Kumar, who was assisting Nagpal, to Bulandshahr. Before being transferred, Kumar survived three attempts on his life, the last one was on 9 February 2013. Nagpal was also targeted on 26 April 2013, during a visit to the Kasna police station.

2500|$|<b>Dredgers</b> – use a dredge for {{collecting}} molluscs from the seafloor. There are {{three types of}} dredges: (a) The dredge can be dragged along the seabed, scooping the shellfish from the ground. These dredges are towed {{in a manner similar}} to beam trawlers, and large <b>dredgers</b> can work three or more dredges on each side. [...] (b) Heavy mechanical dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. <b>Dredgers</b> don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths.|$|E
