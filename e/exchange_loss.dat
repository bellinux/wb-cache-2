Effects of the loss cone loss, charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> of fast ions with neutrals, and the bipolar part of anomalous loss are taken into account. Analysis is applied to the NBI heated plasma in the CHS device. Comparison is made between theoretical results and experimental observations. The increased ion particle losses by the orbit loss and charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> with neutrals make the radial electric field more negative than the value of purely neoclassical calculation. The partition of the injection energy among the shine through, direct orbit loss, charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> and bulk heating is estimated by using the self-consistent electric field profile. The power loss of fast ions caused by the orbit loss or charge exchange process is by a facter of several tens to hundred greater than the reduction of the energy loss of bulk ions through the enhancement of radial electric field.

Important points giving rise to different definitions are the problem of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses,</b> the appropriateness of including net government lending {{to the private sector}} and the distinction between nominal and real deficits. The paper also introduces alternative definitions of quasi-fiscal deficit, and discusses the same issues in the context of these definitions. Foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> and the distinction between nominal and real deficits are discussed in greater detail, since these issues are even more relevant {{in the case of the}} central bank. The authors also merge the accounts of the non-financial and financial public sector into a consolidated budget constraint.

40|$|Energetic protons in the {{radiation}} belt {{of the earth}} 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere show energy density enhancement associated with geomagnetic storms/substorms, which observation with Explorer 45 evidently revealed as a nose structure in the E-t spectrogram inside the plasmasphere. An attempt {{has been made to}} explain this by an injection model in which energetic protons are injected around a nightside geosynchronous orbit with their subsequent inward motions due to a convection electric field possibly driven by the solar wind and a corotation electric field. It is also important to include a loss mechanism in the model inside the plasmasphere since the protons decay due to charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> processes with geocoronal neutral hydrogen. The loss rate of protons depends on the hydrogen density and charge exchange cross section. In this study, the effect of the charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> is examined by computer simulation of energetic proton trajectories in the magnetosphere; the hydrogen density being obtained by the Chamberlain model and the charge exchange cross section being adopted from the latest approximate formula.
