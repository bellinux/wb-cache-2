40|$|Dutch policy makers, as elsewhere, have {{a strong}} belief in the {{effectiveness}} of asset recovery legislation. There are high expectations concerning the amounts of crime money to be collected, and the collection thereof would enable theauthorities to tackle serious, organized crime and fill the treasury. However, {{the results of the}} authors’ empirical research into the actual execution of ‘recovery orders’ show a different image. The majority of asset recovery cases concerns cases with low payment obligations (under ¼ 5, 000), indicating that mainly ‘smaller fishes’ are targeted. In general, the collection of crime money proves to be a difficult endeavour. Large amounts are not collected and there are long execution times. Policy makers who publicly announce high expectations, and who budget the expected <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> asset <b>recovery,</b> do not practice evidence-based policy making and give leeway to false hopes which then require new (legislative) measures...|$|R
30|$|Over the years, {{waterflooding}} {{has been}} the most widely used secondary oil recovery method after the exhaustion of the primary depletion energy of the reservoir. Waterflooding schemes have to be planned such that at every point of the operation, net <b>income</b> <b>from</b> oil <b>recovery</b> exceeds operating expenditure of which produced water disposal cost is paramount. Hence, engineers are regularly plagued with challenges such as optimal completions zones for injectors and producers, optimal flood pattern to adopt and number/type of producers and injectors to use in waterflood field development so as to improve oil recovery, but reduce water production. The aim {{of this study is to}} optimize waterflooding from a case study model using reservoir simulation techniques. A simple optimization methodology involving the analysis of the effects of zones of production and injection, pattern of waterflood selected and number/type of producers and injectors on cumulative <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> a waterflooded reservoir was used. Results revealed that (1) pressure maintenance/increment is more effective when there is water injection into more zones of the reservoir, (2) for waterflood operations involving the use of vertical injectors, higher water production was observed because water is expected to flow more conveniently in the upward direction due to gravity rather than laterally and (3) with horizontal injectors, higher cumulative production was achieved especially for cases where water is injected into the same zones from which oil is produced.|$|R

30|$|Actually, we {{distinguish}} between three {{different types of}} income: labour income, non-labour <b>income,</b> and transfers <b>from</b> the government. Labour income includes gross wages from a main and second job, <b>income</b> <b>from</b> self-employment, <b>income</b> <b>from</b> company shares, and <b>income</b> <b>from</b> agreement contracts (temporary employment contracts). Information on fringe benefits, severance and termination payments, and a company car is also available. Non-labour <b>income</b> covers <b>income</b> <b>from</b> the rental of property or land, interest, dividends, and profit from capital investments. Transfers involve pensions (old age and disability), means-tested benefits (such as the material needs benefit), contributory benefits (unemployment and maternity), and family-related benefits.|$|R

We find that immigrants have a lower <b>income</b> <b>from</b> work than the native population when we control for variables such as schooling, experience, civil status and region of residence.
