Overall, electroosmotic flow profiles within a free liquid film is similar to that of the closed-end solid microchannel.

By utilizing a microgravity environment, the length scales of the transition film region can be extended sufficiently, from submicron to micron, to probe and measure the microscale transport fields which are affected by intermolecular forces. Extension of the thin film dimensions under microgravity will be achieved by using a conical evaporator made of a thin silicon substrate under which concentric and individually controlled micro-heaters are vapor-deposited to maintain either a constant surface temperature or a controlled temperature variation.

All the simulated results are finally utilized for the implication of present day plate kinematics. Although in nature there is lateral and vertical variation in rheology within single domain and different domains (not considered in this study), our simulated results are comparable with the observed data. The imposed boundary condition (fixed North American plate, Pacific plate motion along N 34 °W vector up to northern terminus of the San Andreas faults and N 50 °E vector motion for the subducting Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates) had simulated the present day regional σHmax orientation and displacement vector. Simulated results show some local effect on the stress field and displacement vector by the main strand of the fault and probably its geometry and branch (Garlock Fault). Probably the low angle σHmax orientation to the strike of the SAF system in the South California (although there are some high angle σHmax orientation in southeastern California) compare to the central and northern California is due to the big bend and the Garlock Fault.
