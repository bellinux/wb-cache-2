25|$|The Main Event was a {{continuation}} of a storyline that had <b>gotten</b> <b>very</b> heated, very quickly as Volador Jr. and Mr. Niebla faced off in a singles match between the two. In previous weeks the two had fought, tearing at each other's masks and brutalizing each other whenever they got the chance; this match was no different. The action even included Mije and Zacarias, the Mascotas (little people in brightly colored costumes) as both Mije and Zacarias interfered in the match and tried to gain an advantage for their side. In the third and deciding fall Volador Jr. pulled Mr. Niebla's mask off, hoping to gain an advantage by the distraction, but Mr. Niebla had prepared for such a ploy and had his face wrapped in bandages under the mask so his bare face was not exposed. When the referee caught Volador Jr. with Mr. Niebla's mask in his hands he immediately called for the disqualification as {{it is illegal to}} take an opponent's mask off under Lucha Libre rules. For the third week in a row Volador Jr. challenged Mr. Niebla to a mask vs. mask match and for the third week in a row Mr. Niebla decline the challenge, stating Volador Jr. was not worthy of it.|$|E

[...] She further elaborated that [...] "Don Draper is a sad character, true, {{but there is some}} real comic {{potential in}} his pretensions and vanity. The writers are tapping into this aspect of his characterization to a small degree, but they aren’t really satirizing it." [...] Hughes was not impressed with the Mad Men parody and sarcastically stated that the spoof was [...] "so sharp, you'll swear it's 2008".|$|E

500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted.

500|$|... "Poughkeepsie, Tramps and Thieves" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode an 8.2 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great".

He wrote that [...] "The first half of this episode was extremely witty and fast-paced." [...] However, he thought that the Max-Chelsea storyline should have ended earlier in the episode, and that [...] "love sick, mopey Logan has <b>gotten</b> <b>very</b> old." [...] However, he was complimentary towards Keith's plotline. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed feelings towards the episode, being critical of the case of the week while enjoying some of the secondary storylines. While stating that the episode suffered from [...] "the lack of exploration of Max's character" [...] and Wendy being underdeveloped, he elaborated that [...] "those are generally minor quibbles with a decent standalone episode, however." [...] He went on to praise the Logan-Veronica dynamic and Keith's investigation into the Dean's death.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have <b>gotten</b> <b>very</b> large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire is staring at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E
