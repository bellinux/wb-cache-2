After the platoon's first move, to Als on the Kattegat, Norwegian Army messages were also intercepted, as well as traffic between Swedish and Norwegian radio stations.

40|$|The {{reliability}} and transmission distance are generally limited for the wireless communications {{due to the}} severe channel fading. As {{an effective way to}} resist the channel fading, cooperative relaying is usually adopted in wireless networks where neighbouring nodes act as relays to help the transmission between the source and the destination. Most research works simply regard these cooperative nodes trustworthy, which may be not practical in some cases especially when transmitting confidential information. In this paper, we consider the issue of untrusted relays in cooperative communications and propose an information self-encrypted approach to protect against these relays. Specifically, the original packets of the information are used to encrypt each other as the secret keys such that the information cannot be recovered before all of the encrypted packets have been received. The information is <b>intercepted</b> <b>only</b> when the relays obtain all of these encrypted packets. It is proved that the intercept probability is reduced to zero exponentially with the number of the original packets. However, the security performance is still not satisfactory for a large number of relays. Therefore, the combination of destination-based jamming is further adopted to confuse the relays, which makes the security performance acceptable even for a large number of relays. Finally, the simulation results are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed scheme...|$|E

40|$|Many {{external}} effects {{of land use}} change are based on modifications of lateral flows of soil, water, air, fire or organisms. Lateral flows can be intercepted by filters and thus the severity and spatial range of {{external effects}} of land use change is {{under the influence of}} filter effects. Wherever lateral flows are involved, research results cannot be simply scaled on an area basis, and overall impact does not follow simple linear causal relationships. This complexity has consequences for relationships amongst the primary agents who initiate or exacerbate external effects, other stakeholders who are affected by them and policymakers who attempt to mitigate problems that reach sufficient visibility in society. In this paper we review how the relative importance of lateral flows and filter effects differs among a number of externalities, and the implications this has for research methods. If flows and filters are incompletely understood, policies may be based on fallacies. Whereas ‘fire-breaks ’ act as filters in the lateral flow of the high temperature pulse of a fire, smoke from land-based fires can be <b>intercepted</b> <b>only</b> by rainfall acting as a filter and the external impact of smoke is determined by the atmospheric conditions governing lateral flow and chemical transformations along the pathway. Causal relations in smoke and haze problems are relatively simple and may form a basis for designing policy interventions to reduce downwind damage. For biodiversity issues, landscape connectivity, the absence of filters restricting dispersal and movement of organisms, is increasingly recognised as an influence on the dynamics of species richness and its scaling relations. Biodiversity research methods can extend beyond the current descriptive stage into clarifying causal relation...|$|E
40|$|I have {{recently}} developed dmfs, a Data Migration File System, for NetBSD. This file system {{is based on}} the overlay file system, which is discussed in a separate paper, and provides kernel support for the data migration system being developed by my research group here at NASA/Ames. The file system utilizes an underlying file store to provide the file backing, and coordinates user and system access to the files. It stores its internal meta data in a flat file, which resides on a separate file system. Our data migration system provides archiving and file migration services. System utilities scan the dmfs file system for recently modified files, and archive them to two separate tape stores. Once a file has been doubly archived, files larger than a specified size will be truncated to that size, potentially freeing up large amounts of the underlying file store. Some sites will choose to retain none of the file (deleting its contents entirely from the file system) while others may choose to retain a portion, for instance a preamble describing the remainder of the file. The dmfs layer coordinates access to the file, retaining user-perceived access and modification times, file size, and restricting access to partially migrated files to the portion actually resident. When a user process attempts to read from the non-resident portion of a file, it is blocked and the dmfs layer sends a request to a system daemon to restore the file. As more of the file becomes resident, the user process is permitted to begin accessing the now-resident portions of the file. For simplicity, our data migration system divides a file into two portions, a resident portion followed by an optional non-resident portion. Also, a file is in one of three states: fully resident, fully resident and archived, and (partially) non-resident and archived. For a file which is only partially resident, any attempt to write or truncate the file, or to read a non-resident portion, will trigger a file restoration. Truncations and writes are blocked until the file is fully restored so that a restoration which only partially succeed does not leave the file in an indeterminate state with portions existing only on tape and other portions only in the disk file system. We chose layered file system technology as it permits us to focus on the data migration functionality, and permits end system administrators to choose the underlying file store technology. We chose the overlay layered file system instead of the null layer for two reasons: first to permit our layer to better preserve meta data integrity and second to prevent even root processes from accessing migrated files. This is achieved as the underlying file store becomes inaccessible once the dmfs layer is mounted. We are quite pleased with how the layered file system has turned out. Of the 45 vnode operations in NetBSD, 20 (forty-four percent) required no intervention by our file layer - they are passed directly to the underlying file store. Of the twenty five we do intercept, nine (such as vop_create()) are <b>intercepted</b> <b>only</b> to ensure meta data integrity. Most of the functionality was concentrated in five operations: vop_read, vop_write, vop_getattr, vop_setattr, and vop_fcntl. The first four are the core operations for controlling access to migrated files and preserving the user experience. vop_fcntl, a call generated for a certain class of fcntl codes, provides the command channel used by privileged user programs to communicate with the dmfs layer...|$|E

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the effect}} of inter-habitat migration {{on the distribution of}} population sizes between two habitats, and compare this distribution with the expected ideal free distribution (IFD). Whenever emigration from the two habitats is asymmetric, or when there is a survival cost during migration, the resulting equilibrium distribution of population sizes deviates from the IFD. This result holds irrespective of emigration rule, even though a density-dependent fraction of emigrants generally produces a distribution closer to the IFD than a constant fraction of emigrants. Environmental stochasticity causes a linear relation between population sizes in the two habitats, with slope and <b>intercept</b> <b>only</b> identical to the IFD when net inter-habitat exchange is zero. The type and asymmetry of inter-habitat migration will influence how we should interpret data on population distribution in different habitats.

Therefore, data on population sizes cannot be used uncritically to assess habitat quality...|$|R
