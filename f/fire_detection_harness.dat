There are ample studies investigating the best sensor combinations and appropriate techniques for early <b>fire</b> <b>detection.</b> In the previous studies <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> has either been considered as an application of a certain field (e. g., event detection for wireless sensor networks) or the main concern for which techniques have been specifically designed (e. g., <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> using remote sensing techniques).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{development of the}} forest <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm for upcoming GCOM-C 1 /SGLI sensor. Several existing <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithms which are applied to GOES/VAS, NOAA/AHVRR, Terra Aqua/MODIS sensors mainly use the MIR fire channels(3 - 4 μm) for key role of the <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm. Meanwhile, {{because of lack of}} the MIR fire channel on GCOM-C 1 /SGLI, <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm must be developed using general land/atmosphere observation channels. For this reason, we investigated the significant channels for the <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> process and determined the frameworks of the <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm for SGLI. The proposed <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm mainly uses the second principal component score of SWIR 1. 6 μm and 2. 2 μm channel’s radiance, and the second principal component score of NIR 0. 8 μm and SWIR 1. 6 μm channel’s radiance to detect fire pixels. The algorithm is organized with complex of the various threshold tests.

40|$|Vision based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> is {{potentially}} a useful technique. With {{the increase in}} the number of surveillance cameras being installed, a vision based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> capability can be incorporated in existing surveillance systems at relatively low additional cost. Vision based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> offers advantages over the traditional methods. It will thus complement the existing devices. Conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> systems use physical sensors to detect fire. Chemical properties of particles in the air are acquired by sensors and are used by conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> systems to raise an alarm. However, this can also cause false alarms; for example, a person smoking in a room may trigger a typical fire alarm system. In order to manage false alarms of conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> systems, a computer vision-based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed system consists of two main parts: fire color modeling and robot navigation. The algorithm can be used in parallel with conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> systems to reduce false alarms in order to rescue indoor appliances. It can also be deployed as a stand-alone system to detect fire by using video frames acquired through a video acquisition device. A fire color model is developed in RGB color space to identify fire pixels. The proposed fire color model is tested with video sequences captured in different illumination condition in indoor ambience. The experimental results are quite encouraging in terms of correctly classifying fire pixels according to color information only.

The very interesting dynamics of flames have motivated {{the use of}} motion estimators to distinguish fire from other types of motion. Since fire is a complex but unusual visual phenomenon, employs distinctive parameters such as color, motion, shape, growth, dynamic texture and smoke behavior. Discrimination between fire and non-fire motion can be easily determined. There are many different approaches are available to detect fire at the early stage.
