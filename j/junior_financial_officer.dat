Numerous research projects have been conducted {{to learn more about the}} position of college president and the people who serve in this capacity. However, little is known about the desired leadership traits, behaviors, and characteristics of chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers.</b> The focus of this study was to identify the perceived effective leadership traits, behaviors, and characteristics of public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers.</b> Further, this study was designed to determine if the perceptions of two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and chief executive officers, regarding the most effective leadership traits, behaviors, and characteristics of a chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> of a public two-year college, are significantly different. The results of this study indicate that chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and chief executive officers are more similar than different in their perceptions of effective leadership traits, behaviors, and characteristics for a public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> to possess. Both groups agree that the traits of integrity, honesty, ethical, knowledge, and credibility are important traits for a public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> to have. The behaviors that both groups rated as high importance include: accountability, responsibility, decision making, objectivity, collaboration, commitment, fairness and decisiveness. Characteristics that were rated high within the research analyses include the behavior of objectivity and the traits of achievement oriented, honesty, initiative, ethical, and empathy. A discriminant function analysis identified nine predictors that could be used to distinguish group membership. These nine predictors include motivation, knowledgeable, delegate, loyalty, visible, tact, confidence, fairness, and trust. This study indicates that there was a consensus among chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and chief executive officers regarding the traits, behaviors, and characteristics necessary for a public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> to possess. This study may benefit search committees as they search for the best chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> for their institution. This study may also benefit prospective chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> candidates in evaluating their academic preparation and in expanding their related experiences...|$|R
