40|$|Bacteria have {{developed}} various motility mechanisms {{to adapt to}} a variety of solid surfaces. A rhizosphere isolate, Paenibacillus sp. NAIST 15 - 1, exhibited unusual motility behavior. When spotted onto 1. 5 % agar media, Paenibacillus sp. formed many colonies, each of which moved around actively at a speed of 3. 6 μm/sec. As their density increased, each moving colony began to spiral, finally forming a static round colony. Despite its unusual motility behavior, draft genome sequencing revealed that both the composition and organization of flagellar genes in Paenibacillus sp. were very similar to those in Bacillus subtilis. Disruption of flagellar genes and flagellar stator operons resulted in loss of motility. Paenibacillus sp. showed increased transcription of flagellar genes and hyperflagellation on <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> media. Thus, increased flagella and their rotation drive Paenibacillus sp. motility. We also identified a large extracellular protein, CmoA, which is conserved only in several Paenibacillus and related species. A cmoA mutant could neither form moving colonies nor move on <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> media; however, motility was restored by exogenous CmoA. CmoA was located around cells and enveloped cell clusters. Comparison of cellular behavior between the wild type and cmoA mutant indicated that extracellular CmoA is involved in drawing water out of agar media and/or smoothing the cell surface interface. This function of CmoA probably enables Paenibacillus sp. to move on <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> media...|$|E

An early mechanism of mechanosensing and response is speculated to be governed by as-yet-unidentified sensory complexes containing a Ca 2 +-permeable, stretch-activated (SA) channel. However, the components or regulators of such complexes are poorly understood {{at the molecular level}} in plants. Here, we report the molecular identification of a plasma membrane protein (designated Mca 1) that correlates Ca 2 + influx with mechanosensing in Arabidopsis thaliana. MCA 1 cDNA was cloned by the functional complementation of lethality of a yeast mid 1 mutant lacking a putative Ca 2 +-permeable SA channel component. Mca 1 was localized to the yeast plasma membrane as an integral membrane protein and mediated Ca 2 + influx. Mca 1 also increased [Ca 2 +]cyt upon plasma membrane distortion in Arabidopsis. The growth of MCA 1 -overexpressing plants was impaired in a high-calcium but not a low-calcium medium. The primary roots of mca 1 -null plants failed to penetrate a <b>harder</b> <b>agar</b> medium from a softer one. These observations demonstrate that Mca 1 plays a crucial role in a Ca 2 +-permeable SA channel system that leads to mechanosensing in Arabidopsis.

This allows them to provide the plant with water and nutrients while navigating a heterogeneous soil environment filled with obstacles, toxins, and pests. Gravity and touch, which constitute important cues for roots growing in soil, have been shown to modulate root architecture by altering growth patterns. This is illustrated by Arabidopsis thaliana roots growing on tilted <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> surfaces. Under these conditions, the roots are exposed to both gravity and touch stimulation. Consequently, they tend to skew their growth away from the vertical and wave along the surface. This complex growth behavior is believed to help roots avoid obstacles in nature. Interestingly, A. thaliana accessions display distinct growth patterns under these conditions, suggesting the possibility of using this variation as a tool to identify the molecular mechanisms that modulate root behavior in response to their mechanical environment. We have used the Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred line population to identify quantitative trait loci that contribute to root skewing on tilted <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> surfaces.

All foci in mouse embryo cells yielded both sarcoma and leukemia viruses, but the altered cells could not be propagated. Many foci in rat cells, on the other hand, did not release either virus unless superinfected by leukemia virus; all the foci tested could be grown as independent cultures. The signifi-cance of these results {{to an understanding of the}} kinetics of focus formation by MSV is discussed. -J Nat Cancer Inst 46 : 1001 - 1007, 1971. THE FORMATION of focal areas of morpho-logically altered cells in tissue culture by infection with murine sarcoma virus (MSV) differs in the mouse and rat cell culture systems. In mouse embryo cells, murine leukemia virus (MLV) is required as "helper, " but in rat cells focus forma-tion can occur without MLV (1). To facilitate the selection and study of foci induced in both mouse and rat cells and to minimize spread of newly formed virus, an agar overlay method has been developed. Although <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> overlays have been used for both the avian and murine systems (2 - 4), results with <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> in our laboratory have been inconsistent.

Antibiotic-modified bacteria are phagocytosed very efficiently; considering their bacterial mass, Escherichia coli filaments are killed much more efficiently by PMNs than is an equal mass of normal sized bacilli. Antibiotics at sub-MIC alter the synthesis and excretion of bacterial metabolites which results in a change in their virulence.

40|$|As {{with many}} living organisms, {{bacteria}} often {{live on the}} surface of solids, such as foods, organisms, buildings and soil. Compared with dispersive behavior in liquid, bacteria on surface environment exhibit significantly restricted mobility. They have access to only limited resources and cannot be liberated from the changing environment. Accordingly, appropriate collective strategies are necessarily required for long-term growth and survival. However, in spite of our deepening knowledge of the structure and characteristics of individual cells, strategic self-organizing dynamics of their community is poorly understood and therefore not yet predictable. Here, we report a morphological change in Bacillus subtilis biofilms due to environmental pH variations, and present a mathematical model for the macroscopic spatio-temporal dynamics.

Here, we analyzed in vitro and in vivo, how CCR 6 expression could alter the behavior of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, which were shown to express low levels of the CCR 6 ligand, CCL 20 (LARC), both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of CCR 6 significantly decreased the number of metastases in immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice, without affecting the tumor-forming ability of LLC cells. This was correlated with a decrease in clonogenicity in soft and <b>hard</b> <b>agar,</b> and with increased adhesion to type-IV collagen. These two observations made in basal conditions were enhanced when CCL 20 {{was added to the}} assay medium. Thus, expression of CCR 6 in tumor cells, associated with the local production of CCL 20, decreased the metastatic potential of the LLC line. We propose a model, in which the expression of a chemokine receptor in tumor cells can act as a metastasis-suppressor, or a metastasis-promoting factor, according to the expression, or the absence of expression of the cognate ligand(s) in the tumor.

We report an atomicforce microscopy (AFM) -based approach for the fast imaging of bacterial phenotypes (cell shape, flagella expression) in swarmingmotility studies. Cells from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis sv. israelensis were inoculated on energy-rich media containing increasing agar concentrations. Following swarming assays (2 days), the cell morphology and the amount of flagella were directly observed by AFM imaging in air. Consistent with the macroscopic swarming behavior, cells harvested from the rim of colonies spreading on soft agar were hyperflagellated, elongated and arranged in chains. Increasing the agar concentration led to much lower amounts of flagella and to shorter rod-shaped cells, a finding consistent with the slower swarmingmotility of the cells. Cells taken from colony centers on soft and <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> surfaces were generally non-flagellated, rod-shaped, rarely arranged in chains, and exhibited lysis and sporulation.

On the surface of <b>hard</b> <b>agar,</b> the organisms increased in size but did not multiply. Abundant growth developed on membrane filters of appropriate size, extending into the filters as branching irregular masses. On gelatin, on most samples of coagulated serum, and on silica gel, the organisms grew to a very large size, and occasionally colonies developed by multiplication of large bodies. This multiplication occurred by irregular enlargement and separation into fragments. Growth in broth and in semisolid agar also occurred by multiplication of large bodies, but, in addition, the development of viable granules was observed inside the large bodies in broth culture. After the L forms began to grow abundantly, their nutritional requirements were simple; they no longer required animal serum.

The peptide was proposed to be D-leucine (N-bonded to the carboxylate of the fatty acid) -L-serine-L-threonine-D-phenylalanine-L-isoleucine (bonded to the 3 -hydroxyl group). By examining the effects of isolated serrawettin W 2 on serrawettinless mutants, this lipopeptide was shown to be active in the promotion of flagellum-independent spreading growth of the bacteria on a <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> surface. The parent strain NS 25 formed a giant colony with a self-similar characteristic after incubation for a relatively long time (1 to 2 weeks), similar to other fractal colony-producing strains of S. marcescens (producers of the different serrawettins W 1 and W 3). On a semisolid medium that permitted flagellum-dependent spreading growth, an external supply of serrawettin W 2 accelerated surface translocation of a serrawettinless mutant during a short period (12 h) of observation. In contrast, bacterial translocation in the subsurface space of the semisolid agar was not enhanced by serrawettins.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{root system}} {{architecture}} of higher plants plays {{an essential role}} in the uptake of water and nutrients as well as the production of hormones. These root systems are highly branched with the formation of post-embryonic organs such as lateral roots. The initiation and development of lateral roots has been well defined. WAG 1 and WAG 2 are protein-serine/threonine kinases from Arabidopsis that are closely related to PINOID and suppress root waving. The wag 1;wag 2 double mutants exhibit a strong root waving phenotype on vertical <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> plates only seen in wild-type roots when the seedlings are grown on inclined plates. Here an additional root phenotype in the wag 1;wag 2 mutant is reported. The wag 1;wag 2 double mutant displays both an increased total number and density of emerged lateral roots (approximately 1. 5 -fold). An increased LRP density of 1. 5 -fold over wild-type is observed. To ascertain the role of WAG 1 and WAG 2 in lateral root development we examined promoter activity in the WAG 1 ::GUS and WAG 2 ::GUS lines. The WAG 1 promoter showed no detectable activity at any stage of development. The WAG 2 promoter was active in stage IV onward, however there was no detectable activity in the cell types associated with initiation events. The lateral root density and spatial patterning in wild-type, when grown on inclined <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> plates, was similar to wag 1;wag 2 on vertical plates. Seedlings of both genotypes were treated with hormones such as auxin and MeJA, and inhibitors. Auxin response in wag 1;wag 2 was normal with a similar number of LR as the wild-type after treatment. Treatment with MeJA resulted in a similar induction of LRP in both genotypes, however the percent lateral root emergence in wag 1;wag 2 was reduced while Col- 0 was increased compared to controls. Treatment with the calcium blocker tetracaine resulted in wag 1;wag 2 displaying a wild-type level of LR but had no significant effect on wild-type. Genetic analysis of the wag 1;wag 2 LR pathway revealed that WAG 1 and WAG 2 are acting in the same pathway as AUX 1, AXR 1 and PGM 1. pgm 1 - 1 was not previously reported to have a LR defect but showed decreased LR formation here, while pgm 1;wag 1;wag 2 had a similar LR density to wag 1;wag 2. TIR 7 and ARG 1 were both deduced to operate in separate pathways from WAG 1 and WAG 2. The data presented here shows that the wag 1;wag 2 double mutant has an increased number of LR compared to Col- 0. This defect appears to be caused by increased pre-initiation events and seems to be tied to the root waving phenotype. However, the treatment with MeJA revealed a possible role for WAG 1 or WAG 2 in LRP development, potentially under stress conditions. Calcium also seems to {{play a significant role in}} the wag 1;wag 2 LR phenotype, possibly independent of the root waving phenotype...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that plating GI- 101 A human breast cancer cells on hard (0. 9 %) agar selects for the subpopulation of metastasis-initiating cells. The agar-selected cells, designated GI-AGR, were homogeneous for CD 44 + and CD 133 + and {{five times more}} invasive than the parental GI- 101 A cells. Moreover, mice injected with GI-AGR cells had significantly more experimental brain metastases and shorter overall survival than did mice injected with GI- 101 A cells. Comparative gene expression analysis revealed that GI-AGR cells were markedly distinct from the parental cells but shared an overlapping pattern of gene expression with the GI- 101 A subline GI-BRN, which was generated by repeated in vivo recycling of GI- 101 A cells in an experimental brain metastasis model. Data mining on 216 genes shared between GI-AGR and GI-BRN breast cancer cells suggested that the molecular phenotype of these cells is consistent with that of cancer stem cells and the aggressive basal subtype of breast cancer. Collectively, these results demonstrate that analysis of cell growth in a <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> assay is {{a powerful tool for}} selecting metastasis-initiating cells in a heterogeneous population of breast cancer cells, and that such selected cells have properties similar to those of tumor cells that are selected based on their potential to form metastases in mice...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of rhamnolipid to swarming of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well established. It is frequently, but not exclusively, observed that P. aeruginosa swarms in tendril patterns [...] formation of these tendrils requires rhamnolipid. We were interested {{to explain the}} impact of surface changes on P. aeruginosa swarm tendril development. Here we report that P. aeruginosa quorum sensing and rhamnolipid production is impaired when growing on harder semi-solid surfaces. P. aeruginosa wild-type swarms showed huge variation in tendril formation with small deviations to the "standard" swarm agar concentration of 0. 5 %. These macroscopic differences correlated with microscopic investigation of cells close to the advancing swarm edge using fluorescent gene reporters. Tendril swarms showed significant rhlA-gfp reporter expression {{right up to the}} advancing edge of swarming cells while swarms without tendrils (grown on harder agar) showed no rhlA-gfp reporter expression near the advancing edge. This difference in rhamnolipid gene expression {{can be explained by the}} necessity of quorum sensing for rhamnolipid production. We provide evidence that harder surfaces seem to limit induction of quorum sensing genes near the advancing swarm edge and these localized effects were sufficient to explain the lack of tendril formation on <b>hard</b> <b>agar.</b> We were unable to artificially stimulate rhamnolipid tendril formation with added acyl-homoserine lactone signals or increasing the carbon nutrients.

40|$|SummaryAmong {{the myriad}} cues that {{constantly}} inform plant growth and development, mechanical forces are {{unique in that}} they are an intrinsic result of cellular turgor pressure and also imposed by the environment [1]. Although the key role of mechanical forces in shaping plant architecture from the cellular level to the level of organ formation is well established [1 – 4], the components of the early mechanical signal transduction machinery remain to be defined at the molecular level. Here, we show that an Arabidopsis mutant lacking the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) shows severely altered Ca 2 + signaling and growth responses to different forms of mechanical perturbation. Ca 2 + signals are either abolished or exhibit qualitatively different signatures in feronia (fer) mutants exposed to local touch or bending stimulation. Furthermore, mechanically induced upregulation of known touch-responsive genes is significantly decreased in fer mutants. In addition to these defects in mechanical signaling, fer mutants also exhibit growth phenotypes consistent with impaired mechanical development, including biased root skewing, an inability to penetrate <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> layers, and abnormal growth responses to impenetrable obstacles. Finally, high-resolution kinematic analysis of root growth revealed that fer mutants show pronounced spatiotemporal fluctuations in root cell expansion profiles with a timescale of minutes. Based on these results, we propose that FER is a key regulator of mechanical Ca 2 + signaling and that FER-dependent mechanical signaling functions to regulate growth in response to external or intrinsic mechanical forces...|$|E
40|$|We show in {{this study}} that Salmonella cells, which do not upregulate flagellar gene {{expression}} during swarming, also do not in-crease flagellar numbers permof cell length as determined by systematic counting of both flagellar filaments and hooks. In-stead, doubling of the average length of a swarmer cell by suppression of cell division effectively doubles the number of flagella per cell. The highest agar concentration at which Salmonella cells swarmed increased from the normal 0. 5 % to 1 %, either when flagella were overproduced or when expression of the FliL protein was enhanced in conjunction with stator proteins MotAB. We surmise that bacteria use the resulting increase in motor power to overcome the higher friction associated with harder agar. Higher flagellar numbers also suppress the swarming defect of mutants with changes in the chemotaxis pathway that were previ-ously shown to be defective in hydrating their colonies. Here we show that the swarming defect of these mutants can also be sup-pressed by application of osmolytes to the surface of swarm agar. The “dry ” colony morphology displayed by chemutants was also observed with other mutants that do not actively rotate their flagella. The flagellum/motor thus participates in two func-tions critical for swarming, enabling hydration and overriding surface friction. We consider some ideas for how the flagellum might help attract water to the agar surface, where there is no free water. Swarming bacteria may be divided into two categories: robustswarmers, which can navigate across a <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> surface (1. 5 % agar and above), and temperate swarmers, which can swarm only on a softer agar surface (0. 5 to 0. 8 % agar) (1 – 3).

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying bacterial swarming motility requires studying {{the factors that}} induce and control flagella expression in swarming cells. Moreover, bacterial flagella are currently recognized to mediate a number of functions besides their important role in motility, including acting as attachment organelles, secretory systems, and as stimuli of the innate immune response. Therefore, the analysis of flagella and other cell surface components has become an important challenge, especially in Gram-positive bacteria. Different methodologies are available for visualizing bacterial flagella using either optical or electronic microscopy, {{but none of these}} techniques combine versatility and easiness, with quantitative and high-resolution information. Here, we report an atomic force microscopy (AFM) -based approach for the fast imaging of bacterial phenotypes (cell shape, flagella expression) in swarming motility studies, focusing on the Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. This bacterium is an entomopathogen used worldwide as bioinsecticide which shares important genetic background with other two human pathogens, i. e. Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of the lethal disease anthrax, and Bacillus cereus, the food contaminant and opportunistic human pathogen. Because B. thuringiensis is safe for humans, it represents an ideal model to study swarming in this group of microorganisms with biomedical significance. B. thuringiensis sv. israelensis cells were inoculated on energy-rich media containing increasing agar concentrations. Following swarming assays (2 days), the cell morphology and the amount of flagella were directly observed by AFM imaging in air. Consistent with the macroscopic swarming behavior, cells harvested from the rim of colonies spreading on soft agar (0. 35 %) were hyperflagellated, elongated and arranged in chains. Increasing the agar concentration (up to 1. 5 %) led to much lower amounts of flagella and to shorter rod-shaped cells, a finding consistent with the slower swarming motility of the cells. Cells taken from colony centers on soft and <b>hard</b> <b>agar</b> surfaces were generally non-flagellated, rod-shaped, rarely arranged in chains, and exhibited sporulation and lysis. We next addressed the question as to whether cell-aging and nutrient limitation modulate the morphology of swarming cells, by observing B. thuringiensis sv. israelensis cells harvested from the rim and center of colonies developed on soft agar after 10 days of inoculation. AFM-imaging showed that aging of swarming-cells leads to a loss of flagella and to endospore formation. In addition, we found that aged cells developed at higher agar concentrations displayed complex colony architectures reminiscent of biofilms. Our results sustain previous findings for Bacillus subtilis indicating that flagellum formation is a prerequisite for biofilm formation in early stages. This study shows that AFM imaging can readily discriminate between swarming and non-swarming cells, and quantify their morphological details, thus offering an important tool to study the dynamics of bacterial populations...|$|E
