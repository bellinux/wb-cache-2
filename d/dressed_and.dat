5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. Rubble or third-class masonry construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> squared; and ashlar or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> carefully squared. Rubble masonry was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest tolerances. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using rubble masonry techniques.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} few small gay {{communities}} were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> lived as women and people assigned female at birth who <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, {{and they were the}} most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.|$|E
5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> traveled as a Maharaja {{even though he had}} taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E

5|$|The delay {{caused the}} entire {{production}} schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, {{who had a}} prior commitment, had {{to be replaced by}} Otello Martelli, a long-time favorite of Fellini's. When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter. The temperature had dropped to -5°C, often resulting in no heat or hot water, necessitating more delays and forcing the cast and crew to sleep fully <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> wear hats to keep warm.|$|E
5|$|Unfamiliar with Miami culture, Aki Narula {{spent time}} there before filming began {{to learn how}} Miamians <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> gave Bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours. According to the designer, the most {{interesting}} parts of his styling were the matching scarves, which resembled extended shirt collars. Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and sunglasses. The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{worked to}} {{coordinate}} {{resistance to the}} Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston Town Meeting (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic boycott of British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House—with the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature—which proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> had little money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses for the journey to Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E

She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E

30|$|In {{the review}} we {{identified}} three topical research areas focused on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sex: (1) <b>dress</b> as cue to sexual information, (2) <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence, <b>and</b> (3) <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification. Across these three topical areas, {{it is clear}} that dress is used to infer a range of information about sex. Based on our review, the research on <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification is the most recent of the three topical research areas we have defined. That research began after objectification theory was proposed by Fredrickson and Roberts in (1997); whereas the research on dress as a cue to sexual information dates from 1990 and the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence dates from 1991 (see Table  1). Furthermore, the research on <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification is clearer and more focused than research in the other two categories because nearly all of it all relies on objectification theory as a framework, while researchers working in the other two topical areas have relied on a variety of theories or have sometimes not used theory at all. The research on dress as a cue to sexual information is the most varied of the topical trends and overlaps with some of the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> violence. Although unacknowledged in the research, the research on sex, <b>dress,</b> <b>and</b> objectification overlaps with the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> violence because that research has focused on violence in the context of sexually objectifying experiences.|$|R

He was then shot through the thigh, and continued to refuse treatment. A few minutes later {{he was killed by}} an explosive shell fired by a Japanese vessel. Admiral Ding Ruchang, in command of the fleet, surrendered on 12 February, and committing suicide shortly afterwards. In exchange for the surrender of all war material including the fleet, good behaviour was promised by the Japanese. Jiyuan was later commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Saien, the same Chinese character name.|$|E

On the video, Rachel's date, Chip Matthews, has not arrived, and Monica refuses {{to go to the}} prom without her. Mrs. Geller convinces Ross to wear his father's tuxedo and take Rachel to the prom himself. Ross reluctantly agrees, {{but by the time he}} is <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> ready to go, Chip has arrived and the girls leave. The video ends with Ross looking disappointed and dejected. Rachel, touched by Ross's gesture, gets up and kisses Ross, forgiving him for what happened between them. Monica later watches the video alone which features her and her father, Jack, dancing. The video then shows Monica and Ross's parents in bed, which disgusts her.|$|E

She flees to Kieran for comfort but leaves him, shocked and disgusted, when he kisses her. She goes home and, after finding a note from Emily in her bed, cries herself to sleep.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{maintenance of}} extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation into dominant American culture. Establishment of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance {{as an expression}} of cultural group identity allows these variables to be used as measurements of assimilation. ^ The research design was exploratory since research pertaining to <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation was minimal. Survey techniques employed a questionnaire. ^ A cross-cultural sample was 257 female students in university classes, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, spring semester, 1980. ^ Data gathered includes: <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance; assimilation indices; desire to be assimilated; retention of ethnic identity; and conformity to peer group dress. Data was analyzed by chi-square tests and Spearman rank-order correlations. ^ The conceptual framework was based upon concepts associated with Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s assimilation paradigm: (1) extrinsic traits are quickly lost upon contact with dominant society; (2) extrinsic cultural traits may be retained indefinitely if individuals do not progress beyond first stage of assimilation; (3) once individuals have progressed through structural assimilation evidence of extrinsic cultural traits is completely removed. ^ Research Hypothesis I, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation was supported. Differences exhibited in assimilation indices of name, residential segregation, citizenship, language, family gatherings, and religion were related to differences in <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance characteristics. Persons with low levels of assimilation wore more ethnic clothing items and fewer items of dominant culture dress when compared to individuals with high levels of assimilation. ^ Research Hypothesis II, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and desire to be assimilated was supported. Individuals desiring assimilation exhibited dress characteristics similar to dominant society. Persons not desiring assimilation retained ethnic dress traits. ^ Research Hypothesis III, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and ethnic identity was supported. Continued identification with ethnic heritage related to maintenance of ethnic dress traits. Ethnic dress was worn on more occasions when there was interaction with ethnic group members. ^ Research Hypothesis IV, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and generation was supported. First and second generation individuals retained ethnic dress traits. As generation changed from first through fourth, items of ethnic culture <b>dress</b> worn decreased <b>and</b> items of dominant culture dress worn increased. ^ Research Hypothesis V, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and conformity to peer group dress was supported. Retention of ethnically defined dress traits was high when group cohesion between friends, family, and neighbors was strong. Dominant culture dress was worn more by individuals not attached to strong cohesive groups. ^ Conclusions were: (1) Extrinsic traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were not lost quickly upon contact with dominant society. (2) Extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were retained indefinitely by persons remaining unassimilated. (3) Maintenance of other intrinsic and extrinsic cultural traits was related to retention of ethnically specific <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance traits. (4) Extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were retained by individuals who had progressed through structural assimilation. (5) Strong group cohesion related to retaining ethnically defined dress traits. Finally, (6) <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were found to be viable indices for measuring assimilation indicating the extent individuals maintain identity with ethnic heritages. ^ Further study includes: male subjects; hierarchy of clothing items released during assimilation; new <b>dress</b> patterns emerging; <b>and</b> psychological implications of ethnic dress. ...|$|R

30|$|A 45 -itemized Chinese Stress <b>Dressing</b> <b>and</b> Eating Survey (CSDES) was {{developed}} by the researchers. The researchers adopted a survey that assessed stress, <b>dressing,</b> <b>and</b> eating among females in the United States (Kandiah and Saiki 2010). The CSDES consisted of four sections: (i) effort to control <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> making healthy eating choices, (ii) <b>dress</b> items selected <b>and</b> foods eaten during perceived stressful conditions (PSC), (iii) <b>dress</b> items selected <b>and</b> foods eaten during perceived non-stressful conditions (PNSC), and (iv) demographics. Prior {{to the start of the}} research the CSDES which included multiple choice, yes/no, and four point Likert scale questions was tested for reliability and validity. The Likert scale questions had response options ranging from “great” to “little or no” or “definitely disagree” to “definitely agree.” Likert scale questions were also used to assess participants’ effort put forth to control <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> making healthy eating choices.|$|R

5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wigan, Lancashire, {{he was the}} son of George Formby Sr, {{from whom}} he later took his stage name. After an early career as a stable boy and jockey, Formby took to the music hall stage after the early death of his father in 1921. His early {{performances}} were taken exclusively from his father's act, including the same songs, jokes and characters. In 1923 he made two career-changing decisions – he purchased a ukulele, and married Beryl Ingham, a fellow performer who became his manager and transformed his act. She insisted that he appear on stage formally <b>dressed,</b> <b>and</b> introduced the ukulele to his performance. He started his recording career in 1926 and, from 1934, he increasingly worked in film to develop into a major star by the late 1930s and 1940s, and became the UK's most popular entertainer during those decades. The media historian Brian McFarlane writes that on film, Formby portrayed gormless Lancastrian innocents who would win through against some form of villainy, gaining the affection of an attractive middle-class girl in the process.|$|E
5|$|Oshawa's hopes in the Cup Final {{were damaged}} when Orr {{suffered}} a groin injury against Shawinigan, an injury that is painful and weakens a player's skating ability. To promote the event, held in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the Generals had advertised {{it would be}} the last chance to see Orr in junior and were anxious for him to play. Bruins' management demanded Orr not play in the Final, not wanting to risk further damage to their property. Orr and his parents, however, were adamant he be allowed to play for the national championship. As he had not signed to the Bruins, they threatened he would never play for Boston if he was held out. Blair decided to defy the Bruins' ownership and let Orr play. While Orr <b>dressed</b> <b>and</b> played some, he was not a factor and Edmonton defeated Oshawa for the Cup. Oshawa coach Bep Guidolin was fired for letting Orr play, while Blair left the organization of his own accord to join the expansion Minnesota North Stars.|$|E
