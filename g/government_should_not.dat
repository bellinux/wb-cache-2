5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{be held accountable for}} pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E

25|$|Some Democratic officeholders have championed {{consumer}} protection laws that limit {{the sharing of}} consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats oppose sodomy laws and believe that <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults {{as a matter of}} personal privacy.|$|E
50|$|The {{land policy}} of the <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be an {{instrument}} to effect unnatural changes in the demographic pattern of a given province.|$|R
25|$|Compulsory {{vaccination}} {{policies have}} provoked opposition {{at various times}} from {{those who argue that}} <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> infringe on an individual's freedom to make medical decisions for themselves.|$|R
50|$|In addition, many Greens {{believe that}} <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> levy taxes against {{strictly}} local production and trade. Some Greens advocate {{new ways of}} organizing authority to increase local control, including urban secession, bioregional democracy, and co-operative / local stakeholder ownership.|$|R
25|$|An {{injunction}} is {{also sought}} against FATCA's asset reporting requirements on Form 8966 {{and on the}} form for the report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). The plaintiffs declare that these requirements violate the constitution and that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be allowed to enforce them.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{happiness}} measures could be used not as a replacement for more traditional measures, but as a supplement. According to professor Edward Glaeser, people constantly make choices that decrease their happiness, because they have also more important aims. Therefore, the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> decrease the alternatives available for the citizen by patronizing them but let the citizen keep a maximal freedom of choice.|$|E
25|$|The South China Morning Post {{published}} {{a poll of}} Hong Kong residents conducted while Snowden was still in Hong Kong that showed {{that half of the}} 509 respondents believed the Chinese <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> surrender Snowden to the United States if Washington raises such a request; 33 percent of those polled think of Snowden as a hero, 12.8 percent described him as a traitor, 36 percent said he was neither.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the idea that <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> take policy {{measures}} for the development and growth of National Health System (NHS) without taking into account their financial sustainability. This article is based on a review of existing theories, documents and statistics. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This lecture, {{available}} via podcast, {{argues that}} there should be an increase in international migration. <b>Governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> only free up their borders for trade, but should also make the movement of people easier in order to improve the global economy and the livelihoods of people worldwide. It is argued that such an approach makes moral and economic sense...|$|R
40|$|One central {{result in}} the {{strategic}} trade literature is that <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> support domestic ”losers” but domestic ”winners”. We show that when first-mover advantages are taken into account, the reverse holds, governments have stronger incentives to support domestic ”losers” that face foreign ”winners”. Accordingly, governments can play Stackelberg against foreign Stackelberg leaders {{to prevent them from}} playing Stackelberg against domestic Stackelberg followers...|$|R
25|$|Sachs {{believes}} {{it is best to}} empower countries by utilizing their existing governments, rather than trying to circumnavigate them. He remarks that while the corruption argument is logically valid in that corruption harms the efficiency of aid, levels of corruption tend to be much higher on average for countries with low levels of GDP. He contends that this hurdle in <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> disqualify entire populations for much needed aid from the west.|$|E
25|$|The main {{business}} of the emergencies committee was to cope with strikes, and here Newsam was cautious that the <b>Government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> intervene incorrectly or excessively (particularly if asked to call out troops), because the likely effect would be to cause the strike to spread. Newsam was {{thought to have been}} at his best in an emergency when he had to be decisive and authoritative. On 1 July 1955 he was appointed Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was criticised in Dáil Éireann, {{the lower house}} of the Irish Parliament. The Irish Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern called on FIFA {{to act in the}} interests of fair play. The French Prime Minister François Fillon stated that the 'Irish <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> interfere in footballing decisions'. Rama Yade, French Secretary of State for Sports, and FFF vice-president Noël Le Graët both defended Henry from accusations of intentional cheating, pointing to his playing record, and stating that he should be presumed innocent unless he stated he deliberately set out to cheat.|$|E
50|$|Patrick is {{personally}} pro-life, and {{was supported}} by the Campaign Life Coalition in the 1988 federal election against Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn (Toronto Star, 1 December 1988). Both were defeated by Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party. During the 2000 campaign, Patrick responded to a question about abortion by indicating that <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> intervene in such matters (SSP, 22 November 2000).|$|R
5000|$|On 25 March 2014 three Australian {{academics}} {{published a}} paper in the International Journal of Public Administration thatargued that the BER program represents a [...] "'case study' of how <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> pursue large-scale public expenditure programs". The paper says that the BER illustrates the pitfalls of large-scale public expenditure programs, and {{that it did not}} provide value for money.|$|R

25|$|Though these {{contributions}} to Dutch literature were a happy {{byproduct of the}} controversy, more important {{from the standpoint of}} enduring political science were the key publications by the democratic republican theorists around Baruch Spinoza that were published {{at the end of the}} 1660s. Franciscus van den Enden, Spinoza's mentor, went beyond the De la Court brothers in his espousal of political democracy in his Free Political Propositions, published in 1665, which is one of the first systematic statements of democratic republicanism in the western world. Van den Enden argued that <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> only be in the interest of the citizens (as De la Court had proposed), but should create equality of opportunity and be controlled by the people, not the regent oligarchy. Van den Ende acknowledged only two writers that had preceded him with such ideas to his knowledge: Johan de la Court (Pieter's brother with his Consideratiën van Staat of 1660), and Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy, whose English-language pamphlet A way propounded to make the poor in these and other nations happy (published in London in 1659) also took aristocrats and priests to task. Plockhoy and Van den Ende first tried to implement their ideas in New Netherland in the early 1660s.|$|E
500|$|The protester {{argument}} {{appears to}} be that the federal <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be able to tax income from labor because it would be a tax on an exercise of the freedoms mentioned in the quotation. The [...] "tax" [...] in this case was, in effect, a license fee imposed on door to door sales people under a city ordinance. The city was trying to exact the fee from Jehovah’s Witness members who were going door to door. Questions about the validity of federal income taxes were neither presented to nor decided by the Court.|$|E
500|$|The Zhuangzi vigorously opposes formal government, which Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have felt was {{problematic}} at its foundation [...] "because of the opposition between man and nature." [...] The text tries to show that [...] "as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness." [...] It is unclear if Zhuangzi's positions were [...] "tantamount to anarchy, and he {{was by no means}} in favor of violence." [...] The political references in the Zhuangzi are more concerned with what <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> do rather than what kind of government should exist.|$|E
50|$|Before Vicente Fox, Mexico {{practiced the}} Estrada Doctrine, so named after its creator, Genaro Estrada (Secretary of Foreign Affairs during the Presidency of Pascual Ortiz Rubio). The Estrada Doctrine favored an {{enclosed}} view of sovereignty. It claimed that foreign <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> judge, {{for good or}} bad, governments or changes in governments in other nations, because it would imply a breach of their sovereignty.|$|R
30|$|Brunette and Couture (2008) {{pointed out}} that <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> provide direct {{compensation}} for forest damage as this would reduce incentives for risk management. It is more appropriate for governments to offer aid to landowners who protect their assets through insurance. More controversial is whether governments might make insurance mandatory for private forest owners, thus reducing risk for insurers and lowering premium prices. So far, no country has adopted this approach.|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} was {{the most}} influential and representative instrument in the country's foreign policy for seventy years, it claims that foreign <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> judge, positively or negatively, the governments or changes in government of other states, in that such action would imply a breach of state sovereignty. This policy {{was said to be}} based on the principles of non-intervention, peaceful resolution of disputes and self-determination of all nations.|$|R
500|$|The dispute {{was finally}} settled by the Revolution of the {{shoreline}} dwellers. The mayors Tomás Grigera and Joaquín Campana, supporters of Saavedra, led the [...] "shoreline dwellers" [...] ( [...] , poor {{people living in}} the outskirts of Buenos Aires) to the Plaza, along with the Regiment of Patricians, and demanded the resignation of the morenists Hipólito Vieytes, Azcuénaga, Larrea and Rodríguez Peña, appointing the Saavedrists Juan Alagón, Atanasio Gutiérrez, Feliciano Chiclana and Campana as their replacements. It was requested as well that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> change its political style without voting it first. However, although the revolution was done in support of Saavedra, Saavedra denied having any involvement in it, and condemned it in his autobiography.|$|E
500|$|After Argentina {{invaded the}} Falkland Islands in April 1982, Benn {{argued that the}} dispute should be settled by the United Nations and that the British <b>Government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> send {{a task force to}} {{recapture}} the islands. The task force was sent, and following the Falklands War, they were back in British control by mid-June. In a debate in the Commons just after the Falklands were recaptured, Benn's demand for [...] "a full analysis of the costs in life, equipment and money in this tragic and unnecessary war" [...] was rejected by Margaret Thatcher, who stated that [...] "he would not enjoy the freedom of speech that he put to such excellent use unless people had been prepared to fight for it".|$|E
500|$|The 1993 Republican alternative, {{introduced}} by Senator John Chafee as the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act, contained a [...] "universal coverage" [...] requirement with a penalty for noncompliance—an individual mandate—as well as subsidies {{to be used}} in state-based 'purchasing groups'. Advocates for the 1993 bill included prominent Republicans such as Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett and Kit Bond. Of 1993's 43 Republican Senators, 20 supported the HEART Act. Another Republican proposal, introduced in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision; however, Nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill, stating he had decided [...] "that <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> compel people to buy health insurance". At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues with the mandate; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H. W. Bush, remarked, [...] "I don't remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1972, John F. C. Turner {{published}} his book, Freedom to Build, {{in which he}} argued for a theoretical strategy {{to solve the problem}} of slums. He argued that <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> try to tackle the housing problem itself, but all of the components of the area. Thus, by implementing good sewage and clean water and good paths for people to walk on, people would gradually better their abodes on their own.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, the Constitutional Court ruled 7 to 2 against Article 809. The {{court held}} that Article 809(1) was {{incompatible}} with the Constitution and that if the National Assembly did not amend it by 31 December 1998, it would become null and void, commencing on 1 January 1999. The court declared that until the National Assembly amended the article, other courts and government agencies, including local <b>governments,</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> apply it.|$|R

500|$|In December 1856, Snowden {{wrote to}} Missouri Representative John S. Phelps, hoping for {{progress}} with the legislation, and stating {{that he was}} already [...] "pressed on all hands, and from every quarter, for the new cent—in fact, the public are very anxious for its issue". When the legislation, amended to include the weight and alloy the Mint had decided on, was debated in the House of Representatives on December 24, it was opposed by Tennessee Congressman George Washington Jones over the legal tender provision; Jones felt that under the Constitution's Contract Clause, only gold and silver should be made legal tender. Phelps defended the bill {{on the ground that}} Congress had the constitutional power to regulate the value of money, but when the bill was brought back up to be considered on January 14, 1857, the legal tender provision had been removed. This time, the bill was opposed by New York Congressman Thomas R. Whitney, who objected to a provision in the bill that legalized the Mint's practice of designing and striking medals commissioned by the public, feeling that the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> compete with private medallists. The provision was removed, and the bill passed the following day. The House version was then considered by the Senate, which debated it on February 4, and passed it with a further amendment allowing the redemption of the Spanish coins for a minimum of two years. The House agreed to this on February 18, and President Pierce signed the bill on the 21st. The act made foreign gold and silver coins no longer legal tender, but Spanish dollars were redeemable at their nominal value for two years in exchange for the new copper-nickel cents. The half cent was abolished. The new pieces would be the same size (19mm), though somewhat heavier, than cents are today.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1997 {{letter to}} a constituent, Thompson wrote that he {{supported}} various restrictions on abortion but believed [...] "that <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> interfere with individual convictions and actions in this area." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{stated that}} [...] "Roe v. Wade was bad law and bad medical science," [...] and that judges {{should not be}} {{determining}} social policy. Thompson stated the <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> criminally prosecute women who undergo early term abortions.|$|E
40|$|Processing of raw {{materials}} by the producer countries themselves has frequently been recommended as an appropriate way for developing countries to increase their domestic value added and achieve positive employment effects. As against that, the following article suggests that Third World <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> take hasty investment decisions in favour of processing {{raw materials}} since the effects on the national economy {{in terms of the}} cost-benefit ratio could well be more favourable in other branches of industry...|$|R
40|$|Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine signed {{agreements}} with the EU on 27 June aimed at facilitating closer co-operation. Sebastian Schäffer writes on the impact the agreements will have for the economy of each state, the wider foreign policy issues, and for EU-Russian relations. He suggests that European <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> seek to marginalise Russian influence over neighbouring states, but that they should nevertheless be prepared to defend their interests if the Russian government seeks to impede each state’s co-operation with the EU...|$|R
5000|$|This price drop {{has placed}} many US tight oil {{producers}} under considerable financial pressure. [...] As a result, {{there has been}} a reduction by oil companies in capital expenditure of over $US400 billion. It is anticipated that this will have effects on global production in the longer term, leading to statements of concern by the International Energy Agency that <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be complacent about energy security. Energy Information Agency projections anticipate market oversupply and prices below $US50 until late 2017.|$|R
