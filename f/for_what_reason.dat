5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E

25|$|As is {{the case}} when {{collecting}} and handling evidence, documentation of the source, transfer, and state of said entomological evidence is crucial to a criminal investigation. An accurate record facilitates the tracking of individual pieces of evidence even if the item has been modified after the initial collection; modification can result by means of natural biological processes, like metamorphosis, or the manipulation of the insects by the lab during analysis. Accurate documentation also helps preserve the chain of custody for the evidence collected; it accounts for a detailed record of who has {{had access to the}} evidence, and the exact times and locations of when the evidence was moved and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason.</b> It basically provides a step-by-step ranging from the time of collection to the court hearings.|$|E
2500|$|On Bannicle or Bannack Hill {{there was}} an Admiralty {{telegraph}} station which was built in 1822 {{as part of a}} semaphore line between the Admiralty in London and Portsmouth. It was about 30 yards east of Hill House, but no trace of the station remains. William Cobbett in Rural Rides referred to the station when travelling through the hills of Hambledon. [...] "On one of these hills is one of those precious jobs, called semaphores. <b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> this pretty name is given to a sort of Telegraph house, stuck up at public expense upon a high hill; <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason</b> this outlandish name is given to the thing, I must leave the reader to guess; but as to the thing itself; I know that it means this; a pretence for giving a good sum of public away every year..." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Lord trieth the righteous" [...] (Ps. XI, 5). <b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason?</b> Said R. Simeon: [...] "Because when God finds {{delight in}} the righteous, He brings upon them sufferings, as it is written: 'Yet it pleased the Lord to crush him by disease'" [...] (Is. LIII, 10), as {{explained}} elsewhere. God finds {{delight in the}} soul {{but not in the}} body, as the soul resembles the supernal soul, whereas the body is not worthy to be allied to the supernal essences, although the image of the body is part of the supernal symbolism.|$|E

2500|$|A British Court of Inquiry convened on 7 July 1943 to {{investigate}} the crash, following the order by Air Marshal Sir John Slessor of 5 July 1943. On 25 July 1943 the Court concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} [...] "jamming of elevator controls" [...] which led to the aircraft being uncontrollable after take-off. The report noted that [...] "it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred" [...] although it ruled out sabotage. Slessor was not satisfied with the report and on 28 July ordered the Court to continue its investigation to find out whether the controls were indeed jammed or not, and if they were, then <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason.</b> Despite further investigation the Court was unable to resolve Slessor's doubts. The Polish government refused to endorse this report because of the contradictions cited therein, and the lack of conclusive findings.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{quantitative}} and qualitative research methodologies {{have been used to}} investigate this question. Quantitatively, data collection consists of participant responses to a pre-and post-test survey Likert survey that examine the intern’s attitudes and beliefs regarding teaching science to upper elementary/middle level students. The instrument used is a revised version of a valid and reliable data collection tool, “Attitudes and Beliefs of the Nature of and the teaching of Mathematics and Science” (McGinnis, et al., 2002). The revised instrument used for both the pre-test (administered the week before interns begin the HOSO apprenticeship) and the post-test (administered the week following completion of the HOSO internship) consisted of 19 science items taken verbatim from the original survey. Qualitatively, data collection consisted of pre-test open-ended items that included: 1) What grade levels do you want to teach science? 2) How do you intend to teach science?, and 3) <b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason(s)</b> are you participating as an Adult Leader’s apprentice in the HOSO after school informal science program? Post-test open ended items included: 1) To <b>what</b> degree and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason(s)</b> did the HOSO after school science course encourage you to seriously consider teaching upper level/middle level science?; and 2) to <b>what</b> degree and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason(s)</b> did the HOSO after school internship encourage you to teach science in an inquiry-based manner? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{post-test}} {{open ended}} items would ask interns to respond to: 1) To <b>what</b> degree and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason(s)</b> their science course {{encouraged them to}} seriously consider teaching upper level/middle level science; and 2) to <b>what</b> degree and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>reason(s)</b> their science course encouraged them to teach science in an inquiry-based manner. The sample includes all the teacher education interns who expressed interest in teaching upper elementary/middle level science and who are enrolled in the designated transformative science content course at both UM and BSU during Project Year 2 (28). The Likert item data has been quantitatively analyzed to report means by item and to look for statistically significant changes between the pre-and post-administrations of the survey. The open-ended items were analyzed using the qualitative technique of open coding to look for trends and patterns. Data was disaggregated to highlight minority students’ responses.|$|R
