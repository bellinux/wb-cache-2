5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would {{continue}} to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E

5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E
5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly {{because in the}} frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so. This began to change after the Spanish-American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E

5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé {{to have said}} that he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E

5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> When out in the open, they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations {{have been affected by}} mercury contamination.|$|E
5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E

5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Canids vary {{in size from}} the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps. Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in the shelters, as rebuilding began {{within three days}} of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E

5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign trail for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E
5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin {{is a mixture of}} estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
