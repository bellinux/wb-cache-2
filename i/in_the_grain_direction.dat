From these woods, straight grain test specimens of 12  mm (L) ×  6  mm (T) ×  70  mm (R) were prepared [with {{the exception of}} the beech, which was 4  mm (T)]. The partial density variation of cedar and larch is large because of the effect of annual rings. All machining was conducted on early wood: density was measured for each segment of early wood cut out, with the air-dried density of the cedar and larch being 0.31 and 0.35  g/cm 3, respectively. The machining area was not limited for the beech, and the air-dried density of the beech was 0.62  g/cm 3. All specimens were collected with end matching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction,</b> and all were air-dried specimens having around 10  % moisture content.|$|E
30|$|For multiple-fastener joints, {{many studies}} have been {{conducted}} to estimate the resistance of the connection [4 – 7]. Zahn [5] simplified the equation for the group action factor (Cg) proposed by Lantos [4]. The tabulated values for Cg listed in National Design Specification (NDS) are related to the diameter of a dowel-type fastener, elastic moduli of the main and side members, load-slip modulus for the connection, spacing between fasteners in a row, and number of fasteners in a row. Jorissen [7] proposed the equation for the effective number of fasteners adapted in Eurocode No. 5 [8], which {{is a function of the}} number of bolts per row <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction,</b> the spacing distance, and the fastener diameter. Smith [9] proposed the equation adapted in the Canadian Standard Association (CSA) [10] to estimate the resistance of the multiple fasteners joints, a function of the number of bolts in the load direction, the spacing of fasteners, and the ratio between the timber element thickness and the bolt diameter.|$|E
40|$|Introducing {{a hole in}} a glued {{laminated}} timber (glulam) beam generally results in {{a significant decrease in}} load bearing capacity. Global strength is most often limited by perpendicular to grain fracture with crack initiation at hole periphery and crack propagation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction.</b> Strength analysis and design is far from trivial, which is reflected by the lack of design criteria in contemporary engineering design codes. This paper presents nonlinear 3 D FE-analyses of beams with a hole, carried out using a cohesive zone model based on plasticity theory. Results of numerical analyses are compared to experimental tests showing good agreement. Results of a numerical parameter study relating to beam width and growth ring pattern are presented, showing decreasing nominal beam strength with increasing beam width and that the beam strength is affected by the growth ring pattern. Furthermore, some analyses of the influence of different types of initial cracks are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|The varied contact {{condition}} {{may be one}} of {{the reasons}} of the low accuracy of the conventional parameters and these low accuracies indicate that conventional parameters under varied contact conditions may not detect such small diameter damages in cultural heritage. Besides, <b>the</b> defect size <b>in</b> this experiment was very small. A general rule of thumb is that a discontinuity must be larger than one-half the wavelength to stand a reasonable chance of being detected; in case of 80  kHz ultrasound traveling <b>in</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction,</b> larger than 10  mm defect can be detected but the size of <b>the</b> hole <b>in</b> this study was only 3  mm diameter.|$|R
30|$|The CLT {{is made by}} gluing laminae crosswise; hence, {{the layers}} of CLT cross to a loading {{direction}} will be stressed <b>in</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction</b> under compression. <b>The</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> compressive strength of wood is approximately 10  % of <b>the</b> parallel to <b>grain</b> compressive strength [10]. Therefore, the contribution of <b>the</b> cross layers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global compressive strength of CLT panel {{is assumed to be}} null which makes a design conservative [1]. Glued-laminated products have a benefit of dispersion effect [11]. This effect works to make glued-laminated products more homogeneous material than solid wood by smearing out wood defects. Therefore, the variation of strength performance known from a single lamina grade could be averaged out within a final CLT panel.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{structural}} performance between thin-walled timber and FRP-timber composite Cee-sections. While, thin-walled composite timber structures {{have been proven}} to be efficient and ultra-light structural elements, their manufacturing is difficult and labour intensive. Significant effort and time is required to prevent the cracking of the transverse timber veneers, bent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction,</b> when forming the cross-sectional shape. FRP-timber structures overcome this disadvantage by replacing the transverse veneers with flexible, unidirectional FRP material and only keeping the timber veneers which are bent in their natural rolling direction. The Cee-sections investigated {{in this study were}} 210 mm deep × 90 mm wide × 500 mm high and manufactured from five plies. For both section types, the three internal plies were thin (1 mm thick) softwood Hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) veneers, orientated along the section longitudinal axis. The two outer layers, providing bending stiffness to the walls, were Hoop pine veneers (1 mm thick) for the timber sections and glass fibre reinforced plastic (0. 73 mm thick) for the FRP-timber sections orientated perpendicular to the inner layers. The manufacturing process is briefly introduced in this paper. The profiles were fitted with strain gauges and tested in compression. Linear Variable Displacement Transducers also recorded the buckling along one flange. The test results are presented and discussed in this paper in regards to their structural behaviour and performance. Results showed that the use of FRP in the sections increases both the elastic local buckling load and section capacity, the latter being increased by about 24 percent. The results indicate that thin-walled FRP-timber can ultimately be used as a sustainable alternative to cold-formed steel profiles...|$|E
30|$|A Siemens CT scanner (SOMATOM Emotion Duo, Munich, Germany) {{located at}} Luleå University of Technology, Campus Skellefteå, Sweden, {{was used for}} the {{non-destructive}} density measurements. The density accuracy in a CT scanner is ± 2  kg m− 3 for dry wood and ± 6  kg m− 3 for wet wood, with moisture content ranging from 6 to 100  % in a 2  ×  2  ×  1.5  mm sample, and larger measuring volumes give more accurate density measurements [27]. The 512  ×  512 pixel CT images were obtained using scan settings of 110  kV, 260  mAs, 1.5  s scan time and 3.0  s delay time. The intensity value of each pixel corresponds to the measured density in that measuring volume. The volume of each voxel was 0.98  ×  0.98  mm through the cross-section and 5  mm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction.</b> Thirty scans at 5  mm intervals were performed, covering half of the sample length and producing a total of 2160 scan images before and after impregnation. Scanning on the other half was not performed, but the other half was assumed to have the same distribution of density values. To ensure measurement at the same position of each sample, reference marks were used. Preservative uptake was calculated by taking the density values obtained after preservative treatment and subtracting the values obtained for the oven-dried wood before treatment. The subtraction was performed using the image analysis software, ImageJ 1.46 i [28]. Averaged data from the triplicate samples were used to plot the density graphs. To calculate preservative distribution profiles, the UnwarpJ plugin in ImageJ was used to correct slight swelling effects in the treated sample images so that they would more closely resemble the untreated sample images in terms of their physical dimensions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the deformations caused by stress and humidity interaction, mechano-sorption, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cross <b>grain</b> <b>directions</b> {{of wood and}} the relaxation or accumulation of internal stresses caused by these deformations. Long-term tests on small clear specimens in cyclic climates with both tensile and compressive loads were carried out. The development of internal stresses in timber was measured indirectly at different times during the adsorption and desorption processes. Released deformations were measured from cross-sections after cutting them to small slices. These deformations were used to estimate the internal stresses caused by the humidity variations. Tests with constant loads and multiple humidity cycles show a mechano-sorptive strain that is ten {{times higher than the}} elastic strain. It is shown that existing models for describing mechano-sorption perpendicular to grain are inaccurate when applied to multiple humidity cycles. The present results demonstrate that if the mechano-sorptive behaviour and <b>the</b> moisture gradients <b>in</b> wood can be accurately described, it is possible to predict <b>the</b> stress distribution <b>in</b> a timber cross-section by knowing the climate history...|$|R
30|$|Wood is {{anisotropic}} material and wood has very low tension strength <b>in</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction.</b> <b>The</b> flexural load causes bending moment {{which consists of}} tension and compression stress. At {{the same time the}} local compressive stress below loading block squeezes the tube-shape center-bored round timber like rubber tube. The squeezing force caused tension stress <b>in</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> at <b>the</b> outer surface and inner surface of the cross section. As a result, the center-bored round timbers were flattened and collapsed. This flattening failure mode is well known in steel pipe design. Under center-point bending stress, a pointing load forms plastic hinges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> steel pipe which are separated by a 90 ° angle at the circumference. Because of the plastic hinges, the stress pipe can be flattened. In a tree with a hole inside due to decay, a similar failure mode was observed [24 – 26]. A tree splinters longitudinally at theses points into at least four pieces [25, 27]. The center-bored round timber specimens in this study collapsed similarly as a tress with an inner hole.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the gradual failure of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane {{as a result}} of long-term corrosion, four dynamic corrosion tests were conducted at different temperatures and durations. By combining tension and puncture tests, we systematically studied the variation law of tension and puncture properties of the HDPE geomembrane under different corrosion conditions. Results showed that tension and puncture failure of the HDPE geomembrane was progressive, and tensile strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>grain</b> <b>direction</b> was evidently better than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transverse direction. Punctures appeared shortly after puncture force reached the puncture strength. The tensile strength of geomembrane was in inversely proportional to the corrosion time, and the impact of corrosion was more obvious <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal direction than transverse direction. As corrosion time increased, puncture strength decreased and corresponding deformation increased. As with corrosion time, the increase of corrosion temperature induced the decrease of geomembrane tensile strength. Tensile and puncture strength were extremely sensitive to temperature. Overall, residual strength had a negative correlation with corrosion time or temperature. Elongation variation increased initially and then decreased with <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> temperature. However, it did not show significant law with corrosion time. <b>The</b> reduction <b>in</b> puncture strength and <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> puncture deformation had positive correlations with corrosion time or temperature.

40|$|International audienceTimber is {{a highly}} {{orthotropic}} material with highest strength presented <b>in</b> tension along <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction.</b> Repaired timber structural elements in pure tension using carbon fibre-epoxy patches provide new opportunities as it is well adapted {{to the nature of}} wood. Such repairing process is very interesting as it is easy to use for assembling two damaged parts of timber and has a low environmental impact. Before this process can become widespread <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry, it is necessary to develop numerical tools for predicting the behaviour of such assemblies under tensile loads. Only a few experimental tests have been offered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature, and even fewer numerical studies have been carried out to analyse the complex mechanical behaviour of timber. The present paper describes the use of carbon fibre-epoxy patches for repairing timber beams under tensile stress along <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> <b>direction.</b> <b>The</b> repaired beams with CFRP patches using varying repair lengths were examined. The load-carrying capacity increased by about 47 %, passing from a repair length of 5 mm (F= 3. 8 kN) to a repair length of 10 mm (F= 6. 6 kN) at a displacement u= 0. 3 mm. A three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical methodology for virtual loading process under pure tension, including the interaction between two adherent surfaces and taking the presence of an adhesive layer into account, is presented from both theoretical and numerical point of views. Predicted and measured load-displacement responses and failure modes are compared. The predicted results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured test data...|$|R

30|$|The {{resistance}} of nailed joints under single-shear loading {{is determined by}} various factors, e.g., bending properties of nail, pull out strength of nail from wood, nail-head pull-through resistance. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> combination of plywood embedment and solid wood embedment resistances {{is also one of}} the important factors for it; however, the above studies [22 – 25] did not ignore the resistance produced by solid wood.
