6000|$|Hardly a new-light Apostle, but who, in superaddition to his revolutionary {{scheme for}} {{the minds and}} philosophies of men, entertains some insane, heterodoxical notions about the economy of his body. His soul, {{introduced}} by the gentlemanly gods, into the supernal society,--practically rejects that most sensible maxim of men of the world, who chancing to gain the friendship of any great character, never make that the ground of boring him with the supplemental acquaintance of their next friend, who perhaps, is some miserable ninny. Love me, love my dog, is only an adage for the old country-women who affectionately kiss their cows. The gods love {{the soul of a}} man; often, they will frankly accost it; but they abominate his body; and will forever cut it dead, both here and hereafter. So, if thou wouldst go to the gods, leave thy dog of a body behind thee. And most impotently thou strivest with thy purifying cold baths, and thy diligent scrubbings with flesh-brushes, to prepare it as a meet offering for their altar. Nor shall all thy Pythagorean and Shellian dietings on apple-parings, <b>dried</b> <b>prunes,</b> and crumbs of oat-meal cracker, ever fit thy body for heaven. Feed all things with food convenient for them,--that is, if the food be procurable. The food of thy soul is light and space; feed it then on light and space. But the food of thy body is champagne and oysters; feed it then on champagne and oysters; and so shall it merit a joyful resurrection, if there is any to be. Say, wouldst thou rise with a lantern jaw and a spavined knee? Rise with brawn on thee, and a most royal corporation before thee; so shalt thou in that day claim respectful attention. Know this: that while many a consumptive dietarian has but produced the merest literary flatulencies to the world; convivial authors have alike given utterance to the sublimest wisdom, and created the least gross and most ethereal forms. And for men of demonstrative muscle and action, consider that right royal epitaph which Cyrus the Great caused to be engraved on his tomb--"I could drink a great deal of wine, and it did me a great deal of good." [...] Ah, foolish! to think that by starving thy body, thou shalt fatten thy soul! Is yonder ox fatted because yonder lean fox starves in the winter wood? And prate not of despising thy body, while still thou flourisheth thy flesh-brush! The finest houses are most cared for within; the outer walls are freely left to the dust and the soot. Put venison in thee, and so wit shall come out of thee. It is one thing in the mill, but another in the sack.|$|E

Para tanto, foi selecionada uma propriedade agr??cola familiar localizada no 8 ?? Distrito de Pelotas/RS, na qual foi realizado o experimento, sendo o delineamento experimental composto por um fatorial (2 x 2 x 2), sendo estes: cultivar (Bord?? e BRS Violeta); ??poca de poda seca (normal e tardia); e poda verde (com e sem desfolha). Foram realizadas durante a colheita avalia????es de s??lidos sol??veis totais, da massa dos cachos, do n??mero de cachos e de bagas por cacho e da produ????o por planta. Ainda em cada tratamento foi medida a radia????o solar global, refletida pelo dossel e dispon??vel ao n??vel dos cachos e tamb??m a temperatura di??ria no vinhedo. Os resultados demonstram que a ??poca da poda seca exerceu influ??ncia sobre o comportamento fenol??gico, sobre a necessidade t??rmica e o n??mero de dias para completar o ciclo. Na cv. Bord?? a ??poca da poda seca afetou a produ????o e o ac??mulo de s??lidos sol??veis totais (SST) e na cv. BRS Violeta apenas o SST. Ao relacionar a ??poca da poda seca com a desfolha, sobre os s??lidos sol??veis totais, estes diferiram apenas no tratamento com desfolha, sendo maior na ??poca tardia. A desfolha realizada na cultivar Bord?? reduziu o n??mero de bagas por cacho, entretanto aumentou o peso de cachos e sem diferen??as para a BRS Violeta. A desfolha associada ?? ??poca normal aumentou a produ????o por planta e o n??mero de cachos na Bord?? e sem diferen??as para a cultivar BRS Violeta. O albedo m??dio para os tratamentos BNC, BTC, BTS, VNC, VTC e VTS foi respectivamente, 0, 287, 0, 280, 0, 295, 0, 297, 0, 304 e 0, 287. A cultivar BRS Violeta apresentou maior disponibilidade de radia????o solar ao n??vel dos cachos e maior teor de s??lidos sol??veis totais na colheita quando comparada a cultivar Bord??. A ??poca de poda seca n??o representou diferen??a na quantidade de radia????o solar dispon??vel ao n??vel dos cachos, j?? a realiza????o da desfolha propiciou aumento na radia????o que incide ao n??vel dos cachos para a cv.

In {{order to}} reach the strengthening {{and the development of}} family agriculture as well as the premise of diversification of the productive sources, there appears as an alternative the cultivation of common vineyards destined to the production of home-grown wine, juices and derivatives. Attempts were made to evaluate the existing relationships among local meteorological variables and handling practices, <b>dry</b> <b>pruning</b> and green pruning and the effects on phenological behavior, productive aspects and {{on the quality of the}} cultivated grape under the conditions of the region of Pelotas/RS. For this purpose, a family based agricultural property was selected located in the 8 TH district of Pelotas/RS, in which the experiment was carried out and where the experimental delineation was composed for a (2 x 2 x 2) factorial, these being: (Bord?? and BRS Violeta) cultivar, period of <b>dry</b> <b>pruning</b> (normal and late) and green pruning (with and without defoliation). Evaluations were carried out during harvest of total soluble solids, of the mass of clusters, of the number of clusters of grapes per cluster and production per plant. Moreover, global solar radiation was measured in each treatment, reflected by the canopy and available at the level of clusters as well as the daily temperature of the vineyards, Results demonstrate that the period of <b>dry</b> <b>pruning</b> affected the production and the accumulation of total soluble solids and on cv. BRS Violeta, only the total soluble solids. When relating the period of <b>dry</b> <b>pruning</b> with defoliation over total soluble solids, these differed only in the treatment with defoliation, being greater in the late period. Defoliation carried out on cv. Bord?? reduced the number of grapes per cluster. However, it increased weight of the clusters and presented no differences for the BRS Violeta. Defoliation associated with the normal period increased the production per plant and the number of clusters on Bord?? and presented no differences on the cv. BRS Violeta. The results demonstration that the average albedo presented short variation 0, 287, 0, 280, 0, 295, 0, 297, 0, 304 e 0, 287 for the respectively treatments BNC, BTC, BTS, VNC, VTC and VTS, being B e V refer of the cultivars Bord?? and BRS Violeta, N and T of the <b>dry</b> <b>pruning</b> and C and S with and without.

Using the regression equations, a benefit-cost simulation was conducted. We developed a measure that tells us how much the quantities sold of prunes would be affected by increased advertising expenditures by Sunsweet while taking into account the costs of advertising under an assumption of monopolistic competition. Two different scenarios were evaluated, one with a shutdown condition that did not allow average revenue to be below average cost and another without this shutdown condition. The total Sunsweet prune model resulted in an average benefit cost of 2. 143 with the shutdown constraint and 1. 845 without the shutdown constraint. The Ones product model resulted in an average benefit-cost estimate of 2. 672 with the shutdown constraint and 2. 358 without the shutdown constraint. Overall these ratios are good for a company operating under monopolistic competition and suggest that for every dollar spent on the advertising campaign, the average return was near to or greater than $ 2.

40|$|Acrylamide is {{a process}} {{contaminant}} due to thermal processing and absent in raw food (1). It is carcinogenic and neurotoxic and its level in food arouses great concern (2), although it still does not exist a legal limit for its concentration in foodstuffs. However, European Union recently fixed a recommended level of 1000 μg kg- 1 for potato chips. This work focuses {{on the development of}} extraction and analytical method for acrylamide determination in dried fruits and based edible seeds using a QuEChERS approach. Sixty-eight samples of packed dried fruits (<b>dried</b> <b>prunes</b> and raisins) and edible seeds (almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts, pine nuts, pistachios, and walnuts) were purchased on the Italian market. After grinding, an aliquot of each sample was suspended in water and acetonitrile and then added of the content of a QuEChERS pouch (MgSO 4 4. 0 g + NaCl 0. 5 g) in order to achieve the separation of water from acetontrile and to induce the migration of acrylamide into the acetonitrile phase. The suspension was vigorously shacked and centrifuged. The upper organic phase was transferred and dried by a gentle nitrogen stream and redissolved in water before analysis. The acrylamide determination was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry using a RP-HPLC-ESI-MS-Triple Quadrupole (TQ) equipment. Linearity, sensitivity, matrix effect, accuracy, and precision of the method were studied, also using food matrix reference materials. Then, the method was applied to samples. Results showed that only <b>dried</b> <b>prunes</b> (from 14. 7 to 124. 3 μg/kg) and peanuts (from 10. 0 to 42. 9 μg/kg) were appreciably contaminated with acrylamide, {{as a result of the}} processing techniques. Prunes are not subjected to high temperature during drying (70 - 80 °C) but the exposure time is quite long (24 - 36 h), while peanuts undergo the roasting process (160 - 180 °C; 25 - 30 min). These conditions are both critical and they promote the formation of acrylamide. All the other samples showed values below the limit of detection or the limit of quantification. The relative standard deviations, accuracy and good LOD and LOQ show that QuEChERS associated to LC-MS-TQ could be considered a good approach for acrylamide determination in dried fruits and based edible seeds, and it is promising also for other food matrices...|$|E
40|$|California is {{the world}} leader in prune production, {{accounting}} for about 99 percent of U. S. production and 70 percent of the world's supply. The industry, through the California Prune Board (CPB) and its various packers, especially Sunsweet Growers, the largest marketer of California prunes, has invested substantially in the promotion of prunes to consumers. This study analyzes {{the effectiveness of these}} expenditures in increasing consumer demand for prunes and, thereby, in raising industry revenues. The results from this project are useful for decision makers in the California prune industry as well as to researchers studying the effects of promotion on market demand. The analysis used to derive the results is also pertinent to other California commodity groups, in light of increased scrutiny surrounding generic promotion programs. The study was conducted under an agreement between the CPB and the University of California, and was carried out by a research team of faculty and graduate students in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. The study involved econometric analyses of U. S. domestic demand for California prunes. Economic theory implies that, to be effective, expenditures on promotion must increase consumers' demand for the product being promoted. Other factors generally considered to influence demand, and which need to be incorporated into a demand study, include the price of prunes, the prices of close substitutes or complements, measures of consumers' purchasing power, and factors to account for any time trends or seasonality in demand. Three data sets were assembled to study prune demand. The main data set consisted of 51 observations on retail prune consumption and prices in the United States, reported in monthly intervals for the period September 1992 to July 1996. Expenditures on promotion by the California Prune Board and by Sunsweet Growers were closely matched to the four-week observations on sales for this period. A second data set consisted of annual observations on domestic prune shipments and prices for the period 1949 to 1995. The measure of promotion in the annual model consisted of annual real expenditures by the CPB and Sunsweet on all types of domestic promotion. A third data set consisted of the results of a test market analysis of television advertising for prunes conducted in six U. S. cities. Results from analysis of the monthly data indicate that prune promotion has increased the demand for prunes. Across several alternative model specifications examined and reported in part 3, prune promotion consistently had a statistically significant, positive impact on retail prune sales. For the various models estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), the elasticity of sales with respect to promotion generally ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 22, while the promotion elasticity in the model estimated using 2 SLS was 0. 21. This means that a 10 percent increase in expenditures on promotion would have increased sales about 2 percent, holding price and other explanatory variables constant. The models based on the annual data series did not perform as well. Promotion, measured in this case by annual real expenditures by the CPB and Sunsweet on all types of domestic promotion, generally did not have a statistically significant effect on demand. Such results were not believable, however, in light of diagnostic tests that we performed to evaluate our specification of the structure of these annual demand models. The tests led us to conclude that—either because of poor or missing data or an incorrect model form—the models were not specified correctly. Thus, we were unable to use the annual data in any meaningful way. The television advertising test-market campaign was conducted for 12 weeks in Fall 1990, with three cities selected as test markets, and three used as controls. The advertisements featured generic advertising of <b>dried</b> <b>prunes.</b> Our analysis of the test-market data indicates that the television advertisements had a positive and statistically significant effect on prune demand both during the period of the advertising campaign and during the post-test period. The model we developed indicated that in-store displays, by themselves, had no impact on prune sales. A simulation approach was used to translate the effects of promotion on prune demand into estimates of the resulting marginal benefits (the increase in industry revenues from an incremental increase in promotional expenditures) to prune growers. Because of our greater faith in the data underpinning the monthly analysis of demand, the superior statistical performance of models estimated using the monthly data, and the congruence of these model results with the results from the test-market analysis, we based our simulation analysis on results from models estimated from the monthly data. Because the statistical analysis was restricted to demand modeling, while the simulation analysis required a complete model of the industry, including supply response, it was necessary to construct a synthetic supply model and conduct simulations for a variety of alternative supply specifications. The marginal benefit-cost ratio for promotion of California prunes was calculated. This ratio refers to the net revenues generated from incremental expenditure on promotion, and hinges importantly on the value of the price elasticity of supply, and on whether growers bear the entire burden of funding the expenditures or some of the burden is shifted to consumers in the form of higher prices. Returns to growers from allocating expenditures to promotion would be maximized by expanding expenditures until the marginal (last) dollar spent on promotion yields just a dollar back in revenues. The analysis suggests that the industry stopped short of this optimizing condition during the 1992 - 1996 period covered by the monthly data. The calculated marginal benefit of an additional dollar spent on promotion, given the amounts actually expended, ranged from $ 2. 65 to almost $ 30. 00, suggesting that additional promotion expenditures would have generated positive net revenues to producers. Only when producers are (implausibly) assumed to bear the entire cost of the promotion is it possible to derive average benefit-cost ratios less than 1 : 1, and to do so requires an elasticity of supply of 1. 0 or more, which is only likely to be relevant for longer-run changes. We conclude that promotion of California prunes conducted by the CPB has increased the demand for prunes and returns to producers of prunes. Over the four-year period analyzed in the monthly model, investments by prune growers in promotion yielded them marginal returns of at least $ 2. 65 for every dollar spent. Moreover, marginal benefit-cost ratios in the range of 2. 7 : 1 and higher indicate that the industry could have profitably invested even more in promotion during this period...|$|E
