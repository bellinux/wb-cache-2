40|$|Abstract—The PERCS {{system was}} {{designed}} by IBM {{in response to a}} DARPA challenge that called for a high-productivity high-performance computing system. A major innovation in the PERCS design is the network that is built using Hub chips that are integrated into the compute nodes. Each Hub chip is about 580 mm 2 in size, has over 3700 signal I/Os, and is packaged in a module that also contains LGA-attached optical electronic devices. The <b>Hub</b> <b>module</b> implements five types of high-bandwidth interconnects with multiple links that are fully-connected with a high-performance internal crossbar switch. These links provide over 9 Tbits/second of raw bandwidth and are used to construct a two-level direct-connect topology spanning up {{to tens of thousands of}} POWER 7 chips with high bisection bandwidth and low latency. The Blue Waters System, which is being constructed at NCSA, is an exemplar large-scale PERCS installation. Blue Waters is expected to deliver sustained Petascale performance over a wide range of applications. The Hub chip supports several high-performance computing protocols (e. g., MPI, RDMA, IP) and also provides a noncoherent system-wide global address space. Collective communication operations such as barriers, reductions, and multi-cast are supported directly in hardware. Multiple routing modes including deterministic as well as hardware-directed random routing are also supported. Finally, the <b>Hub</b> <b>module</b> is capable of operating in the presence of many types of hardware faults and gracefully degrades performance in the presence of lane failures.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of neural activity patterns is fundamentally {{linked to an}} {{understanding of}} how the brain’s network architecture shapes dynamical processes. Established approaches rely mostly on deviations of a given network from certain classes of random graphs. Hypotheses about the supposed role of prominent topological features (for instance, the roles of modularity, network motifs, or hierarchical network organization) are derived from these deviations. An alternative strategy could be to study deviations of network architectures from regular graphs (rings, lattices) and consider the implications of such deviations for self-organized dynamic patterns on the network. Following this strategy, we draw on the theory of spatiotemporal pattern formation and propose a novel perspective for analyzing dynamics on networks, by evaluating how the self-organized dynamics are confined by network architecture to a small set of permissible collective states. In particular, we discuss the role of prominent topological features of brain connectivity, such as <b>hubs,</b> <b>modules</b> and hierarchy, in shaping activity patterns. We illustrate the notion of network-guided pattern formation with numerical simulations and outline how it can facilitate the understanding of neural dynamics.

40|$|Compartmentalization-the {{organization}} of ecological interaction networks into subsets {{of species that}} do not interact with other subsets (true compartments) or interact more frequently among themselves than with other species (modules) -has {{been identified as a}} key property for the functioning, stability and evolution of ecological communities. Invasions by entomophilous invasive plants may profoundly alter the way interaction networks are compartmentalized. We analysed a comprehensive dataset of 40 paired plant-pollinator networks (invaded versus uninvaded) to test this hypothesis. We show that invasive plants have higher generalization levels with respect to their pollinators than natives. The consequences for network topology are that-rather than displacing native species fromthe network-plant invaders attracting pollinators into invaded modules tend to play new important topological roles (i. e. network <b>hubs,</b> <b>module</b> <b>hubs</b> and connectors) and cause role shifts in native species, creating larger modules that are more connected among each other. While the number of true compartmentswas lower in invaded compared with uninvaded networks, the effect of invasion on modularitywas contingent on the studysystem. Interestingly, the generalization level of the invasive plants partially explains this pattern, with more generalized invaders contributing to a lower modularity. Our findings indicate that the altered interaction structure of invaded networks makes them more robust against simulated random secondary species extinctions, but more vulnerable when the typically highly connected invasive plants go extinct first. The consequences and pathways by which biological invasions alter the interaction structure of plant-pollinator communities highlighted in this study may have important dynamical and functional implications, for example, by influencing multi-species reciprocal selection regimes and coevolutionary processes. © 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

30|$|The {{integration}} of transport logistics <b>hubs</b> via logistics <b>modules,</b> which select between several predefined transport chains, {{is a more}} sophisticated method. A decisive influence on the consideration of <b>hubs</b> within logistics <b>modules</b> is the properties of shipments (e.g., commodity, shipment size). Due to the characteristics of hubs there are often limits in handling certain shipments. If hubs are not suitable to handle a certain shipments, the likelihood of transportation via these hubs will be reduced. Different transport chains, processing only via certain hubs, {{are the result of}} that consideration. In this manner, the characteristics of hubs in combination with the characteristics of shipments determine the utilization and impact of hubs or transport demand respectively. Another aspect of integrating logistics hubs into modelling is the inclusion of further hub characteristics that excess the characteristics mentioned above (capability of handling certain shipments). The {{integration of}} information about differences in technologies used at hubs, for instance, can turn out to be very helpful if used technologies vary significantly. This way offers the possibility to a more nuanced consideration of hubs if they differ regarding their characteristics.|$|R

How could a future crewed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platform look like with the lessons learnt from the ISS experience in mind? How could a future role share be organized and what use cases and applications could a future platform offer? What is the longterm big picture for future human LEO activities? These questions are currently under {{investigation in the}} course of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) “Post-ISS” activities. A very promising answer is proposed by the Orbital Hub concept which has been developed by DLR’s System Analysis Space Segment department in Bremen together with scientists, international space industry and recently together with international institutions using DLR’s Concurrent Engineering Facility. The concept consists of a small modular crewed part called Base Platform and a dockable, serviceable, but uncrewed experiment platform referred to as Free Flyer. One major advantage of such a scenario is the decoupling of the habitat and the payload platform leading to higher flexibility, reduced attitude and pointing restrictions as well as less security concerns. The single modules of the Orbital Hub have been designed under the premise of modularity and each with their own dedicated functionalities and responsibilities. Therefore, they could also be used as building blocks for different platform concepts together with modules from other international partners and re-used ISS parts to serve for diverse mission objectives and political requirements. In the long-term, the DLR vision is to have the Orbital Hub as a central node of a platform cluster building up an environment for resource sharing, exchange and collaboration in LEO, referred to as “Space City”. The present paper gives an overview about the technical design, development progress and ongoing activities around this concept including e. g. joint studies with international partners.

Established hepatocyte differentiation protocols are effective and generate hepatocytes, which recapitulate some key features of their in vivo counterparts. However, generating mature hPSC-HEP remains a challenge. In this study, we applied transcriptomics to investigate the progress of in vitro hepatic differentiation of hPSCs at the developmental stages, definitive endoderm, hepatoblasts, early hPSC-HEP, and mature hPSC-HEP, to identify functional targets that enhance efficient hepatocyte differentiation. Using functional annotation, pathway and protein interaction network analyses, we observed the grouping of differentially expressed genes in specific clusters representing typical developmental stages of hepatic differentiation.

Herein, we explore a genome-wide gene-to-gene regulatory network based on expression data from the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisae (budding yeast). We recover static properties like hubs (genes having several out-going connections), network motifs and modules, which have previously been derived from multiple data sources such as whole-genome expression measurements, literature mining, protein-protein and transcription factor binding data. Further, our analysis uncovers some novel dynamical design principles; hubs are both repressed and repressors, and the intra-modular dynamics are either strongly activating or repressing whereas inter-modular couplings are weak. Finally, {{taking advantage of the}} inferred strength and direction of all interactions, we perform a global dynamical systems analysis of the network. Our inferred dynamics of <b>hubs,</b> motifs and <b>modules</b> produce a more stable network than what is expected given randomised versions. The main contribution of the repressed hubs is to increase system stability, while higher order dynamic effects (e. g. module dynamics) mainly increase system flexibility. Altogether, the presence of <b>hubs,</b> motifs and <b>modules</b> induce few flexible modes, to which the network is extra sensitive to an external signal. We believe that our approach, and the inferred biological mode of strong flexibility and stability, will also apply to other cellular networks and adaptive systems.

In this work, microbial functional molecular ecological networks were studied in both contaminated and uncontaminated soils to determine the possible influences of oil contamination on microbial interactions and potential functions. Soil samples were obtained from an oil-exploring site located in South China, and the microbial functional genes were analyzed with GeoChip, a high-throughput functional microarray. By building random networks based on null model, we demonstrated that overall network structures and properties were significantly different between contaminated and uncontaminated soils (P < 0. 001). Network connectivity, module numbers, and modularity were all reduced with contamination. Moreover, the topological roles of the genes (<b>module</b> <b>hub</b> and connectors) were altered with oil contamination. Subnetworks of genes involved in alkane and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were also constructed. Negative co-occurrence patterns prevailed among functional genes, thereby indicating probable competition relationships. The potential keystone genes, defined as either hubs or genes with highest connectivities in the network, were further identified. The network constructed in this study predicted the potential effects of anthropogenic contamination on microbial community co-occurrence interactions...|$|R

Both the interactions within PAB and FLB community fractions and {{their relationship with the}} surrounding environmental properties are largely unknown. Here, by using high-throughput sequencing and network-based analyses, we compared the community and network characteristics of PAB and FLB from a plateau lake during a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom. Results showed that PAB and FLB differed significantly in diversity, structure and microbial connecting network. PAB communities were characterized by highly similar bacterial community structure in different sites, tighter network connections, important topological roles for the bloom-causing M. aeruginosa and Alphaproteobacteria, especially for the potentially nitrogen-fixing (Pleomorphomonas) and algicidal bacteria (Brevundimonas sp.). FLB communities were sensitive to the detected environmental factors and were characterized by significantly higher bacterial diversity, less connectivity, larger network size and marginal role of M. aeruginosa. In both networks, covariation among bacterial taxa was extensive (> 88 % positive connections), and bacteria potentially affiliated with biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (i. e., denitrification, nitrogen-fixation and nitrite-oxidization) were important in occupying <b>module</b> <b>hubs,</b> such as Meganema, Pleomorphomonas, and Nitrospira. These findings highlight the importance of considering microbial network interactions for the understanding of blooms...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{performance}} and meat quality are important traits for the pig industry and consumers. Adipose tissue {{is the main}} site at which fat storage and fatty acid synthesis occur. Therefore, we combined high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing in adipose and muscle tissues with the quantification of corresponding phenotypic features using seven Chinese indigenous pig breeds and one Western commercial breed (Yorkshire). We obtained data on 101 phenotypic traits, from which principal component analysis distinguished two groups: one associated with the Chinese breeds and one with Yorkshire. The numbers of differentially expressed genes between all Chinese breeds and Yorkshire were shown to be 673 and 1056 in adipose and muscle tissues, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes are associated with biological functions and canonical pathways related to oxidoreductase activity, immune response, and metabolic process. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis found more coexpression modules significantly correlated with the measured phenotypic traits in adipose than in muscle, indicating that adipose regulates meat and carcass quality. Using the combination of differential expression, QTL information, gene significance, and <b>module</b> <b>hub</b> genes, we identified {{a large number of}} candidate genes potentially related to economically important traits in pig, which should help us improve meat production and quality...|$|R
40|$|In {{apparently}} scale-free protein-protein interaction networks, or 2 ̆ 7 interactome 2 ̆ 7 networks, most proteins {{interact with}} few partners, whereas {{a small but}} significant proportion of proteins, the 2 ̆ 7 hubs 2 ̆ 7, interact with many partners. Both biological and non-biological scale-free networks are particularly resistant to random node removal but are extremely sensitive to the targeted removal of hubs. A link between the potential scale-free topology of interactome networks and genetic robustness seems to exist, because knockouts of yeast genes encoding hubs are approximately threefold more likely to confer lethality than those of non-hubs. Here we investigate how hubs might contribute to robustness and other cellular properties for protein-protein interactions dynamically regulated both in time and in space. We uncovered two types of hub: 2 ̆ 7 party 2 ̆ 7 hubs, which interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and 2 ̆ 7 date 2 ̆ 7 hubs, which bind their different partners at different times or locations. Both in silico studies of network connectivity and genetic interactions described in vivo support a model of organized modularity in which date hubs organize the proteome, connecting biological processes [...] or modules [...] to each other, whereas party <b>hubs</b> function inside <b>modules...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Developing {{effective}} {{strategies to}} reveal modular structures in protein interaction networks {{is crucial for}} better understanding of molecular mechanisms of underlying biological processes. In this paper, we propose a new density-based algorithm (ADHOC) for clustering vertices of a protein interaction network using a novel subgraph density measurement. Results By statistically evaluating several independent criteria, we found that ADHOC could significantly improve the outcome as compared with five previously reported density-dependent methods. We further applied ADHOC to investigate the hierarchical and overlapping modular structure in the yeast PPI network. Our method could effectively detect both protein modules and the overlaps between them, and thus greatly promote the precise prediction of protein functions. Moreover, by further assaying the intermodule layer of the yeast PPI network, we classified hubs into two types, <b>module</b> <b>hubs</b> and inter-module hubs. Each type presents distinct characteristics both in network topology and biological functions, which could conduce to the better understanding of relationship between network architecture and biological implications. Conclusions Our proposed algorithm {{based on the novel}} subgraph density measurement makes it possible to more precisely detect hierarchical and overlapping modular structures in protein interaction networks. In addition, our method also shows a strong robustness against the noise in network, which is quite critical for analyzing such a high noise network. </p...|$|R
