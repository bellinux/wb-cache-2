25|$|Beginning in the 2000s, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} in interest {{in the idea of}} moving or optimizing the headlight beam in response not only to vehicular steering and suspension dynamics, but also to ambient weather and visibility conditions, vehicle speed, and road curvature and contour. A task force under the EUREKA organization, composed primarily of European automakers, lighting companies and regulators began working to develop design and performance specifications for what is known as Adaptive <b>Front-Lighting</b> Systems, commonly AFS.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} Lexus GS came standard with dual front airbags, front driver and passenger knee airbags, {{front and rear}} row side curtain airbags, and front row side torso airbags standard while rear row side torso airbags were optional. An Adaptive <b>Front-lighting</b> System (AFS) was standard on the V8 model while optional on the V6 model. The radar-based Pre-Collision System (PCS) with a Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system was optional. PCS can automatically apply up to 0.3g of deceleration if the driver does not react to imminent crash warnings. Anti-lock braking, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) are standard on all models. VSC with the electric power steering system can immediately alter steering torque assist during evasive maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive <b>Front-lighting</b> System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera on the passenger side view mirror to help eliminate blind spots on the passenger side at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{complexity}} and the criticality of automotive electronic embedded systems are steadily increasing today, {{and that is}} particularly the case for software development. The new ISO 26262 standard for functional safety {{is one of the}} answers to these challenges. The ISO 26262 defines requirements on the development process in order to ensure the safety. Among these requirements, fault injection (FI) is introduced as a dedicated technique to assess the effectiveness of safety mechanisms and demonstrate the correct implementation of the safety requirements. Our work aims at developing an approach that will help integrate FI in the whole development process in a continuous way, from system requirements to the verification and validation phase. This leads us to explore the benefits of safety analyses (Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Critical Path Analysis (CPA) or Freedom From Interference (FFI) Analysis, etc.) for the definition of the test plan, defining efficient FI tests cases. The paper discusses the objectives and role of FI in the Verification and Validation process. It also illustrates how to apply this methodology on a platform based on AUTOSAR 4. X that integrates a trusted <b>Front-Light</b> Manager Application (Automotive Safety Integrity Level-ASIL B) and a non-trusted (Quality Management-QM) application. This proposed architecture allows ensuring the safety requirements with dedicated safety mechanisms and also FFI using both temporal and spatial partitioning. Finally, the results of FI test cases obtained on a mock-up running the <b>Front-Light</b> Manager Application, developed at Valeo GEEDS are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent study}} (Cavallo and Pinto, 2012) showed that {{daytime running lights}} (DRLs) on cars create “visual noise” that interferes with the {{lighting}} of motorcycles and affects their visual conspicuity. In the present experiment, we tested three conspicuity enhancements designed to improve motorcycle detectability in a car-DRL environment: a triangle configuration (a central headlight plus two lights located on the rear view mirrors), a helmet configuration (a light located on the motorcyclist’s helmet {{in addition to the}} central headlight), and a single central yellow headlight. These three <b>front-light</b> configurations were evaluated in comparison to the standard configuration (a single central white headlight). Photographs representing complex urban traffic scenes were presented briefly (for 250 ms). The results revealed better motorcycle-detection performance for both the yellow headlight and the helmet configuration than for the standard configuration. The findings suggest some avenues for defining a new visual signature for motorcycles in car-DRL environments...|$|R
30|$|In general, {{there is}} a class of HDR scenes where the imaging sensor has a lower dynamic range than the scene of interest. These low- to medium-dynamic range sensors cannot capture the full {{dynamics}} of the scene without losing information. In such back-lighted or excessive <b>front-lighted</b> scene conditions, considerable luminance differences exist between the object(s) of interest and the background. As a typical result, the average luminance {{is dominated by the}} luminance of the background. Typical scenarios where this situation occurs are tunnel exits, persons entering the building on a bright sunny day while the camera is inside of the building, or in a video-phone application where a bright sky behind the person at the foreground dominates the scene. In these cases, exposure problems are typically solved by overexposing the image so that details in the shadows have a good visibility. However, all the details in the bright parts of the image are then clipped and lost. In case when no object of interest is present, the exposure of the camera is reduced to correctly display the background of the image. This processing is called back-light compensation.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rising}} {{complexity}} of automotive Electric/Electronic embedded systems, Functional Safety becomes a main issue in the automotive industry. This issue has been formalized {{by the introduction of}} the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety in 2011. The challenges are, on the one hand to design safe systems based on a systematic verification and validation approach, and on the other hand, the fulfilment of the requirements of the ISO 26262 standard. Following ISO 26262 recommendations, our approach, based on fault injection, aims at verifying fault tolerance mechanisms and non-functional requirements at all steps of the development cycle, from early design phases down to implementation. Fault injection is a verification technique that has been investigated for a long time. However, the role of fault injection during design phase and its complementarities with the experimental validation of the target have not been explored. In this work, we investigate a fault injection continuum, from system design validation to experiments on implemented targets. The proposed approach considers the safety analyses as a starting point, with the identification of safety mechanisms and safety requirements, and goes down to the validation of the implementation of safety mechanisms through fault injection experiments. The whole approach is based on a key fault injection framework, called FARM (Fault, Activation, Readouts and Measures). We show that this approach can be integrated in the development process of the automotive embedded systems described in the ISO 26262 standard. Our approach is illustrated on an automotive case study: a <b>Front-Light</b> system...|$|R
