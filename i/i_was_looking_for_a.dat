500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster. McBride made this happen by putting the reserves on his payroll as taxi drivers, although none of them were asked to drive cabs. This group {{came to be known as}} the [...] "taxi squad", a term still in use to describe players kept on hand to fill in for injured team members. The taxi squad was just one of the ways in which McBride backed Brown. He viewed owning the team as primarily a civic duty – as a gift to the city. [...] "Cleveland has been good to me," [...] he said in a 1947 interview. [...] "I've made a great deal of money here. If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> get-rich-quick investment, the last thing I'd do is buy a pro football club. It's a risky business. Too much depends on ideal weather conditions, and this is no climate to risk a buck on a raindrop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian {{originally}} intended to sing lead vocal on [...] "God Only Knows" [...] but after the instrumental portions of the song had been recorded, Brian thought Carl could impart the message better than he could. Brian reflected in October 1966, [...] "I gave the song to Carl because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tenderness and a sweetness which I knew Carl had in himself {{as well as in}} his voice. He brought dignity to the song and the words, through him, became not a lyric, but words." [...] At the time, it was rare for Carl to sing lead on a Beach Boys song.|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when I arrived in London <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E

2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E

50|$|Larch served {{four years}} in the Army during World War II — an {{experience}} that left him troubled for years thereafter. In 1965, he reflected on his post-military problems, saying: What was my hangup then?

6000|$|Cornelia turned {{round and}} took {{a good look at}} the janitress. She decided from her {{official}} as well as her personal appearance that she might be trusted, as least provisionally. It had been going through her mind there at the windows what a fool she was to refuse to let Mr. Ludlow come to meet her with that friend of his, and she had been helplessly feigning that she had not refused, and that he was really coming, but was a little late. She was in the act of accepting his apology for the delay when the janitress spoke to her, and she said: [...] "I don't know whether I'd better wait any longer. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Fourth Avenue car." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "MY DEAR MISS THOROUGHBUNG,--In {{the views}} which we both promulgated this morning I fear {{that there was}} some {{essential}} misunderstanding as to the mode of life which had occurred to both of us. You, as was so natural at your age, and with your charms, have not been slow to anticipate a coming period of uncheckered delights. Your allusion to a pony-carriage, and other incidental allusions,"--he did not think it well to mention more particularly the fish and the champagne,--"have made clear the sort of future life which you have pictured to yourself. Heaven forbid that I should take upon myself to find fault with anything so pleasant and so innocent! But my prospects of life are different, and in seeking the honor of an alliance with you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quiet companion in my declining years, and it might be also to a mother to a possible future son. When you honored me with an unmistakable sign of your affection, on my going, I was just about to explain all this. You must excuse me if my mouth was then stopped by the mutual ardor of our feeling. I was about to say--" [...] But he had found it difficult to explain what he had been about to say, and on the next morning, when the time for writing had come, he heard news which detained him for the day, and then the opportunity was gone.|$|E
60|$|But {{my horse}} {{was new to}} this bear chasing. He was mettlesome, {{and he did not}} want to do what I wanted. When I jabbed the spurs into his flanks he nearly bucked me off. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> soft place to light when he quit. Long before I got down that open slope Teague and R.C. had disappeared. I had to follow their tracks. This I did at a gallop, but now and then lost the tracks, and had to haul in to find them. If I could have heard the hounds from there I would have gone on anyway. But once down in the jack-pines I could hear neither yell or bay. The pines were small, close together, and tough. I hurt my hands, {{scratched}} my face, barked my knees. The horse had a habit of suddenly deciding to go the way he liked instead of the way I guided him, and when he plunged between saplings too close together to permit us both to go through, it was exceedingly hard on me. I was worked into a frenzy. Suppose R.C. should come face to face with that old grizzly and fail to kill him! That was the reason for my desperate hurry. I got a crack on the head that nearly blinded me. My horse grew hot and began to run in every little open space. He could scarcely be held in. And I, with the blood hot in me too, did not hold him hard enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, my dear girl," [...] I answered, [...] "it is less {{unlike the}} house I wanted than other houses I have seen. When we are young we make up our minds {{to try and}} get what we want; when we have arrived at years of {{discretion}} we decide to try and want what we can get. It saves time. During the last two years I have seen about sixty houses, and out of the lot there was only one that was really the house I wanted. Hitherto I have kept the story to myself. Even now, thinking about it irritates me. It was not an agent who told me of it. I met a man by chance in a railway carriage. He had a black eye. If ever I meet him again I'll give him another. He accounted for it by explaining that he had had trouble with a golf ball, and at the time I believed him. I mentioned to him in conversation <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> house. He described this place to me, {{and it seemed to me}} hours before the train stopped at a station. When it did I got out and took the next train back. I did not even wait for lunch. I had my bicycle with me, and I went straight there. It was--well, it was the house I wanted. If it had vanished suddenly, and I had found myself in bed, the whole thing would have seemed more reasonable. The proprietor opened the door to me himself. He had the bearing of a retired military man. It was afterwards I learnt he was the proprietor.|$|E
