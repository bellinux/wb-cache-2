40|$|Structural {{failure of}} a high {{pressure}} orifice flange of an oil refinery is studied by using visual inspection, optical and electron microscopy, tensile tests, fractography and stress calculation. This flange was located at a high pressure (2700 KPa), elevated temperature (370 CÂ°) <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>line.</b> Failure observed during a startup {{at the time of}} increasing pressure and temperature. The results of the analysis show that brittle fracture has acted as a main factor for failure of the structure and stress concentration together with corrosion have provided minor sources for the failure. These results indicate that brittle behavior of this flange can attribute to hydrogen embrittlement of the steel material...|$|R
40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how the feed flow from such a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). The feed flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements were performed with different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of the feed flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate the feed flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> average values of several parameters characterising the feed flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> are the same for different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the impeller speed is high, the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of the feed flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> opening and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

40|$|Experiments on semibatch {{reaction}} crystallization of {{benzoic acid}} are reported. The conditions in an agitated tank are simulated by a loop reactor by which feed point mixing conditions {{can be controlled}} separately from the macroscale circulation rate. Hydrochloric acid is fed into a circulating solution of sodium benzoate and the in#uence of macromixing, mesomixing and micromixing on the product crystal mean size is evaluated. The product mean size increases with increasing circulation rate in the loop, with increasing feed point mixing intensity, with decreasing feed rate and with decreasing <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter. Increased mixing intensity on any level leads to larger product crystals, but especially the rate of mesomixing is of importance. The in#uence of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is opposite to predictions by available theories and cannot be explained by backmixing into the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe.</b> All results can be correlated quite well against a dimensionless mixing e$ciency de"ned as {{the ratio of the}} reactant feeding time to the mixing time. The mixing time is the sum of the time constants for mesomixing and micromixing. A new mesomixing time constant is de"ned as being proportional to the ratio of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter and the velocity of the bulk #ow passing the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> 2001 Published b...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} seafood is {{continuously}} growing throughout the world, {{while the number}} of sheltered locations for fish farming is decreasing. Consequently, the industry is pushed to fin nd new and innovative solutions to this problem. One solution is to move the fish farms in non-sheltered locations, which requires extensive research on all structural parts of a fish farm, including components of the feeding system. The main goal of this thesis is to predict the hydrodynamic loads on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> used by fish farmers in the industry, which is an important aspect of design to assure successful operation. The aquaculture industry has expressed the need for increasing the knowledge on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> for fish farming. The bending of the pipes is of particular concern, especially when introducing non-sheltered locations. The hydrodynamic loads of the feed barge were obtained by generating a finite element model in GeniE and performing hydrodynamic analysis in frequency domain with the potential solver Wadam. The displacement RAOs of the feed barge were imported into OrcaFlex after conducting a sensitivity-and convergence study to verify the results. Dynamic simulations of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> were carried out in time domain using OrcaFlex, where the design basis was established using typical environmental and design data for Norwegian salmon farming. Analyses were performed under different sea states, investigating different responses of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Due to the limited work available on the force coefficients for floating pipes on the sea surface, a sensitivity study regarding the force coefficients was carried out. It was concluded to implement a variable data set for the drag-and added mass coe cient of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes.</b> The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in high loads for all <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths. The main problem that was found for the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> was the large bending moment at the connection points, i. e. at the fish cage and the feed barge. For this reason, bend stiffeners at the connection points were installed. A reduction of 846 % for the bending moment was observed with the bending stiffener attached to the pipe. To conclude, the dynamic analysis exhibits too large hydrodynamic loads for offshore use. The use of bending stiffeners seems inevitable for the harsh environment in the open sea. More research on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> must be carried out to secure safe operation offshore...|$|R

The result of LRUT is A-scan which shows relation between signal amplitude and <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> distance. Each high amplitude signals except spurious signals is produced by a <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> feature like weld, flange or a local (external/internal) corrosion.

40|$|Abstract: Gas {{hydrates}} are ice like crystals, {{but they}} are different in structure. gas hydrates formation in gas transporting <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> causes clogging the <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> and prevents transporting gas. therefore gas hydrates formation should be prevented because clogging price is high and itâs time- consuming. To stop gas hydrate formation in gas transporting <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> chemical inhibitors are used. These inhibitors are divided into thermodynamic and synthetic inhibitors. Synthetic inhibitors are used with low density and prevents making and growing of crystal hydrates. This article will focus on analyzing synthetic inhibitors, and their function the task orders are as followed: 1. Synthetic investigation of hydrate formation with and without presence of inhibitor. 2. Using Kashchiev- Firozabad model and experimental data of gas transporting <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> for drawing synthetic graphs of gas hydrates formation with presence of synthetic inhibitors...|$|R

The water requirement for each block is determined, and <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge. Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> and valves are fitted to control {{the flow of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves. In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.|$|R
