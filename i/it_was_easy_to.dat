5|$|The T-26 could cross 0.75m high {{vertical}} {{obstacles and}} 2.1m wide trenches, ford 0.8m deep water obstacles, cut 33cm thick trees and climb 40° gradients. Needless to say, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> drive.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, {{the latter was}} circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> perceive B.verticillata as falling {{within the range of}} variation of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E
5|$|Josh Weinstein {{has said}} {{that there are so many}} sleazy {{characters}} in The Simpsons that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find people for the scenes in the burlesque house. A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can also be seen. Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E

5|$|P. H. Vanderweyde {{noted that}} Crookes {{was already a}} believer in psychic powers before he {{obtained}} {{the results of the}} experiments. Vanderweyde stated the spring balance used in Crookes' experiment was unreliable as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> manipulate by deception and suggested he should repeat the experiment by using a chemical balance.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{find and}} kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} {{and later by}} Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, {{and it may have}} competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E

5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|When first {{described}} by the naturalist George Perry in 1810, the brolga was misclassified as a species of Ardea, the genus that includes the herons and egrets. It {{is in fact a}} member of the Gruiformes—the order that includes the crakes, rails, and cranes, {{and a member of the}} genus Antigone. The ornithologist John Gould used the name Grus australasianus when he wrote about it and noted it to be widespread in the north and east of Australia. He also recorded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tame, and that James Macarthur had kept a pair at his home in Camden. Calling it the Australian Crane, he mentioned that its early colonial name had been Native Companion. The Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union made brolga, a popular name derived from Gamilaraay burralga, the official name for the bird in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} the final {{production}} and release of the Thanhouser Company and {{it was to be}} released through Pathé. Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser. Q. David Bowers writes that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> understand Thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work, the New Rochelle studio was 2,500 miles {{from the center of the}} trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released, Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the bookkeeper, Jessie B. Bishop. The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan, the scenario writer of the company, had retired from the company. As it wound down, the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance. Little is known of the production of this final film, but it was directed by Emile Chautard from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The cameraman was Jacques Bizeul.|$|E

25|$|Due to poor {{banknote}} quality (both talonas {{and early}} litas) <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> counterfeit them.

It is estimated that their notes totaled 140,000 litas.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, a low-lying country, dams {{were often}} applied to block rivers {{in order to}} {{regulate}} the water level and to prevent the sea from entering the marsh lands.

25|$|Other early {{accounting}} records {{were also found}} in the ruins of ancient Babylon, Assyria and Sumeria, which date back more than 7,000 years. The people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth of crops and herds. Because there was a natural season to farming and herding, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> count and determine if a surplus had been gained after the crops had been harvested or the young animals weaned.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned. When an army unit goes {{against the grain of}} the pattern, he reasoned, it becomes conspicuous; to hide, it has to go with the pattern. He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E
25|$|Many of his {{prints and}} {{thousands}} of unpublished sketches were found in his estate after he died. They revealed more of the true depth of his work.

A set of prints that were acquired by William Benton from Marsh's wife are now all in the William Benton Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, and the Middendorf Gallery in Washington, D.C.|$|E

25|$|Brumowski {{continued}} amassing victories through May, {{ending the}} month {{with a total}} of eight. By now, he was flying a single-seat fighter, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I. Although better suited for air-to-air combat than the C.1, it still suffered three major disadvantages: the pilot's vision was partially obstructed; the single machine gun was not synchronized to fire through the propeller arc, and it was a difficult craft to fly because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> spin at any altitude. Aiming and firing a gun mounted above and ahead of the pilot was more difficult than simply aiming the airplane at the enemy and firing a synchronized gun.|$|E
25|$|The {{controllers}} were hard-wired to {{the console}} with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied {{directly from the}} Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even taking apart ones from American game consoles {{to see how they}} worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks left on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port {{on the front of the}} console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern and}} western sectors of Berlin were now {{completely}} separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass {{from one to the}} other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. During the Wall's existence there were around 5,000 successful escapes into West Berlin; 136 people were officially killed trying to cross (see Deaths at the Berlin Wall) and around 200 were seriously injured. The sandy soil under the Wall was both a blessing and a curse for those who attempted to tunnel their way to West Berlin and freedom. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> dig through quickly, it was also more prone to collapse.|$|E
