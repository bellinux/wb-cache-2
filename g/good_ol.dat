40|$|Abstract Highly de-bundled multiwalled carbon {{nanotube}} (MWCNT) polymer nanohybrids were obtained via ionic assembling {{of a novel}} POSS-polyimidazolium-ionic liquid (POSS = polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes) with oxidized MWCNTs. The synthesis, accomplished by a simple bilayer chloroform/water metathetical reaction process, was promoted by the high surfactant properties of POSS-imidazolium-polyionic liquid, which assisted the effective de-bundling, dispersion and purification of the as prepared POSS@MWCNT polymers in organic media, via a surface coating mechanism. The presence of remarkably intense radial breathing modes (RBMs) in Raman spectra, both in solution and as solid, corroborates {{the effectiveness of the}} de-bundling process induced by the amphiphilic POSS polymeric ionic liquid (polyIL). This was, further, substantiated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy images. The nonlinear optical (NLO) behavior of POSS@MWCNT was investigated by Z-scan technique, which revealed a remarkable susceptibility χ(3) of 2. 38 · 10 - 7 esu mainly due to a dispersive effect. A <b>good</b> optical limiting (<b>OL)</b> performance, under a 532 nm pulsed excitation, was observed as well...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} used both {{systemic}} and topical 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) -mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat oral precancers including oral leukoplakia (OL), oral erythroleukoplakia (OEL), and oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH) {{as well as}} oral cancers including oral verrucous carcinoma (OVC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Systemic ALA-PDT {{has been used to}} treat oral dysplastic lesions and oral cancers with promising clinical outcomes. The efficacy of a regular topical ALA-PDT (fluence rate, 100  mW/cm 2; light dose, 100  J/cm 2) was tested on an extensive buccal OVC and an enhanced topical ALA-PDT (fluence rate, 200  mW/cm 2; light dose, 200  J/cm 2) on an early-invasive OSCC; complete regression of the carcinomas was demonstrated after 28 and 18 PDT treatments, respectively. Several previous studies showed relatively <b>good</b> outcomes for <b>OL</b> lesions treated with topical ALA-PDT. However, {{it was found that the}} regular topical ALA-PDT is very effective for OVH and OEL lesions but less so for OL lesions. Better PDT outcomes are significantly associated with OVH and OEL lesions with smaller size, pink to red color, epithelial dysplasia, or thinner surface keratin layer. Moreover, the thicker surface keratin layer on the OL lesions is responsible for the relatively poorer PDT outcomes for OL lesions. In addition, both light emitting diode light- and laser light-mediated topical ALA-PDTs are comparative treatment modalities for OVH and OEL lesions. Methotrexate- or vitamin D 3 -preconditioned prostate or skin carcinoma cells can accumulate more intracellular protoporphyrin IX, resulting in an increased killing of these preconditioned cells by subsequent ALA-PDT. Because chemotherapy can help destroy carcinoma cells and tumor-associated vasculatures and cryotherapy pretreatment may help the diffusion of ALA into lesional epithelial cells, the chemotherapy or cryotherapy-combined topical ALA-PDT may be a new effective PDT alternative for treatment of oral precancers and cancers. It is concluded that topical ALA-PDT using either light emitting diode or laser light is very effective for OVH and OEL lesions but is relatively less effective for OL lesions. If OVC or early-invasive OSCC has no concurrent regional or distant metastasis, regular or enhanced topical ALA-PDT may have a high potential to treat these two particular kinds of oral cancer. A large-scale human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacies of drug-preconditioned topical ALA-PDT and chemotherapy or cryotherapy-combined topical ALA-PDT on oral precancers, OVC and early-invasive OSCC in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Let me {{get back}} to entry # 002, where I pointed out the value of {{distinguishing}} between inferential and descriptive techniques. I believe my first few tries at understanding statistics failed because I took classes that didn’t make this distinction. Consider <b>good</b> <b>ol</b> ’ ordinary least squares (OLS), which is often all the stats an undergrad will learn. Here are the steps: • Clean your data, producing an input matrix X and a dependent vector Y. This is via various computer-code matrix manipulations and substitutions for missing data. • Find the line of best fit, with coefficients β = (X ′ X) − 1 X ′ Y, using pure linear algebra. • Test the elements of β, using methods most folks recognize as statistical, regarding comparing a statistic against a distribution. The {{point here is that}} each of these steps is a different world from the others: computer trickery, linear algebra, and t-distributions basically have nothing in common. Like most undergrad courses, I’ll pass on the first step, and assume a perfect data set...|$|E
40|$|It {{is hard to}} {{talk about}} race. Discussions about race in general and racial {{discrimination}} in particular are potentially unnerving, which explains in large measure why such conversations are so few and far between. All too frequently, these discussions take place only after a horrific incident that draws public attention to race, such as the brutal dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Jasper, Texas, or the <b>Good</b> <b>Ol</b> Boy Roundup in Tennessee, or the white supremacist in Los Angeles who went on a racially motivated crime wave and murdered an Asian-American postal worker and shot at young children in a Jewish day care center.

It was in excellent condition and you can be assured that the contents received extra special attention. Altho [sic] most of us won’t be where we would like to be at Christmas time, we celebrate the best we can. We have just recently completed building a dayroom for after work leisure. It is a swell place to read, write and relax and listen to the brand new radio. The most important feature is the bar which serves the best beer and cognac. The whole set up is the envy of every other squadron on the field. Our group also runs an Enlisted Man’s club in the nearby city which is really ritzy. All the modern conveniences of a large hotel and the Saturday nite [sic] dance with the local belles is the highlight of the week. So you can see that things could be a lot worse, at least here.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} about teachers 2 ̆ 7 lives and careers is problematic. It often fails to involve teachers themselves (Schubert, 1991), specifically women (Miller, 1993; Noddings, 1989). Moreover, it is often written from an administrative, thus frequently white male perspective (Casey, 1992). If documentation about teachers may be race and gender biased, teachers 2 ̆ 7 voices must be included more {{if we are to}} interrupt inequities in schools and education research. Women teachers [...] the majority of whom are now 43 years of age (National Education Digest, 1996) [...] represent an important population. Their own experience with possible educational and professional inequities and the transitions typical of midlife and midcareer all could add interesting dimensions to their pedagogy and role modeling for adolescent students, particularly girls. ^ This was a qualitative research project based phenomenological interviews (Seidman, 1991) with eighteen participants. In three ninety minute segments, participants were asked to relate how they became teachers, to describe their jobs, and to reflect on the meaning they make of their careers. The diverse women were between thirty-five to forty-eight years old and have taught full time for at least fifteen years in urban and suburban high schools. Interviews were taped, transcribed and analyzed for thematic similarities and differences. Peer debriefing sessions were held at intervals. ^ Major themes from the data included women teachers as care-givers, their growing frustration with administrators over the course of their careers, and a perception that their achievements, experience, and professional opinions are often ignored. Participants expressed feeling powerlessness in often racist, sexist, homophobic work places frequently influenced by 2 ̆ 2 <b>good</b> <b>ol</b> 2 ̆ 7 boy 2 ̆ 2 networks. On the other hand, at midcareer these women have more confidence in their teaching and with themselves than ever before, and at midlife have developed a greater awareness of their own needs. Some have sought professional development and mentoring to stave off the effects of a flat line career and monotony which can typically accompany midcareer. To prevent 2 ̆ 2 burnout 2 ̆ 2 which can affect human service professionals (Maslach, 1981) most are redirecting energy from careers to self-care. The relationship between midlife teachers as models for adolescents in transition was not clearly established. ...|$|E
