40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the lunar gravity field have {{concluded}} that the lunar Moho is substantially uplifted beneath the young mul-tiring basins. This uplift is presumably due to the excavation of large quantities of crustal material during the cratering process and subsequent rebound of the impact basin floor. Using a new dual-layered crustal thickness model of the Moon, the excavation cavities of some nearside multiring basins (Grimaldi and larger, and younger than Tranquillitatis) were reconstructed by restoring the uplifted Moho to its preimpact location. The farside South Pole– Aitken (SPA) basin was also considered due to its importance in deciphering lunar evolution.

Ninety primary molars were selected from 30 children (10 males and 20 females) between the age group 6 and 9 years. Materials and methods: After caries <b>excavation,</b> <b>cavities</b> were evaluated for caries removal or clinical efficacy by the tactile and visual criteria, microbiological efficacy, time taken for the procedure.

We evaluated woodpecker nest <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> {{in relation to the}} nature and availability of decay in trembling aspen (Populustremuloides) using 12 years of nest and tree decay class data from British Columbia. We used a cavity-nest web to visually depict decay selection profiles for six woodpecker species and compared these woodpecker decay selection profiles to the availability of decay in aspen (96. 7 % of all cavity nests found), identifying the most suitable nest tree stages used by woodpeckers. The suitable woodpecker nest tree stage consists primarily of live unhealthy trees and recently dead trees (93. 9 % of active nests found in aspen). Compared to non-nest trees (trees within which no cavity nests were found during the study period), live trees that were used for nest <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> had higher annual probabilities of entering the suitable woodpecker nest tree stage than non-nest trees, and they also had a lower probability of progressing outside of this stage. This suggests excavation decisions involve a balance of competing tradeoffs between ease of excavation and tree security.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{structure of}} Cactus Crater, a 105 m diameter nuclear explosion crater formed in water-saturated carbonate rock of Eniwetok Atoll, is delineated using the high to low Mg calcite diagenetic transition as a stratigraphic tracer. Outside Cactus, this transition is observed as a discontinuous horizon {{which appears to}} be depressed, possibly {{as a result of the}} cratering event, near the crater. Beneath the crater, this transition occurs gradually over a 4. 5 ± 0. 5 m interval, leading to the following conclusions: material inside Cactus Crater underwent primarily in situ brecciation and mixing, the maximum depth of the <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity</b> is 20 m below sea level, and a fallback breccia lens, if it exists, has a maximum thickness of l m. A central uplift of 4. 5 ± 0. 5 m is inferred from the observation that the transition interval occurs at a 4 to 5 m greater depth at 1 / 2 crater radius than in the center. The excavation process, deduced from the Mg calcite transition as well as gamma well log data, involves high velocity injection of strongly shocked material to form the <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity</b> lining. The in situ brecciation and mixing appears to be a turbulent process, probably facilitated by fluidization of the carbonate rock. Based on the Mg calcite transition patterns beneath the crater floor, dynamic rebound is inferred as the modification mechanism for Cactus Crater. Using the Melosh Bingham model for dynamic rebound, a maximum strength of 1 bar is inferred for the cratered carbonate medium. This strength value is representative of clays, such as those in which Snowball, a chemical explosion crater having dimensions and features similar to Cactus', was formed.

Terrace blocks exposed upon a crater's interior walls are interpreted to be sections of the transient cavity rim that slumped into the cavity during the terminal stages of crater formation. Impact <b>excavation</b> <b>cavities</b> have been reconstructed by restoring the innermost terrace block exposed within a crater to its inferred original position at the cavity rim and accounting for the volume of material that slumped into the cavity. Critical model assumptions include (1) the radial variation of topography near the initial cavity rim crest, (2) {{the structure of the}} failure surface along which terrace blocks slumped into the cavity, and (3) the geometric shape of the initial cavity.

For a wide range of model parameters the reconstructed depths of impact cavities 15 - 30 km in diameter are significantly greater than depths predicted by small-crater morphometry, implying that cavity depths inferred from depth/diameter atios observed for small craters may substantially underestimate the depth of excavation of impact cratering events in this size class.

As this method does not rely upon filtering the Bouguer anomaly, which was required with previous inversions performed in the spherical-harmonic domain, and as the dramatic variations in spatial quality of the lunar gravity field are taken into account, our crustal thickness model more faithfully represents the available data. Using our model results, we investigate various aspects of the prominent nearside impact basins. The crustal thickness in the central portion of the Orientale and Crisium basins is found to be close to zero, suggesting that these basins could have conceivably excavated into the lunar mantle. Furthermore, given our uncertain knowledge of the density of the crust and mantle, {{it is possible that the}} Humorum, Humboldtianum, Nectaris, and Smythii basins could have excavated all the way through the crust as well. The crustal structure for most of the young impact basins implies a depth/diameter ratio of about 0. 08 for their <b>excavation</b> <b>cavities.</b> As noted in previous studies, however, the crustal structure of Imbrium and Serenitatis is anomalous, which is conceivably a result of enhanced rates of post-impact viscous relaxation caused by the proximity of these basins to the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.

Ejected material originates from an <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity</b> whose geometry is distinct from that of the transient crater.

When applied to Meteor Crater in Arizona, the model predicts 5 % of the primary ejecta, with an average fragment size of 1. 4 cm, to have fallen back into the crater, in agreement with empirical studies of the crater fallback deposit, thus indicating atmospheric deceleration to be the principal mechanism for fallback deposition on earth. The model also predicts the proportion of primary ejecta to be deposited as fallback to increase with <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity</b> diameter on the earth.

40|$|Abstract—We {{explored}} simple geologic {{strength and}} material response models {{to determine which}} {{have the capability to}} simulate impact-induced faulting, complicated ejecta patterns and complex crater shapes. This led us to develop models for material damage, dilatancy, and inhomogeneous materials (mixtures). We found that a strength degradation (damage) model was necessary to produce faulting in homogeneous materials. Both normal and thrust ring faults may occur and extend relatively deeply into the planet during the transient cavity radial expansion. The maximum depth of fault development is about the depth of maximum penetration by the projectile. Dilatancy in geologic materials may reduce the final bulk density compared to the pristine state because of irreversible fracturing. When we include the effects of dilatancy, the radial position of faulting is displaced because of greater upward motions. In addition, the late time crater profile is shallower and the expression of features such as central peaks and rings may be more pronounced. Both damage and rock-ice mixtures effect the distribution of ejecta. The excavation flow field within the heavily damaged region is similar to flow fields in Mohr-Coulomb materials with no zero-pressure strength. In the outer, less damaged zone within the <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity,</b> the material trajectories collapse back into the crater. This effect creates a zone of reduced ejecta emplacement {{near the edge of the}} final crater.

40|$|Red-cockaded {{woodpecker}} (Picoides borealis) {{adaptation to}} fire-maintained southern pine ecosystems has involved several important interactions: (I) {{the reduction of}} hardwood frequency in the pine ecosystem because of frequent tires, (2) the softening of pine heartwood by red heart fungus (Phellinus pini) that hastens <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> by the species, (3) the woodpecker 2 ̆ 7 s use of the pine 2 ̆ 7 s resin system to create abarrier against rat snakes (Elaphe sp.), and (4) the woodpecker as a keystone cavity excavator for secondary-cavity users. Historically, frequent, low-intensity ground tires in southern pine uplands reduced the availability of dead trees (snags) that are typically used by other woodpecker species for <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation.</b> Behavioral adaptation has permitted red-cockaded woodpeckers to use living pines for their cavity trees and thus exploit the frequently burned pine uplands. Further, it is proposed that recent observations of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) destruction of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities {{may be related to}} the exclusion of fire, which has increased the number of snags and pileated woodpeckers. Red-cockaded woodpeckers mostly depend on recl heart fungus to soften the heartwood of their cavity trees, allowing <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> to proceed more quickly. Red-cockaded woodpeckers use the cavity tree 2 ̆ 7 s resin system to create a barrier that serves as a deterrent against rat snake predation by excavating small wounds, termed resin wells, above and below cavity entrances.

Depending on the energy of planetary impacts and target properties, materials are driven out of the final crater via five possible mechanisms (Melosh 1989): (1) impact jetting during the initial contact between the impactor and target launches superheated uppermost target and minor impactor materials (Kieffer 1977); the jetted materials have small launch angles {{with regard to the}} target surface (<[*] 20 °) and large ejection velocities that may exceed several times the impact velocity (Kurosawa et al. 2015); so most of the jetted materials have escaped the target body if it is airless, and the rest are quickly quenched during the trajectory, forming impact glass; (2) vaporization of the projectile and target occurs during the early contact stage; the residual particle velocity and pressure gradient within the plume drives vapor expansion (Vickery 1986), and the micron-scale condensed droplets on Earth are formed by this process; (3) spallation caused by the interaction of shock waves and rarefaction waves launches target material from a shallow interference zone, where rarefaction waves arrive earlier than the peak of shock waves due to the nonzero rise time of the shock pulse; spall fragments launched by kilometer-scale lunar and Martian craters, together with acceleration by thermal expansion, can have velocities exceeding the escape velocity of the target body (Melosh 1984; Kurosawa et al. 2017); (4) the incompressible and subsonic excavation flows, which are initiated by shock waves and subsequently excited by rarefaction waves, are the major mechanism of excavating materials, and most of the excavated materials are deposited near the margin of the transient crater (Melosh 1989); (5) the collapse of the <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity,</b> intertwined with the formation of central peaks/rings, may push a small amount of mixtures of impact melt and clasts toward the crater exterior (Osinski et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the geology of multiring impact basins on the Moon {{over the past ten}} years has given us a {{rudimentary}} understanding of how these large structures have formed and evolved on the Moon and other bodies. Two-ring basins on the Moon begin to form at diameters of about 300 km; the transition diameter at which more than two rings appear is uncertain, but it appears to be between 400 and 500 km in diameter. Inner rings tend to be made up of clusters or aligned segments of massifs and are arranged into a crudely concentric pattern; scarp-like elements may or may not be present. Outer rings are much more scarp-like and massifs are rare to absent. Basins display textured deposits, interpreted as ejecta, extending roughly an apparent basin radius exterior to the main topographic rim. Ejecta may have various morphologies, ranging from wormy and hummocky deposits to knobby surfaces; the causes of these variations are not known, but may be related to the energy regime in which the ejecta are deposited. Outside the limits of the textured ejecta are found both fields of satellitic craters (secondaries) and light plains deposits. Impact melt sheets are observed on the floors of relatively unflooded basins. Samples of impact melts from lunar basins have basaltic major-element chemistry, characterized by K, rare-earth elements (REE), P, and other trace elements of varying concentration (KREEP); ages are between 3. 8 and 3. 9 Ga. These lithologies cannot be produced through the fusion of known pristine (plutonic) rock types, suggesting the occurrence of unknown lithologies within the Moon. These melts were probably generated at middle to lower crustal levels. Ejecta compositions, preservation of pre-basin topography, and deposit morphologies all indicate that the <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity</b> of multiring basins is between about 0. 4 and 0. 6 times the diameter of the apparent crater diameter. Basin depths of excavation can be inferred from the composition of basin ejecta. A variety of mechanisms has been proposed to account for the formation of basin rings but none of them are entirely plausible. Mechanisms can be divided into two broad groups: (1) forcible uplift due to fluidization of the target; (2) concentric, brittle, fracturing and failure of the target, on regional (megaterraces) to global scales (lithospheric fracturing). Most basin rings are spaced at a constant factor on all planets. Evidence supports divergent ringforming models, so it may be that the ring-locating mechanism differs from the ring-forming mechanism. Thus, large-scale crustal foundering (megaterracing) could occur along concentric zones of weakness created by some type of resonant wave mechanism (fluidization and uplift); such immediate crustal adjustment could then be followed by long-term adjustment of the fractured lithosphere...|$|E

This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on improving understanding of the composition {{and structure of the}} Moon's crust and the processes that have affected it over its history. This is accomplished through integrating remote sensing datasets with models of modifying processes such as basin-forming impacts and galactic cosmic ray radiation. I focus on two areas of active study for the Moon: the nature of the mafic component of the highlands crust, and the unique nature of the Moon's polar regions. The first part of this dissertation integrates three remote sensing data sets: 1) mineral maps derived from ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy from the Clementine mission, 2) neutron counts from the lunar surface from the Lunar Prospector neutron spectrometer, and 3) elemental abundances from the Lunar Prospector gamma ray spectrometer. Systematic discrepancies between the three datasets are identified and resolved, resulting in new abundance maps of the major lunar minerals (olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, and ilmenite) and an associated map of magnesium number for the mafic minerals. The second part of this dissertation employs the new mineral maps as constraints on mixing models. The mixing models assess contributions to the current lunar highlands crust of primary magma ocean anorthosites, later igneous products, and ultramafic mantle material excavated by large basins. We conclude that the magma ocean likely did not predominately produce anorthosites containing 15 vol% mafic minerals, and that the combined contribution to the highlands crust of ultramafic mantle material excavated by large basins and post-magma ocean igneous activity is between 15 and 45 vol%. The mixing models also support the conclusion of Weiczorek and Phillips (1999) that the <b>excavation</b> <b>cavities</b> of the largest lunar basins had depth-to-diameter ratios shallower than 1 / 10 (ratios between 0. 03 and 0. 07 are consistent with our mixing models). The final part of this dissertation uses the radiation transport code MCNPX 2. 6. 0 to model the radiation dose from galactic cosmic rays absorbed at different depths in the lunar regolith. We conclude that if simple ices are present in polar cold traps, they could have accumulated radiation doses equivalent to those used in experiments to stimulate synthesis of complex organic species...|$|R
50|$|The {{bird species}} red cockaded {{woodpecker}} (Picoides borealis) {{was once a}} common inhabitant since {{the demise of the}} ecosystem it has been placed on the federal endangered species list. The woodpecker adults are characterized by being 7 inches long, with a black head, white cheek patch, and barred back with black and white stripes that give the appearance of a latter. In males, a red strip atop the head is only visible when young or up close. This woodpecker carefully selects longleaf pine, or associated pine species of the area, for heart rot disease. Once a tree is selected, <b>excavation</b> of a <b>cavity</b> is achieved usually taking 2 years to complete.|$|R
40|$|The morphologic {{transition}} from complex impact craters, to peak-ring basins, and to multi-ring basins has been well-documented for decades. Less clear {{has been the}} morphometric characteristics of these landforms due to their large size {{and the lack of}} global high-resolution topography data. We use data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) instrument onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft to derive the morphometric characteristics of impact basins on the Moon, assess the trends, and interpret the processes involved in the observed morphologic transitions. We first developed a new technique for measuring and calculating the geometric/morphometric properties of impact basins on the Moon. This new method meets a number of criteria that are important for consideration in any topographic analysis of crater landforms (e. g., multiple data points, complete range of azimuths, systematic, reproducible analysis techniques, avoiding effects of post-event processes, robustness with respect to the statistical techniques). The resulting data more completely capture the azimuthal variation in topography that is characteristic of large impact structures. These new calculations extend the well-defined geometric trends for simple and complex craters out to basin-sized structures. Several new geometric trends for peak-ring basins are observed. Basin depth: A factor of two reduction in the depth to diameter (d/Dr) ratio in the {{transition from}} complex craters to peak-ring basins may be characterized by a steeper trend than known previously. The d/Dr ratio for peak-ring basins decreases with rim-crest diameter, which may be due to a non-proportional change in <b>excavation</b> <b>cavity</b> growth or scaling, as may occur in the simple to complex transition, or increased magnitude of floor uplift associated with peak-ring formation. Wall height, width, and slope: Wall height and width increase with increasing rim-crest diameter, while wall slope decreases; decreasing ratios of wall width to radius and wall height to depth may reflect burial of wall slump block toes by impact melt redistribution during transient cavity collapse. Melt expulsion from the central basin may help to explain the observed increase in floor height to depth ratio; such central depressions are seen within the largest peak-ring basins. Peak-ring height: Heights of peak rings increase with increasing rim-crest diameter (similar to central peak heights in complex craters); peak-ring height to basin depth ratio also increases, suggesting that floor uplift is even larger in magnitude in the largest peak-ring basins. No correlation is found between peak-ring elevation and distance to the rim wall within a single basin, suggesting that rim-wall slumping does not control the topography of peak rings. Offset of peak rings: Peak rings often show minor offset from the basin center. Enhancement in peak-ring elevation in the direction of offset is generally not observed, although this could be a function of magnitude of offset. Basin volume: Volumes of peak-ring basins are about 40 % smaller than the volumes predicted by geophysical estimates of the dimensions of corresponding excavation cavities. This difference indicates that collapse of the transient cavity must result in large inward and upward translations of the cavity floor. These new observations of geometric/morphometric properties of protobasins and peak-ring basins place some constraints on the processes controlling the onset and formation of interior landforms in peak-ring basins. Comparisons of the geometric trends of the inner rings of Orientale basin with those of peak-ring basins are generally consistent with a mega-terrace model for the formation of multi-ring basins.

40|$|This study {{reviews the}} overall {{ecological}} {{role of the}} Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in the southern pine ecosystem. It is the only North American woodpecker species to become well adapted to a landscape that was relatively devoid of the substrate typically used by woodpeckers for <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> (i. e. snags and decayed, living hardwoods). Its adaptation to use living pines for <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> has expanded {{the use of this}} fire-disclimax ecosystem for numerous other cavity-using species. As such, the Red-cockaded Woodpecker represents an important keystone species of fire-disclimax pine ecosystems of the South. Historically, populations of this woodpecker and other cavity dependent species decreased dramatically with the logging of the southern pine forests between 1870 and 1930. Woodpecker populations continued to decline into the 1980 s as a result of inadequate old-growth pine habitat, and suppression of fire which permitted encroachment of hardwoods into the previously pine-dominated ecosystem. Management practices initiated after 1988 have resulted in woodpecker population increases on Texas national forests. Cavity-tree mortality and southern pine beetle (Dendrocconus frontalis) infestation of cavity trees on the Angelina National Forest in eastern Texas were studied from 1983 through 1996. The intensive management activities initiated to stabilize severely declining woodpecker populations in 1989 may have increased beetle infestation rates of cavity trees in loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine habitat resulting in a net loss of cavity trees over the past seven years. Initial results suggest that beetle-caused mortality of cavity trees may be related in part to ambient southern pine beetle population levels in surrounding forest stands...|$|R
40|$|Indirect pulpcapping is {{the method}} for {{treating}} deep carious leasions by which some carious dentin {{is left in}} the cavity, {{in order to prevent}} exposure of the pulp. In this treatment a selective <b>excavation</b> of the <b>cavity</b> is essential.

40|$|Purpose: To {{verify the}} {{influence}} of cavity access diameter on demineralized dentin removal in the ART approach. Methods: 40 non-carious human premolars were randomly divided into four groups. The occlusal surface was ground flat and the teeth were sectioned mesio-distally. The hemi-sections were reassembled and occlusal access preparations were carried out using ball-shaped diamonds. The resulting size of the occlusal opening was 1. 0 mm, 1. 4 mm, 1. 6 mm and 1. 8 mm for Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Standardized artificial carious lesions were created and demineralized dentin was excavated. After <b>excavation,</b> the <b>cavities</b> were analyzed using: (a) the tactile method, (b) caries-detection dye to stain demineralized dentin, as proposed by Smales & Fang, and (c) Demineralized Tissue Removal index, as proposed in this study. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher, Spearman correlation coefficient, kappa, Kruskal-Wallis and Miller tests (P < 0. 05). Results: The three methods of evaluation showed {{no significant difference between}} Groups A vs. B, and C vs. D, while statistically significant differences were observed between Groups A vs. C, A vs. D, B vs. C and B vs. D.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} a micromechanical model {{to the analysis of}} <b>cavity</b> <b>excavation</b> in heterogeneous rocks by taking into account influences of mineralogical compositions. The Callovo-Oxfordian argillite is considered here in the context of feasibility studies for geological storage of nuclear waste storage. Based on the microstructural analysis, a micromechanical model is first proposed using nonlinear homogenization techniques for heterogeneous materials. The argillite is seen as a three phase composite with elastoplastic clay matrix, elastic damaged calcite grains and elastic quartz grains. Using the proposed model, the variations of elastic and plastic properties of material with mineralogical compositions at different depths are systematically taken into account. Comparisons between experimental data and model's predictions are presented. The proposed model, implemented into a finite element computation code, is finally applied to the analysis of excavation of a vertical shaft...|$|R
