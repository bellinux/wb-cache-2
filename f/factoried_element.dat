40|$|At present customers’ {{expectations}} {{have increased}} worldwide for practically all businesses. Quality and cost {{have become a}} requisite, with customers now expecting companies to offer more flexibility in terms of product mix, or improved speed of deliveries. Ecolab {{is a company that}} specialises in producing a range of liquid and cream sanitising products. They have addressed this situation by formulating plans to improve productivity of its two main production lines with an initial target of 3 - 5 % improvement by the end of 2014. For the long-term the company is targeting to achieve results of 75 % Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) in both of their main production lines Excel and Purdy. As a starting point in achieving this, the present dissertation reviews and investigates the current measurement system of Ecolab to determine its level of accuracy and the possibility of improving such system in order to have more accurate measures. Additionally, it aims identify unaccounted OEE losses in order to suggest improvements based on the Lean literature. The methodology used consisted of observation of the current state, an analysis of the information collected, and recommendations to help improve upon such issues. The results of the conceptual and empirical research pointed out alternative expressions to calculate OEE with potentially more benefits for the company in terms of visibility of the performance. The major issues affecting accuracy of OEE were related to the theoretical cycle time, and issues originated due to manual data collection. Suggestions such as standard-work and training are made to improve, it is also considered the implementation of software packages to automate data collection whose benefits can be highly favourable to the company in the long-term. In the research of unaccounted OEE losses it was found that minor stops are often not considered by operators. However, as they occur frequently their effects on productivity could be high at a long-term; as part of the suggestions to improve this, Lean techniques such as visual <b>factory</b> <b>elements,</b> 5 S, and super-market are considered. Finally, an approach to multi skill direct workforce is described as a way to reduce planned time by covering breaks and meetings.

40|$|Today, value {{chains are}} usually {{considered}} fractionally {{and on the}} basis of simplified model assumptions and can therefore only be regarded fractionally. Interactions between processes, materials, means of production and in this environment acting individuals as well as the effect of change on the product are usually not known exhaustively. In order to meet with these deficits, self optimizing production systems are used. These systems are a key technology, for raising the benefit of a value-chain oriented approach including identification and emphasis on valueadding talks as well as the planning efficiency by reutilisation of acquired knowledge and the application to similar and new production cases. They provide systems, that emulate the 'human' ability of reaching a decision with technical architectures. The goal of these novel approaches for production and assembly systems is to steadily analyze and evaluate the actual status in technological as well as in organisational areas and conduct a system adaption to alternating objectives. The cross-sectional fields of coordination, planning, steering and human-machine interaction determine the integrative frame of action of the self optimizing <b>factory.</b> Key <b>elements</b> for this purpose are the creation and implementation of cognitive mechanisms on the planning and organisational level across processes and process chains as well as the communicational ability of the participated entities...|$|R

We seek to benchmark stellar evolutionary models of low-mass stars. In particular, we measure the surface abundance of 12 C in thermally pulsing AGB stars with well-known mass and metallicity, which can be used to infer information about the onset and efficiency of the third dredge-up. Methods. We recorded high-resolution near-infrared spectra of AGB stars in the LMC cluster NGC 1978.

40|$|D. Ing. The {{construction}} industry {{has changed dramatically}} over the past thirty odd years. The following factors {{played a significant role}} in this change: (1) The building boom around the 1970 s pressurized the industry to work faster. This was followed by periods of variation in workload, which have over the last number of years manifested in a permanent low demand for construction in South Africa. (2) Projects became larger and more complex. (3) An over-regulated labour environment not only leads to the downsize of organizations, but is a main contributor towards the increased use of subcontracting. (4) The time value of money causes owners to specify compressed project schedules and lowest price is often the only selection factor in the award of contracts. The shift in work from predominantly public sector towards the private sector, which by nature is more time conscious, is another factor pressurizing the industry to work faster. The industry has introduced amongst others the following measures to cope with these demands: (1) Main contractors are subcontracting more and more of the work. (2) The traditional in-series concept came under pressure - the management approaches became formal procurement concepts and design-build re-appeared. (3) New construction techniques such as fast-tracking and the movement towards <b>factory</b> produced <b>elements</b> in certain areas, for example precast concrete elements, reduced project schedules and replaced previously time consuming activities and counteracted to a certain extent the shortage of skilled tradesmen. The author argues that in the process to combat these external pressures, the following problems, amongst others, manifested: (1) Ineffective project procurement. (2) Unethical and unsound practices between main contractors and subcontractors. (3) Lack of quality and reliability of a substantial share of end-products. Another problem burdening the industry is historical, namely cultural differences between designers and contractors...|$|R

It is an unusual story in that York practised the specialised skill of brass instrument making and repairing {{and was one of}} a handful of brass instrument makers known to have operated in Sydney at the time. At the end of the nineteenth century the significant purchasing power of an expanding Australian middle class, and a strong demand for the many musical instruments required for home entertainment, generated vigorous competition amongst Sydney’s music retailers. Cheaper British mass produced instruments were aggressively marketed by Palings and Nicholsons whose ‘emporiums’ were located at the more fashionable northern end of George Street. In order to succeed in this market, John York’s reputation as an instrument maker and repairer was paramount. This was largely founded on the promise of consistent, high quality workmanship and superior, personalised service. Even after his death in 1910, this enduring reputation sustained loyalty from York’s customers well into the middle of the twentieth century when the business continued under the management of his wife and sons...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the advent}} of precast {{construction}} technology, the construction industry has seen a rapid {{change in the way}} structures are built. Precast construction has brought down project costs and durations, increased the predictability and improved the quality of construction. It has also resulted in a shift in construction tasks from the construction site to the <b>factory</b> floor. Precast <b>elements</b> are manufactured and cured in controlled factory environments and are then transported to the construction site for assembly. This shift into the factory makes the process a viable candidate for automation. However {{due to the nature of}} the construction industry, it is important that the used automation technology be reconfigurable in a way that accommodates frequent changes in design and demand. The majority of precast elements currently used are made of reinforced concrete. This paper considers the unique constraints inherent in precast construction, and proposes a method to automate the production of precast concrete elements. Assembly and placement of rebar cages is an important step during the precast segment manufacturing process. An automated procedure for assembling the steel reinforcement cage for precast elements is described. This includes the placement of longitudinal reinforcement bars, followed by the placement and bending of transverse reinforcement. The entire design and analysis is conducted using Virtual Reality-assisted Virtual Prototyping to reach a favorable design for the proposed mechanism, without having to construct an actual prototype...|$|R
