5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that primordial black holes (PBHs) of roughly 30 solar masses could make up the dark matter and if so, might account for the recent detections by LIGO involving binary black holes in this mass range. It has also been argued that the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that reside at <b>galactic</b> <b>centers</b> may be surrounded by extremely-dense dark-matter spikes. Here we show that the rate for PBH mergers in these spikes may well exceed the merger rate, considered before, in galactic dark-matter halos, and may provide a plausible explanation for the current rate of detection of mergers of 30 -solar-mass black holes, even if PBHs make up a subdominant contribution to the dark matter.

5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic {{habitable}} zone {{was further}} developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the galactic halo would lack the heavier elements required to produce habitable terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} the galactic habitable zone. Being too close to the <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the galactic bulge.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the <b>galactic</b> <b>center.</b> While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
25|$|Observations by the European Space Agency's INTEGRAL {{satellite}} {{may explain}} the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the <b>galactic</b> <b>center.</b> The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of X-ray binaries (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly {{on one side of}} the <b>galactic</b> <b>center.</b> While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a stellar remnant.|$|E
40|$|Active Galactic Nuclei {{can produce}} {{extremely}} powerful jets. While tightly collimated, {{the scale of}} these jets and the stellar density at <b>galactic</b> <b>centers</b> implies {{that there will be}} many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the jet through stellar winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by a small number of high mass-loss stars. We construct a framework for jet mass-loading by stellar winds for a broader spectrum of wind mass-loss rates than has been previously considered. Given the observed stellar mass distributions in <b>galactic</b> <b>centers,</b> we find that even highly efficient (0. 1 Eddington luminosity) jets from supermassive black holes of masses M_BH 10 ^ 4 M_ are rapidly mass loaded and quenched by stellar winds. For 10 ^ 4 M_<M_BH< 10 ^ 8 M_, the quenching length of highly efficient jets is independent of the jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind mass-loading is unable to quench efficient jets from more massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of the inefficient M 87 jet, and implies a baryon dominated composition on scales 2 kpc therein even if the jet is initially pair plasma dominated.

40|$|Tracing {{the star}} {{formation}} history in circumnuclear regions (CNRs) {{is a key}} step towards understanding the starburst-AGN connection. However, bright nuclei outshining the entire host galaxy prevent {{the analysis of the}} stellar populations of CNRs around type-I AGNs. Obscuration of the nuclei by the central torus provides an unique opportunity to study the stellar populations of AGN host galaxies. We assemble a sample of 10, 848 type-II AGNs with a redshift range of 0. 03 < z< 0. 08 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 4, and measure the mean specific star formation rates (SSFRs) over the past 100 Myr in the central ∼ 1 - 2 kpc. We find a tight correlation between the Eddington ratio (λ) of the central black hole (BH) and the mean SSFR, strongly implying that supernova explosions (SNexp) {{play a role in the}} transportation of gas to <b>galactic</b> <b>centers.</b> We outline a model for this connection by accounting for the role of SNexp in the dynamics of CNRs. In our model, the viscosity of turbulence excited by SNexp is enhanced, and thus angular momentum can be efficiently transported, driving inflows towards <b>galactic</b> <b>centers.</b> Our model explains the observed relation λ∝ SSFR^ 1. 5 - 2. 0, suggesting that AGN are triggered by SNexp in CNRs.
