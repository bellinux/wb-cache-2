5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, <b>Galatea,</b> orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of <b>Galatea</b> helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and <b>Galatea</b> may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E
5|$|Making {{her second}} cruise against the British with President, Congress sailed from Boston on 8 October. On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue , which was escorting two {{merchant}} ships. <b>Galatea</b> and her charges were chased {{for about three}} hours, during which Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. In the meantime, President kept after <b>Galatea</b> but lost sight of her as darkness fell. Congress and President remained together during November {{but they did not}} find a single ship to capture. On their return to the United States they passed north of Bermuda, proceeded towards the Virginia capes, and arrived back in Boston on 31 December. During their entire time at sea, the two frigates captured nine prizes.|$|E

5|$|The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their {{existence}} is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several theories about the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of which holds that <b>Galatea</b> confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led {{to the conclusion that}} the rings are not in CIR with <b>Galatea.</b>|$|E
5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of <b>Galatea.</b> A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with <b>Galatea,</b> providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variable}} winds of 20 May, some ships were more heavily engaged than others {{and as a}} result the casualties in the action were unevenly spread. According to the French account of the battle, Renommée suffered 93 killed and wounded, including Commodore Roquebert dead and the first lieutenant and commander of the troops on board both badly wounded, although British accounts give a figure of 145 casualties. The French accounts also demonstrate that Néréide had suffered severely, losing 25 dead including Captain Lemaresquier and 32 wounded (again the British accounts differ, stating that she suffered 130 casualties). Clorinde, which had caused severe damage to <b>Galatea</b> while the British ship was immobile but had failed to support Renommée against Schomberg, lost just one man killed and six wounded. British losses were less severe, although still significant, <b>Galatea</b> losing 16 and 46 wounded, Phoebe seven dead and 24 wounded and Astraea two dead and 16 wounded. Racehorse, despite being badly damaged in her masts and rigging, reportedly suffered no casualties.|$|E
50|$|Aphrodite is {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} doves and roses - symbols commonly linked with the goddess - and the water at her feet, reminiscent of her birth, fully formed, from the sea. This also represents <b>Galatea's</b> birth, fully formed, as a woman. In a scene that is strongly evocative of Michelangelo's Creation painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, the goddess adds colour and sensuality to Pygmalion's austere studio and <b>Galatea's</b> soft flesh. The rich-colour drapery, wrapped suggestively around an intricately carved pole at left, is noticeably absent from the other images in the series.|$|R

50|$|<b>Galatea's</b> orbit lies below Neptune's {{synchronous}} orbit radius, {{so it is}} slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune's atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching.|$|R
5|$|American International Pictures {{secured the}} rights to have American actors Mark Damon and Boris Karloff while the French co-production company Societé Cinématographique Lyre secured Michele Mercier and Jacqueline Pierreux (the latter is {{credited}} under the pseudonym Jacqueline Soussard). Mercier had previously worked with director Mario Bava on his film The Wonders of Aladdin (1961). Italian production company <b>Galatea</b> had Susy Andersen cast while retaining Mario Bava who had directed their production of Black Sunday.|$|E
5|$|At a {{rehearsal}} {{for one of}} these entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and <b>Galatea</b> (1871).|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had a busy autumn. His play On Guard had an {{unsuccessful}} {{run at the}} Court Theatre, opening on 28 October 1871, while his most successful play to date, Pygmalion and <b>Galatea,</b> opened on 9 December, {{only a few days}} before rehearsals for Thespis were to begin. Sullivan, however, had more time on his hands after a Manchester production of The Merchant of Venice, for which he supplied incidental music, had its première on 9 September.|$|E

50|$|The {{story of}} the opera {{is based on the}} famous story of a king and sculptor, Pygmalion, {{originally}} taken from the tenth book of the Metamorphoses by Ovid. Pigmalione, dismayed that he may never find in real life the ideal of feminine beauty, creates a sculpture of it himself. Having fallen in love with his own creation, Pigmalione's prayer for the sculpture (christened <b>Galatea)'s</b> animation is answered by Venus.|$|R
5|$|In {{order of}} {{distance}} from Neptune, the regular moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, <b>Galatea,</b> Larissa, S/2004 N 1, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune's rotational period is 0.6713 day) {{and thus are}} being tidally decelerated. Naiad, the closest regular moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of S/2004 N 1), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named Courage, Liberté, Egalité1, Egalité2 and Fraternité (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity). The {{existence of}} arcs {{was difficult to}} explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of <b>Galatea,</b> a moon just inward from the ring.|$|E
5|$|Bennett edited {{some of the}} {{keyboard}} works of Beethoven and Handel and co-edited the Chorale Book for England with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), based on German hymns collected by Catherine Winkworth. He supervised the first British printed edition of the St Matthew Passion. A full vocal score (with piano accompaniment) was adapted from the German edition prepared by Adolf Bernhard Marx (Berlin 1830), which followed Mendelssohn's revival of the work; this was revised {{with reference to the}} score published by the Leipzig Bach Society in 1862. Bennett's additional tempo and dynamic markings were shown in parentheses for distinction. He provided harmonies for the figured bass both in the solo music sections (based on the Leipzig full score) and elsewhere. Bennett also produced editions of Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier and Handel's masque Acis and <b>Galatea.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1776, {{the ship}} was sent to North America {{under the command of}} Captain Thomas Jordan with a crew of 200. She took part in the capture of 30 American ships. An American naval {{squadron}} led by Samuel Elbert attacked the ship near St. Simons Island in {{what became known as the}} Frederica naval action. Although the Americans captured her other three escort ships, <b>Galateas</b> crew ran her aground and managed to escape without being captured.|$|R
50|$|Theocritus and Ovid have Polyphemus compare <b>Galatea’s</b> {{physical}} {{beauty and}} allusiveness to natural and pastoral phenomena. The lamenting of Polyphemus {{is marked by}} the statement of her rejection {{of him and his}} consequent despondence. In Theocritus, “Polyphemus’ four comparisons are with the daily business of agriculture and husbandry, made special nevertheless by the endearing simplicity of this Cyclops.” In contrast, Góngora portrays Polyphemous as deeply poetic and sophisticated despite his ferocious appearance, lifestyle and the egotistical/antisocial disposition.|$|R
50|$|<b>Galateas</b> main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two breech-loading (BL) 9.2 in Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL 6 in guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, {{most of which were}} mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water.|$|R
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune {{are made of}} {{extremely}} dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to that found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, <b>Galatea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rings were {{investigated}} in detail during the Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Neptune in August 1989. They were studied with optical imaging, and through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light. The spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries {{relative to the}} Sun, producing images of back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring's reflectivity on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including the Adams ring shepherd <b>Galatea.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} recriminations among the British squadron, Schomberg praising Astraea and Phoebe but omitting Racehorse and <b>Galatea</b> from the {{recommendations}} in his post-battle report. Captain Losack was particularly offended as Schomberg had implied that Galateas distress signal was an overreaction {{in the face}} of the enemy, despite her casualties being greater than the rest of the squadron combined. He subsequently requested a court martial to clear any suggestion of cowardice from his name but the Admiralty refused, commenting that they were fully satisfied with his conduct. Historian William James claims that opinion within the Navy was also with Losack and that Schomberg had been excessively harsh in his criticism.|$|E
40|$|Three {{new species}} of the ischnoceran louse genus Emersoniella (Phthiraptera) are {{described}} from four species of New Guinean kingfishers and kookaburras (Coraciiformes: Alcedinidae: Halcyoninae). They are: Emersoniella crassicarina n. sp. ex Dacelo gaudichaud Quoy & Gaimard (rufous-bellied kookaburra) and Dacelo leachii intermedia Salvadori (blue-winged kookaburra); E. reninoda n. sp. ex Melidora macrorrhina macrorhina Lesson (hook-billed kingfisher); and E. per-sei n. sp. ex Tanysiptera danae Sharpe (brown-headed paradise-kingfisher). In addition, we illustrate Emersoniella regis Emerson & Price, Emersoniella halcyonis Tendeiro, and the male genitalia of Emersoniella <b>galateae</b> Emerson & Price, {{as well as provide}} a complete host-louse checklist, and an updated key to all seven species of this genus...|$|R
50|$|<b>Galateas</b> boats {{captured}} the French corvette Lynx off Les Saintes on 21 January 1807. The boats, manned with five officers, 50 seamen and 20 marines, had to row for eight hours, {{mainly in the}} blazing sun, to catch her. During the action Lieutenant William Coombe, who had already lost a leg in a previous action, received a musket ball through the thigh above the previous amputation. The British only succeeded in boarding Lynx on their third attempt and a desperate struggle occurred on deck as {{the crew of the}} Lynx outnumbered their attackers. The British lost nine men killed and 22 wounded, including Coombe. The French had 14 killed and 20 wounded, including the captain.|$|R

5|$|After Brantinghame Hall closed, {{he again}} played Chrysos in {{a revival of}} Pygmalion and <b>Galatea</b> at the Lyceum Theatre and played Mr Barnes in his own play, To the Death, at the Olympic Theatre. He then {{appeared}} at the Comedy Theatre under Charles Hawtrey in Pickwick (1889), a successful one-act musical play by F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon based on an episode in The Pickwick Papers, which Barrington ended up directing and in which he alternated in the roles of Pickwick and Baker. Barrington then created the role of Lt. Col. Cadbury in a Grundy farce called Merry Margate and next played Tosser in a comic opera by Solomon and George P. Hawtrey called Penelope, in which he co-starred with Dan Leno. He also played {{a number of other}} roles in other theatres throughout 1889 until he rejoined D'Oyly Carte to create the role of Giuseppe in The Gondoliers in December 1889, remaining for the long run of that last Gilbert and Sullivan hit.|$|E
5|$|After some refitting, President, {{still under}} Rodgers' command, sailed on 8October with Congress, United States, and Argus. On 12October, United States and Argus parted from the {{squadron}} {{for their own}} patrols. On 10October, President chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17October President captured the British packet ship Swallow, which carried {{a large amount of}} currency on board. On 31October, President and Congress began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, and in that time Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. Meanwhile, President kept after <b>Galatea</b> and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night. Congress and President remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the Virginia capes; they arrived in Boston on 31December, having taken nine prizes. President and Congress found themselves blockaded there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1794, the {{squadron}} was {{under the command of}} Commodore Sir Edward Pellew in the frigate HMS Arethusa, accompanied by HMS Artois under Captain Edmund Nagle, HMS Diamond under Captain Sir Sidney Smith and HMS <b>Galatea</b> under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats. All four ships had specially selected crews and equipment and the squadron formed the elite force of the Channel Fleet's light warships. Pellew led his squadron out of Cawsand Bay on 19 October with the intention of cruising off the entrance to Brest and intercepting shipping entering or leaving the port. The French fleet, its principal squadrons blockaded in Brest, continued to send raiders to sea. One such ship, was the large newly commissioned 40-gun frigate Révolutionnaire under Captain Antoine René Thévenard with a hastily assembled and disaffected crew and a main battery of 18–pounder cannon, which departed from the Channel port of Le Havre on 13 October, sailing westwards towards the Atlantic.|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of Chappuis, 1954 (Copepoda, Harpacticoida, Latiremidae D. obscura D. <b>galateae</b> Cottarelli, 1971 are presented, based on topotype {{material}} from Sardinia and newly collected specimens from mainland Italy. Previous records of D. karamani Petkovski, 1957 from the Bulgarian Black Sea coast are based on misidentifications and should be attributed t D. obscura sp. nov. All three species are morphologically similar, and criteria based on meristic and ornamentation characters are provided to distinguish them. Examination of copepodid V intermoult stages provided {{new insights into the}} morphology of the highly transformed P 4 exopod of the adult male and its homology with reference to the female. A reassessment of the generic distinctiveness of Delamarella and the monotypic genus Latiremus Bozic, 1969 revealed that morphological criteria, traditionally employed to separate both genera, are all essentially unsound and based on erroneous reports in the literature. Consequently, Latiremus is relegated to a junior synonym of the type genus, leaving Delamarella and Arbutifera Huys & Kunz, 1988 as the only remaining valid genera in the family...|$|R
6000|$|She knew he {{referred}} to the schedules, based on the current prices of cotton, made out in the agent's office and sent in duplicate to the selling house, in Boston. She got them from the shelf; and as he went over them she heard him repeating the names of various goods now become familiar, pongees, poplins, percales and voiles, garbardines and <b>galateas,</b> lawns, organdies, crepes, and Madras shirtings, while he wrote down figures on a sheet of paper. So complete was his absorption in this task that Janet, although she had resented the insinuating pressure of his former attitude toward her, felt a paradoxical sensation of jealousy. Presently, without looking up, he told her to call up the Boston office and ask for Mr. Fraile, the cotton buyer; and she learned from the talk over the telephone though it was mostly about [...] "futures"--that Ditmar had lingered for a conference in Boston on his way back from New York. Afterwards, having dictated two telegrams which she wrote out on her machine, {{he leaned back in his}} chair; and though the business for the day was ended, showed a desire to detain her. His mood became communicative.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to all having different names, most warriors (usually high in rank) further their individuality by possessing a unique sword technique, fighting style, or yoki ability. The sword techniques are unique to the Claymores: yoma and awakened beings do not fight with swords and a normal human body could not perform them. Examples of sword techniques are: twisting the arm around and thrusting for a drill-like strike, unsheathing and re-sheathing the sword faster than the eye can see, or vibrating the sword so quickly the enemy cannot tell where the blade is coming from. A few fighting styles include: stretching the arm, fighting with two blades, and releasing a burst of yoki for a momentary burst of speed. For yoki ability, there are several Claymores who can sense yoki over vast distances and very accurately in close quarters. This appears to be, while not offensive, a very rare and valuable ability and the Claymores in the Organization with this ability are usually highly ranked. In addition, there are four Claymores that have offensive techniques that are yoki based. The first is <b>Galatea's</b> ability to control her opponents yoki for brief periods during battle, usually to cause the enemy's attack to miss. The second is Teresa's: her ability to sense yoki {{is so strong that}} she can sense it moving around her opponents body and can therefore sense how and when her enemy would attack next, a technique later copied by Clare. The third ability is that of Raftela who is able to manipulate the vision and movements of other Claymores. She is employed as an anti-training warrior.|$|R
