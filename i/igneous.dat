5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of europium in minerals {{relative to}} other rare-earth elements {{is known as the}} europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form <b>igneous</b> rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of <b>igneous</b> rocks.|$|E
5|$|His {{two best}} known {{contributions}} were {{his work on}} the Clinton iron ore and a 1927 monograph about the origins of alkaline <b>igneous</b> rocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 Alfred Harker {{published}} The Tertiary <b>Igneous</b> Rocks of Skye, {{the first}} detailed {{scientific study of}} an extinct volcano.|$|E
5|$|Palladium can {{be found}} as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum-group metals in placer {{deposits}} of the Ural Mountains, Australia, Ethiopia, North and South America. For the production of palladium, these deposits play only a minor role. The most important commercial sources are nickel-copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia. The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld <b>Igneous</b> Complex South Africa. The Stillwater <b>igneous</b> complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des Îles <b>igneous</b> complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States. Palladium {{is found in the}} rare minerals cooperite and polarite.|$|E
5|$|Starting 20 {{million years}} ago (in the Cenozoic) and lasting until 5 {{million years ago}}, a now-extinct {{extension}} of Cascade Range volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of <b>igneous</b> material in the area. These <b>igneous</b> deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides have {{a diverse}} geology {{ranging in age}} from Precambrian strata that are amongst the oldest rocks in Europe to Paleogene <b>igneous</b> intrusions.|$|E
5|$|This variety has a closed, bulb-like rosette {{of winter}} leaves which are {{acicular}} (pointy) at the tip. It tends to grow on <b>igneous</b> substrates.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is the ninth-most {{abundant}} {{element in}} Earth's crust (0.63% by mass) and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most <b>igneous</b> rocks, in sediments derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water. Of the 801 types of <b>igneous</b> rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.|$|E
5|$|Argon-39, with a {{half-life}} of 269 years, {{has been}} used for a number of applications, primarily ice core and ground water dating. Also, potassium–argon dating and related argon-argon dating is used to date sedimentary, metamorphic, and <b>igneous</b> rocks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Igneous</b> {{activity}} {{associated with}} this stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago. Sedimentation is concentrated in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of {{more or less the}} same valley floor elevation over time.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{production}} has greatly increased {{since the end}} of World War II. The metal is separated from other elements in <b>igneous</b> minerals. The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450°C.|$|E
5|$|The Hebridean {{archipelago}} outlier of St Kilda {{is composed}} of Paleogene <b>igneous</b> formations of granites and gabbro, heavily weathered by the elements. These islands represent {{the remnants of a}} long extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately 40m (130ft) below sea level.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of <b>igneous</b> rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|Thompson's Walls {{consists}} of two 19th-century farm cottages {{and a group of}} farm buildings, notable for being built entirely of hard, <b>igneous</b> rock. Andesite was quarried, and was used in the construction of Yetholm church.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: <b>igneous</b> deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld <b>Igneous</b> Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive <b>igneous</b> rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, <b>igneous</b> lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion years ago. It is {{composed}} of a metamorphic and <b>igneous</b> platform which {{is the basis of}} the continental shield. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as sandstones, limestones and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{production}} of the Anahim hotspot has shifted from more felsic to more mafic compositions in the last 3.0million years. For instance, much of the magma created between 3.0and 0.33million years ago was <b>igneous</b> phonolite, trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt and basanite; the volcanoes built during this period are almost entirely made of these rock types. Other <b>igneous</b> rocks such as phonotephrite are present in smaller quantities; these occur in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. Volcanic eruptions in the last 0.33million years have been mainly basanitic and have occurred at the youngest eruptive centre, Nazko Cone. Basanites produced by these eruptions are significantly more undersaturated than basalts from older Anahim volcanoes {{in the west and}} may indicate an eastward shift toward a deeper or less depleted mantle source. It is also possible that as the North American Plate moves over the Anahim hotspot, it underlies thinner continental crust. The overall chemistry and mineralogy of the Anahim magmas are analogous to regions of incipient continental rifting above a mantle plume.|$|E
5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. <b>Igneous</b> rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils {{have been found in}} the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.|$|E
5|$|Most of Gyeongju {{lies in the}} Gyeongsang Basin, but a {{few areas}} of the city belong to the Pohang Basin, such as Eoil-ri and Beomgok-ri in Yangbuk-myeon, and part of Cheonbuk-myeon. The Gyeongsang Basin areas consist of Bulguksa {{intrusive}} rock penetrating layers of sedimentary rocks, mainly granite and porphyry. By contrast, the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era, which consist of <b>igneous</b> rock, aqueous rock, porphyry, sandstone, and tuff.|$|E
5|$|Mount Elbert is {{composed}} largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various <b>igneous</b> intrusions including pegmatite, {{as well as}} bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which {{can be attributed to}} its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Ore {{deposits}} of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits {{have been found}} in the norite belt of the Bushveld <b>Igneous</b> Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa; the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States; the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario, Canada; and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle {{onto the surface of}} the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. <b>Igneous</b> intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{specialized}} in petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. He showed the sedimentary origin of iron ore deposits near his native Clinton, New York, mapped the geology {{of the western}} Adirondack Mountains, and published a well known monograph {{on the origins of}} alkaline <b>igneous</b> rocks. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America.|$|E
5|$|Spectra {{taken of}} this crater during the Clementine mission {{were used to}} perform mineral mapping. The data {{indicated}} that the central peak {{is a type of}} rock called anorthosite, which is a slow-cooling form of <b>igneous</b> rock composed of plagioclase feldspar. By contrast the outer wall is troctolite, a rock composed of equal parts plagioclase and olivine.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade metamorphic rocks. Many of {{the rocks}} of the Blue Ridge {{appear to be the}} metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Others are metamorphosed <b>igneous</b> rocks, including Corbin metagranite, Fort Mountain gneiss, varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks, and the metavolcanic rocks of the Gold Belt.|$|E
5|$|The Highlands and Islands lie to {{the north}} and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely {{comprises}} ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian, which were uplifted during the later Caledonian Orogeny. It is interspersed with <b>igneous</b> intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} parts of Van Cortlandt Park have a varied geology. The Northwest Woods and Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway have a steep terrain dotted with Fordham gneiss, a metamorphic rock that {{is very hard to}} weather. The Tibbetts Brook valley is set in Inwood marble, which weathers more easily. The east side of the park near Indian Field contains Yonkers granite, an <b>igneous</b> rock that mixed with Fordham gneiss as a hot magma before later cooling.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating {{the age of the}} earliest <b>igneous</b> rocks and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium–thorium dating, uranium–lead dating and uranium–uranium dating. Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets in the making of high-energy X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{primarily}} composed of granite of 59.8 ± 0.4 – 58.4 ± 0.4 million years (from the Palaeocene epoch), with slate {{at the southern}} end; the plateau soil is mainly loam, with some peat. Among the <b>igneous</b> dykes cutting the granite are a small number composed of a unique orthophyre. This was given the name Lundyite in 1914, although the term– never precisely defined– has since fallen into disuse.|$|E
5|$|These Precambrian <b>igneous</b> and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is {{the only}} known intact {{asteroid}} that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with <b>igneous</b> histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.|$|E
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield <b>igneous</b> rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon <b>igneous</b> rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in <b>igneous</b> bedrock {{at a depth of}} about 500 meters in 2001. The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, was under construction at the site in 2012.|$|E
