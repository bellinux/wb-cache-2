5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E

In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008.

As shown by near-infrared spectroscopy on these samples, H 2 O molecules are the predominant hydrous species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water-rich <b>glasses</b> whereas OH groups bound to tetrahedrally coordinated cations are predominant at low water contents. Backscattering and time-of-flight methods were combined to investigate motional correlation times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range between 0. 2 ps and 2 ns. For <b>the</b> water-rich <b>glasses</b> an elastic scan between 2 K and 420 K shows that the dynamical processes set in at lower temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ca-bearing <b>glass</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Na-bearing <b>glass.</b> This is corroborated by the broadening of the inelastic spectra S(Q,ω). The shape of the scattering function S(Q,t) suggests a distribution of activation barriers for the motion of hydrous species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disordered structure of <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> <b>The</b> distribution is narrower and the average activation energy is smaller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ca-bearing <b>glass</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Na-bearing <b>glass.</b> No indication for dynamics of hydrous species was found at temperatures up to 520 K <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water-poor <b>glass</b> NaAlSi 3 O 8 ⋅ 0. 3 H 2 O containing dissolved water mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of OH groups.
