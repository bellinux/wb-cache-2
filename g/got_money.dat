25|$|Malcolm X is {{the first}} non-documentary, and the first American film, to be given {{permission}} to film in Mecca (or within the Haram Sharif). A second unit film crew was hired to film in Mecca because non-Muslims, such as Lee, are not allowed inside the city. Lee fought {{very hard to get}} filming in Mecca but Warner Bros. initially refused to put up the money for location shooting. New Jersey was considered for filming the Mecca segments. In the end, Lee <b>got</b> <b>money</b> and permission together for filming in Mecca.|$|E
25|$|Briggs {{took over}} the Bureau during {{difficult}} times. It was {{the height of the}} depression and his first task was to reduce costs 50%. He managed to save the jobs of about 2/3 of the career employees by putting many on part-time employment and transferring others to the American Standards Association while they continued their work at the bureau. He emphasized doing work with direct economic impact and <b>got</b> <b>money</b> from the Works Progress Administration to hire unemployed mathematicians to develop math tables. Due to Briggs outstanding persuasive powers, he managed to get Congress to increase its appropriation for the Bureau in 1935, and many of the employees that were let go were re-hired.|$|E

The song opens with Bieber using a lower-register and breathy vocals while rapping, [...] "If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go/ I can take you places you ain’t never been before/ Baby, take a chance or you’ll never ever know/ I <b>got</b> <b>money</b> in my hands that I’d really like to blow/ Swag, swag, swag on you/ Chillin' by the fire while we eatin’ fondue." [...] As the chorus follows, he adopts a Michael Jackson similar falsetto, and sings about being [...] "everything you want".|$|E

500|$|The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} LaRouche {{and his staff}} solicited US$34million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed [...] "reckless disregard for the truth". In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, [...] "Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants <b>got</b> <b>money,</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent, what they did with that money when they got it... The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren't true." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "New Guy" [...] {{was released on}} 14 June 2015 through Sarkodie's official YouTube account; a sneak peek of the video's production was released one month prior to create hype for its release. It was directed by Justin Campos from Gorilla Films, while its production was administered by his wife, Candice Lee Campos. Much like the song, the two singers take turns performing their verses while standing in dark-coloured rooms. Ace Hood appears without a shirt and stands next to Sarkodie while visual of female dancers performing choreography are randomly displayed. Towards {{the end of the}} video, they appear outside wearing black and white suits; Sarkodie's T-shirt from earlier is shown and displays: [...] "They <b>got</b> <b>money</b> for wars but can't feed the poor", which is a lyric from 2Pac's 1993 single [...] "Keep Ya Head Up".|$|E
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, {{let me tell you}} something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that <b>got</b> <b>money</b> like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whom {{shall we}} in future trust? Here is Sir Morton Peto, saying expressly, ‘These {{debentures}} are not debentures; I {{do not know}} what they are, but debentures they are not. I <b>got</b> <b>money</b> on them, it is true, but they are not worth anything. They are only quasi things, and the good debentures are elsewhere.’ We have never seen the whole basis of railway credit so rudely shaken. We could not have believed that such a defence could have been offered. How is Lombard-street ever to rely on having good debentures, when it finds men of the greatest repute and the highest standing offering it documents so very like debentures, but after all not real? ... Of course the company was primarily responsible; but Sir Morton Peto was acting as their trusted financial agent, ... and therefore he must be held responsible, not of course exclusively, but conjointly with those with whom he acted." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the {{character}} was romantically paired with gangster Andy Hunter, played by Michael Higgs. In the storyline, Sam {{had been left}} {{in charge of the}} various Mitchell business and properties, and Andy, sensing an opportunity to gain control of these assets, proposed to Sam. According to Medcalf, Sam needed the marriage because she was [...] "vulnerable". She added, [...] "Andy is tough and she craves someone to look after her. I can see why she'd go for him; he's a good-looking guy, he's <b>got</b> <b>money,</b> he wears good clothes - he ticks every box." [...] 11 million viewers watched Sam marry Andy in September 2004. According to Medcalf, [...] "She knows that he's not desperately in love with her, but she thinks that it's enough. She's desperately in love with him. She's entering it very positively [...] Sam's not the brightest person, so she falls for his manipulations [...] I think she just wants to get the ring on her finger and then they can try to iron out any problems. She's a little naive." [...] The marriage lasted mere months on-screen; when Sam was conned into giving away all her family's properties, including her mother's public house (pub), The Queen Vic, Andy threw her out of their house.|$|E
