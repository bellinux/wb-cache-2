5|$|Belldandy is {{regarded}} by commentators {{as an example}} of the magical girlfriend character, and comparisons have been drawn with the characters of Samantha from Bewitched and Jeannie from <b>I</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> Jeannie. The character's very conservative nature, however, which almost completely subordinates her to her fictional boyfriend, Keiichi, has led to some concerns from critics and has polarized the audience.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote, [...] "'Je Souhaite' {{offers a}} few laughs but little drama and no {{intellectual}} substance.

500|$|The [...] "magical girl" [...] character, {{of which}} Belldandy is an example, {{typically}} combines powerful abilities with very feminine characteristics. For Western audiences, a comparison {{can be drawn}} with the characters of Samantha Stephens from Bewitched and Jeannie from <b>I</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> Jeannie. As such, Belldandy is depicted as being very sweet and exceptionally kind-hearted, with very [...] "old-fashioned" [...] sensibilities. Combined with domestic skills portrayed through the series and her loyalty to Keiichi, this makes her {{a classic example of}} the concept of Yamato Nadeshiko.|$|E
500|$|The Love-matic Grampa is {{a parody}} of fantasy sitcoms such as Mister Ed, <b>I</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> Jeannie and Bewitched as well as having {{similarities}} to My Mother the Car.

500|$|Directed by Mike Kim {{and written}} by Brian Scully, {{the title of}} the episode refers to the {{television}} series <b>I</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> Jeannie.

The episode guest starred Chris Cox, Ike Barinholtz, Amanda MacDonald, Niecy Nash, Sulkin and Paris and Perez Hilton.

500|$|The episode's {{name is a}} play of {{the title}} of the NBC sitcom, <b>I</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly {{identical}} to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the characters destroy a printer, including use of the same song. Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends [...] "got wrecked on Southern Comfort" [...] before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the American people that going to war was correct because he answers to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to disagree with him, similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno.|$|E
