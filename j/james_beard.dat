500|$|Angels {{on horseback}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with devils on horseback. The latter dish, which is derived from the former, uses fruit, typically prunes or dates. American and British chefs including Martha Stewart and Martin Blunos recognise the distinction between the dishes, and though food writer John Ayto does too, he notes that the names have often been used interchangeably.

This natural tinting {{may have been the}} source for the name [...] "red velvet", as well as [...] "Devil's food" [...] and similar names for chocolate cakes. Contemporarily, chocolate has often undergone Dutch processing, which prevents the color change of the anthocyanins.|$|R
