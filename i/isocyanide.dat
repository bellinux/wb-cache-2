25|$|The Van Leusen {{reaction}} {{can be used}} to form pyrroles, by {{reaction of}} tosylmethyl <b>isocyanide</b> (TosMIC) with an enone in the presence of base, in a Michael addition.

25|$|HCN {{is formed}} in {{interstellar}} clouds {{through one of}} two major pathways: via a neutral-neutral reaction (CH2 + N → HCN + H) and via dissociative recombination (HCNH+ + e− → HCN + H). The dissociative recombination pathway is dominant by 30%; however, the HCNH+ must be in its linear form. Dissociative recombination with its structural isomer, H2NC+, exclusively produces hydrogen <b>isocyanide</b> (HNC).|$|E

50|$|Akin to carbon monoxide, <b>isocyanides</b> are {{described}} by two resonance structures, {{one with a}} triple bond between the nitrogen and the carbon and one with a double bond between. Surprisingly, the second one, with a carbenic character is the more important. Nevertheless, the π lone pair of the nitrogen, responsible of the zwitterionic structure, stabilizes the structure and is responsible of the linearity of <b>isocyanides.</b> <b>Isocyanides</b> are best shown as a mixture of both resonance structures. They are susceptible to polymerization.|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{asymmetric synthesis}} of -sulfinylamino <b>isocyanides</b> is {{reported on the}} basis of the highly diastereoselective addition of 9 -isocyanofluorene to optically pure N-tert-butanesulfinimines. The resulting optically pure <b>isocyanides</b> readily cyclized to give optically pure 2 -imidazolines upon removal of the sulfinyl group. Furthermore, the -sulfinylamino <b>isocyanides</b> were used as chiral inputs in Ugi and Passerini multicomponent reactions to generate new types of (pseudo) peptide scaffolds. Optically pure -sulfinylamino <b>isocyanides</b> are synthesized in a highly diastereoselective addition of 9 -isocyanofluorene with N-tert-butanesulfinimines. Follow-up chemistry demonstrates that they are excellent precursors for the preparation of optically pure 2 -imidazolines. Furthermore, they are applied in Ugi and Passerini multicomponent reactions; TMSOTf = trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, DIPEA = N,N- diisopropylethylamine.

50|$|<b>Isocyanide</b> based MCRs {{are most}} {{frequently}} exploited because the <b>isocyanide</b> is an extraordinary functional group. It is believed to exhibit resonance between its tetravalent and divalent carbon forms. This induces the <b>isocyanide</b> group to undergo both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions at the CII atom, which then converts to the CIV form in an exothermic reaction. The occurrence of isocyanides in natural products has also made it a useful functional group. The two most important isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions are the Passerini 3-component reaction to produce α-acyloxy carboxamides and the Ugi 4-component reaction, which yields the α-acylamino carboxamides.|$|E
