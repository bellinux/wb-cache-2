5|$|Cornwallis {{refused to}} attend the {{surrender}} ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who {{shook his head and}} pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final bout {{of the main}} card was the UFC Middleweight Championship match between Anderson SIlva and Chael Sonnen, {{regulated}} by referee Yves Lavigne. As the fight <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> place, Sonnen quickly took the champion down {{in the first round}} and maintained a dominant position throughout, eventually gaining full mount while attacking with ground-and-pound.|$|E
5|$|In 1768 {{the family}} <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> up {{residence}} in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, Tech's fortune turned. Late {{in the third}} quarter, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Miami's offense again, but instead of {{receiving}} the punt cleanly, the Hokies committed a roughing the kicker penalty that allowed Miami to retain possession of the ball with a first down. A few plays later, Miami scored its first touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter Miami <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> the lead on a 10-play, 70-yard drive. The Hokies were unable to answer the Hurricanes' score, and Miami won the 1966 Liberty Bowl, 147.|$|E
5|$|The {{band had}} also {{incurred}} heavy legal {{expenses for the}} Penis Envy prosecution; this, combined with exhaustion and the pressures of living and operating together, <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> its toll. On 7 July 1984, the band played a benefit gig at Aberdare, Wales, for striking miners, and on the return trip guitarist N. A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{capitulation}} at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional {{forces with}} which he could end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted {{what would have been}} a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.|$|E

5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the seasons which did not feature post-season fights between the coaches, several seasons have been impacted, forcing postponements. Due to injuries to the season six coaches Matt Serra and Matt Hughes, their fight was postponed. Serra suffered a herniated disc in his lower back and Hughes later suffered a torn MCL before the fight <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> place at UFC 98. The fight between season ten coaches Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson took place at UFC 114 with Rashad Evans winning by unanimous decision. The fight was postponed by five months due to Jackson's A-Team filming commitments and his temporary decision to retire from fighting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end of}} 1277 Constantine Tikh <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> {{measures}} to confront the rebels. He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he had to travel in a chariot because of his injury. Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force, killing many of the emperor's close associates, {{while the rest of}} the army joined the rebels. Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh, claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle. After his triumph, Ivaylo began to seize the country's fortified cities, which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one. By the spring of 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of Empress Maria.|$|E
5|$|Joan outlived Elizabeth, and in {{the event}} Sir Hugh Luttrell, who was Henry V's seneschal in Normandy, <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> over the castle on Joan's death in 1404. The castle had {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} investment during the final years of the Mohan's ownership, and Luttrell repaired and extended the castle at a cost of £252, constructing the Great Gatehouse and a barbican between 1419 and 1424. The new entrance lay at right-angles to the old and was three storeys high, built of imported Bristol red sandstone, and contained extensive apartments; it formed a grand, if ill-defended, ceremonial route into the castle. The castle was reroofed with Cornish stone tiles. By the 15th century the sea had receded, and the Luttrells created a deer park for the castle at Marshwood. Such a park would have been highly prestigious and allowed the Luttrells to engage in hunting, providing the castle with a supply of venison as well as generating income.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim, St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri, St. Andrew's Church at Bandra, and Gloria Church at Byculla. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The British were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognized its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land-attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} {{change of}} colonial administrators, {{and the corresponding}} reissue of encomienda licenses to relatives {{and friends of the}} incoming official, prolonged the instability in the province of Chiapa. In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} wind shear <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's {{convection}} began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed {{to have been}} an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660miles (1060km) southeast of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Under the Congressional {{calendar}} of the 1860s, {{members of the}} 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863; by the time Blaine <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> his seat that month, the Union had turned the tide in the war with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. As a first-term congressman, he initially said little, mostly following the administration’s lead in supporting the continuing war effort. He did clash several times with {{the leader of the}} Republicans' radical faction, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, firstly over payment of states' debts incurred in supporting the war, and again over monetary policy concerning the new greenback currency. Blaine also spoke in support of the commutation provision of the military draft law passed in 1863 and proposed a constitutional amendment allowing the federal government to impose taxes on exports.|$|E
5|$|When his men <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> the hill, 15 Germans {{had been}} killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and {{kept him out of}} combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.|$|E
5|$|York's second {{protectorate}} {{that followed}} was even shorter-lived than the first. At the parliament of February 1456 the king – {{now under the}} influence of Queen Margaret – resumed personal government of the realm. By this time Warwick had taken over Salisbury's role as York's main ally, even appearing at that same parliament to protect York from retributions. This conflict was also a pivotal period in Warwick's career, as it was resolved by his appointment as Constable of Calais. The post was to provide him with a vital power base in the following years of conflict. The continental town of Calais, conquered from France in 1347, was not only of vital strategic importance, it also held what was England's largest standing army. There were some initial disputes, with the garrison and with the royal wool monopoly known as the staple, over payments in arrears, but in July Warwick <b>finally</b> <b>took</b> up his post.|$|E
