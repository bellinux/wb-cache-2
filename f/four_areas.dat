5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines {{takes place}} in <b>four</b> <b>areas</b> of 21st-century Los Angeles: Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown. Set in the World of Darkness, the game depicts {{a world in which}} vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to {{maintain}} their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity). The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.|$|E

40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey was}} carried out in <b>four</b> <b>area</b> councils (Abuja Municipal, Kuje, Gwagwalada, and Kwali) of the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja) to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Newcastle disease virus in local chickens using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests. In each area council, one hundred sera samples were collected from apparently healthy local chickens with no history of vaccination. Abuja Municipal, Kuje, Gwagwalada, and Kwali area councils had prevalence of 37, 44, 79, and 68 %, respectively. The overall prevalence of antibody to Newcastle disease in the <b>four</b> <b>area</b> councils was 57 %.

25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with <b>four</b> <b>areas</b> unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that <b>four</b> <b>areas</b> cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

40|$|T {{his paper}} investigates {{the effects of}} HVDC link in {{parallel}} with HVAC link on automatic generation control (AGC) problem for a multi-area power system taking into consideration system parameter variations. A fuzzy logic controller is proposed for <b>four</b> <b>area</b> power system interconnected via parallel HVAC/HVDC transmission link which is also referred as asynchronous tie-lines. The linear model of HVAC/HVDC link is developed and the system responses to sudden load change are studied. The simulation studies are carried out for a <b>four</b> <b>area</b> interconnected thermal power system. Suitable solution for automatic generation control problem of <b>four</b> <b>area</b> electrical power system is obtained by means of improving the dynamic performance of power system under study. Robustness of controller is also checked by varying parameters. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} scheme works well. The dynamic analyses have been done with and without HVDC link using fuzzy logic controller in Matlab-Simulink. Further a comparison between the two is presented and {{it has been shown that}} the performance of the proposed scheme is superior in terms of overshoot and settling time. </span...|$|R
