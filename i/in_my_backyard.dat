I reference traditional tattoo imagery, Historical printmaking techniques, Mexican-American heritage, Heavy metal music, Pagan symbolism and 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s horror films.

Suddenly I thought I’ve been wasting my time trying to like hardcore punk and here’s this thing that was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>backyard</b> that I was totally unaware of. From there on I started looking for more bands like that. Then you get into The Cramps and all of these other things that kind of ride that line, that are really good, gritty rock‘n’roll, but are also on the outside of culture, like punk. So that was a real eye opener. I continued to hunt records in thrift stores and junk shops." [...] http://turnit-down.blogspot.com/2009/07/greg-cartwright-interview-reigning.html ...|$|R
