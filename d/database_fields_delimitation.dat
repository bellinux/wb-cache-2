40|$|In recent years, data {{warehouses}} {{have reached}} a prominent position in the <b>database</b> <b>field,</b> especially in the database industry.

In this paper, an integrated database architecture in which data warehouses {{are part of the}} database is put forward. Instead of having data warehouses built using a database, we propose to have data warehouses defined as part of the database architecture; this architecture is defined as an extension of a federated database architecture. 1 Introduction The main motivation {{of this paper is to}} put data warehouses in the context of other database research areas; and to benefit from developments in those areas. In section 2, some database architectures are reviewed: the ANSI/SPARC threelevel architecture; and two schema architectures for federated databases. In section 3, the most [...] ...|$|R
