40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{solution}} behavior of cetyltrimethylammonium <b>hydroxynaphthalene</b> carboxylate (CTAHNC), {{which has the}} unique feature of undergoing a transition from vesicle to worm-like micellar phase in three different ways, namely, increase in temperature, addition of a surfactant and on shearing. Fluorescence anisotropy, NMR, rheology, small angle neutron scattering studies etc gave evidence of the vesicle-micelle transition. CTAHNC can be looked upon as a complex formed by two oppositely charged surfactants (CTA(+) and HNC-). This ion pair effectively acts as a double-chain lipid and {{has a tendency to}} form vesicles. On increasing the temperature, and/or adding single chain surfactants or shearing, the complex dissociates which changes the curvature energy of the surface. This leads to a 'surface melting' that brings forth the vesicle-micelle transition...|$|E

40|$|Prenylated {{aromatic}} compounds {{are widely}} distributed {{in nature and}} many of these compounds display interesting biological and pharmaceutical activities. The transfer of prenyl moieties to aromatic substrates is catalysed by aromatic prenyltransferases, and the multitude of possibilities for attachment of these moieties gives rise to a large structural diversity. Investigation of the functions of aromatic prenyltransferases would therefore help to elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of those natural compounds in the producing organism, as well as the applicability of these enzymes for chemoenzymatic synthesis of biologically active compounds for pharmaceutical purposes. Four putative prenyltransferase genes of the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) superfamily from Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans) were investigated as one part of this thesis. The genes xptA, xptB, ANID_ 10289 and ANID_ 11080 were cloned, and the two putative xanthone prenyltransferase genes xptA and xptB were overexpressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Both recombinant prenyltransferases were purified to near homogeneity using affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA and investigated biochemically. In this thesis, the enzyme XptB was confirmed to function as a xanthone prenyltransferase, catalysing a regiospecific Oprenylation of several xanthones. The enzyme products were isolated on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). Another previously postulated substrate, the benzophenone arugosin H, was not accepted by XptB under the tested conditions. No enzyme activity was detected for the second enzyme XptA with postulated or potential substrates. Reports of the enzyme VrtC from Penicillium aethiopicum (P. aethiopicum) implicated that some members of the DMATS superfamily might not be restricted to the usual prenyl donor dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C 5 -unit). VrtC was shown as the first known member of the DMATS prenyltransferases, which accepts geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C 10 -unit), but not DMAPP, for prenylation of a naphthacenedione substrate. Therefore, the acceptance of prenyl donors, such as GPP and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, C 15 -unit), was investigated in this thesis with the prenyltransferases 7 -DMATS and CdpNPT, both from Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus), as well as CdpC 3 PT and AnaPT, both from Neosartorya fischeri (N. fischeri). It was found that AnaPT accepted, in addition to DMAPP, also GPP as prenyl donor. Furthermore, a shift of the prenylation position was observed. Instead of a reverse C 3 α-prenylation with DMAPP, C 6 - and C 7 -geranylations of tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides with GPP were demonstrated in this thesis. This was the first report of the acceptance of both DMAPP and GPP {{by a member of the}} DMATS superfamily. The observed shift of the prenylation position by changing the prenyl donor expands the applicability of AnaPT for the production of prenylated compounds. As last part of this thesis, the putative prenyltransferase genes AO 090102000322, AO 090701000600 and AO 090020000527 from Aspergillus oryzae (A. oryzae) were cloned. The recombinant protein BAE 61387, encoded by AO 090102000322, was successfully overproduced and purified from E. coli. Analysis of neighbouring genes in the genome of A. oryzae revealed no backbone genes for the biosynthesis of a possible natural substrate of BAE 61387. The enzyme BAE 61387 was therefore incubated with a large number of compounds that are known substrates of enzymes from the DMATS superfamily. Activity was clearly observed in incubation mixtures with <b>hydroxynaphthalenes.</b> Interestingly, these unnatural substrates, which are accepted by several members of this enzyme class, were accepted by BAE 61387 in the presence of all three prenyl donors DMAPP, GPP and FPP. The acceptance of all these prenyl donors for regiospecific C-prenylations of <b>hydroxynaphthalenes</b> has never been shown for a member of this enzyme superfamily prior to this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidative}} polymerization of hydroxylated naphthalene derivatives, including chiefly 1, 8 -dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 8 -DHN), is {{an important}} process of broad biological, environmental and astrochemical relevance, being involved for example in the biosynthesis of black melanin pigments in certain pathogenic fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus) and halophilic ascomycetous black yeasts, in the combustion of organic matter, in the metabolic evolution of xenobiotics in water and soil pollution, and in the complex transformations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM). The latter processes, especially, attract growing interest {{in relation to the}} abiogenetic theory of the origin of life. PAHs are widely diffuse in the ISM and more than 20 % of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, thus serving as precursors to life molecules. Dust grain chemistry in particular could be central to PAHs reprocessing, since icy matrices can trap several astrochemically relevant CHON-bearing molecules, and mineral catalysis could have {{played a significant role in}} prebiotic chemistry. Studies on PAHs reactivity under astromimetic conditions have resulted in the identification of several hydroxylated products, which may represent the initial products of reprocessing. In addition, growing interest is currently focusing on the possible role of PAHs and their oxygenated derivatives as the main determinants of infrared emission features seen in different astrophysical environments. Early experiments showed that exposure of naphthalene to ultraviolet radiation in ice under astrophysical conditions leads to the generation of phenolic and quinone derivatives, allowing specific prediction of the existence and relative abundances of various oxidized naphthalenes in meteorites. However, apart from those studies, the mechanisms of conversion of PAHs under conditions mimicking those occurring in the ISM are largely uncharted, which makes it difficult to probe the actual role of this chemistry in the reprocessing of carbon compounds. Aim of this thesis is to investigate the oxidative pathways of hydroxylated naphthalenes, including 1 -naphthol, 2 -naphthol, 1, 8 -DHN, 1, 6 -DHN and 2, 6 -DHN, as representative in order to gain a first insight into the mode of coupling of these compounds, the nature and properties of the resulting polymers and their actual formation under astrochemically relevant conditions. To this aim, the thesis developed along three main phases: a) the isolation and characterization of the main oligomer intermediates in the oxidative conversion of the selected hydroxynaphthalenes; b) the synthesis and characterization of the resulting melanin-like polymers; c) the characterization of the species formed by UV-induced oxidation of <b>hydroxynaphthalenes</b> following adsorption on astrochemically-relevant minerals, by comparison with chemically-produced model polymers. The main outcome of these studies was: a) the elucidation of the reaction pathways and mode of coupling of hydroxylated naphthalenes; b) the definition of basic structure-property relationships in DHN-derived polymers; c) the characterization of melanin-type materials generated via solid state polymerization on mineral surface. Overall, these results fill a gap in the chemical literature on the oxidative polymerization of hydroxylated naphthalenes and provide an improved background to inquire into the mechanisms of PAH reprocessing in the ISM and other astrochemically relevant environments...|$|R
40|$|The linkage of isoprenoid and {{aromatic}} moieties, catalyzed by aromatic prenyltransferases (PTases), {{leads to}} an impressive diversity of primary and secondary metabolites, including important pharmaceuticals and toxins. A few years ago, a <b>hydroxynaphthalene</b> PTase, NphB, featuring a novel ten-stranded b-barrel fold was identified in Streptomyces sp. strain CL 190. This fold, termed the PT-barrel, is formed of five tandem aabb structural repeats and remained exclusive to the NphB family until its recent discovery in the DMATS family of indole PTases. Members of these two families exist only in fungi and bacteria, {{and all of them}} appear to catalyze the prenylation of aromatic substrates involved in secondary metabolism. Sequence comparisons using PSI-BLAST do not yield matches between these two families, suggesting that they may have converged upon the same fold independently. However, we now provide evidence for a common ancestry for the NphB and DMATS families of PTases. We also identify sequence repeats that coincide with the structural repeats in proteins belonging to these two families. Therefore we propose that the PT-barrel arose by amplification of an ancestral aabb module. In view of their homology and their similarities in structure and function, we propose to group the NphB an...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus, a {{filamentous}} fungus producing bluish-green conidia, {{is an important}} opportunistic pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised patients. Conidial pigmentation of A. fumigatus significantly influences its virulence in a murine model. In the present study, six genes, forming a gene cluster spanning 19 kb, were identified as involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. Northern blot analyses showed the six genes to be developmentally regulated and expressed during conidiation. The gene products of alb 1 (for “albino 1 ”), arp 1 (for “aspergillus reddish-pink 1 ”), and arp 2 have high similarity to polyketide synthases, scytalone dehydratases, and <b>hydroxynaphthalene</b> reductases, respectively, found in the dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) -melanin pathway of brown and black fungi. The abr 1 gene (for “aspergillus brown 1 ”) encodes a putative protein possessing two signatures of multicopper oxidases. The abr 2 gene product has homology to the laccase encoded by the yA gene of Aspergillus nidulans. The function of ayg 1 (for “aspergillus yellowish-green 1 ”) remains unknown. Involvement of the six genes in conidial pigmentation was confirmed by the altered conidial color phenotypes that resulted from disruption of each gene in A. fumigatus. The presence of a DHN-melanin pathway in A. fumigatus {{was supported by the}} accumulation of scytalone and flaviolin in the arp 1 deletant, whereas only flaviolin was accumulated in the arp 2 deletants. Scytalone and flaviolin are well-known signature metabolites of the DHN-melanin pathway. Based on DNA sequence similarity, gene disruption results, and biochemical analyses, we conclude that the 19 -kb DNA fragment contains a six-gene cluster which is required for conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. However, the presence of abr 1, abr 2, and ayg 1 in addition to alb 1, arp 1, and arp 2 suggests that conidial pigment biosynthesis in A. fumigatus is more complex than the known DHN-melanin pathway...|$|E
40|$|The maize {{pathogen}} Cochliobolus heterostrophus requires two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Chk 1 and Mps 1, {{to produce}} normal pigmentation. Young colonies of mps 1 and chk 1 deletion mutants have a white and autolytic appearance, which was partially rescued by a hyperosmotic environment. We isolated the transcription factor Cmr 1, an ortholog of Colletotrichum lagenarium Cmr 1 and Magnaporthe grisea Pig 1, which regulates melanin biosynthesis in C. heterostrophus. Deletion of CMR 1 in C. heterostrophus resulted in mutants that lacked dark pigmentation and acquired an orange-pink color. In cmr 1 deletion strains {{the expression of}} putative scytalone dehydratase (SCD 1) and <b>hydroxynaphthalene</b> reductase (BRN 1 and BRN 2) genes involved in melanin biosynthesis was undetectable, whereas expression of PKS 18, encoding a polyketide synthase, was only moderately reduced. In chk 1 and mps 1 mutants expression of PKS 18, SCD 1, BRN 1, BRN 2, and the transcription factor CMR 1 itself was very low in young colonies, slightly up-regulated in aging colonies, and significantly induced in hyperosmotic conditions, compared to invariably high expression in the wild type. These findings indicate that two MAPKs, Chk 1 and Mps 1, affect Cmr 1 {{at the transcriptional level}} and this influence is partially overridden in stress conditions including aging culture and hyperosmotic environment. Surprisingly, we found that the CMR 1 gene was transcribed in both sense and antisense directions, apparently producing mRNA as well as a long noncoding RNA transcript. Expression of the antisense CMR 1 was also Chk 1 and Mps 1 dependent. Analysis of chromosomal location of the melanin biosynthesis genes in C. heterostrophus resulted in identification of a small gene cluster comprising BRN 1, CMR 1, and PKS 18. Since expression of all three genes depends on Chk 1 and Mps 1 MAPKs, we suggest their possible epigenetic regulation...|$|E
40|$|Prenyl {{transfer}} reactions occur ubiquitously {{in nature}} and {{play an important role}} in primary and secondary metabolism in all domains of life. Prenylated secondary metabolites including indole alkaloids usually demonstrate improved biological and pharmacological activities and thus makes them to promising candidates for drug discovery and development. Important producers of such bioactive compounds are fungi of ascomycetes and bacteria of actinomycetes. The transfer reactions of a prenyl moiety from prenyl diphosphate, primarily dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), onto indole derivatives including tryptophan are mainly catalyzed in nature by the members of the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) superfamily. In the last years, remarkable progress has been achieved in their biochemical, molecular biological, and structural characterization, especially for DMATS enzymes from fungi. The major challenge of this thesis is to provide a better understanding of the catalytic features of these enzymes from different origins. Cloning and expression of these genes as well as the subsequent biochemical investigations of the three novel tryptophan prenyltransferases provided several new intriguing features. Initially, two tryptophan C 6 -prenyltransferases were identified, i. e. 6 -DMATSSa from Streptomyces ambofaciens and 6 -DMATSSv from Streptomyces violaceusniger. Biochemical investigation on these enzymes revealed a remarkable broad substrate specificity. In addition to a number of indole derivatives also several <b>hydroxynaphthalenes</b> were accepted by 6 -DMATSSa and 6 -DMATSSv. Moreover, they represent the first examples of tryptophan prenyltransferases that accept both DMAPP and geranyl diphosphate (GPP) as prenyl donors and catalyze the same prenylation positions. Consequently, the studied 6 -DMATSs were used for further investigations on the acceptance of unnatural alkyl or benzyl donors. Prior to this study, investigations on this issue are limited to fungal C 4 - and C 5 - prenyltransferases. The L-tyrosine prenyltransferase TyrPT with a tryptophan C 7 -prenyltransferase activity, the two mentioned 6 -DMATSs as well as the bacterial 5 -DMATSSc (SCO 7467) were included in this project. In total, five C 5 -, C 6 - and C 7 -prenytransferases were investigated in the presence of the DMAPP analogs methylallyl (MAPP), 2 -pentenyl (2 -pentenyl-PP) and benzyl diphosphate (benzyl-PP). The unnatural donors were accepted by all tested enzymes with different relative activities and regioselectivities. C 6 -alkylated or benzylated derivatives were identified in all the reactions, as unique product of the two 6 -DMATSs or as one of the main products of the other enzymes. These results demonstrated a clear preference of the five enzymes for alkylation/benzylation at C- 6 of the indole ring in the presence of the unnatural DMAPP derivatives. Furthermore, homology modeling of the 5 -DMATS and subsequent docking as well as molecular dynamics studies with DMAPP, MAPP and 2 -pentenyl-PP, led to a distance-based explanation of the observed reaction results. Later on, a third tryptophan C 6 -prenyltransferase 6 -DMATSMo from Micromonospora olivasterospora was identified and characterized. The most notable feature of 6 -DMATSMo is the high relative activity toward D-tryptophan. This result led to the comparative study on enantioselectivity of the seven DMATS enzymes from fungi and bacteria. The tested prenyltransferases displayed different substrate preferences as well as different regioselectivities toward the L- and D-enantiomers of tryptophan and their methylated derivatives. Interestingly, the bacterial 5 -DMATSSc and 6 -DMATSMo highly preferred the D-enantiomer of 5 -methyltryptophan to the L-enantiomer, although that was the better substrate in all other reactions. In the presence of the racemate, the D-enantiomer reaction was strongly inhibited, which could be explained by the high affinity to the respective L-form as the main reason. Another interesting output of this project is the reduced or even completely changed regioselectivity for the reactions of FgaPT 2, 5 -DMATSSc, and 7 -DMATS with the D-enantiomers of tryptophan or 5 -methyltryptophan. Moreover, the observed diprenylation by 5 -DMATSSc was the first report on a tryptophan prenyltransferase which catalyzes two successive prenylation steps. In conclusion, identification and characterization of the three new 6 -DMATSs from actinomycetes expand our knowledge on bacterial tryptophan prenyltransferases. Furthermore, prenyltransferases including the three 6 -DMATSs could serve as valuable biocatalysts in chemoenzymatic synthesis for alkylated compounds with potential biological activities...|$|R

40|$|Prenylated indole {{alkaloids}} {{are widely}} distributed in plants, fungi and bacteria, {{especially in the}} family of Clavicipitaceae and Trichocomaceae of Ascomycota, and commonly exhibit interesting biological and pharmaceutical activities. In the biosynthetic pathway of prenylated indole alkaloids, prenylation catalyzed by prenyltransferases contributes significantly to the large structure diversity of these compounds in nature. Investigation on indole prenyltransferases would help to understand the construction of prenylated indole alkaloids in nature and also be useful for structural modification of indole derivatives and other substances to produce analogues of prenylated derivatives. Three indole prenyltransferases belonging to the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) superfamily were biochemically identified and characterized in vitro, including CdpC 3 PT from Neosartorya fischeri (N. fischeri), BrePT from Aspergillus versicolor (A. versicolor) and 5 -DMATS from Aspergillus clavatus (A. clavatus). The responsible genes cdpC 3 PT and brePT were cloned into expression vector and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). These works were carried out by Dr. Wen-Bing Yin, Suqin Yin and Qing Wang, respectively. In this thesis, CdpC 3 PT was confirmed to catalyze the formation of C 3 -prenylated products with a characteristic 6 / 5 / 5 / 6 -fused tetracyclic ring system from tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides in one-step reaction. The NotF homologue BrePT showed much higher flexibility towards its aromatic substrates than NotF, and was proven to catalyze the highly regiospecific reverse prenylation at C- 2 of the indole nucleus. The cloning of 5 -dmats {{was carried out by}} Yan Liu. Functional proof of this gene was provided within this thesis by heterologous expression in E. coli and subsequent structure elucidation of enzyme products by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. 5 -DMATS established high regiospecific activity to catalyze C 5 -prenylation on indole derivatives. Given the importance of prenylation in structure diversity and bioactivity enhancement, CdpC 3 PT, BrePT, 5 -DMATS and other known prenyltransferases of the DMATS superfamily were applied for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of prenylated compounds. By using AnaPT, CdpC 3 PT and CdpNPT, eight and six stereoisomers of cis-configured prenylated pyrroloindoline diketopiperazines from cyclo-Trp-Ala and cyclo-Trp-Pro isomers were produced, respectively. The stereospecificity of AnaPT and CdpC 3 PT depended mainly on the configuration of tryptophanyl moiety in cyclo-Trp-Ala and cyclo-Trp-Pro isomers, while CdpNPT showed lower stereoselectivity, but higher conversion ability towards most tested substrates. 5 -DMATS and FgaPT 2 from Aspergillus were used for chemoenzymatic synthesis of prenylated indolocarbazoles. Reconstitution of enzyme activity of 5 -DMATS and FgaPT 2 in vitro revealed that they catalyzed regiospecific prenylation of indolocarbazoles at the para-position of the indole N-atom. This is the first report for prenylated indolocarbazoles. Subsequently, some indole prenyltransferases of the DMATS superfamily were found to accept also hydroxynaphthalenes and flavonoids, which were substrates for enzymes from the CloQ/NphB group and the UbiA superfamily, respectively. Nine prenylated flavonoids and twenty prenylated hydroxynaphthalenes have been isolated, and their structures were elucidated by MS and NMR analyses. It has been shown that, for an accepted <b>hydroxynaphthalene,</b> different enzymes produced usually the same major prenylated product, i. e. with a regular C-prenyl moiety at para- or ortho-position to a hydroxyl group. For flavonoids accepted by 7 -DMATS, C- 6 between two hydroxyl groups was the favorable prenylation position. The Michaelis-Menten constants (KM) and turnover numbers (kcat) of some prenyltransferases towards selected hydroxynaphthalenes are comparable to those obtained by using indole derivatives. In addition to indole prenyltransferases, other genes in the biosynthetic cluster of prenylated indole alkaloids were also investigated. A putative O-methyltransferase gene hasC and a putative cytochrome P 450 gene hasH involved in the biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome (HAS) in Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) were cloned into pQE 60 and pESC-URA, respectively. Soluble His 6 -HasC was successfully overproduced in E. coli SG 13009 and purified to near homogeneity by Ni-NTA. Constructs for co-expression with the reductase gene NFIA_ 083630 from N. fischeri in pESC-URA and for expression as His 6 -tagged protein in pESC-URA were also prepared for the putative cytochrome P 450 gene hasH...|$|E

Durch eine Additionsreaktion können Polydimethylsiloxan-Membranen ausvinylendgestoppten linearen Polydimethylsiloxanen und niedermolekularen Si-H-funktionalisierten Polydimethylsiloxanen unterEinfluss eines Platin- Katalysators hergestellt werden. Hierbei ist es durch den Einsatz genau charakterisierterAusgangspolymere möglich, Membranen mit einer statistisch definierten Mikrostruktur zu erhalten. Die Mikrostruktur kanndurch die Netzbogenlänge charakterisiert werden. Der Abschnitt zwischen zwei Verknüpfungspunkten in einem Netzwerk wirdals Netzbogenlänge (NBL) bezeichnet. Diese beschreibt die Anzahl der Dimethyl-siloxan-Einheiten zwischen zweiVerknüpfungen. Die Permeationseigenschaften wurden mit Hilfe des standardisierten Permeationskoeffizienten untersucht. Derstandardisierte Permeationskoeffizient ist von der mittleren Netzbogenlänge der Polydimethylsiloxan-Membranen abhängig. Dieser Zusammenhang wurde an elf Benzoesäure- und Naphthalinderivaten als Modellsubstanzen untersucht und bestätigt. Hierbei wurden Membranen mit den mittleren Netzbogenlängen 65, 99 und 122 Siloxan-Einheiten für die Untersuchungeneingesetzt. Bei allen untersuchten Substanzen stieg der Permeationskoeffizient mit größer werdender Netzbogenlänge derMembranen geringfügig an. Die Permeationskoeffizienten von Membranen mit der Netzbogenlänge 122 waren dabei - mitlediglich vier Ausnahmen - stets statistisch signifikant größer als von Membranen mit der Netzbogenlänge 65. Als mögliche weitere Einflussfaktoren auf die Permeationsgeschwindigkeit wurden der Membran/Wasser-Verteilungskoeffizient, dasDipolmoment und das van der Waals-Volumen der elf Modellsubstanzen untersucht. Es konnte ein Zusammenhang zwischendem Membran/Wasser-Verteilungskoeffizienten und dem Permeationskoeffizienten aufgezeigt werden. Das Volumen deruntersuchten permeierenden Moleküle hat jedoch nur bei Netzbogenlängen kleiner als 122 einen Einfluss auf diePermeationsgeschwindigkeit. Als neue Möglichkeit zur Untersuchung der Diffusionskinetik vor Erreichen des stationärenZustands in Polydimethylsiloxan-Membranen wurde die konfokale Raman-Spektroskopie eingesetzt. Bei derRaman-Spektroskopie wird das Probensystem während der Messung weder zerstört noch verändert. Weiterhin ist es möglich,durch das gekoppelte konfokale Mikroskop gezielt an einem bestimmten Punkt innerhalb der Membran zu messen. Damitkönnen nun dynamische Vorgänge wie der Aufbau eines Konzentrationsgradienten vor Erreichen des stationären Zustandes aneinem bestimmten Punkt in einer Membran über einen längeren Zeitraum gemessen werden. Anhand von Intensitätsänderungencharakteristischer Peaks oder der Verschiebung von Banden werden Konzentrations- und Strukturänderungen der Membranund der permeierenden Moleküle sichtbar. Die Untersuchungen mit der konfokalen Raman-Spektroskopie zeigten, dass dieseMethode geeignet ist, Diffusionskinetiken im nicht stationären Zustand innerhalb der Membranen zu beobachten. The {{knowledge}} of the microstructure of controlling membranes {{is very important in}} order to achieve a defined and constantdrug release from therapeutic systems. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes can be prepared by an addition reaction of linearpoly(dimethylsiloxanes) with terminal vinyl groups and low molecular poly(dimethylsiloxanes) with Si-H functional groups. Forthis reaction a Platinum catalyst is used. By using well characterized starting polymers it is possible to get membranes with astatistically defined microstructure. The network chain length can characterize the microstructure. The distance between twopoints of cross-linking within the network is called network chain length (NCL). The network chain length describes the numberof the dimethyl- siloxane-units between two cross-linking points. The properties of permeation were investigated by using the stadardized permeation coefficient. The permeation coefficient is dependent on the average network chain length of thepoly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes. This relationship was confirmed for 11 benzoic acid and <b>hydroxynaphthalene</b> derivates. Membranes with network chain lengths of 65, 99 and 122 were used for these investigations. The permeation coefficient P*increases slightly with rising network chain length for all 11 model substances. The permeation coefficient of the membraneswith network chain length of 122 was found to be higher by a statistically significant amount than those of membranes with anetwork chain length of 65 - having only 4 exceptions. In order to find other factors which influence the permeation rate, the membrane/water-partition coefficient, the dipole moment and the van der Waals volume were investigated. There was amathematically relationship between the membrane/water-partition coefficient and the permeation coefficient. The volume of themoleculeshad only with membranes with a network chain length of 122 an influence on the permeation. ConfocalRaman-spectroscopy was taken as a pioneering method to investigate the kinetics of diffusion before reaching the steady statein poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes. Up to now it was only possible to investigate the diffusion process in the steady state. The membrane was always taken as a whole. Raman-spectroscopic measurements do not destroy or change the probe system. Because of the coupled confocal microscope it is possible to measure selectively at a defined point in the membrane. Thereforedynamic processes e. g. can be investigated before reaching the steady state flux. The investigations with confocalRaman-spectroscopy show the possibility to observe diffusion processes in and before the steady state flux with this method...|$|E
