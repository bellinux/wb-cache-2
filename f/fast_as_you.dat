500|$|Say Anything {{released}} the video for [...] "Shiksa (Girlfriend)" [...] on April 9, 2008. On April 25, Say Anything performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. During summer 2008, Say Anything joined the Warped Tour {{for the first}} time, appearing on all dates. On August 1, 2008, Say Anything announced the Max Bemis Song Shop, through which users could pay for Max Bemis to write a song based on a short writing by the customer. However, {{by the end of}} the night, the item was no longer available with the following text displayed on the item listing: [...] "We're sorry but Max can't write songs as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are requesting them. As soon as he catches up we will start again. Thank you so much for believing in our crazy idea." [...] The Song Shop has reopened semi-annually since its initial launch, and taken down after about a week each time. This aforementioned message has been displayed each time the Song Shop was discontinued.|$|E
500|$|After landing, {{some of the}} 9th and 10th Battalion's men {{headed for}} 400 Plateau. The first 10th Battalion platoon to arrive was {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Noel Loutit, and accompanied by the Brigade-Major, Charles Brand. They discovered the Turkish battery in the Lone Pine sector, which was preparing to move. As the Australians opened fire the battery withdrew down Owen's Gully. Brand remained on the plateau and ordered Loutit to continue after the Turkish battery. However, the guns had been hidden {{at the head of}} the gully and Loutit's platoon moved beyond them. Around the same time, Lieutenant Eric Smith and his 10th Battalion scouts and Lieutenant G. Thomas with his platoon from the 9th Battalion arrived on the plateau, looking for the guns. As they crossed the plateau Turkish machine-guns opened fire on them from the Lone Pine area. One of Thomas's sections located the battery, which had started firing from the gully. They opened fire, charged the gun crews, and captured the guns. The Turks did manage to remove the breech blocks, making the guns inoperable, so the Australians damaged the sights and internal screw mechanisms to put them out of action. By now the majority of the 9th and 10th Battalions, along with brigade commander Maclagen, had arrived on the plateau, and he ordered them to dig in on the plateau instead of advancing to Gun Ridge. Unfortunately the units that had already passed beyond there were obeying their orders to [...] "go as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, at all costs keep going".|$|E
2500|$|By the 1980s, so {{much had}} fled the Centro {{that many of}} its former mansions were either {{abandoned}} or turned into tenements for the poor, [...] and its sidewalks and streets taken over by pickpockets and milling vendors. For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City's reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace [...] "get {{into and out of}} as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to the more attractive resort areas. Until recently, many of the restaurants of the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your tears fall <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> talk of happiness,' said Nicholas, 'and you shun the {{contemplation of}} that dark future which must be laden with so much misery to you. Defer this {{marriage}} for a week. For but one week!' ...|$|R
50|$|Some copyrightable {{elements}} of a game may be created due to limitations of the Hardware it is being developed or played on, e.g. the classic game Space invaders, as originally played as an Arcade game, got <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> killed more of the onscreen aliens as that freed up system resources, making this change an actual element of the game.|$|R

2500|$|Townshend played {{keyboards}} {{on several}} Who songs. On Who's Next, {{he began to}} work with analogue synthesizers, using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He {{had this to say}} about the instrument: [...] "I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren't in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you're stuck with as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can play and I don't play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional naval {{doctrine}} envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This {{view was}} challenged when army airman General Billy Mitchell demonstrated {{the capability of}} aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not {{been shown to be}} as lethal. The adage [...] "Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power" [...] was well known. Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power. Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at Admiral Husband Kimmel's hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to [...] "get to the other fellow with everything you have as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can and to dump it on him." [...] Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{up along}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible; <b>you</b> {{can take your}} time coming back," [...] Jet said, as his companion, {{shouldering}} the muzzle-loader, was ready to set out, [...] "and don't delay sending that message." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well!' {{said the}} old lady, good-humouredly; 'you get well <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise you that! Now, let us talk about {{something}} else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right--that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think I've been killed, {{and floated}} down the river--there's {{something}} up there that 'll help them think so--so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just shove {{off for the}} big water <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Down there--anywhere, Quin," [...] said Jackman turning quickly; [...] "and be off as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can to see {{after that}} rifle and cartridges." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did; and, {{having been}} answered, I won't intrude upon you longer. So cut along home as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can. It is getting late.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, then?" [...] {{cried the}} other. [...] "My faith, Pierre, if your fingers went <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> your tongue, <b>you</b> {{would be the}} first joiner in France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} better to buy one from those men, Brenon, because the fact of our being strangers would not then be noticed. I want one rowing boat, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> a craft <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can pick out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut {{the cords}} {{and make them}} run for their prisoners. They'll run <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> geese--don't <b>you</b> see they're web-footed?" [...] These were the cries which the {{soldiers}} vaguely understood to be jeers, and probably threats. But every one seemed disposed to give invitations of this spirited kind rather than to act upon them.|$|R
6000|$|Then Jimmy {{scrambled}} {{to his feet}} with the water draining from him. [...] "Back to the Adelaide," [...] he said, [...] "as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Go to {{the thicket}} near the fork, where the boys killed your brothers, and {{directly}} they or the dogs see <b>you</b> return here <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can. The mountain will open {{to let you}} in, and the hunters will follow you. Then I shall have them in my power, {{and be able to}} revenge myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father, [...] "crows move their wings <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> that, whereas <b>you</b> only move hands and arms. If you had great wings, as long, in proportion, <b>as</b> the crows, <b>you</b> {{could not move}} them so fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{and your}} three men have indeed given a good account of yourselves," [...] Captain Burgh exclaimed; [...] "but while I am talking you are fasting. Here is {{a bottle of}} wine, a cold chicken, and a manchet of bread which I put in my wallet on starting; let us breakfast, for though I do not pretend to have been <b>fasting</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have, the morning ride has given me an appetite. I see your fellows are hard at work already on the viands which my orderly brought for them in his havresack; but first let us move away to the tree over yonder, for verily the scent of blood and of roasted flesh is enough to take away one's appetite, little squeamish as these wars have taught us to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Guy, as he {{attached}} his signature, [...] "fold {{and address}} that, and be off {{with it as}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can to the post." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Say {{another word}} and we'll thrash you good," [...] he said. [...] "Now get--just as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can walk." [...] And he {{pointed toward the}} river.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it: {{you seemed}} so touched and troubled. I longed {{to speak to}} you, but didn't dare, so dropped the flowers and got away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible. Did <b>you</b> think it very rude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doctor Robinson?... Good. Mrs. Forrest has a rifle-shot through lungs {{or heart}} or maybe both. Callahan {{is on his}} way to meet you in the racing car. Keep coming <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> God'll let <b>you</b> till you meet Callahan. Good-by." ...|$|R

5000|$|Released on 11 October, [...] "Parts, Pieces", is the Rocketsmiths' {{newest and}} most {{successful}} EP so far. It follows the same format {{as the other}} EPs, having six songs. After [...] "Parts, Pieces" [...] was released, the Rocketsmiths' website biography changed to feature:Picture yourself in an abandoned theme park. The rollercoaster is dilapidated, the merry go round a collection of twisted metal and cobwebs. The big top still stands, although shabby and dirty, {{in the middle of}} the park. Suddenly, the old tent lights up and strange music booms from the inside, cutting through the humid night air. A constant, throbbing beat grows <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> run towards the thin streak of light shining from the entrance. The music seems to encompass everything around you; the decaying carnival, the deep night and the long grass brushing past your legs. There is no hint of danger <b>as</b> <b>you</b> burst through the tent flap and into the bright surrounds of the Big Top’s interior. Standing on a stage in front of you are five young men with powerful voices and a sound like no other; they are Rocketsmiths. -the Rocketsmiths ...|$|R
