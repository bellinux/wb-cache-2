5|$|Brownsea Castle {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, <b>France</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII.

Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.|$|E
