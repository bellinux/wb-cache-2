5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, McCreary {{returned}} to his legal practice. In 1884, he sought election to Congress from Kentucky's Eighth District. His opponents for the Democratic nomination were Milton J. Durham and Philip B. Thompson, Jr., both of whom had held the district's seat previously. McCreary bested both men, and {{in the general election}} in November, defeated Republican James Sebastian by a margin of 2,146 votes.

5|$|Following the 2000 census, the Oklahoma {{delegation}} to the U.S. House of Representatives was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one congressional district. For the 112th Congress (2011–2013), there were no changes in party strength, and the delegation included four Republicans and one <b>Democrat.</b> <b>In</b> the 112th Congress, Oklahoma's U.S. senators were Republicans Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn, and its U.S. Representatives were John Sullivan (R-OK-1), Dan Boren (D-OK-2), Frank D.

He {{dropped out of the}} race in December. McEwen's name was floated in 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio's other senator, John Glenn, another Democrat, but McEwen did not enter the race.|$|E

5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; {{he had been}} the most important <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|A <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E

That same year, he ran as a Green for the same seat. He ran unsuccessfully for Buffalo Grove Village Clerk in 2011, for Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2016 as a Green – receiving 4.7% of the vote – and he had {{announced that he would}} run for Illinois's 12th congressional district in 2018.

5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
5|$|The campus newspaper, the FSView & Florida Flambeau, is 100 {{years old}} now and publishes weekly {{during the summer and}} semiweekly on Mondays and Thursdays during the school year {{following}} the academic calendar. After changing hands three times in 13 years, the FSView was sold to the Tallahassee <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> late July 2006, making it part of the Gannett chain. This exchange was allowed because the FSView had been for a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with Florida State University. Since most collegiate newspapers are supported by their colleges, this was also among the first times that a major corporation had acquired a college newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed {{a bill that would}} have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory for a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E

5|$|Tyler's {{successor}} in the Senate was William Cabell Rives, {{a conservative}} <b>Democrat.</b> <b>In</b> February 1839, the General Assembly considered who should fill that seat, {{which was to}} expire the following month. Rives had drifted away from his party, signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs. As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats, he expected the Whigs would support him. Still, many Whigs found Rives a more politically expedient choice, as they hoped to ally with the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in the 1840 presidential election. This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay, who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time. With the vote split among three candidates, including Rives and Tyler, the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years, until January 1841.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> a county where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E
5|$|During the West Virginia Democratic Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia Democratic Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the national Democratic Party {{as part of its}} 1888 platform. White had been among the first Democratic Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare his opposition to the fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's Democratic delegation was the first Democratic county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal policies. As the county executive committee chairman, White was the first <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies. By 1897, White had participated as a delegate from Hampshire County to most of the Senatorial and Congressional Democratic Party conventions in West Virginia, and every state Gubernatorial convention with the exception of one.|$|E
