They had large boilers and large grates {{which had been}} {{designed}} to burn very poor quality coal. In service, they {{were found to be}} free steaming, excellent and smooth runners and low on maintenance costs. These qualities, with their roomy cabs and general handiness, made them popular with the enginemen, who nicknamed them <b>Hatracks.</b>|$|R

Nicknamed the <b>Hatracks,</b> the locomotives were designated 4th Class on the CGR. When they came onto South African Railways (SAR) stock in 1912, they were considered obsolete and designated Class 04. They remained in SAR service until 1931.|$|R

There are three toilets, forward, midships, and aft. It has a buffet/bar and a further cabin crew rest area in a vestibule forward, with a further optional cabin crew rest area aft. Typical mixed-class accommodation ranges between 128 and 144, seated four or six abreast, and a common single aisle configuration for long distance Aeroflot examples was first class (2-abreast) 3 rows, business class (3-abreast) 4 rows, economy class (3-abreast) 17 rows (Thiel, 2001). In this configuration, the central aisle in business and economy classes is quite narrow. A first class compartment is optionally sited aft of forward entry door or just forward of midships entry door, with an economy compartment further forward in the latter case.

No in-flight entertainment systems are available except a public-address system that may be coupled to an open-reel or audio cassette player. Individual aircraft were experimentally fitted with television sets for Soviet-standard videotape entertainment during the 1970s. Some aircraft were retrospectively fitted with Western in-flight entertainment (solely audio) systems after 1991.|$|R

In 1895 and 1900 the stone house was refurbished, and telephone service, acetylene lighting, and steam heat were added. In 1900 The Sullivan Review newspaper recalled its former state and wrote of the changes: [...] "We hardly call that an improvement. ... When the North Mountain House is lighted by gas, heated by a modern furnace, etc., its great charm is gone." ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Making medical {{decisions}} {{can sometimes}} be very complicated because it is affected by factors such as time, information, cost, patientsâ€™ health condition, etc. The traditional relationship of doctor to patient has put patients in a passive position of acquiring information and making decisions; doctors my take the authority of making decisions without knowing enough information about their patients as individuals. This thesis will discuss doctor-patient communication from the aspect of active participation. To allow for design of aids to enhance decision-making and communication between patients and doctors, this paper will discuss decision-making theories and current issues, related to active communication and cognitive bias during medical decision-making. Principles of graphic design will be discussed, including basic design elements, the principle of Five Ultimate <b>Hatracks,</b> and principles of analytical visualization. A case study was conducted on five decision aids, to analyze information and design approaches, so as to develop a framework of the medical decision process and guidance of information design for patients. In the future direction, development of technology such as interaction design, wearable devices, and medical networks will provide more possibilities for the future design of decision aids...|$|R

He was very quiet that night; and after he had tried to mount the <b>hatrack,</b> under the mistaken impression that it was intended for his own gymnastic exercise, and knocked all the hats off, he went peaceably to sleep on the rug.|$|E

25|$|The only {{successful}} hijacking of a SAA flight {{took place}} on 24 May 1972, when a Boeing 727-044 (ZS-SBE) was hijacked en route from Salisbury, Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe) to Johannesburg. Two Lebanese, Kamil and Yagi, {{took control of the}} aircraft by packing dynamite sticks on the <b>hatracks.</b> They were armed with a pistol. They forced the pilot, Captain Blake Flemington, to return to Salisbury, where they landed and re-fuelled with 12 hostages remaining on board. The captain tricked them into thinking that they were en route to the Seychelles, while he was in fact heading for Blantyre, Malawi. After landing, the passengers used nightfall to enter the cockpit, where they climbed down the emergency escape rope. By the time the hijackers realised this, the captain, one passenger, and a flight steward, Dirk Nel, remained on the aircraft. The two hijackers started fighting with each other for possession of the dynamite fuse. In the ensuing chaos, the three captives escaped, leaving the two hijackers on board. Malawi security forces started shooting and the two surrendered. They were jailed for two years on a charge of being in possession of an undeclared firearm on board an aircraft. After serving one year of their sentence, they were released.|$|R
40|$|The report {{summarizes}} groundbreaking {{aircraft cabin}} developments at Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). The founder {{and chief executive}} Juan Terry Trippe (1899 - 1981) established Pan Am as the world's first truly global airline. With Trippe's determination, foresight, and strategic brilliance the company accomplished many pioneering firsts â€“ many also in aircraft cabin design. In 1933 Pan Am approached the industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes (1893 - 1958). The idea was to create the interior design of the Martin M- 130 flying boat by a specialized design firm. Noise absorption was optimized. Fresh air was brought to an agreeable temperature before it was pumped into the aircraft. Adjustable curtains at the windows {{made it possible to}} regulate the amount of light in the compartments. A compact galley was designed. The cabin layout optimized seating comfort and facilitated conversion to the night setting. The pre-war interior design of the Boeing 314 flying boat featured modern contours and colors. Meals were still prepared before flight and kept warm in the plane's galley. The innovative post-war land based Boeing 377 Stratocruiser had a pressurized cabin. The cabin was not divided anymore into compartments. Seats were reclining. The galley was well equipped. The jet age started at Pan Am with the DC- 8 and the B 707. The B 707 featured individual overhead "service clusters" with reading light, air outlet, and stewardess call button. The aircraft had no night time settings anymore. Inflight entertainment (video and music) was introduced. Early jets had <b>hatracks.</b> Overhead bins were introduced on the B 747...|$|R

50|$|The {{front hall}} was the {{introduction}} to the house, and as such was {{an important part of the}} Victorian home. Furnishings were selected not only to make it a useful place to hang a hat and coat, store an umbrella and leave a calling card, but also to show family wealth, social position and knowledge of current styles. A hall stand or a <b>hatrack</b> was the most important piece of furniture. These were new forms that appeared about 1840, as homes became larger and social visits became more structured; see also Hall Tree.|$|E

In regard to the latter two pairings, Safire writes in the underbook, [...] "All four surely had romantic attachmentsâ€”but with other people.
