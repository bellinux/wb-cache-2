40|$|Secondary amines and thiols {{undertake}} a substitution reaction {{on the side}} chain of 2 -bromoethyl-pyridinium derivatives ‘directed’ by an <b>intramolecular</b> <b>re-arrangement.</b> Experimental investigations strongly indicate that the reaction is initiated by an alpha addition of the nucleophile onto the iminium moiety of the N-heteroaromatic cation, followed by a cyclisation and an oxidative ring opening. This novel substitution process is able to occur with less reactive nucleophiles that would not undergo conventional substitution with ‘isolated’ bromoethyl moieties...|$|E
