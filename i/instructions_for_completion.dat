40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal {{cancer is}} a major public health problem in Malaysia. However, {{it is also one}} of the most treatable cancers, {{resulting}} in significant numbers of survivors. Therefore, the impact of surviving treatment for colorectal cancer on health related quality of life is important for the patients, clinicians and policy makers, and may differ in different cultures and populations. The aim of this study was to validate the Malaysian versions of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life instruments among colorectal cancers patients. Methods/design This is a cross sectional multi centre study. Three hospitals were included, the University of Malaya Medical Centre, the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre and Hospital Tuanku Jaafar Seremban. Malaysian citizens and permanent residence were studied and demographic and clinical information obtained from hospital records. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Core 30, colorectal cancer CR 29, and the colorectal cancer liver metastasis LMC 21 were used and an observer assessment of performance obtained with the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Questionnaires were translated into three most commonly spoken languages in Malaysia (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil), then administered, scored and analyzed following the developers’ guidelines. Ethical approval was obtained from the participating centres. Tests of reliability and validity were performed to examine the validity of these instruments. Conclusion The result of pilot testing shows that the use of the Malaysian versions of EORTC QLQ C 30, CR 29 instruments is feasible in our sample of colorectal cancer patients. <b>Instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion</b> as well as questions were well understood except the questions on the overall quality of life, overall health status and sexual activity.

40|$|Background: No {{questionnaire}} specifically {{measuring the}} core components of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use has been validated for use across European Union (EU) countries. We aimed {{to determine the}} face validity, acceptability and the participants' comprehension of a pre-existing questionnaire designed to measure 'CAM use', to provide a comparative, standardised questionnaire for use by health care providers, policy makers and purchasers throughout Europe. Methods: Established procedures were employed to translate the questionnaire into 4 EU languages. The translated questionnaires were piloted on 50 healthy adults from each country who may never have used CAM. 10 participants per country also took part in audio-recorded think aloud interviews about the questionnaire. The interviews were transcribed and analysed in the language {{in which they were}} conducted; findings were summarised in English. Questionnaire data were pooled across countries, and patterns of completion and missing data were analysed. Results: The questionnaire was translated into Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Romanian. The mean age of the participants was 43. 6 years. 34 % were male, 87. 4 % were either light or heavy CAM users, and 12. 6 % were non-users. Qualitative analysis identified common problems across countries including a 'hard-to-read' layout, misunderstood terminology and uncertainty in choosing response options. Quantitative analysis confirmed that a substantial minority of respondents failed to follow questionnaire instructions and that some questions had substantial rates of missing data. Conclusions: The I-CAM-Q has low face validity and low acceptability, and is likely to produce biased estimates of CAM use if applied in England, Romania, Italy, The Netherlands or Spain. Further work is required to develop the layout, terms, some response options and <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion</b> before it can be used across the EU...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, and is also increasing among public safety professionals like firefighters who {{are expected to be}} fit and more active. The present study evaluates the associations among Body Mass Index (BMI), weight perception and cardiovascular risk factors in 768 male career firefighters from two Midwestern states in the United States. Methods A physical examination was performed and fasting blood samples were taken. Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) was determined from symptom- limited maximal treadmill exercise testing with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and estimation of oxygen consumption (metabolic equivalents, METS) using the Bruce protocol. A health and lifestyle questionnaire was administered with standardized written <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion.</b> Self-reports of weight perception were extracted from responses to the completed multiple choice questionnaire. Baseline characteristics were described using the mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables and frequency for categorical variables. Group comparisons were calculated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linear models and logistic regression models were used to adjust for possible confounders. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios of underestimating one’s weight category. Results A high proportion of overweight and obese male career firefighters underestimate their weight categories (68 %). The risk of underestimating one’s weight category increased by 24 % with each additional unit of increasing BMI after adjustment for age and CRF. When divided into six groups based on combinations of measured BMI category and weight perception, there were significant differences among the groups for most cardiovascular risk factors. After adjustment for age and BMI, these differences remained statistically significant for CRF, amount of weekly exercise, {{prevalence of}} Metabolic Syndrome (MetSyn), body fat percentage and cholesterol measurements. Conclusion A high proportion of overweight and obese male career firefighters underestimate their measured BMI categories. As a result, they are unlikely to fully appreciate the negative health consequences of their excess weight. The results of this study emphasize the importance of objectively measuring BMI and then informing patients of their actual weight status and the associated disease risks. </p...|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the current {{knowledge}} of school principals in Newfoundland and Labrador (hereafter referred to as Newfoundland) concerning their legal rights and responsibilities. Secondly, it attempted to determine if principals’ knowledge of school law varied according to certain personal, professional and situational characteristics such as age, gender, and training. As a basis for the study, a review of the legal rights and responsibilities of principals in Newfoundland was undertaken. [...] Information for review was obtained from a number of sources: (1) Federal and Provincial statutes, (2) Department of Education and school board regulations, (3) The Newfoundland Teachers’ Association collective Agreement, and (4) principles established in case law relating to education. [...] Data were collected from these principals through a self-developed school law questionnaire. Included in the development process was validation by a panel of experts in school law. The questionnaire was also piloted with a number of principals for further refinements. The final draft consisted of two sections with 45 questions: Section A with 30 true-false, and Section B with 15 multiple-choice. A checklist requesting information concerning respondents’ personal, professional and situational characteristics was also included. [...] The questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 300 principals, representing more than one-half of all principals in the Province. Included were a covering letter, general <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion,</b> and a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Follow-up procedures were taken to ensure a maximum number of questionnaires (73 percent) were returned. [...] Data were analyzed chiefly be relating the independent variables to the dependent variables by means of person product-moment correlation coefficients, and comparing them through stepwise multiple correlation. [...] The findings from the study indicated that principals know only bits and pieces about school law and perhaps not as much as they should know, given the litigiousness of our changing society. The overall mean score for the entire sample was 67. 5 percent. [...] Results of the testing of the Hypotheses indicated that principals’ knowledge of school law is positively correlated with age, teaching experience, school size (defined by enrolment), teaching certificate level, Master’s degree in Educational Administration, course(s) in school law, in-service training in school law, and principalship experience. However, the most significant contributors to their knowledge of school law were Master’s degree and level of teaching certificate. [...] It is hoped that the results of this study will help clarify the legal rights and responsibilities of principals. Furthermore, by conducting a study such as this, principals may become more aware of their level of knowledge in this area and be prompted to take steps to educate themselves in the areas that are lacking. [...] The findings of this study have implications for pre-service and in-service programs offered by educational institutions and by teacher/administrator associations...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} user experience of crowds, incorporating issues of comfort, satisfaction, safety and performance within a given crowd situation. Factors that influence the organisation and monitoring of crowd events will be considered. A comprehensive review of the literature revealed that crowd safety, pedestrian flow modeling, public order policing and hooliganism prevention, has received the greatest attention with previous research on crowds. Whereas crowd performance, comfort and satisfaction has received less attention, particularly within spectator events (sporting and music for example). Original research undertaken for this doctoral thesis involved a series of studies: user focus groups, stakeholder interviews, and observational research within event security and organisation. Following on from these investigations, the findings have been integrated with a tool to assist crowd organisers and deliverers during the planning of crowd events, and accompanying user feedback interviews following use of the tool. The overarching aim of the research within this thesis was to explore the complex issues that contribute to the user experience of being in a crowd, and how this might be improved. The crowd user focus groups revealed differences in factors affecting crowd satisfaction, varying according to age and user expectations. Greater differences existed between crowd users, than across crowd situations, highlighting the importance of identifying expected crowd members when planning individual events. Additionally, venue design, organisation, safety and security concerns were found to highly affect crowd satisfaction, irrespective of group differences or crowd situations, showing the importance of these issues when considering crowd satisfaction for all crowd events, for any crowd members. Stakeholder interviews examining crowds from another perspective suggested that overall safety was a high priority due to legal obligations, in order to protect venue reputation. Whereas, comfort and satisfaction received less attention within the organisation of crowd events due to budget considerations, and a lack of concern as to the importance of such issues. Moreover, communication and management systems were sometimes inadequate to ensure compliance with internal procedures. In addition a lack of usable guidance was seen to be available to those responsible for organising crowd situations. Eleven themes were summarised from the data, placed in order of frequency of references to the issues: health and safety, public order, communication, physical environment, public relations, crowd movement, event capacity, facilities, satisfaction, comfort, and crowd characteristics. Results were in line with the weighting of the issues within the literature, with health and safety receiving the most attention, and comfort and satisfaction less attention. These results were used to form the basis of observational checklists for event observations across various crowd situations. Event observations took two forms: observing the role of public and private security, and observing crowd events from the user perspective. Observations within public and private security identified seven general themes: communication, anticipating crowd reaction, information, storage, training, role confusion, financial considerations and professionalism. Findings questioned the clarity of the differing roles of public and private security, and understanding of these differences. Also the increasing use of private over public security within crowd event security, and the differing levels of training and experience within public and private security were identified. Event observations identified fifteen common themes drawn from the data analysis: communication, public order, comfort, facilities, queuing systems, transportation, crowd movement, design, satisfaction, health and safety, public relations, event capacity, time constraints, encumbrances, and cultural differences. Key issues included the layout of the event venue together with the movement and monitoring of crowd users, as well as the availability of facilities in order to reduce competition between crowd users, together with possible links to maintaining public order and reducing anti-social behaviour during crowd events. Findings from the focus groups, interviews, and observations were then combined (to enhance the robustness of the findings), and developed into the Crowd Satisfaction Assessment Tool (CSAT) prototype, a practical tool for event organisers to use during the planning of crowd events. In order to assess proof of concept of the CSAT, potential users (event organisers) were recruited to use the CSAT during the planning of an event they were involved in organising. Semi-structured feedback interviews were then undertaken, to gain insight into the content, usefulness, and usability of the CSAT. Separately human factors researchers were recruited to review the CSAT, providing feedback on the layout and usability of the tool. Feedback interviews suggested the CSAT was a useful concept, aiding communication, and providing organisers with a systematic and methodical structure for planning ahead, prioritising ideas, and highlighting areas of concern. The CSAT was described as being clear and easy to follow, with clear aims, and clear <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion,</b> and was felt to aid communication between the various stakeholders involved in the organisation and management of an event, allowing information to be recorded, stored and shared between stakeholders, with the aim of preventing the loss of crucial information. The thesis concludes with a summary model of the factors that influence crowd satisfaction within crowd events of various descriptions. Key elements of this are the anticipation, facilities, and planning considered before an event, influences and monitoring during an event and reflection after an event. The relevance and impact of this research is to assist the planning of crowd events, with the overall aim of improving participant satisfaction during crowd events. From a business perspective the issue is important with competition between events, the desire to encourage return to events, and to increase profit for organisers. From an ergonomics perspective, there is the imperative of improving the performance of crowd organisers and the experience of crowd users...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the research In November 2009, considerable interest was generated by a study day of the National Association of Principal Educational Psychologists (NAPEP) on evaluation of outcomes {{of the work of}} Educational Psychology Services (EPSs). Following this, my service requested that I investigate this area during my training placement, as a topic for my doctoral research. A review of the literature and professional networking sites (for example, EPNET) revealed that although many services at the time were considering or actively seeking valid and reliable ‘tools’ to evaluate services, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, in practice, few were undertaking evaluation systematically, and those that were did not feel confident that they were doing it well. While a number of services were regularly collecting data on how much service (quantity) they were delivering, to whom and in what ways, and on the subjective experience for a range of service users, few were focussing on outcomes, and even fewer were measuring these in any systematic way (Norgate, 2010). My service was one of those that already collected data on delivery in terms of quantity and subjective quality, and they had just introduced Target Monitoring and Evaluation (TME) (Dunsmuir, Brown, Iyadurai and Monsen, 2009), as a goals-based approach to informing service delivery, and a way of recording consultation and engagement with children, families and schools. While this was a positive step towards more systematic evaluation, it was noted that a missing dimension was what the children themselves felt about the outcome of engagement with an EP, and whether they felt that things had been improved in domains that were significant to them. While there was considerable interest in hearing children’s voices driven by international agreements, legislation, policy initiatives and research, {{a review of the literature}} suggested that engaging with children in meaningful ways, and eliciting valid views, was a challenging endeavour. This was particularly true for certain groups of children and young people; those with additional needs, particularly those with profound and multiple difficulties or severe language difficulties, and also for the youngest children in the pre-school and primary years. The two research studies presented here aimed to begin to redress that balance. I chose to focus on the collective voice of local children aged 7 – 11 years in Key Stage 2 (KS 2), in mainstream primary schools, and of all abilities, including children with additional needs at all three stages of the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice. My reason for this was to ascertain the views of ‘typical’ children in mainstream education, so that they might be better understood by adults (presented in Paper 1), and in order to produce a general measure (presented in Paper 2), which could later be modified and refined, as appropriate, for other groups, for example, younger age groups, or children with more significant difficulties. Paper 1 briefly reviews the literature on hearing children’s voices, some of the difficulties encountered in this enterprise, and approaches that have been proposed to overcome these, including attempts to actively involve them in decision making and research about issues that affect their lives. The findings of a selection of studies, which have explored what children and young people have identified as being important factors in their school lives, are presented. The qualitative research study that follows is informed by this review of the selected literature. The approach is informed by ‘positive psychology’, with an explicit focus on ‘what works’, while not denying or ignoring what children say does not work for them. Forty primary school children in Key stage 2 were interviewed using a range of approaches. The children were recruited from local schools with differing demographics in the South West of the United Kingdom. The research approach was pragmatic, and adopted a critical realist perspective and mixed methodology. A thematic analysis was carried out to explore children’s understandings of what helped them to learn at school (Paper 1), and these understandings were subsequently used within a realist approach to develop a tool co-designed with the children (Paper 2). The approach was also inductive, being driven by the data rather than theory. The aim was to put the children at the centre of the research, not just as participants, but as collaborators and co-constructors of the interpretations made of their ‘talk’, and of the subsequent design of a ‘tool’ to facilitate helpful conversations about what they might like to change, and to subsequently measure any impact of interventions. The interview data were analysed using a thematic approach, and the findings were discussed, modified and validated through focus groups with the original interviewees. A thematic network or ‘map of the child’s-eye view’ is presented. A descriptive reading of three emerging topics; academic competence, social competence and social recognition, is offered and discussed, and exemplified by original quotes from the children. (Due to the word limit, additional descriptive analysis is presented in the appendices). Finally, at a deeper level of analysis, two overarching themes, ‘competence’ and ‘connectedness’ are suggested as having emerged from the data. The results of the thematic analysis are linked to previous research, and it is proposed that, while this is only one possible reading of the data presented, there are significant resonances with data collected for children and young people across cultures and age ranges. Therefore findings may tentatively be generalised beyond the local culture. The implications of the findings for EP practice are discussed. In Paper 2, the previous study is used to inform the design of a measure to assess children’s satisfaction with their school life, in terms of issues that are important to them. Current literature on evaluating outcomes in EP services is briefly reviewed. This is followed by discussion of a selection of the measures currently available which target aspects of children’s life in schools, and the advantages and drawbacks of using these in evaluation. Finally, I discuss why it might be advantageous to view school life from the perspective of children’s subjective well-being or ‘happiness’, and review evidence from experimental research, within a positive psychology framework, and particularly the ‘Broaden-and-Build’ Theory of Positive Emotions (Frederickson, 2005). Subsequently, the thematic network, created in Paper 1, was used with four focus groups of the original interviewees, to design items for an instrument to assess subjective satisfaction with school life; what makes them ‘happy’ and ‘ready-to-learn’ in school. The children were included in every step of the design, including; choosing and wording the items (guided by frequency data and the range of topics and themes identified in Study 1), choice of the rating system, <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion</b> and layout, and naming of the instrument (the ‘Ready-to-Learn’ Scale). Following piloting and minor modification, the ‘Ready-to-Learn’ Scale was administered to an opportunity sample of 344 children from the four participating schools over the summer term of 2011. Principal components analysis on the data generated a six factor solution, interpreted as six sub-scales: school competence (α =. 81), social competence (α =. 80), academic competence (α =. 78), distress and discomfort in school (α =. 68), environmental support for learning (α =. 70), and acceptance and recognition by adults (α =. 80), with an overall scale reliability, α =. 92, and a 95...|$|E

50|$|Reliable {{measures}} of self-report {{are defined by}} their consistency. Thus, a reliable self-report measure produces consistent results every time it is executed. A test’s reliability can be measured a few ways. First, one can calculate a test-retest reliability. A test-retest reliability entails conducting the same questionnaire to a large sample at two different times. For the questionnaire to be considered reliable, people in the sample {{do not have to}} score identically on each test, but rather their position in the score distribution should be similar for both the test and the retest. Self-report measures will generally be more reliable when they have many items measuring a construct. Furthermore, measurements will be more reliable when the factor being measured has greater variability among the individuals in the sample that are being tested. Finally, there will be greater reliability when <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>completion</b> of the questionnaire are clear and when there are limited distractions in the testing environment. Contrastingly, a questionnaire is valid if what it measures is what it had originally planned to measure.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} indicates that {{a significant proportion of}} children underaccommodate at 1 / 3 m. Accommodation may vary with task demand, so children may accommodate appropriately if required, for example, when reading small print. This study explores the range of accommodative responses elicited in typical children, under naturalistic conditions, to a range of targets. Method: We identified 24 typically developing children from the University of Reading Child Database. Primary-school children attending UK Year 2 (age 6 - 7 years) or Year 6 (age 10 - 11 years) with minimum distance visual acuity of 0. 200 logMAR and near visual acuity of 0. 100 logMAR were recruited for participation. A remote haploscopic photorefractor was used to assess naturalistic, sustained, binocular accommodative responses to a variety of targets. At 33 cm, accommodative targets included individual letters, age-appropriate text in large print equivalent to early primary-school books, small N 5 equivalent print, a visual search task (“Where’s Wally?”), a clown picture containing a range of spatial frequencies, and a children’s cartoon. Participants were given minimal <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> task <b>completion.</b> The target presentation order was counterbalanced. The results reported in this study were obtained during a longer testing session involving different target types and fixation distances. Results: The accommodative response observed with each target varied across participants to both the clown target and single letters of a size used in school reading books the accommodative responses were 2. 4 ± 0. 48 D (range 0. 85 - 2. 97 D) and 2. 47 ± 0. 37 D (range 1. 48 - 3. 09 D), respectively. The accommodative response to N 5 print (3. 06 ± 0. 52 D) was statistically better than all other targets other than the visual search and larger print tasks (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Even to demanding N 5 text, accommodation is variable between participants, but is better than that to less demanding targets.

40|$|ABSTRACT REALISTIC CONTRIBUTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE PHYSICAL SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT by ?? Lauren Elizabeth Albert 2010 Master of Arts in Education Curriculum and Instruction Option California State University, Chico Summer 2010 As {{funding for}} schools {{continues}} to decline, only certain projects can be completed. Certainly these projects should be ones that offer the greatest return in increasing student achievement. Indeed even in difficult financial times, {{it is possible}} to complete substantial improvement projects for minimal to no cost. However, there are no comprehensive handbooks that explain how to implement such projects. Despite this fact, improving the physical school environment is beneficial to students, educators, and the entire community. The purpose of this project is to identify improvements to schools??? culture, through various projects enhancing the physical aesthetics of the school. The premise of the project is based on findings from a survey, which was directed at the aspects of the schools??? physical environment that caused increases in students??? learning. This project provides a handbook of realistic resources for improving a school???s physical environment. The handbook outlines four project ideas to be completed by the school community for minimal costs. The four project ideas are 1) School Murals, 2) School Garden, 3) Paint with School Colors Benches, Doors, etc., and 4) Plant Trees with Identification Tags. The projects are organized with step-by-step <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> ease of <b>completion.</b> Additionally, the handbook provides resource ideas for funding. Creating an enriching physical school environment has been shown to improve students??? attitudes toward learning, thus positively influencing test scores. This handbook is intended to improve the grounds and facilities of a school with the end result being a more motivated school community. CSU, Chic...|$|R
