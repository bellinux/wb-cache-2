5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with <b>elongated</b> shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly <b>elongated</b> bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Most comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies with <b>elongated</b> {{elliptical}} orbits that take them {{close to the}} Sun for {{a part of their}} orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder.

40|$|Recombination of the {{epithelium}} and mesenchyme between quail anterior submaxillary gland (<b>elongating</b> type) and quail anterior lingual or mouse submaxillary gland (branching type) was effected {{in vitro}} to clarify whether the <b>elongating</b> morphogenesis {{was directed by}} the epithelial or the mesenchymal component. Quail anterior submaxillary epithelium recombined with quail anterior lingual or mouse submaxillary mesenchyme came to branch. Conversely, quail anterior lingual or 12 -day mouse submaxillary epithelium recombined with quail anterior submaxillary mesenchyme came to <b>elongate,</b> though the mesenchyme was less effective with 13 -day mouse submaxillary epithelium.

40|$|A {{surgical}} tool captures and removes very large intraocular foreign bodies from the eye. An <b>elongate</b> bore is formed in an <b>elongate</b> base that {{is held in}} the palm of a hand. A user retracts a foreign body capturing device including a handle, rim, and net into the <b>elongate</b> bore by sliding a thumb-engagable control member in a first direction. The device is extended by sliding the control member in a second direction opposite to the first. The rim is formed of a material having memory so that it expands into an elliptical shape when extended from the <b>elongate</b> bore. The net depends from the rim and is used to capture intraocular foreign bodies.

5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is <b>elongated.</b> Proteus is not significantly <b>elongated,</b> but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it {{is larger than the}} Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km in diameter.|$|E

5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an <b>elongated</b> crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some {{research}} has suggested that both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The <b>elongated</b> crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed by the collapse of a shallow magma chamber. Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E

50|$|Some monocots, such as grasses, have hypogeal emergence, {{where the}} {{mesocotyl}} <b>elongates</b> and pushes the coleoptile (which encloses and protects the shoot tip) toward the soil surface. Since elongation occurs above the cotyledon, it {{is left in}} place in the soil where it was planted. Many dicots have epigeal emergence, in which the hypocotyl <b>elongates</b> and becomes arched in the soil. As the hypocotyl continues to <b>elongate,</b> it pulls the cotyledons upward, above the soil surface.|$|R
40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} is to study changes of phytoliths in Leymus chinensis quantitatively under saline-alkali stress to assist reconstruction of saline paleoenvironments. Methods We selected similarly sized leaves of L. chinensis under six different saline-alkali levels and extracted phytoliths with the wet ashing method.
