40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a prototype of}} an application {{for the analysis of}} cDNA/gene expression data and contribution for genome annotation from macroarrays. The application described here allows the quantification of a set of experiments with macroarrays of the same size. It generates html reports, easily shared, showing the expression of genes contained in each membrane and a global report comparing films (expositions) and probes. Although initially the objective of this application was macroarray analysis, with minor adjustments, it can be used for other densitometric analysis involving circular <b>dish</b> <b>plates</b> such as petri <b>dish</b> <b>plates,</b> or multiple cell plates. It aims to be a simple, but effective, tool that does not require the user to have previous knowledge in image processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{importance}} of aviation industry in modern era is long familiar. The industrial sector has been suffering energy crises from decades and consequently paves {{way for the}} need of energy regeneration and utility. Runways are heart of an airport and currently runways are used as pathways for airplane takeoff and landing. The proposed idea emphasizes use of residual mechanical vibrational energy from aircraft during takeoff and landing. Air Wakes are huge source of vibrational energy and these vibrations are harnessed using energy regenerative engineering technology. The lifting aircraft produces turbulent air wakes, which strike light weight swinging elliptical <b>dish</b> <b>plates</b> along sides of the runway. These are made to vibrate continuously and impact the piezoelectric media which consequently produces electric potential. Varieties of efficient piezoelectric harnessers are being developed using different vibration analysis and many have embarked upon the idea. But this paper is unparallel to those in many ways...|$|R
50|$|Kiln formed {{glass is}} usually {{referred}} to as warm glass, and can be either made up from {{a single piece of}} glass that is slumped into or over a mould or different colours and sheets of glass fused together. The process of hot glass is highly scientific in that the types of glass and temperatures that they must be fired at is quite complicated operation to undertake correctly. Art glass that is kiln formed usually take the form of <b>dishes,</b> <b>plates</b> or tiles. Glass that is fused in a kiln must be of the same co-efficient of expansion (CoE). If glass that does not have the same CoE is used for fusing, the differing rates of contraction will cause minute stress fractures to form and, over time, these fractures will cause a piece to crack. The use of polarizing filters to inspect the work will determine if stress fractures are present.|$|R
