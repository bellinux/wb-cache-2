Mobile disc chippers are used in the pulp- paper industry and fibreboard manufacturing plants.

40|$|The study {{determined}} the time consumption, fuel consumption and chip size obtained with two different industrial chippers, working with logging residues (tops and branches), thinning material and pulpwood. Specific time consumption per oven dry tons (odt) was 83 % {{higher for the}} less powerful <b>disc</b> <b>chipper,</b> and chipping forest residues resulted in a 35 % increase in specific time consumption compared to chipping thinning material. What is more, {{the interaction between the}} two factors pointed at a different suitability of the two machines to chip different materials, since the difference in specific time consumption between the drum and the <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> was larger when chipping forest residues rather than thinning. Specific time and fuel consumption of the more powerful drum chipper increased by 30 % and 39 %, respectively, when working with dull blades compared to working with sharp blades. The best product quality was obtained when applying the <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> to pulpwood material. However, the same machine produced more fines when fed with forest residues...|$|E
40|$|Chip size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} quality variable not only for buyers of forest fuels, but also for chipping contractors as it influences both fuel consumption and productivity of <b>chippers.</b> Studies of <b>disc</b> <b>chippers</b> and of drum chippers with closed drums have shown that increased chip target length increases chipper productivity and decreases fuel consumption per ton of chips produced. For open drum chippers, chip length is partly controlled by the mesh size in the sieve. In order to evaluate how this sieve affects productivity and fuel consumption of chippers, two open drum machines for professional chipping of forest fuels were studied. Small chippers were represented by a Kesla 645, and larger ones by an Eschlböck Biber 92. The Kesla 645 was studied with 25, 50, and 100 mm sieves and the Biber 92 with 35, 50, and 100 mm sieves. With the 100 mm sieve the Kesla chipper produced 14. 5 oven dry ton (odt) of chips per effective hour and the Biber 30. 0 odt per effective hour. Fuel consumption per odt was 3. 0 l for the Kesla and 2. 1 l for the Biber. A reduction of sieve mesh size decreased productivity and increased fuel consumption for both machines. Reducing the mesh size decreased the size of produced chips for the Kesla, {{but not for the}} Biber. The sieve on the Biber seems to be a safety measure against oversized pieces whereas chip size is, as on a closed drum chipper, mainly controlled by the cut length of the knives...|$|R
40|$|Wood-chippers {{are widely}} used {{machines}} in the forestry, urban and agricultural sectors. The use of these machines implies various risks for workers, primarily the risk of contact with moving and cutting parts. These machine parts have a high moment of inertia {{that can lead to}} entrainment with the cutting components. This risk is particularly high in the case of manually fed chippers. Following cases of injury with wood-chippers and the improvement of the technical standard (ComitéEuropéen de Normalisation-European Norm) EN 13525 : 2005 + A 2 : 2009, this technical note presents the prototype of an innovative system to reduce risks related to the involved moving parts, based on the “brake caliper” system and electromagnetic clutch for the declutching of the power take-off (PTO). The prototype has demonstrated its potential for reducing the run-down time of the <b>chipper</b> <b>disc</b> (95 %) and for reducing the worker’s risk of entanglement and entrainment in the machine’s feed mouth...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{tested a}} chipper {{prototype}} adopting a new comminution device, designed to produce high quality chips when processing delimbed logs. The machine was fitted with innovative tubular blades, {{mounted on a}} flywheel. The prototype was powered by a 55 kW farm tractor through the standard power take-off. The machine appeared as efficient as most conventional <b>disc</b> or drum <b>chippers</b> in the same size class, but offered a much better chip quality. Chips were free from any particles longer than 45 mm, and with a very limited content of fine particles (max. 2. 5 %). Of course, this was achieved when using premium wood raw material, such as delimbed small logs. Performance varied with tree species: poplar was the softest and easiest to chip, whereas robinia was the hardest and required a much larger effort. Diesel fuel consumption varied between 3. 4 and 4. 3 dm 3 per oven-dry tonne. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|In {{both the}} {{chemical}} and mechanical pulping process, the logs are cut into wood chips by a <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> before fibre separation. To make the wood chipping process more efficient, one have to investigate in detail the coupling between theprocess parameters {{and the quality of}} the chips. The objective of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind the creation of wood chips. Both experimental and analytical/numerical approaches have been taken inthis work. The experimental investigations were performed with an in‐house developed equipment and a digital speckle photography equipment. The results from the experimental investigation showed that the friction between the log and chipping tool is probably one crucal factor for the chip formation. Further more it was found that the indentation process is approximately self‐similar, and that the stress field over the entire crack‐plane is critical for chip creation. The developed analytical model predicts the normal and shear strain distribution. The analytical distributions are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding distributions obtained from a finite element analysis...|$|E
40|$|The force {{relations}} and dynamics of cutting knife in a vertical <b>disc</b> wood <b>chipper</b> were investigated. The tool geometry determined include: rake angle (20 deg C); Shear angle, (fi= 52. 15 deg C); the mean frictional angle, (t = 5. 71 deg C). The analysis and {{comparison of the}} cutting forces {{has shown that the}} chips separated from the wood are being formed by off cutting, since normal applied force N is compressive in nature, the magnitude of the forces used by the knife on the wood is expected to increase as the cutting edge of the knife goes deeper into the wood until the value of the resisting force acting against the cut wood Ff is reached and exceeded. The evaluated forces acting on the knife and the chip are: F = 3. 63 Nmm^- 1; N = 34. 7 Nmm^- 1; Fs= 27. 45 Nmm^- 1; Fn = 31. 92 Nmm^- 1; Ft = - 8. 46 Nmm^- 1; Fc = 33. 85 Nmm^- 1. The resultant force acting on the tool face, Pr = 34. 89 Nmm^- 1. The specific cutting pressure, Pc and cutting force needed to cut the timber, Fc, are 1. 79 × 10 ^ 6 N/m 2 and 644. 84 N respectively. The energy consumed in removing a unit volume of material is 69. 96 kJ/mm^- 3 and the maximum power developed in cutting the chip is 3591. 77 W (4. 82 hp).

40|$|The study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} chipper type on productivity, power demand, fuel consumption and product quality. Tests were conducted on two commercial chipper models, a disc and a drum chipper. Both chippers had the same diameter capacity, were applied to the same tractor and fed with the same feedstock types. Fifteen replications were conducted per machine and for each of four different feedstock types, reaching a total of 120 tests. The <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> had a higher energy efficiency and used 19 % less fuel per unit product, possibly due to its simpler design, integrating comminuting and discharge system in one synergic device. In contrast, the drum chipper was 8 % more productive, since it cut with the same energy all {{along the length of}} its knives. The drum chipper produced smaller chips, with a higher incidence of fines. Feedstock type had a strong effect on productivity, energy efficiency and product quality. The effect of feedstock type was mainly related to piece size, and may be stronger than the effect of chipper type. Further studies should determine the effect of blade wear on the relative performance of the two chipper types...|$|E
40|$|Roadside {{chipping}} is {{a common}} harvesting system in Australian plantations, which utilizes a mobile chipper stationed at the field edge to produce high-quality pulp chips for export. The studied harvesting system included a feller-buncher, two grapple skidders, a flail-debarker and a <b>disc</b> <b>chipper.</b> The study goals were to determine machine productivity, operation costs, fuel consumption, chip quality and measure the amount of slash left in the field after harvesting. The average productivity for feller buncher and skidder were about 97. 26 GMt/PMH 0 and 60. 22 GMt/PMH 0, respectively. The productivity of flail and chipper averaged at 57. 80 GMt/ PMH 0 and 58. 18 GMt/PMH 0 in this case study. The transportation productivity averaged about 57. 34 GMt/PMH 0. Time studies and regression analysis were used to model machine productivity. Tree size had {{significant impact on the}} feller-buncher productivity, while skidding distance was a significant variable affecting skidding productivity. Operation costs were evaluated using the ALPACA (Australian logging productivity and cost appraisal) model. This paper offers valuable information about the impact of different factors on feller-buncher and skidder productivity. Application of two skidders resulted in high total operating cost. Extracting whole trees to roadside yielded a very small amount of remaining slash distributed on the site...|$|E
40|$|Issue: In {{addition}} to contaminant removal and screening, size-reduction {{is one of}} the key processes in preparing recovered wood waste for a variety of commodity feedstock and specialty product markets. There are several types of equipment that processors can employ to accomplish size reduction. Each type of equipment varies with respect to the forms of wood waste it can effectively handle and the quality of the product it produces. Selection and utilization of the appropriate size-reduction equipment allows processors to convert wood waste into the highest value products attainable from the raw material. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using chipping equipment for size-reduction of specific forms of wood waste to produce finished product of a particular quality. Types of Chipping Equipment. Disc Chipper: A <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> consists of a series of embedded knives arranged around a large steel ‘disc. ’ As the disc rotates, the knives pass a fixed anvil directly at the chipper’s infeed. Disc chippers can have either vertical or horizontal infeeds. The number, position, and bevel of the knives and anvil are critical to the size and quality of the chips produced, as well as the chipping speed.

40|$|Wood chips need {{to fulfill}} {{specific}} quality parameters {{in order to}} be used as fuel for industrial or residential use. Moisture content and chip size distribution are recognized as the main physical characteristics affecting energy conversion efficiency. Objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effects of harvesting mode on the quality of wood chips, under the typical conditions offered by SRC poplar grown in Central Italy. Single-pass and two-pass harvesting were compared. Standing stems and cut windrowed stems were harvested using two modified foragers alternately equipped with a drum or a <b>disc</b> <b>chipper,</b> allowing a further comparison of different chipping devices. Data were obtained from 3 fields in Central Italy and allowed analyzing the drying process occurring when stems are felled and stored in the field as windrows. The mean water content at the time of cutting was 59 % (wH 2 O) (wH 2 O), which was reduced below 30 % after about 100 days of storage in the windrows. Regression analysis of storage duration and moisture content showed that air temperature is the main driver of the drying process, under the typical conditions of a Mediterranean climate. Harvest mode (single-pass or two-pass) and chipping device (drum or disc) have a significant effect on particle-size distribution. The incidence of accept particle was higher when chipping windrowed stems or using the drum chipper. The paper discusses the advantages of two-pass harvesting and emphasizes the importance of flexibility when choosing harvest mode and chipper type...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} rock abrasiveness {{that causes}} attrition (wearing down) of the disintegration indentors. In {{the case of}} drilling machines equipped with <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> tools it is the attrition of the discs. The attrition of the discs results in {{the reduction of the}} drilling rate and the increase in the specific disintegration energy, thus directly affecting the total economic outcome of the mining site (tunnel). Abrasiveness of the rock is the rocks ability to wear down the working tool during the mutual interaction between the working indentor and the rock in the mechanic rock disintegration process. The disintegration indentor wears down during the interaction, that changes its geometric dimensions, causing the increase in the contact area between the tool and the surface of the rock. The changes in these dimensions consequently alter the rate of advance of the drilling machine and the specific disintegration energy. Abrasiveness is therefore an overall result of physical and mechanical characteristics of the rock during the interaction between the disintegration indentor and the rock. In the present time there is no method that would formulate the rocks abrasiveness at the hands of physical-mechanical characteristics of the rock. Because the interaction between the tool and the rock depends on the characteristics of the tool, abrasiveness is at present a relative quantity, dependent also {{on the quality of the}} disintegration indentors. With the progress in the quality of disintegration tools, the abrasiveness and the attrition of the tool during mechanic rock disintegration changes. From this standpoint it is, in the course of determining the rocks abrasiveness in the laboratory procedures, needed to eliminate the impact of the disintegration indentor characteristics. By choosing one disintegration indentor type with predetermined physical-mechanical characteristics for the laboratory measurements, we can obtain abrasiveness that characterizes the examined rock. The process of interaction between the indentor and the rock is also influenced by the environment where the interaction takes place. The effect of the environment is not negligible and therefore it is, in the laboratory conditions of determining the abrasiveness, always necessary to provide for the same environment and thus eliminate its influence on the overall measurement, especially in the case of comparing the abrasiveness of different rocks. We have determined the abrasiveness according to the ON 44 1121 (1982) on three types of rocks...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} a global increase in Eucalyptus pulpwood plantations. Harvesting systems traditionally utilised in the northern hemisphere are being used in Eucalyptus pulpwood plantations worldwide. However, the small tree size and complexity of debarking Eucalyptus have provided harvesting with productivity and cost challenges not previously experienced in northern-hemisphere conditions. Much research has been invested in these two harvesting methods in northern-hemisphere species and conditions. There is little research available on mechanised processing-machine productivity and costs in Eucalyptus. This investigation aimed to quantify the effect that tree and bundle size has on the productivity of different processing machines in Eucalyptus plantation pulpwood. This was done through regression analysis, whereby productivity models that included tree size and bundle size were constructed. The research also aimed {{to determine whether or}} not the multi-stem systems were more cost-effective in smaller tree sizes. The research investigated five mechanised harvesting options that forestry managers could use in Eucalyptus pulpwood plantations. These systems consisted of one CTL system, one full-tree system with single-stem processing and three full-tree systems with multi-stem processing. The CTL system used a harvester to process the trees into logs and to extract them. The full-tree system with single-stem processing used a dangle-head processor (DHP) to process trees into logs. The first full-tree system with multi-stem processing used a chain-flail debrancher debarker (CFDD) to produce debarked and debranched tree lengths, which were slashed into logs. The remaining full-tree, multi-stem systems both produced chips. The first used a chain-flail debrancher debarker chipper (CFDDC) and the second, a CFDD feeding into a stand-alone <b>disc</b> <b>chipper</b> (CFDD&C). The productivity data, measured as m 3 per productive machine hour (PMH), was then statistically analysed using regression techniques. Productivity equations were formulated, considering tree size and bundle size, as well as the quadratic functions of these two variables and the interaction between them. Bundle size was only applicable to the multi-stem processing machines. The productivity equations successfully predicted processing-machine productivity, using tree size and bundle size as input variables. Apart from the 0. 075 m 3 tree size class, the CFDD had the highest overall productivity. The costs of the five systems were then calculated for different tree sizes. No single system was more cost-effective than the others across all tree sizes. In 0. 075 m 3 trees, the CFDDC system proved the most cost-effective. All systems evidenced high costs in the 0. 075 m 3 trees, ranging between $ 19. 43 per m 3 for the CFDDC system to $ 28. 84 for the harvester system. In 0. 40 m 3 trees, the cost differences between systems were lower, ranging from $ 6. 91 per m 3 for the DHP system to $ 11. 84 per m 3 for the CFDD&C. This study confirms that the CTL system was very expensive to operate in the small tree sizes (0. 075 m 3). There is a cross-over point at 0. 25 m 3 per tree, where the CTL system costs become lower than those of the full-tree system. At the 0. 40 m 3 tree size, the full-tree system is slightly more expensive than the CTL system. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.
