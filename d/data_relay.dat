5|$|Radio {{communications}} provided telemetry {{and scientific}} data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links {{were also used}} during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, Mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to the core module. The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the Luch <b>data</b> <b>relay</b> satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, {{in order to receive}} commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system.|$|E

Data channels for the Canadarm2, European Columbus laboratory and Japanese Kibō modules are routed via the S band and Ku band systems, although the European <b>Data</b> <b>Relay</b> System and a similar Japanese system will eventually complement the TDRSS in this role.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} <b>data</b> <b>relaying</b> in {{wireless}} sensor networks (WS-Nets) under QoS constraints with two different strategies. In the first, data packets originating from the same source are sent to the base station possibly along several different paths, while in the second, exactly one path is used for this purpose. The two strategies correspond to splitting and not splitting relaying traffic respectively. We model a sensor network architecture based on a three-tier hierarchy of nodes which generalizes to a two-tier WSNet with multiple sinks. Our results apply therefore to both types of networks. Based on the assumptions in our model, we describe several methods for computing relaying paths that are optimal with respect to energy consumption and satisfy QoS requirements expressed by the delay with which data are delivered to the base station(s). We then use our algorithms to perform an empirical analysis that quantifies the performance gains and losses of the splittable and unsplittable traffic allocation strategies for wireless sensor networks with delayconstrained traffic. Our experiments show that splitting traffic does not provide a significant advantage in energy consumption, but can afford strategies for <b>relaying</b> <b>data</b> with a lower delay penalty when using a model based on soft-delay constraints. Key words: Sensor networks, <b>data</b> <b>relaying,</b> delay constraints. ...|$|R
