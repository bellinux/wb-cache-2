5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or {{that one of them}} offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} years, he was Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation. As chairman, he {{advocated}} {{the establishment of}} a World War I memorial similar to other war memorials in Washington, D.C.. Toward this end, Buckles campaigned for the District of Columbia War Memorial to be renamed the National World War I Memorial. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> before Congress in support of this cause, and met with President George W. Bush at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Teller became {{controversial}} in 1954 when <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> against Oppenheimer at Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial {{he was the}} only member of the scientific community to state that Oppenheimer should not be granted security clearance.|$|E
50|$|Richard Farley - One of {{the members}} of Tyson's platoon. <b>He</b> <b>testifies</b> against Tyson.|$|R
6000|$|... ... In the Autobiography (1873) of John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), {{there is}} a {{remarkable}} passage where <b>he</b> <b>testifies</b> to the influence exerted upon him by Wordsworth.] ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>testifies</b> {{regularly}} {{before the}} U.S. Congress. He chairs the South-Central Europe area {{studies program at}} the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State.|$|R
5|$|After <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> {{before a}} grand jury in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted when the case went to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
50|$|After Libby's {{motion to}} dismiss was denied, the press {{initially}} reported that <b>he</b> would <b>testify</b> at the trial. In February 2007, during the trial, however, numerous press reports stressed that whether or not <b>he</b> will <b>testify</b> was still uncertain, and, ultimately, <b>he</b> did not <b>testify</b> at trial.|$|R
50|$|During 1998, as {{a member}} of Serbian Police, he had taken part in a series of actions for which <b>he</b> <b>testifies</b> that were taken against Albanian civilians across Kosovo.|$|R
50|$|The US {{government}} {{agreed to}} drop all charges filed against Sklyarov, provided that <b>he</b> <b>testify</b> {{at the trial}} of his company. He was permitted to return to Russia on December 13, 2001.|$|R
5|$|As radicalism {{took hold}} in Britain in the 1790s, Johnson became {{increasingly}} involved in its causes: {{he was a}} member of the Society for Constitutional Information, which was attempting to reform Parliament; he published works defending Dissenters after the religiously motivated Birmingham Riots in 1791; and <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> on behalf of those arrested during the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims of press gangs, and those unjustly accused of violating the game laws.|$|E
5|$|Caltech did not spell {{an end to}} Bacher's {{service in}} Washington. He served two terms {{as a member of}} the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959. During his first term <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James L. Fisk and Ernest Lawrence to examine how a Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty could be monitored.|$|E
5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E
5000|$|As to any {{evidence}} or facts against him which the defendant can reasonably {{be expected to}} deny or explain because of facts within his knowledge, if <b>he</b> does not <b>testify</b> or if, though <b>he</b> does <b>testify,</b> <b>he</b> fails to deny or explain such evidence, the jury may take that failure into consideration as tending to indicate the truth of such evidence.|$|R
50|$|Jack Zelig (1888-1912), murdered before <b>he</b> could <b>testify.</b>|$|R
50|$|Raymond Sintès is a {{neighbour}} of Meursault who beats his Arab mistress. Her {{brother and}} friends {{try to take}} revenge. He brings Meursault into the conflict, and the latter kills the brother. Raymond and Meursault seem to develop a bond, and <b>he</b> <b>testifies</b> for Meursault during his trial.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Brown {{became the}} deputy {{commander}} of U.S. Special Operations Command and, holding the post until 2003 {{when he was}} selected to replace Air Force General Charles R. Holland as Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. Shortly after becoming the head of USSOCOM, in 2004, {{he was involved in}} the aftermath of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident which culminated when <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> before the congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2007. Also during his tenure in command of USSOCOM he announced the creation of Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command in 2006. Brown retired in 2007 after leading USSOCOM through four years of the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to Mondorf-les-Bains where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a number of American POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> at the Nuremberg trial of Hermann Göring, but his offers to testify against Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
50|$|Siddiki {{was brought}} up in London, England. He worked as a {{marketing}} executive at A.L. Williams, now Primerica Financial Services, before a life-threatening bout with shingles in 1987, at the age of thirty-four at Toronto General Hospital, which <b>he</b> <b>testifies</b> led to his conversion from Islam to Christianity.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> also <b>testified</b> before Congress in his {{official}} capacity.|$|R
5000|$|... "Never Would Have Made It" [...] is {{a single}} by American gospel singer Marvin Sapp from his seventh studio album Thirsty. Sapp wrote this song as a tribute {{after the death of}} his father, Henry Lewis Sapp, Jr. <b>He</b> <b>testifies</b> that it was created by divine {{inspiration}} the Sunday after his father’s burial.|$|R
5|$|Other {{witnesses}} for {{the plaintiffs}} included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified {{that she had seen}} the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night. Allan MacMillan was also called: though <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|President Smetona {{received}} memoranda {{from nine}} nationalistic organizations urging {{the government to}} reject the ultimatum. However, a decisive comment was made by General Stasys Raštikis, {{the commander of the}} Lithuanian army: <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> that a military victory over Poland was impossible and argued for a peaceful resolution. The government's decision was confirmed by the Fourth Seimas with minimal discussion. On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as a show of good faith.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5000|$|Hitman Trabucco {{has been}} hired to {{eliminate}} Rudy [...] "Disco" [...] Gambola before <b>he</b> <b>testifies</b> against fellow members of the Mob, but completing the contract becomes problematic once he encounters suicidal Victor Clooney, an emotionally disturbed television censor staying in the room adjacent to his in the Ramona Hotel in Riverside, California.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> who <b>testifies</b> {{to these}} things says, “Surely I am coming quickly”.|$|R
40|$|This {{recording}} is of Dell delivering devotionals on Isaiah 1 : 18, {{about how}} people should come to Jesus now to reason with him and worship him. He talks about human suffering, and about how Jesus forgives and accepts sinners into paradise. <b>He</b> <b>testifies</b> about finding God as a teenager, and his transition into becoming a Christian...|$|R
5|$|The first {{witnesses}} for the Claimant included former {{officers and}} men from Roger Tichborne's regiment, {{all of whom}} declared their belief that he was genuine. Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was John Moore, Roger's valet in South America. <b>He</b> <b>testified</b> that the Claimant had remembered many small details of their months together, including clothing worn {{and the name of}} a pet dog the pair had adopted. Roger's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which <b>he</b> <b>testified</b> could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Hearings into Teapot Dome {{began in}} October 1923, after Harding's death. Fall had left office earlier that year, but he denied {{receiving}} any money from Sinclair or Doheny; Sinclair agreed. The following month, Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch. Fall reappeared {{and stated that}} the money had come as a loan from Harding's friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B. McLean, but McLean denied it when <b>he</b> <b>testified.</b> Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a personal loan out of regard for their past association, but Fall invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.|$|E
5000|$|... 19:27-28:30: In {{his final}} journey to Rome, Paul is taken by Jews in Jerusalem to be killed, but is rescued by Roman {{soldiers}} who imprison him. <b>He</b> <b>testifies</b> before the Sanhedrin (22:30-23:11), {{and the governor}} Felix at Caesarea (24:1-27) before using his power as a Roman citizen (22:29) to have his case heard by the emperor.|$|R
50|$|Robinson (1957: p. 296) conveys {{his focus}} and states his methodology, clearly {{identifying}} the limitations in {{scope of this}} particular publication, which <b>he</b> <b>testifies</b> is principally built upon, though divergent from, the work of Nakamura:In considering the formal structure of Nagarjuna's argumentation, I exclude epistemology, psychology, and ontology from consideration.... Such extra-logical observations as emerge will be confined to the concluding paragraphs...|$|R
50|$|In 1906, U.S. {{government}} prosecutors {{served a}} grand jury subpoena on Hale, demanding that <b>he</b> <b>testify</b> and turn over corporate documents. Hale appeared before the jury but refused to reply to questions or to produce documents. On his company's behalf, he invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and was held in contempt. Hale then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit, which ultimately came before the Supreme Court.|$|R
