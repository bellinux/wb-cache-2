50|$|The {{production}} of bottromycin by S. bottropensis and S. scabies, {{as well as}} the {{production of}} a bottromycin analog termed bottromycin D, has been studied. It was independently confirmed in 2012 by multiple groups that bottromycin is produced as a ribosomal peptide natural product that it subsequently post-translationally modified. Before this, it was unclear whether bottromycin was produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase machinery (NRPS). The presence of amino acids other than the 20 proteinogenic amino acids is often a feature of NRPS products because NRPS machinery can directly incorporate other amino acids, among other chemical building blocks. Ribosomal peptide synthesis, which is the same machinery that produces all proteins found in the cell, is limited to the 20 proteinogenic amino acids.

40|$|Scientific {{progress}} in organic synthesis, biochemistry and biology and cures to many infectious diseases and cancer rely on discovery of microbial natural products and their biosynthetic pathways. ̀Omics' approaches such as <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> have opened {{new opportunities for}} natural product discovery within the last decade as ̃ 90 % of pathways in microbial genomes are uncharacterized in their products. <b>Genome</b> <b>mining</b> for natural product discovery {{can be defined as}} the connection of a natural product (chemotype) with its biosynthetic genes (genotype) by applied biosynthetic knowledge. Traditional <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> approaches are in silico-guided approaches in which the isolation of a new natural product is guided by bioinformatic predictions from a target cryptic gene cluster. The problem of in silico-guided <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> in natural product discovery is its low-throughput rate as only one pathway is characterized per experiment. In this dissertation, mass spectrometry (MS) -guided <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> approaches are introduced which rapidly connect a natural product with its biosynthetic genes by matching de novo tandem MS structures of biosynthetic building blocks such as amino acids and sugars to metabolite structures predicted from microbial genomes. As MS guided <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> starts at the chemotype level by e. g. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of a microbial extract and subsequently connects putative natural products with their gene clusters, it has the potential for automation. In Chapter 2, peptidogenomics is introduced as a MS-guided <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> approach for characterization of ribosomal and nonribosomal peptide chemotypes and their corresponding genotypes. Peptidogenomics characterized ten new peptide chemo- and genotypes from Streptomyces cultures including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, linaridins and lipopeptides. In Chapter 3, a combination of imaging mass spectrometry, tandem MS and <b>genome</b> <b>mining</b> characterized the biosynthetic pathway of the didemnin anti-cancer agents in the marine alpha-proteobacterium Tistrella mobilis.

40|$|An organism's {{ability to}} detect and {{interpret}} chemical signals from the surrounding environment is vital to its survival. In mammals, the vomeronasal organ provides {{an integral part of}} this requirement as it allows for the detection of inter-individual chemical signals. Located within the vomeronasal epithelium is a group of highly specialized receptors called vomeronasal type- 1 receptors (V 1 Rs). These receptors bind pheromones and kairomones, which are chemical cues from conspecifics and heterospecifics, respectively. Recently, V 1 Rs have been recognized as highly variable across mammalian taxa. One extraordinary example is the mouse lemur, in which ~ 83 % of the estimated 259 genes are expected to be intact. This relatively young and cryptically diverse prosimian group has a controversial history of species delimitation and it is possible that patterns in the rapidly evolving and highly diverse V 1 R gene family may provide insight into species boundaries. This study generated broad and deep coverage of the two most diverse V 1 R subfamilies across multiple Microcebus species. By utilizing Pacific Bioscience's single molecule real time sequencing technology, this study produced sequences {{at a fraction of the}} time and cost of the traditional method of Sanger-sequenced clones. The results advance our understanding of the high diversity-at least 5. 6 % and 9. 9 % sequence divergence intra- and inter-individually for V 1 R IX and V 1 R strep, respectively-and rapid evolution of V 1 Rs in mouse lemurs. Comparing these results with draft <b>genome</b> <b>mined</b> sequences demonstrates the limited utility of low coverage genomes for identifying variation in this gene family.
