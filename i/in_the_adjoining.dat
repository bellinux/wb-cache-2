5|$|The railway {{provides}} the suburb's most important industry, through the Hillside Railway Workshops, which {{are located in}} the southeast of the suburb and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> suburb of South Dunedin.

5|$|Within {{the close}} precincts of the Bijaymandal, a domed {{building}} is seen {{which has a}} unique architectural façade of two openings on each of its three sides, interpreted as an annex to another building (based on underground passages seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> structure). However, the purpose for which this dome was built is not known.|$|E

5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> rear garden.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside {{the course of the}} River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

25|$|The highest {{recorded}} amount {{appears to}} be specifically in the seed coat of black soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) containing approximately 2 g per 100 g, in purple corn kernels and husks, and in the skins and pulp of black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa L.) (see table). Due to critical differences in sample origin, preparation, and extraction methods determining anthocyanin content, the values presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adjoining</b> table are not directly comparable.|$|E
