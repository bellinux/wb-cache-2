40|$|During {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, there may be marked body weight loss. Therefore, body composition should be monitored to check for a decrease in fat mass alone, without an excessive decrease of both fat-free mass and total body water. Accordingly, {{it is useful to}} monitor the hydration of these patients. One method that allows us to check the status of body hydration is the multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis (MFBIA). It makes use of formulas that estimate total body water {{on the basis of the}} concept that the human body may be approximated to a cylinder of length equal to body height. In normal subjects body water estimates are sufficiently accurate, but in obese subjects the true hydration status may be overestimated. In this report, we describe the accuracy of mathematical models previously described in the literature, and correct for the overestimation of total body water in obese subjects by means of a new equation based on a new model. The coefficients for each model have been recalculated by the weighing of our sample in order to test the accuracy of estimates obtained with the equations. This new model includes both body volume and two impedances at appropriate frequencies useful for identifying two terms strictly related to extra- and intra-cellular water. The new formulas do not include body weight, but they include the body volume, a parameter more closely related to the biophysical reference model. Fifty-five overweight females, body mass index ranging from 26. 8 to 50. 2 kg/m 2, were enrolled in the study. The proposed equations, taking advantage of two impedance values at appropriate frequencies, better predict total body water in obese women. This was particularly evident when the results obtained with the multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis and <b>deuterium</b> isotopic <b>oxide</b> dilution method were compared. Although this last method is considered the "gold standard," it is not suitable for use in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, evaluation of total body composition by means of bioelectric impedance analysis might be included in programs for the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and for monitoring weight loss during overt pathology...|$|R
40|$|Total body water {{reference}} values and prediction equations for adults. BackgroundThe clinical interpretation of total body water (TBW) necessitates {{the availability of}} timely comparative reference data. The prediction of TBW volume in renal disease is critical in order to prescribe and monitor the dose of dialysis in the determination of Kt/V. In clinical practice, urea distribution (V) is commonly predicted from anthropometric equations that are several decades old and for white patients only. This article presents new {{reference values}} and prediction equations for TBW from anthropometry for white and black adults. MethodsThe study sample included four data sets, two from Ohio and one each from New Mexico and New York, {{for a total of}} 604 white men, 128 black men, 772 white women, and 191 black women who were 18 to 90 years of age. The TBW concentration was measured by the <b>deuterium</b> or tritium <b>oxide</b> dilution method, and body composition was measured with a Lunar DXA machine. An all-possible-subsets of regression was used to predict TBW. The accuracy of the selected equations was confirmed by cross-validation. ResultsBlacks had larger TBW means than whites at all age groups. The 75 th TBW percentile for whites approximated the TBW median for blacks at most ages. The white men and black men and women had the largest TBW means ever reported for healthy individuals. The race- and sex-specific TBW prediction equations included age, weight, and stature, with body mass index (BMI) substituted for weight in the white men. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) and standard errors for the individual (SEIs) ranged from approximately 3. 8 to 5. 0 L for the men and from 3. 3 to 3. 6 L for the women. In both men and women, high values of TBW were associated with high levels of total body fat (TBF) and fat-free mass (FFM). ConclusionTBW in these healthy adults is relatively stable through a large portion of adulthood. There are significant race and sex differences in TBW. These accurate and precise equations for TBW provide a useful tool for the clinical prediction of TBW in renal disease for white and black adults. These are the first TBW prediction equations that are specific for blacks...|$|R

25|$|<b>Deuterium</b> <b>oxide</b> is used {{in nuclear}} {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy when using water as solvent if the nuclide of interest is hydrogen.

25|$|The CANDU, for Canada Deuterium Uranium, is a Canadian {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactor design {{used to generate}} electric power.

40|$|The Lewis acid catalysed {{rearrangement}} of optically active, <b>deuterium</b> labelled styrene <b>oxide</b> derivatives to aldehydes is studied experimentally and {{the mechanism}} is further elucidated by ab initio molecular orbital and density functional calculations. The Lewis acid catalysed rearrangement of styrene oxide derivatives {{is shown to}} occur via a carbocation intermediate. Opening of the epoxide ring occurs with rotation of the Lewis acid coordinated oxygen either towards or away from the aryl group to form either the cis or trans carbocation. Calculations indicate that conversion between the cis and trans cations will only occur via ring closure back to the epoxide. The selectivity for hydride migration {{is controlled by the}} preferred geometry of thc carbocation intemediate, specifically whether the C-O bond prefers to adopt an eclipsed confonnation relative to the adjacent cation substituent or whether the stabilisation of the cation is obtained from hyperconjugation of a terminal hydrogen to the cation centre. Chapter One contains a review of the relevant literature and the results of previous mechanistic studies into the Lewis acid catalysed rearrangement of epoxides are discussed. In Chapter Two, a methodology is developed to measure the relative amounts of hydrogen or deuterium in each position of the aldehyde produced by hydride or deuteride migration in the rearrangement of a styrene oxide derivative. The aldehyde product is reduced to an alcohol and reacted with a chiral acid chloride. The resulting ester can be analysed by III NMR in the presence of Yb(hfC) 3 or Eu(hfc) 3 chiral shift reagents so that the full stereochemical course of the hydride migration can be determined. Chapter Three describes the BF 3. OEt 2 and LiC 104 catalysed rearrangement of deuterated analogues of optically active p-methylstyrene oxide. It is shown that the rearrangement reaction must proceed at least in part via a carbocation intermediate. The results are analysed by the method of Fujimoto and show that for both the BF 3. OEt 2 and LiC 104 catalysed reactions, the majority of the reaction occurs by epoxide opening with rotation of the Lewis acid coordinated oxygen towards the aromatic group (66 % : 34 % and 57 % : 43 % respectively). This is in contrast to previous studies where it was assumed that this reaction pathway would not occur. In the LiC 104 catalysed reaction, where epoxide opening occurs with rotation of the oxygen away from the aromatic group, hydride/deuteride migration occurs almost exclusively with inversion of configuration; while in the other reactions hydride migrates to an equal extent with inversion or retention of configuration. In Chapter Four, deuterated fluorohydrin is synthesised from deuterated p-methylstyrene oxide and converted to aldehyde with an excess of BF 3. OEh in order to determine whether fluorohydrin is an undetected intermediate in the BF 3. OEt 2 catalysed rearrangement of p-methyl styrene oxide. It is shown the conversion of fluorohydrin to aldehyde occurs by a nearly concerted mechanism, in contrast to the rearrangement of p-methylstyrene oxide to aldehyde which occurs via a carbocation. The rates of the two reactions are also not compatible and fluorohydrin is shown not to be an intem 1 ediate in the reaction. Chapter Five describes the LiC 104 and BF 3. OEt 2 catalysed rearrangement of deuterated optically active m-methoxystyrene oxide. The selectivity for hydride migration observed is consistent with the mechanism developed for the rearrangement of p-methylstyrene oxide in chapter 3. More of the reaction goes by epoxide opening with rotation towards the aryl group for the destabilised m-methoxy compared to the p-methyl substituted epoxide. Chapter Six describes a computational investigation into the BF 3 and Li+ catalysed rearrangement of various styrene oxide derivatives. Stationary points are calculated on the potential energy surfaces for the reactions and the stationary points are characterised by vibrational frequency calculations. Two confom 1 ations of carbocation are found on the Li+ catalysed reaction surface. One structure has the C-O bond eclipsed with the adjacent C- aryl bond and both terminal hydrogens equally aligned for migration. The other cation minimum shows one terminal hydrogen already in hyperconjugation with the carbocation p-orbital, making it more likely to migrate. It is also shown that rotation of the oxygen towards and away from the aryl group can be considered separately when analysing the reaction. Chapter Seven describes a computational study into the BF 3 catalysed rearrangement of 2, 3, 3 -trimethyl- 1 -butene oxide. The results are combined with a previous computational and experimental studies and it is shown that the reaction fits with the mechanism developed to explain the results of the rearrangement of styrene oxide derivatives. The synthesis of chiral deuterated, 1 -octene oxide and 2, 3, 3 -trimethyl- 1 -butene oxide and the attempted synthesis of p-methoxystyrene oxide is described in Chapter Eight. Chapter Nine describes an investigation into acetate participation in epoxide rearrangement reactions. In this study epoxide rearranged to ketone and no participation of acetate in a cyclisation reaction was observed. The final chapter details the experimental procedures used in the preceding chapters...|$|R

25|$|Different {{isotopes}} {{of chemical}} elements have slightly different chemical behaviors, {{but for most}} elements the differences are far too small to use, or even detect. For hydrogen, however, this is not true.
