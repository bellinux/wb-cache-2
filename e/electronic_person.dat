40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in the ethical design of robots. As evidence of this fact, one may refer to some recent reports and the European Parliament’s resolution on civil law rules on robotics. The latter will be {{the primary focus of}} this analysis since the EU Parliament is the first legal institution in the world to have initiated work of a law on robots and artificial intelligence. The European strategy on robotics seems affected by two main problems: an excessive emphasis on ethics at the expense of security, and more gen-erally, a lack of awareness of the critical role played by the operation of striking a balance between competing interests. Balancing is pivotal to the interpretation and application of the law. And the current development of AI technologies does not enable the delegation of the operation to robots. Certainly, the most controversial point regards the status of robots as <b>electronic</b> <b>persons.</b> Even though the suggestion may seem extreme, it may prove to be successful, for at least three reasons. First, robots {{are becoming more and more}} similar to humans (anthropomorfisation and AI). Second, humans are becoming increasingly akin to robots (artificial enhancement).

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} {{recognition of the}} benefits of exercise in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), yet the MS population does not engage in sufficient amounts of exercise to accrue health benefits. There has been little qualitative inquiry to establish the preferred format and source for receiving exercise information from health-care providers among persons with MS. Objective: We sought to identify the desired and preferred format and source of exercise information for persons with MS that can be delivered through health-care providers. Setting and participants: Participants were adults with MS who had mild or moderate disability and participated in a range of exercise levels. All participants lived in the Midwest of the United States. Methods: Fifty semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Two themes emerged, (i) approach for receiving exercise promotion and (ii) ideal person for promoting exercise. Persons with MS want to receive exercise information through in-person consultations with health-care providers, print media and <b>electronic</b> media. <b>Persons</b> with MS want to receive exercise promotion from health-care providers with expertise in MS (ie neurologists) and with expertise in exercise (eg physical therapists).

5000|$|A one-man band or one-woman band is a {{musician}} {{who plays a}} number of instruments simultaneously using their hands, feet, limbs, and various mechanical and/or <b>electronic</b> contraptions. One <b>person</b> band musicians also often sing while they perform. The simplest type of [...] "one-person band" [...] — a singer accompanying him/herself on acoustic guitar and playing a harmonica mounted in a metal [...] "harp rack" [...] below the mouth — is often used by buskers and folk music singer-guitarists. More complicated setups may include wind instruments strapped around the neck, a large bass drum mounted on the musician's back with a beater which is connected to a foot pedal, cymbals strapped between the knees or triggered by a pedal mechanism, tambourines and maracas tied to the limbs, and a stringed instrument strapped over the shoulders (e.g., a banjo, ukulele or guitar). Since the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers, and electronic pedal keyboards into their set-ups. In the 2000s and 2010s, the availability of affordable digital looping pedals enables singer-musicians to record a riff or chord progression and then solo and/or sing over it.|$|R

They wrote that [...] "the Justice Department's defense of what it concedes was secret and warrantless <b>electronic</b> surveillance of <b>persons</b> within the United States fails to identify any plausible legal authority for such surveillance. Accordingly the program appears on its face to violate existing law." [...] They summarized: In conclusion, the DOJ letter fails to offer a plausible legal defense of the NSA domestic spying program. If the administration felt that FISA was insufficient, the proper course was to seek legislative amendment, as it did with other aspects of FISA in the Patriot Act, and as Congress expressly contemplated when it enacted the wartime wiretap provision in FISA. One of the crucial features of a constitutional democracy is that it is always open to the President—or anyone else—to seek to change the law. But it is also beyond dispute that, in such a democracy, the President cannot simply violate criminal laws behind closed doors because he deems them obsolete or impracticable.|$|R

There were ten large newspapers operating in Saudi Arabia in 1992, all privately owned; seven were printed in Arabic and three in English. English is commonly taught in the public schools, and sometimes French is offered in private academies. The Saudi men living in the United States and who {{do not wish to}} return to Saudi Arabia to marry do have other options when seeking a spouse. In the 1990s, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), headquartered in Plainfield, Indiana, maintained an <b>electronic</b> database of <b>persons</b> seeking to marry. Through it, Muslims living in the United States and Canada were able to locate potential spouses with whom they could share Islamic values. The restrictions for Saudi women desiring to marry non-Saudis are severe. As of 1999, they were required get a kingly dispensation to marry anyone that was not from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, or the United Arab Emirates. In 1999, the American Embassy was aware of that only four Saudi women be married with Americans men. For these reasons, Saudi men and women living in the United States are unlikely to marry with Americans, thereby eliminating one aspect of Americanization: The cross-cultural marriages that have played key roles in helping to establish other ethnic communities in United States.|$|R

The negative sequelae of falls in older persons are well documented; risk factors for falls in this population have been extensively investigated and evidence for the efficacy of interventions to reduce falls is steadily emerging. It is not known whether the risk factors for falls and effective interventions for falls risk reduction in patients with cancer are different from those in older <b>persons.</b> <b>Electronic</b> databases MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for studies of risk factors for falls or effective interventions for falls risk reduction in patients with cancer. Assessment of study quality was performed. Data analysis was descriptive. Seven studies designed to identify the risk factors for falls in patients with cancer and one study to determine the predictive validity of a screening tool for falls in patients with cancer were included. All had methodological shortcomings, precluding the generation of a new synthesis from this review, but highlighting important design and statistical issues. Further research is needed to identify patients at risk and inform the design of an interventional model to reduce falls risk. Investigators should be cognizant of the limitations of using cross-sectional study design to answer this research question, should employ validated tools to measure exposure variables, use reliable methods to ascertain the occurrence of falls and appropriate statistical models to adjust for confounding variables...|$|R

A problem may arise if an enemy who sees the electronic transaction has unlimited computational power: he can break the underlying computational assumption {{of the system and}} forge a signature. In this situation, {{there is no way to}} distinguish whether the signer is trying to deny his own signature, or someone else is trying to forge the signature.

This includes finding new template constructions and also specific construction based on the known templates. A second objective is to propose FSS constructions that can cater for specific applications. In particular we will propose constructions of FSS that can be securely used in distributed environments, and FSS that can be efficiently used for signing long messages. Both these applications are of high interest in today 2 ̆ 7 s distributed computer systems and as will be shown, pose new security and efficiency problems that require careful attention.

After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was {{moved away from the}} wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all <b>electronic</b> devices a <b>person</b> carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a head-mounted display. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so [...] "deckers" [...] have once again become [...] "hackers". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.|$|R

As {{part of a larger}} study to estimate HIV incidence within Kiev City, we included questions on possible {{risk factors for}} HIV acquisition and testing history to existing systems in 4 infectious disease clinics. Data were provided by the person requesting an HIV test using a handheld <b>electronic</b> tablet. All <b>persons</b> (≥ 16 yrs) presenting for an HIV test April 2013 -March 2014 were included. Rates per 100, 000 were calculated using region-specific denominators for Kiev. During the study period 6370 individuals tested for HIV, equivalent to a testing rate of 293. 2 per 100, 000. Of these, 467 (7. 8 %) were HIV-positive, with the highest proportion positive among 31 - 35 year olds (11. 2 %), males (9. 4 %), people who inject drugs (PWID) (17. 9 %) and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) (24. 1 %). Using published population size estimates of MSM, diagnosis rates for MSM ranged from 490. 6 to 1548. 3 / 100, 000. A higher proportion of heterosexual women compared to heterosexual men reported contact with PWID, (16 % vs. 4. 7 %) suggesting a bridging in risk between PWID and their sexual partners. Collection of HIV risk factor information in Kiev, essential for the purposes of developing effective HIV prevention and response tools, is feasible. The high percentage of MSM among those testing positive for HIV, may indicate a significant level of undisclosed sex between men in national figures...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 The {{objective}} of this project is to design an antenna {{for use in the}} <b>electronic</b> monitoring of <b>persons</b> convicted of non-violent crimes. If implemented, electronic monitoring will lighten the load on the South African prison system. Electronic monitoring makes use of an electronic tether connected to the person being monitored. This led to specific performance requirements and size constraints being placed on the antenna. The antenna should be physically small while still being able to perform as specified. It is also necessary to test the design with various frequencies, to determine the best possible frequency to use. It was decided to use a Transformer Coupled Loop (TCL) antenna, after various designs were considered. The TCL antenna can be used in various configurations, with some of these configurations being simulated to determine the best antenna structure to use. After various antenna structures were discarded, a specific antenna structure emerged as a possible solution, which was then optimised to deliver the best possible performance. The optimised antenna model was constructed to test the antenna performance. The receiving antenna was a directional Log-Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA), connected to a spectrum analyser. Tests were conducted in an open-field environment to minimise the effect of reflections. The azimuth- and elevation radiation patterns for the antenna could be compared to the simulated results. The same tests were performed with the antenna attached to a saline solution bag, simulating the effects of the human body on the antenna performance. The radiation patterns obtained from the measured results proved to be similar to the simulated results for both frequencies tested. When making use of the human analogue, the radiation pattern tended to be more omnidirectional in both the azimuthand elevation planes. These results are ideal, since omnidirectional communication by the tethering device is required by a security application. The primary objective was achieved, together with the secondary objectives of comparing different frequencies. Master...|$|R
40|$|This chapter, {{prepared}} for Presidential Power Stories (edited by Christopher Schroeder and Curtis Bradley), {{tells the story}} of United States v. United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, better known as the Keith case. Keith is the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s first and still most important statement {{on the extent to which}} the President, acting in the interests of national security, may authorize the warrantless wiretapping or other <b>electronic</b> surveillance of <b>persons</b> within the United States. The case began as a criminal prosecution of members of the radical 2 ̆ 2 White Panther Party 2 ̆ 2 for the bombing of a CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It took a turn when the government disclosed before trial that one of the defendants had been overheard on a warrantless federal wiretap of domestic organizations that the Attorney General deemed threats to national security. This put the legality of the wiretap in issue. In what the New York Times called 2 ̆ 2 a stunning legal setback 2 ̆ 2 for the government, the Court concluded that 2 ̆ 2 Fourth Amendment freedoms cannot properly be guaranteed if domestic security surveillance may be conducted solely within the discretion of the Executive Branch. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the Court held, a judicial warrant must issue before the government may engage in wiretapping or other electronic surveillance of domestic threats to national security.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{snapshot}} of the current state of media literacy programs. IntroductionIn 2009 and 2010, people coming and going in a collection of public places in Ukraine saw an unusual set of <b>electronic</b> billboards. “The <b>person</b> who uncovers that which was hidden–that’s a real journalist,” read one, against an image of a curtain being pulled back to reveal the word “truth. ” Another, showing different colored pens writing different letters and numbers, declared that “True news means various views on a single event. ”Part of a program sponsored by Internews, the billboards were a rare attempt to teach concepts of media literacy directly to a population at large, that is, anyone who happened to be passing by. The target was the practice of what Ukrainians call jeansa, or hidden advertising, in which a company or politician pays money to a media outlet to get a puff piece, presented as real journalism. But after 2010, Internews decided to discontinue the campaign. It cited the relatively high cost, but also concerns the strategy wasn’t sufficiently effective. In surveys and focus groups, significant numbers of people showed they “were able to distinguish paid journalism and/or hidden advertisements intuitively,” said Josh Machleder, Internews’ vice president for Europe and Eurasia. Internews decided to focus on public discussions to provide a platform for opinion makers and pilot programs for media literacy education in schools and universities. Generally speaking, Machleder wrote, Internews found that “raising the general level of media literacy in the population is a complicated endeavor, and that running a PSA campaign was not enough to tackle it. It did shine light on the problem … and sowed the seeds for a larger public discussion on the quality of journalism in Ukraine. ”In countries all over the world, whether democratic or one-party states, governments are promoting media literacy as a vital skill set. Media development organizations uniformly say that it is a vital part of their work. Both programming and spending patterns among funders suggest that media literacy programs are a still small but growing focus of overall media development work. The Center for International Media Assistance published a trio of reports in 2009 that looked at the then emerging topic of media literacy. After hearing much discussion about media literacy among media development implementers since then, CIMA decided to take a second look at the topic. Do media literacy programs offer a promising new approach to media development, or is it yet another example of further fragmentation of overall media development efforts? What have we learned in recent years about how to best approach such programs? Has the expansion of social media and mobile devices {{had an impact on the}} way media development organizations approach media literacy?This report aims to take another snapshot of the current state of media literacy programs and revisit some of the questions that this new area of media development is raising. Looking forward, the subject deserves much deeper research and examination. We need more data to understand how a country’s population gets access to information, understands it, and acts on it. We need more detailed spending figures to see how various donors are approaching this work and funding it. We also need more evaluations to see if this work has meaningful impact. So while “Media Literacy 2. 0 ” is still far from the final word on the topic, it does begin to surface some revealing examples of emerging approaches...|$|R
40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) {{technology}} are entering nursing education {{at a rapid}} speed (Foronda et al., 2017). VR {{has been reported in}} the nursing literature to significantly improve students’ performance (Jenson & Forsyth, 2012; Park, 2016; Foronda et al., 2017) even though the body of evidence {{in terms of the number}} and research quality of peer reviewed research papers is not yet substantial enough to identify VR technology’s effectiveness. However, VR is not actually reality. VR may not actually reflect reality. Young people (and even adults) may not perceive the different between reality and VR. They may not yet be mature enough to distinguish the difference. However, VR {{technology are}} going much further than traditional educational methods by allowing humans to experience a much higher level of immersion through a virtual image. Even the gap between advances in VR technology and its application to education science is widening, causing serious concern. The advance in VR technology is value-neutral. As with all things, whether something is good or bad depends on how humans use it. VR can be useful, for example, when it enables scholars to attend an international conference without traveling to the physical convention center. VR provides the ability to speak, listen, and discuss in real time. Those using VR can choose to view a featured or real-time image of the other participants as if they were actually at the conference. Further, remote participants can feel touch through electronic sensors attached to their body. How amazing! The problem with VR lies in the fact that we are not ready to cope with any possible harmful influences caused by advances in VR technology. But what is the “Dark Shadow of VR,” and why does it cause concern, particularly in pedagogy? Luc Besson’s 2017 film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Plants showed an exceptional VR world, “Big Market,” a shopping-focused VR platform. But such a world is no longer strictly science fiction: many large commercial companies are really building gigantic VR platforms (Kim, 2017). VR developers boast that the platforms can be categorized based on the purpose of the VR platform, e. g., Media, Communication, Travel, Education, Games, Medicine, the Military, and even Adult Movies (Kim, 2017). Also, the platform itself may be another “false” real world built up in the VR platform that mirrors our current real life (Kim, 2017). Imagine: a person could have a dual identity for (1) real life and (2) VR life (Kim, 2017). It sounds fantastic, does it not? Unfortunately, it may not be true. Suppose that a person selects the “Adult Movies” VR platform. Using Head Mounted Displays (HMD) device and <b>electronic</b> sensors, a <b>person</b> would not only experience a vivid and lively video, but also feel a “real-life” touch. Such an option is very dangerous to adolescents because they are particularly vulnerable to sexually explicit content (Adeolu, Owoaje, & Olumide, 2016). While we cannot begin to fathom the implications, it is possible that this technology could lead to higher rates of teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in reality (Kann et al., 2016). Young people might also lose touch with reality, mistaking the virtual world as being more “real” than reality itself. For example, a young couple with a baby were playing a video game in which they were trying to save a baby from harm while neglecting their own baby to the point that the baby died (Kang, 2016). Further, what if the real economy began to operate just like the “Big Market”? In fact, VR developers are already creating such a VR platform (Kim, 2017). Since real estate is unlimited in the VR world, so is the amount of investment. This strongly suggests that VR as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) can ensure that the winner (primarily developers such as Data Scientists and AI algorithm makers) takes all. Is such a situation fair and just? Here is another example: What if a person’s account were unintentionally deleted in the VR platform or removed by someone? If the account is not renewable, another socio-economic problem might arise. We should be mindful of the possible harmful consequences, the “Dark Shadow of VR,” while adopting and applying advances in VR technology to all areas of pedagogy. No matter how effective educational outcomes the integration of VR technology into pedagogy produces, nothing is more important than delivering the highest quality of education – i. e., “Putting People First” – to our next generation...|$|R
