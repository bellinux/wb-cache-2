5|$|Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} embedded into English political life during Henry III's minority. As the King grew older, his government {{slowly began to}} recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters. Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the charters became clear in the royal court, when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued—if sometimes incorrectly—that the charters protected the new arrangements. This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and William Brewer over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters, given that he had been forced to agree to them. On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters, enabling a royal inquiry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in the counties to progress.|$|E
5|$|Standish {{called all}} of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The {{following}} day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings. In some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, {{were in the same}} room as Standish and several of his men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged to be alone with Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut off, to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.|$|E

It closely followed the evolution of the KAPD in Germany and oriented itself more towards the Theses of the Berlin KAPD, in opposition to the group around Gorter. Over four years, the GIC studied and discussed the study which Appel had made in prison, and the book Foundations of Communist Production and Distribution was published in 1930 by the Berlin AAU, a book which has been discussed and criticised by revolutionaries throughout the world to this very day.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Tavis Morello , an Eagle Scout, {{and staff}} member working at Yawgoog Scout Reservation {{was fired for}} admitting he was gay to Scouting Official Gary Savignano, who then {{proceeded}} to confiscated Morello's Eagle Scout card.

Following this, GLAD and the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown is quoted as saying, “Based on the information I’ve heard, this person was terminated because he acknowledged he was gay. And that’s illegal.” Due to mounting legal pressures and increasing amounts of negative publicity, by the end of the camping season, the Narragansett Council had reversed its decision and offered to reinstate Morello, both as an employee and as an Eagle Scout.|$|E

However, Nghệ Tông was proved to be an inefficient ruler during his reign as emperor and afterward as retired emperor from 1372 to his death at 1394. As the Retired Emperor who oversaw the ruling of his three consecutive successors, Duệ Tông, Phế Đế and Thuận Tông, Nghệ Tông was responsible for the rising in royal court of Đỗ Tử Bình who brought Emperor Duệ Tông to his death and Hồ Quý Ly who ultimately overthrew the Trần Dynasty to found his own dynasty. Nghệ Tông also witnessed many defeats of Đại Việt in the struggle with Champa including Đồ Bàn Battle when Emperor Duệ Tông was killed in action or several attacks by king of Champa Chế Bồng Nga in Thăng Long, capital of Đại Việt.

500|$|The cleared, {{underlying}} rock {{foundation of}} the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a grout curtain. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as [...] into the rock, and any cavities encountered were {{to be filled with}} grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit [...] "uplift"—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due {{to the beginning of the}} concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled. After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology.
