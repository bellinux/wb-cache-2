5|$|Since Sri Lanka gained {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, {{relations between the}} majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with ethnic riots in 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983, {{led to the formation}} and strengthening of militant groups advocating independence for Tamils. The ensuing civil war resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000people and the <b>forced</b> <b>disappearance</b> of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing allegations of atrocities being committed by the Sri Lankan Military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during its final months. A United Nations panel found that as many as 40,000 civilians may {{have been killed in the}} final months of the civil war. The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and judiciary coming under political control.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lanka {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil {{community has been}} strained. Sri Lanka {{has been unable to}} contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war. The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past. The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the <b>forced</b> <b>disappearance</b> of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.|$|E

40|$|Does violent {{repression}} {{strengthen the}} state? In this {{paper we explore}} the legacies of repression by the Mexican government on subsequent state consolidation. We investigate how a particular form of state repression, <b>forced</b> <b>disappearances</b> of alleged leftist dissidents, during the 1960 s and 1970 s in Mexico had path-dependent consequences for different dimensions of state capacity nearly fifty years later. To do so, we rely on data gathered from suppressed Mexican human rights reports of <b>forced</b> <b>disappearances</b> which, to our knowledge, have not been analyzed by social scientists before. Controlling for a rich set of pre-disappearances covariates, we find that <b>forced</b> <b>disappearances</b> are positively correlated with contemporary measures of fiscal and bureaucratic capacity. However, historical <b>forced</b> <b>disappearances</b> do not help the state to provide security, to consolidate its monopoly {{over the use of}} force, or to provide welfare-related public goods in the long run. Moreover, disappearances are negatively correlated with various measures of trust in the government...|$|R

According to the ombudsman of the Chechen Republic, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, the most complex and painful problem as of March 2007 was to trace over 2,700 abducted and forcefully held citizens; analysis of the complaints of citizens of Chechnya shows that social problems were ever more frequently coming to the foreground; two years earlier, he said, complaints mostly concerned violations {{of the right to}} life.|$|E

25|$|October 2015, Euro Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor {{has issued}} a press release calling Bahrain’s {{authorities}} to allow {{freedom of speech and}} to free the dissidents.

The monitor accused Bahrain authorities of continuing the arbitrarily punishment without due process. The monitor has documented 21 cases in which peaceful demonstrations were violently broken up by shooting live ammunition and tear gas canisters. In addition, the monitor said that 86 protesters have been detained, of whom 17 are minors, the detainees have tortured and denied a fair trial. The Euro-Med Monitor called Bahraini authorities to take more serious and committed actions to protect human rights on their territory, starting with the immediate release of the detainees, easing of restrictions on peaceful protests and permission for specialists in torture and <b>forced</b> <b>disappearance</b> to investigate conditions in Bahraini prisons.|$|E

25|$|Among Escobar's biographers, only Vallejo {{has given}} a {{detailed}} explanation of {{his role in the}} 1985 Palace of Justice siege. The journalist stated that Escobar financed the operation, which was committed by M-19. She would go on to blame the army for the killings of the Supreme Court judges and the M-19 members detained after the coup. These statements prompted a reopening of the case in 2008, and when Vallejo was asked to testify in the reopened Palace case, most of the events she had described in her book and testimonial were confirmed by Colombia's Commission of Truth. These events led to further investigation into the siege, which led to a high-ranking former colonel and a former general being sentenced to 30 and 35 years in prison, respectively, for the <b>forced</b> <b>disappearance</b> of the detained after the siege. Vallejo would subsequently testify in the case of Luis Carlos Galán's assassination, which had also been reopened. She would accuse several politicians, including Colombian presidents Alfonso López Michelsen, Ernesto Samper and Álvaro Uribe of having links to drug cartels. Her cooperation in the cases saw Vallejo being granted political asylum in the United States on 3 June 2010.|$|E

The summer months of 1944 were marked by an increase of resistance activities.

On 19 June, Bezen Perrot participated in the arrest and <b>forced</b> <b>disappearance</b> of 3 resistance fighters. On 3 July, it executed 31 people in the village of Locminé, 5 were deported to Germany and 4 more to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp where they were exterminated.

Several days later, 6 female resistance fighters were shot in the chapel of Quistinic.|$|E
500|$|Notable {{historical}} {{examples of}} conscientious noncompliance {{in a different}} professional context included the manipulation of the visa process in 1939 by Japanese Consul-General Chiune Sugihara in Kaunas (the temporary capital of Lithuania between Germany and the Soviet Union) and by Raoul Wallenberg in Hungary 1n 1944 to allow Jews to escape almost certain death. Ho Feng-Shan the Chinese Consul-General in Vienna in 1939, defied orders from the Chinese ambassador in Berlin to issue Jews with visas for Shanghai. John Rabe a German member of the Nazi Party likewise saved thousands of Chinese from massacre by the Japanese military at Nanking. The White Rose German student movement against the Nazis declared in their 4th leaflet: [...] "We will not be silent. We are your bad conscience. The White Rose will not leave you in peace!" [...] Conscientious noncompliance {{may be the only}} practical option for citizens wishing to affirm the existence of an international moral order or 'core' historical rights (such as the right to life, right to a fair trial and freedom of opinion) in states where non-violent protest or civil disobedience are met with prolonged arbitrary detention, torture, <b>forced</b> <b>disappearance,</b> murder or persecution.|$|E
