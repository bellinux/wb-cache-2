5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> in the rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, Congress {{passed the}} first peace-time draft legislation. It was renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It {{involved}} {{questions as to}} who should control the draft, {{the size of the}} army, and the need for deferments. The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> them. There was very little draft resistance.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Charles XII's death, the anti-Swedish allies became {{increasingly}} divided on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the power gap {{left behind by the}} defeated and retreating Swedish armies. George I and Frederik IV both coveted hegemony in northern Germany, while August the Strong was concerned about Frederick William I's ambitions on the southeastern Baltic coast. Peter the Great, whose forces were spread all around the Baltic Sea, envisioned hegemony in East Central Europe and sought to establish naval bases as far west as Mecklenburg. In January 1719, George I, August II and emperor Charles VI concluded a treaty in Vienna aimed at the reduction of Russia's frontiers to the pre-war limits.|$|E

500|$|As a {{link between}} {{the end of the second}} verse, where Lennon sings [...] "I'd love to turn you on", and the start of McCartney's middle-eight, the band {{included}} a 24-bar bridge. At first, the Beatles were not sure <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> this link section. At the conclusion of the session on 19 January, the transition consisted of a simple repeated piano chord and the voice of assistant Mal Evans counting out the bars. Evans' voice was treated with gradually increasing amounts of echo. The 24-bar bridge ended with the sound of an alarm clock triggered by Evans. Although the original intent was to edit out the ringing alarm clock when the section was filled in, it complemented McCartney's piece – which begins with the line [...] "Woke up, fell out of bed" [...] – so the decision was made to keep the sound.|$|E
500|$|Among {{more recent}} commentators, Alan Pollack admires [...] "Hey Jude" [...] as [...] "such a good {{illustration}} of two compositional lessons – <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> a large canvas with simple means, {{and how to}} use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast." [...] Pollack considers that the song's long coda provides [...] "an astonishingly transcendental effect", while AllMusic's Richie Unterberger similarly opines: [...] "What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in rock …" [...] In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald wrote that the [...] "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out may be a blemish" [...] but he praised the song as [...] "a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms". MacDonald concluded: [...] "'Hey Jude' strikes a universal note, touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired." [...] Lennon said the song was [...] "one of [...] masterpieces".|$|E
500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E

500|$|Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also rated {{it three}} out of four stars, stated [...] "Strike Back isn't {{brilliant}} television, but it's plenty entertaining, and by fitting the action of 24 with the grit of The Unit (and the nudity of Cinemax), it fills a [...]22 caliber hole in American television." [...] However Riccio added that the downside to the series was that [...] "not enough time is given over to the fractious [...] "buddy-cop" [...] relationship between the two main characters, Scott and Stonebridge, whereas quite a bit of time is spent with the villains." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "surprisingly stylish and addictive," [...] adding [...] "Fans of [...] "24," [...] which bowed last year, still ask me <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> that void. They want just enough intelligence-agency hooey to make the unbelievable seem somewhat real. Until [...] "Strike Back," [...] I didn't have a good answer." [...] Stuever lauded Scott and Stapleton's portrayal, stating he is [...] "the real find here, a thoroughly unlikable loser" [...] who [...] "saves the show from a dour sense of duty," [...] adding that Staplton [...] "seems to have been created in a laboratory experiment that grafted Ewan McGregor's personality and smile onto Hugh Jackman's body — with more than adequate results." ...|$|E
500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The first thing I want you to do is not to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times was {{critical}} of the episode, discussing the show's [...] "increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country." [...] He commented that while [...] "Acafellas" [...] did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than [...] "Showmance", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the [...] "most fun of all" [...] in the episode, but overall noted that: [...] "The humor can’t {{make up for the}} lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show {{is always going to be}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are already getting old, so it would behoove the producers to keep those gaps as short as possible." [...] Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee [...] "overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot." [...] Ray wrote, Glee [...] "upbeat message" [...] was [...] "overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of-the mill high school drama." [...] As with Hale, Ray commented that: [...] "Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri [...] "beyond annoying", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Of Will, Malcom posed the question: [...] "didn’t it feel as though his commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] How could he turn his back so easily?" [...] More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene [...] "lovely". She wrote that Groban's appearance was [...] "laugh out loud" [...] funny, while Stack commented: [...] "It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spitzer's reform-based platform, and {{his pledge}} [...] "to change {{the ethics of}} Albany", hit an early {{roadblock}} when his ideas on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> vacancies in the executive department were defeated by the state legislature. According to the New York State Constitution, {{it is the duty}} of the state legislature to fill executive vacancies. The governor was criticized as unreasonable for admonishing the legislature when it took constitutional actions. The appointment of state assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli to succeed the disgraced Alan Hevesi as New York State Comptroller was a serious blow to the new governor. Spitzer had backed an outside panel to draft a list of qualified candidates; the legislature resisted Spitzer's desires when these included no legislators. Some Assembly Democrats were alienated over the incident, and questioned Spitzer's refusal of extending patronage to party members seeking local political appointments.|$|E

2500|$|The {{salaries}} and pensions scandal in Bell also brought {{into question the}} issue of voter fraud. In the 2005 election, fewer than 400 votes were cast in a special election that {{cleared the way for}} City Council members to dramatically boost their own salaries. In that election, more than half the votes cast were absentee ballots, the most vulnerable method to manipulate fraudulent votes. One resident of Bell, on condition of anonymity, told the Los Angeles Times that he was assigned the chore of retrieving absentee ballots: [...] "Our objective was to collect absentee ballots, and if they were not filled out, instruct them <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> it out, and if not, fill it out for them", he said. It is estimated that less than 1% of registered voters actually showed up to cast their ballot. It has been reported that some residents went to the polling place, only to find that their votes had already been cast.|$|E
2500|$|Fee-based consultants, some {{available}} entirely online, can {{be hired}} {{to help a}} student gain admission to the so-called right schools, {{although there are some}} free programs to help underprivileged youth learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> out applications, write essays, get ready for tests, and work on interviews. Consultants can help a student select schools to apply to, counsel them on test taking strategies, review scores, help with essay preparation (but not writing), review applications, conduct mock interviews, provide logistical planning, and collaborate with others such as athletic coaches. Consultants try to keep a low profile; however, one admissions dean explained that she can [...] "sniff out when there has been some adult involved in the process". Assistance by consultants or other adults can go to extremes, particularly with hard-to-check variables such as the college essays; according to one view, plagiarism on admissions essays has been a [...] "serious problem", particularly on applications to private universities and colleges. There is the possibility that hiring a professional admissions consultant can make an application appear artificial; for example, admissions personnel may suspect adult coaching when one part of an application is polished, while other parts aren't, such as varying quality regarding writing samples. Another risk in hiring a consultant, which can happen if parents become too involved in the process, is what Mamlet and VanDeVelde term overpackaging: the applicant appears so smooth and perfect that admissions officers suspect the person is not real but a marketing creation. Generally, when hiring a college admissions counselor, parents and students try to understand the counselor's philosophy, learn what services are provided, and whether any help will be offered regarding advice about financial aid or scholarships. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that it is improper for an admissions counselor to tamper with a student's [...] "authentic self". According to their view, ideal counselors have experience with college admissions, meet regularly with college admissions officers, visit campuses regularly, and belong to professional affiliations.|$|E

An example of business document application is described in PT Indrajaya Bandung, a company which produces many kinds of spring beds. The company has certain suppliers to fulfill their raw materials, and certain retailers to distribute their product to the end user. Both of them have a credit transaction with PT Indrajaya. By comparing between the theory of creating and using business document forms with the application of business documents, as stated in the example of PT lndrajaya, we can analyze and conclude the effectiveness and the efficiency of forms that they use for their business transactions...|$|R
