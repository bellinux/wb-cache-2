2500|$|By {{the time}} North Louisiana Telephone Company had been sold, Couch was already {{exploring}} {{the possibilities of}} developing a similar interconnected electric utility system. [...] Both Malvern and Arkadelphia had awarded franchises for citywide electric utilities, and in both cities, the utility companies were in decline, and only provided night-time service. [...] Couch proposed a partnership with Arkansas Land & Lumber Company, a large sawmill operation in Malvern, whereby sawdust and waste material purchased from the sawmill {{would be used to}} fuel boilers, producing steam for two 550-kilowatt turbines to generate electric power. [...] The new system, a predecessor of Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP), became operational on 18 December 1914, providing Malvern and Arkadelphia with 24-hour electric service for the first time. [...] In 1916, AP's second generating plant opened in Russellville, seat of Pope County in north-central Arkansas. The plant was adjacent to a coal field which provided a steady supply of fuel. Under leadership of Couch, AP continued purchasing city utility systems and building <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> throughout Arkansas.|$|E

International audienceToday's {{advanced}} reflectometry methods {{provide an}} efficient {{solution for the}} diagnosis of <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> hard faults (open and short circuits), but they are much less efficient for soft faults, in particular, for faults resulting in spatially smooth variations of characteristic impedance. This paper attempts to fill an important gap {{for the application of}} the inverse scattering transform to reflectometry-based soft fault diagnosis: it clarifies the relationship between the reflection coefficient measured with reflectometry instruments and the mathematical object of the same name defined in the inverse scattering theory, by reconciling finite length <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> with the inverse scattering transform defined on the infinite interval. The feasibility of this approach is then demonstrated by numerical simulation of lossless <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> affected by soft faults, and by the solution of the inverse scattering problem effectively retrieving smoothly varying characteristic impedance profiles from reflection coefficients...|$|R
