50|$|The Newport Back Bay Science Center {{is located}} in Newport Beach, California on Shellmaker Island. This center’s main focus is to supply {{information}} on <b>estuarine</b> and marine <b>biology</b> through activities and lectures in a year-round program. This science center {{is connected to the}} watershed, which is home to around 175 thousand people in urban cities. The Newport Back Bay Science Center’s goal is to educate the citizens on how they can aid in keeping the Back Bay area clean, and how they affect the watershed. They strive to educate this generation and generations to come so as to keep the movement for a clean environment on an incline.|$|R
40|$|Where the Avon and Heathcote rivers meet before {{discharging}} {{into the}} sea, {{an area of}} mudflats has been formed, commonly termed the Avon – Heathcote or Christchurch estuary. It is roughly a triangular shaped region, approximately three square miles in area. Of this area about ¾ consists of exposed mudflats at low tide. Previous studies on the estuary biota have been those of Thompson (1929), Bruce (1953), Williams (1959). Rosenberg (1962), and Estcourt (1962). The last author has an excellent review of previous work. The aims of the investigation were as follows: (1) To provide a general survey of the fish population of the Christchurch estuary, {{as a basis for}} future comparison with other New Zealand estuaries. (2) To investigate the feeding, sexual maturity and size relationships of the estuarine fish populations, and relate these to the respective habitats occupied. (3) To note the occurrence, and where possible, the incidence of the fish parasites. (4) To provide data and material for future research work on <b>estuarine</b> fish <b>biology.</b> (5) To provide, where possible, a brief and simple account of relative growth rates. The present investigation was started on 23 rd April. 1965, and owing to unforeseen circumstances, had to be terminated on the 8 th December, 1965. However, various additional samples were taken at certain periods after this date (see appendix 1) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{commissioned}} {{and funded by}} the Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station (COMES) to 1) identify the scientific and management issues constraining the advancement of the Oregon bay clam commercial industry, 2) explore scientific, management, and economic opportunities for the enhancement of the fishery, 3) outline and suggest mechanisms to develop stock and biological information, obtain funding, and manage the fishery at sustainable levels, and 4) provide a comprehensive framework {{for the development of}} a bay clam fishery management plan. Additionally, this report succeeds a recent draft of the new Oregon Nearshore Strategy (by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (ODFW) Marine Resources Program (2005)) that recommends ODFW provide greater attention to developing and achieving stock assessments for shellfish as well as develop more capable fisheries management methods – two important aspects of this bay clam fishery study. This report provides a synthesis of political, social, and scientific information regarding the current status and future potential of the Oregon bay clam commercial fishery and addresses the following topics: regulation and management, allocation, ecology and <b>biology,</b> <b>estuarine</b> water quality, stock assessments, economics, funding, applied Geographic Information Science (GIS), examples of relevant management from other states and countries, and related issues including markets, aquaculture, non-indigenous species, and regulatory enforcement. The presentation of these issues provides a framework for developing and implementing a bay clam fishery management plan. Cost-effective and cooperative management act as guiding concepts in developing the report’s structure, analysis, and recommendations...|$|R
