5|$|Works at Morgantown were {{undertaken}} by DuPont under a cost-plus <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> contract, {{as was the}} works at Wabash and Alabama. Construction commenced on 7 January 1943, and was substantially completed ahead of the 1 September scheduled date. The facilities were progressively brought into operation between 29 May and 28 August 1943. The cost was $3,490,069. DuPont's <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> was originally $154,882, but this was voluntarily reduced to $88,588 because the cost of construction was considerably less than the $6,034,000 originally estimated.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} The Beginning or the End {{originated}} in October 1945 with actress Donna Reed, and {{her high school}} science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to The Hollywood Reporter issues of December 1945 and January 1946, MGM, Paramount and 20th Century-Fox were all interested in making a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's Hal B. Wallis was already working on his own version, titled Top Secret, but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering {{to serve as an}} adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> and a percentage of the box office gross.|$|E
5|$|Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it {{was decided}} to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be {{obtained}} from the Clinch River and steam from the K-25 power house. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the steam plant, with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per {{racetrack}} for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack. Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit was a young woman, a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it {{was conducted on the}} XA calutron and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack, and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 25,000 in mid-1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by David Fincher and was written by Beau Willimon, who has served as an aide to Charles Schumer, Howard Dean and Hillary Clinton. Independent studio Media Rights Capital purchased the rights to House of Cards, with the intent on creating a series. Netflix agreed to contribute an undisclosed <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> to production costs in March 2011. As he was completing his work on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher {{was introduced to the}} original miniseries by his agent and sought to develop a series with Eric Roth. House of Cards was pitched to several cable networks, including HBO, AMC and Showtime. Netflix, interested in launching their own original programming, outbid the networks, picking the series up for 26 episodes, totaling two seasons. Netflix was the only bidder that was interested in purchasing the rights without seeing a completed pilot. Thus, the show was not forced into manipulating story arcs introduced in the pilot to create artificial cliffhangers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about {{how many people were}} in or would be in the town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee.</b> The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E

5|$|This {{model was}} {{inspired}} by Sweden, where a separate dining company had been established; this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> per restaurant carriage. The Swedish model involved including the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots. On 21 December 1918, A.S Norsk Spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of 200,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). It had 20 shares; 17 were owned by the Trunk Railway, and one by each of three directors: Waldemar Stoud Platou, Gotfred Furuholmen and Christian Emil Stoud Platou—the former representing the Trunk Railway and the latter being director-general of the NSB. In January 1919, Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director. The company took over Christiansen's four restaurant carriages and the restaurant at Oslo Ø on 1 April 1919.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} was the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee</b> which, {{strictly}} interpreted by Attorney-General’s Department ultimately led to a serious decline in standards from which the program has never fully recovered. Once the pioneer celebrants became diluted with new appointments idealism was only sustained by the minority. Attitudes developed with many celebrants {{which turned out to}} be very destructive. Realising they received the same remuneration if they spent time and care in the preparation of a marriage, or if they did not, many provided the absolute minimum for the marrying couple. To make matters worse, the <b>fixed</b> <b>fee,</b> in a period of high inflation, declined in value, which further exacerbated the problem.|$|E
40|$|How {{should the}} payment be {{structured}} when external firms acquire or license patents from individual inventors or small firms? Variable fees, such as equity sharing or royalties, provide incentives for inventor effort during the commercialization. <b>Fixed</b> <b>fees</b> provide incentives {{to the external}} firm to make investments in the commercialization process. Excluding either variable or <b>fixed</b> <b>fees</b> from the contract leads to a moral hazard problem. By including both variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>fees,</b> the incentives of the inventor and the firm become more aligned. The performance of licensed and acquired patents with different payment structures has, however, seldom been analyzed empirically. Based on a detailed database on Swedish patents, I use a survival model to estimate how the commercialization decision and the payment structure influence the patent renewal decision. I find that that commercialization substantially increases the probability of renewal, but only for patents which are (i) commercialized by the original owner or (ii) licensed/acquired using both variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>fees.</b> If the contract relies uniquely on either <b>fixed</b> or variable <b>fees,</b> the probability of renewal is as low as for patents that are not commercialized at all. The results are inconclusive, however, since the difference in renewal between acquired/licensed patents with different terms is not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|The optimal {{competition}} policy when licensing {{is an alternative}} to a merger to transfer a superior technology is derived in a differentiated goods duopoly, for the cases of Cournot and Bertrand competition.

By contrast, when only one instrument is feasible, be it <b>fixed</b> <b>fees</b> or royalties, the possibility of licensing cannot {{be used as a}} definitive argument against mergers. ...|$|R
40|$|Many tax systems require payment {{by means}} of <b>fixed</b> <b>fees,</b> {{percentages}} of gross revenues (royalties or ad valorem taxes), or percentages of net income (profit shares or income taxes).

For equal expected levies, profit-sharing is often ranked as {{the most effective means}} of risk-spreading, followed by royalty payments, and finally by <b>fixed</b> <b>fees.</b> When revenues and costs are both uncertain, however, we demonstrate that this common risk-ranking is not generally valid and discuss reasons for its breakdown. ...|$|R
