40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} the methane (CH 4) emission and its controlling factors in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region and to explore its implication for large dams. We measured CH 4 emissions from four vegetation stands in newly created marshes in the drawdown area of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China, {{in the summer of}} 2008. The results showed highly spatial variations of methane emissions among the four stands, with the smallest emission (0. 25 +/- 0. 65 mg CH 4 m(- 2) h(- 1)) in the Juncus amuricus stand, and the greatest (14. 9 +/- 10. 9 mg CH 4 m(- 2) h(- 1)) in the Scirpus triqueter stand. We found that the spatial variations of CH 4 emissions are caused by difference in standing water depth and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Results also showed a special seasonal variation of CH 4 emissions in this area, i. e., maximal emissions in early July followed by a low and steady value before the winter flooding. The seasonality of CH 4 emissions was found closely related to temperature and standing water depth. Because of the large area of the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zones</b> for global dam reservoirs and a large CH 4 emission rate, such newly created marshes should not be neglected when estimating CH 4 emissions from reservoirs.

40|$|Large {{reservoirs}} are {{an increasingly}} common feature across tropical landscapes {{because of their}} importance for water supply, flood control and hydropower, but their ecological conditions are infrequently evaluated. Our objective {{was to assess the}} range of disturbances for two large tropical reservoirs and their influences on benthic macroinvertebrates. We tested three hypotheses: i) a wide variation in the level of environmental disturbance can be observed among sites in the reservoirs; ii) the two reservoirs would exhibit a different degree of disturbance level; and iii) the magnitude of disturbance would influence the structure and composition of benthic assemblages. For each reservoir, we assessed land use (macroscale), physical habitat structure (mesoscale), and water quality (microscale). We sampled 40 sites in the littoral zones of both Três Marias and São Simão Reservoirs (Minas Gerais, Brazil). At the macroscale, we measured cover percentages of land use categories in buffer areas at each site, where each buffer was a circular arc of 250 m. At the mesoscale, we assessed the presence of human disturbances in the riparian and <b>drawdown</b> <b>zones</b> at the local (site) scale. At the microscale, we assessed water quality at each macroinvertebrate sampling station using the Micro Disturbance Index (MDI). To evaluate anthropogenic disturbance of each site, we calculated an integrated disturbance index (IDI) from a buffer disturbance index (BDI) and a local disturbance index (LDI). For each site, we calculated richness and abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae genera richness, abundance and percent Chironomidae individuals, abundance and percent EPT individuals, richness and percent EPT taxa, abundance and percent resistant individuals, and abundance and percent non-native individuals. We also evaluated the influence of disturbance on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at the entire-reservoir scale. The BDI, LDI and IDI had significantly greater average scores at São Simão than at Três Marias Reservoir. The significantly greater differences in IDI scores for São Simão Reservoir were reflected in 10 of the 13 Ekman-Birge dredge biotic metrics and in 5 of 13 of the kick-net biotic metrics. We also observed clear ranges of disturbances within both reservoirs at macro (BDI) and mesoscales (LDI) and in water quality, but an insignificant range in MDI results. However, we found no significant relationship between the benthic macroinvertebrate metrics and the BDI, LDI, and IDI among sites within a single reservoir. Hence, we believe that benthic macroinvertebrate distributions in those reservoirs were influenced by other factors or that reservoir macroinvertebrates (dominated by chironomids) were poor indicators of disturbance at the site scale. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In 2008 Hanfeng Lake {{was created}} in Kai County, Chongqing, by the filling of the {{reservoir}} associated with the Three Gorges Dam. The lake is partially separated from the Pengxi River by a water-level regulatory dam, and is surrounded by urban development. The <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> of Hanfeng Lake requires special attention because of its urban location {{and the status of}} the lake as a nature reserve. Here we discuss some of the management issues for the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone,</b> with special consideration to eco-design principles and engineered wetlands. Given the unique nature of the lake, we argue that manage-ment of the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> requires an approach that is experimental and therefore adaptive. Given that the nature reserve objectives include a focus on bird abundance and diversity, we argue that the management approach must be ecosystem-based. Given the urban location, we argue that community-based processes must be used for the management approach to besocially acceptable. We consider that the effective ecosystem is the watershed of the lake and that both large-scale and local zoning are necessary management tools. Within the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> itself, we consider that eco-design principles can be ap-plied to achieve the provision of valuable ecosystem services including: bank stabilization, improved water quality, wetland productivity and biodiversity, natural science education, food production, and agricultural education. By taking these community-based and ecosystem-based approaches to raising awareness about the values provided by wetlands, natural ecosystem services will be delivered and these will promote the sustainable economic and social development of Kai County. ...|$|E
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of ecohydrological {{processes in the}} ecotone between surface water and groundwater - the hyporheic zone - is limited. Groundwater drawdown is a key stressor for many groundwater dependent ecosystems, as groundwater levels are declining globally. It is caused by different perturbations, including agriculture, mine dewatering and climate change. Therefore, there is a pressing need to examine how different ecohydrological systems work under different types of stress. This research aims to investigate the impacts of groundwater <b>drawdown</b> on hyporheic <b>zone</b> microbial activity. For two six week sampling campaigns (winter and summer) at Maules Creek, Namoi, New South Wales, Australia, microbial activity was measured using the cotton strip degradation method. Unprimed cotton canvas was affixed to rulers which were then placed for six weeks in different habitats (dry bar, hyporheic zone and surface waters) at three different water regimes found at different sections of the creek (perennial, ephemeral, and losing). The microbial activity {{was related to the}} loss of cotton strip tensile strength. The water regimes were used as proxies for different stages of groundwater drawdown. Key physico-chemical variables were also measured. The preliminary results show that there is a positive correlation between moisture status (i. e. the degree of habitat saturation over six weeks) and microbial activity. This suggests that groundwater drawdown and desaturation of streambed sediments may lead to a decrease in microbial activity and therefore, the recycling of organic carbon and nutrients. This research has local implications for environmental impact assessments and global implications for the assessment and management of ecological impacts of declining shallow groundwater levels...|$|R
40|$|For {{numerical}} {{modeling of}} {{ground water movement}} in a real aquifer system, the aquifer is usually divided into hydrogeologically defined zones, {{each with its own}} parameter values. The responses of the system, such as head or drawdown, are often available only in some of the zones. The estimated parameters of all the zones are based on the measured response in these limited zones. However, the estimates for some of the zones may be very uncertain, and these zones are therefore not justified by the data. In this paper, an approach is presented to understand which zone may produce uncertain parameter values and should be lumped with its neighbor. This approach is demonstrated using a regional numerical model for pumping test analysis in the Nottinghamshire aquifer, UK. A step-by-step process is used in identifying the aquifer zones and estimating their parameters based on the principle of using the smallest possible numbers of zones and parameters for adequate representation of the drawdown response. After the parameters of each zone are estimated, the sensitivity features of these parameters are examined. The results show that the parameters in one zone can be estimated properly by the <b>drawdown</b> in another <b>zone</b> only when there is significant sensitivity. For transmissivity, sensitivity between zones occurs when there is significant flow between them. For storativity, sufficient sensitivity can occur without large flows between the zones, provided that one <b>zone</b> causes significant <b>drawdown</b> in the other. This idea can be extended to the flow model for a large aquifer system. If the aquifer is divided {{in such a way that}} aquifer responses are not sensitive to the parameters in some of the zones, the parameters in those zones cannot be estimated properly and should be lumped into their neighboring zones. In this way, a simple but more reasonable model can be built. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The State of Idaho INEL Oversight Program, {{with the}} University of Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, and the Idaho Geologic Survey, used a straddle-packer system to {{investigate}} vertical variations in {{characteristics of the}} Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in southeast Idaho. Sixteen single-well aquifer tests were conducted on. isolated intervals in three observation wells. Each of these wells has approximately 200 feet of open borehole below the water table, penetrating the E through G and I basalt flow groups and interbedded sediments of the Snake River Plain aquifer. The success of the aquifer tests was limited by the inability to induce measurable <b>drawdown</b> in several <b>zones.</b> Time-drawdown data from aquifer tests were matched to type curves for 8 of the 16 zones tested. A single aquifer test at the water table exhibited greater curvature than those at depth. The increased degree of curvature suggests an unconfined response and resulted in an estimate of specific yield of 0. 03. Aquifer tests below the water table generally yielded time-drawdown graphs with a rapid initial response followed by constant drawdown throughout {{the duration of the}} tests; up to several hours in length. The rapid initial response implies that the aquifer responds as a confined system during brief pumping periods. The nearly constant drawdown suggests a secondary source of water, probably vertical flow from overlying and underlying aquifer layers. Three analytical models were applied for comparison to the conceptual model and to provide estimates of aquifer properties. This, Hantush-Jacob leaky aquifer, and the Moench double-porosity fractured rock models were fit to time-drawdown data.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Carbohydrate content and membrane stability, two key factors for survival of plants under flooding stress, of two ecotypes (designated "dwarf" and "green") of C. arundinacea growing at different elevations of the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> were investigated. Live stems (LS) and dead stems (DS) of the two plant ecotypes at eight elevations (175, 170, 162, 160, 158, 155, 152 m and 149 m) were sampled. Contents of soluble sugar, starch and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as plasma membrane permeability of live stems were measured. The lowest elevations for survival of dwarf and green C. arundinacea were 160 m and 158 m, respectively. Soluble sugar content of live stems of both ecotypes decreased with elevation, with amounts from an elevation of 170 m being lower than from an elevation of 175 m. MDA content and plasma membrane permeability in live stems of green C. arundinacea did not increase with the decrease in elevation, while these measures in dwarf C. arundinacea from an elevation of 162 m {{were significantly higher than}} from an elevation of 175 m. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate content, especially soluble sugar content, in both ecotypes was more sensitive to flooding stress than membrane stability. Green C. arundinacea had a higher tolerance to submergence than dwarf C. arundinacea, and thus green C. arundinacea can be planted at lower elevations than dwarf C. arundinacea...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Effects of partial drawdowns, drawdown timing, and tilling on vegetation and seed production for waterfowl were tested in ponds at the Lewisville Aquatic Ecosystem Research Facility in north-central Texas. Vegetation lists, percent cover (PC), and above-ground biomass (AGB) revealed partial drawdowns produced a typical zonation of wetland plants: submergent macrophytes in deep-flooded zones; cattail (7 ypha sp.), black willow (Salix nigra), and sedges in shallow-flooded zones; forbs in moist zones adjacent to water; and, grasses in upper, drier zones. Seed production of grasses, sedges, and forbs generally reflected vegetation present in each soil-moisture zone. Taxon richness of emergent plants was highest in dewatered <b>zones.</b> <b>Drawdown</b> timing did not affect taxon richness of emergent plants within dewatered zones, but forb and sedge PC and AGB, and grass AGB, were highest during 1993 spring drawdown. The majority of grasses and forbs had higher seed production during 1992 late-summer/early-fall drawdown, whereas sedges produced more seeds during spring drawdown. Black willow occurred most frequently and cattail was first recorded during spring drawdown. Most submergent macrophytes were unaffected by drawdown timing. Soil disturbance with rototilling created diversity in ponds by increasing taxon richness of emergent plants, encouraging annuals, and discouraging perennials. PC, AGB, and seed production of forbs and grasses generally increased and decreased, respectively, with tilling, whereas sedges were not affected. Cattail and black willow occurred most frequently in tilled areas. Most submergent macrophytes were not affected by tilling, except southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis), with higher PC in tilled plots. Waterfowl visiting ponds utilized regions according to water depth and plant communities. Gadwall (Anas strepera) and American wigeon (A. americans) were most often observed within deep zones supporting submergent vegetation. Although data were not statistically significant, blue-winged teal (A. discors) and green-winged teal (A. crecca) occurred most often in shallow zones supporting emergent vegetation and seeds.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} first {{demonstrates the}} effectiveness of hydraulic tomography (HT) in characterizing the heterogeneity of both the saturated and unsaturated zone parameters through a laboratory unconfined aquifer. Specifically, a geostatistical inversion algorithm that considers variably saturated flow processes (successive linear estimator (SLE) developed by Mao 2013 c)) in unconfined aquifers is utilized to obtain tomograms of hydraulic conductivity (K), specific storage (Ss), and the unsaturated zone parameters (pore size parameter (α) and saturated water content (θs)) for the Gardner-Russo's model. The estimated tomograms accurately capture the locations of heterogeneity including high and low K layers within the saturated and unsaturated zones compared to the true stratigraphy visible in the sandbox, as well as reasonable distribution patterns of α and θs for the Gardner-Russo's model. The estimated tomograms are then used to predict drawdown responses of pumping tests not used in the inverse modeling effort. The simulated and observed drawdown curves show an excellent agreement for observations in both the saturated and unsaturated <b>zones.</b> <b>Drawdown</b> predictions of the geostatistical inversion approach are significantly better than those based on the homogeneous assumption. Results of this study demonstrates the robust performance of HT that considers variably saturated flow processes in unconfined aquifers and the unsaturated zone above it, and substantiate the unbiased and minimal variance of HT analysis with the SLE algorithm. Then, this dissertation investigates the importance of geological data in HT through sandbox experiments. Four geological models with homogeneous units are constructed with borehole data of varying accuracy. These geological models are calibrated to multiple pumping test data of two different pumping and observation densities. Results show that both accurate and inaccurate geological models can be well calibrated and inaccurate geological models yield poor drawdown predictions for model validation. Moreover, model calibration and validation comparisons among layer-based geological models and a highly parameterized geostatistical model show that the performance gap between the approaches decreases {{as the number of}} pumping tests and monitoring locations are reduced. Next, four geological models are populated with permeameter test K values for each layer and used as prior mean information in geostatistical inverse models. Results show that the estimated K tomograms preserve geological features especially in areas where drawdown data are not available. Overall, this sandbox study emphasizes that accurate geological data is important for incorporating into HT surveys when data from pumping tests are sparse. Finally, this dissertation looks into the importance of geological data in HT through field experiments conducted at a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit at the North Campus Research Site (NCRS) of the University of Waterloo. Unlike the sandbox study in which the stratigraphy is perfectly known, geological data are obtained from 18 boreholes at NCRS. Two geological models of different resolutions are constructed. One model contains 19 layers while the other model merges some of the units resulting in five layers. Steady state pressure head data of 14 pumping tests are selected from the site for model calibration and validation purposes. The results are first compared with permeameter-estimated K profiles along boreholes. Results reveal that the simultaneous calibration of geological models to seven pumping test data yields K values that correctly reflect the general patterns of vertical distributions of permeameter-estimated K. In addition, this study finds that using a geological model as prior information in the geostatistical inversion approach leads to improved correspondence of K estimates to permeameter test results along wells, as well as in preserving geological features where drawdown measurements are lacking. Therefore, the field study suggests incorporating geological data for HT analysis based on geostatistical inverse modeling approaches when reliable geological data are available...|$|R

My study explored the ecology of an extreme northern population (Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada) of western painted turtles (WPT; Chrysemys picta bellii) inhabiting a reservoir that constantly fluctuates due to hydroelectric operations. The potential challenges this environment poses include inundation of nesting sites, increased winter mortality due to water level changes, {{and changes in the}} availability of aquatic habitat. I used radio telemetry and mark-recapture to identify where turtles were nesting and overwintering, and to assess demographics and turtle behaviour in relation to the changing water levels. My data suggest that adults and juveniles of both sexes used and overwintered in the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone.</b> Nest inundation as a result of reservoir operations {{did not appear to be}} a significant threat to the animals as all detected nests lay above the high-water mark. Similarly, no incidents of turtle mortality were directly attributable to reservoir operations. Changes in water levels did affect habitat availability: areas in which turtles were located during early spring were subsequently lost as water levels rose, while flooding in other areas created seasonal, suitable habitat for turtles that otherwise was not accessible. Modelling turtle response to water levels, water temperature, and season suggested that changes in water levels did not significantly impact behaviour as measured. Appropriate management for this species and other semi-aquatic species that reside within drawdown zones is complex, given the reliance on both terrestrial and aquatic habitat, the life cycles of the species, movement, changing water levels, and subzero winter temperatures.

Eight cylindrical boxes, each with two compartments (at 10 - and 30 -cm depth, respectively) containing 50 Atlantic salmon eggs, were placed in the river bed substrate of both the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> and the permanently wetted area as a reference. They were regularly checked for survival during winter from January to May, coinciding with egg development period for this river. Survival rates in boxes in the dewatered river bed were between 8 and 78 % during winter, compared to 80 to 99 % in the reference wetted area. The main driver for egg survival in the dewatered area was groundwater with sufficient oxygen levels...|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{mechanisms}} underlying migration remain poorly understood, {{but recent}} attention {{has focused on}} the role of the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone (CORT) as a key endocrine regulator of migration. The migration-modulation hypothesis (MMH) proposes that baseline plasma CORT levels are elevated in migratory birds to facilitate hyperphagia and lipogenesis and that further elevation of CORT in response to acute stress is suppressed. Consequently, CORT may be a poor indicator of individual condition or environmental variation in migratory birds. We tested the MMH by measuring baseline and stress-induced CORT in common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) during fall migration over 2 consecutive years in the Revelstoke Reach <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone,</b> a migratory stopover site affected by local hydroelectric operations. Birds had low baseline CORT at initial capture (/mL) and then showed a robust stress response, with CORT increasing to ca. 50 ng/mL within 10 - 20 min. Our data therefore do not support the MMH. Baseline CORT did not vary with body mass, time of capture, Julian day, or year, suggesting that variable flooding regimes did not affect baseline CORT. Individual variation in the rate of increase in CORT was correlated with Julian day, being higher later in the migration period. Our data suggest that plasma CORT can be a useful metric in migration studies...|$|E
30|$|The soil {{seed bank}} may {{contribute}} to plant community dynamics following disturbance (Plassmann et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2009). The seasonal flooding caused the degradation of soil seed bank and vegetation on the river bank in the TGRR. Most perennials and woody plants disappeared from seed bank and vegetation, and the soil seed bank was mainly composed of annuals and a few flooding-tolerant perennials. Lu et al. (2010 b) investigated the effects of initial impoundment on the riparian soil seed bank and suggested that low species compositional similarity to established vegetation and the dominance of annual plants limited {{the efficacy of the}} soil seed bank to restore pre-dam vegetation in the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> of the TGRR. Our study indicates that the differences in species composition and dominant species between the soil seed bank and surrounding vegetation decreased, implying the vegetation composition and structure gradually stabilized after a long period of water-level fluctuation. The composition of the soil seed bank and vegetation included annuals, perennials and shrubs and vines that differed from the pre-dam riparian soil seed bank and vegetation. The dominant species of the soil seed bank, including selected annuals and several submersion-tolerant perennials, such as C. dactylon and P. paspaloides, was related to the standing vegetation.|$|E

The results showed that carbon storage in the drawdown area was 514 862. 3 tC and the area is gradually playing a role as a regional carbon sink. Carbon storage changes along the elevation grade, with 160 ~ 170 m {{above mean sea level}} having the largest carbon storage at 229 367. 46 tC and other elevations following in the order: 160 ~ 170 m> 150 ~ 160 m> 170 ~ 175 m > 145 ~ 150 m. Carbon storage was zero in areas with greater land slopes (> 25 °) due to water erosion and exposed bedrock leading to sparse growth of vegetation. In different slope zones, carbon storage was in the sequence: 5 ° ~ 15 °> 0 ° ~ 5 °> 15 ° ~ 25 °. On the whole, due to the regulation and operation modes of TGR the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> had luxuriant vegetation in summer, which had uptake and accumulation of large carbon and had big carbon sequestration potential.

40|$|After our {{previous}} study about methane (CH 4) emissions from littoral marshes of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), Chinese dams have raised a world-wide concern. Through measurements {{from the surface}} of the TGR, a CH 4 emission rate was recorded as 0. 26 +/- 0. 38 mg CH 4 m(- 2) h(- 1) (Mean +/- SD), relatively low compared with those from other hydropower reservoirs. We also recorded CH 4 emission rate {{from the surface of}} downstream water, which was also relatively low (0. 24 +/- 0. 37 mg CH 4 m(- 2) h(- 1)). Such result may indicate that TGR is not a great CH 4 emitter (not "CH 4 menace"). One possible reason for such a low emission rate is that measures to maintain water quality and protect environment and ecosystem decrease the input of organic materials (for methanogenesis), which in turn limits the CH 4 production in the sediment of the TGR. We also found that CH 4 emission from the flooding drawdown area (0. 29 +/- 0. 37 mg CH 4 m(- 2) h(- 1)) was higher than other permanently flooded sites (0. 23 +/- 0. 38 mg CH 4 m(- 2) h(- 1)). Because of annual vegetation re-growth, the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> is the especially important carbon source for methanogenesis in flooding season. Interestingly, we also observed that mean CH 4 emission was significantly higher in winter than in spring and summer. This was partly due to seasonal dynamics of hydrology. In order to estimate the net CH 4 emissions caused by the reservoir and reservoir operation, the best approach would be Life Cycle Analysis.

40|$|AbstractThe dike-pond {{system was}} a form of {{ecological}} engineering that was a component of successional dikes and ponds {{along the banks of the}} Pengxi River in the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> (DDZ) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The application of science-based evaluation system was appropriate for the flows of emergy in this agricultural ecosystem. The Emergy Analysis (EmA) has the ability to transform different types of inputs to a common form to allow meaningful comparisons across different systems. This study made use of the emergy analysis that assessed two different types of farming methods in the DDZ of the TGR. One method was planning crops in a dike-pond system (model I), and the other method was conventional agriculture (model II). In addition, the Exergies of both yields of agriculture methods were calculated, and the Exergy and Emergy Density (ED) were combined to explore the quality of these methods. The results showed that the two models relied on different resources. The ED yield of both models were similar, but the emergy investment of model II was greater than that of model I. Model II also used less renewable energy input to the agricultural systems than model I. The agricultural emergy sustainability index (AESI) of model I system (AESI= 2. 4 > 1) was greater than that of model II system (AESI= 0. 5 < 1), which indicated that the sustainable development of model I was stronger than that of model II in the DDZ of the TGR. The ratio Exergy/Emergy density (Rex/em) in the two models of different agricultural system were 121. 52 × 10 − 3 J/sej (Model I) and 24. 19 × 10 − 3 J/sej (model II). Model I was greater than model II, and the result intimated that the model I agricultural system was a new method in the DDZ, but it was older and closer to the steady state than model II. The Emergy and Exergy analysis certifies that model I has a more acceptable and more sustainable development potential and is more stabilized in the DDZ of the TGR...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the limnology of two small dams (< 5 ha) built in series on Munwahuku river. Very {{little is known about}} the ecology of such small water bodies and the hydrological regime of these dams is that they undergo severe fluctuations in water levels. Rainfall is seasonal but water demand for irrigation and potable water persist throughout the year. The theoretical mean water residence time was 9 days for the Upper dam and 3. 6 days for the Lower one while the water level in the Upper dam fluctuated more than the Lower one. Thermal stratification established during summer in the dams but was weak during winter. Stratification was poorly established during the main rainy season (Jan-April) and this could be the result of throughflows causing disruptions. Oxygen stratification patterns were similar to those of temperature and deoxygenation sometimes occurred in summer. Seasonal trends were related to changes in solar radiation income and the corresponding changes in air temperatures. The Lower dam was less stable during summer than the Upper one and this could largely be a result of short water residence time which influenced development of thermal stratification. Diurnal stratification of temperature and oxygen occurred in both dams during summer but was less established in winter. The shallow nature of small dams suggests that they are more vulnerable to external fluxes such daily changes in temperature, wind runs and any other disturbances and hence the prevalence of diel stratification because of low stability. The water and aspects of sediment chemistry of the dams was investigated in relation to influence of the hydrological regime. The two small dams were not significantly different in water chemistry but their sediment chemistry showed some differences. Seasonal fluctuations in conductivity, TDS, TSS and Secchi disc transparency were strongly linked to the hydrological regime to the effects of the first rains while increases in BOD and COD suggested increased organic matter at low water levels. There were no dramatic seasonal variations in pH, alkalinity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and total nitrogen although the latter tended to be higher in the Upper dam. Short water residence time was attributed as the main factor resulting in small differences in the water quality of the two dams. In the Upper dam, sediment silt content was higher in the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> while clay was significantly higher in the permanently inundated zone. There were no major seasonal variations in nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content in the zones but their values were consistently higher in the deeper zone. In contrast, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content were significantly different between the two zones in the Lower dam and were higher in the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone</b> except clay. The community structure of zooplankton and phytoplankton populations was studied. Zooplankton abundance was not very different between the two dams with peaks during the late dry season attributed to a sudden abundance of rotifers. A similar pattern was observed for phytoplankton abundance and biomass with peaks around October 2000 but generally higher abundance was measured in the bottom dam. There was a complete shift in the dominant zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa in both dams after October 2000. A major factor influencing plankton abundance was washout during the main rainy season whilst water transparency, suspended solids, water temperature were factors identified by CCA analysis as important for zooplankton community structure in both dams. CCA analysis revealed that physico-chemical variables were not significant in determining phytoplankton communities in both dams perhaps superseded by hydrological processes. The effects of grazing on phytoplankton by zooplankton and predation on zooplankton by fish were not assessed but could be factors influencing community dynamics. Six fish species were caught in both dams during the entire sampling. The dominant species numerically was B. paludinosus and C. gariepinus in either dam but C. gariepinus contributed the greatest proportion of the total catch weight at most times. The cyprinids B. lineomaculatus and B. trimaculatus were caught in small numbers and so were the cichlids, O. mossambicus and T. sparrmanii. This species composition is perhaps largely determined by the fish community in the river and the shallow nature and frequent fluctuations in water level do not allow for specialized habitats to develop in small dams hence promoting diversity. Water retention is very short in these dams and so they could be little difference with the main river. The highest proportion of breeding B. paludinosus was during the rainy season and consequently relative fecundity was highest at that time. Migration, spawning events and recruitment events were not easily discernable in the fish populations of either dam. The high turbidity when water levels were low did not appear to have adverse effects on the fish community in either dam...|$|E
40|$|The 1985 kokanee {{spawning}} {{run in the}} Flathead {{system was}} the strongest in five years. Escapement to the Flathead River system was 147, 000 fish, including 123, 000 in McDonald Creek and an estimated 20, 000 in the main stem. Enumeration of spawners and redds in the Flathead River was hindered by high fall flows and early freezing in November. The upstream spawning migration from Flathead Lake began in late August. Schools of kokanee were seen six miles above the lake on September 4. We counted 1, 156 redds in Flathead Lake, distributed primarily along the southeastern shore. An unusually high proportion (90 percent) of lakeshore spawning occurred in the zone above minimum pool, where egg mortality is very high because of exposure from drawdown. Escapement to the Swan River was 1, 350 fish. Four year old (III+) fish comprised 95 percent of the spawning run in the Flathead system. This continues a five-year trend toward dominance of the III+ year class. The age composition of spawners has varied considerably for the past 15 years. The average size of spawning fish was 365 mm, which {{is identical to the}} average size of the parent year class in 1981. One of the goals of managing Flathead kokanee is to produce mature fish 300 - 330 mm in length. In the main stem Flathead River, pre-emergent survival was 80 percent. Survival in McDonald Creek, unaffected by hydroelectric operations, was 83 percent. Sampling showed few hatched alevins, probably due to unusually cold winter temperatures. Egg survival at Blue Bay, a spawning area on Flathead Lake where redds are concentrated below minimum pool, varied in relation to depth and dissolved oxygen concentration in the substrate. Eggs survived 78 days at 2, 880 feet where dissolved oxygen was 5. 7 mg/l. Eggs survived 35 days at 2, 870 feet where dissolved oxygen concentration averaged 2. 9 mg/l. Low dissolved oxygen contributed to poor survival to emergence at all elevations in Blue Ray. Experiments in Skidoo Bay confirmed that survival of eggs above minimum pool depends on redds being wetted by groundwater seeps. After 40 days exposure by drawdown, eggs in groundwater seeps showed 86 percent survival, whereas outside of the groundwater seeps eggs survived less than six days. These results confirm that exposure by drawdown is the primary factor that limits kokanee reproductive success in redds above minimum pool. We surveyed the west and south shoreline of Flathead Lake to locate potential kokanee spawning habitat. We found conditions which could support incubating eggs at two sites in South Ray and two sites on the west shore of the lake. Seven other sites on the west shore were not suitable due to low groundwater discharge or low dissolved oxygen. In all these areas suitable substrate existed only within the <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone.</b> The lake should be drafted earlier in the fall, and filled earlier in the spring to improve recruitment from lakeshore spawning. We conducted creel surveys during 1985, and estimated that anglers caught 192, 000 kokanee. Anglers harvested 49, 200 fish during the ice fishery in Skidoo Bay, 129, 000 fish during the summer fishery on the lake, and 13, 800 during the fall river fishery. Estimated fishing pressure for the year exceeded 188, 000 angler hours. The abundance of mysid shrimp in Flathead Lake, measured at six index stations, increased to 130 /mIf in 1986. My&Is increased tenfold from 1984 to 1985, and about threefold from 1985 to 1986. Monitoring of mysid shrimp and zooplankton populations in Flathead Lake is supplementing an investigation of the growth and survival of juvenile kokanee. Kokanee and mysid shrimp feed primarily on planktonic crustaceans. This work was designed to detect a potential decline in kokanee recruitment or growth brought about by competitive interaction with mysid shrimp. Fluctuation in adult kokanee year class strength is in part attributable to the negative effects of hydroelectric dam operation on reproductive success in the main stem Flathead River and in Flathead Lake. Our results show that egg survival in the river has improved in response to stabilized discharge from Hungry Horse Dam. Drawdown exposure continues to limit egg survival in lakeshore redds. Study of the variability in growth and survival of young-of-the-year fish in Flathead Lake will further the understanding of factors which cause fluctuation in the kokanee population...|$|E
40|$|A {{major focus}} of {{research}} regarding non-native invasive plants is to understand what ecological variables (abiotic and biotic) increase or decrease {{the likelihood that a}} non-native plant species will become invasive, and to determine whether invasion has a negative impact on native plant species. Crassula helmsii is a plant indigenous to Australasia, which has invaded wetland habitats across much of Britain. It is a low growing, clonally spreading plant, which occupies the margins and shallows of freshwater and brackish waterbodies. Crassula helmsii is considered invasive due to its ability to produce vigorous aboveground growth, which in some locations spreads to form dense monospecific mats of vegetation. There are concerns that C. helmsii can exclude native plant species, and therefore that its invasion may {{have a negative impact on}} biodiversity. The research presented in this thesis was conducted with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms which allow C. helmsii to develop dense, dominating vegetative mats. This aim was addressed by investigating how C. helmsii abundance was related to variation in the abiotic environment, how C. helmsii abundance was affected by generalist herbivores, and whether C. helmsii abundance was related to the presence or absence of co-occurring plant competitors. To investigate how C. helmsii abundance is related to the abiotic environment, firstly field data were collected of pH, nutrient levels, water depth, and shade levels along C. helmsii invaded margins of waterbodies. Multiple linear regression was used to address the question: How well does abiotic variation predict variation in C. helmsii abundance in the field? Finding that C. helmsii cover was significantly greater at a higher pH and at lower shade levels. Secondly C. helmsii was grown in mesocosms at different strengths of salinity (0, 2, 4, 8 ppt) to address the question: What is the estimated minimum salinity level for the control of C. helmsii in brackish water habitats? Relative growth rate decreased significantly with increasing salinity and C. helmsii died in the highest salinity treatments (8 ppt). These two experiments demonstrated that C. helmsii abundance can be affected by the abiotic environment, and specifically by pH, shade levels, and salinity. Dense, dominating mats of C. helmsii are more likely to occur in freshwater conditions, which have a neutral to alkaline pH, and with minimal overhead shading. More effective control against C. helmsii dominance may be achieved by preventing C. helmsii from colonising sites with such abiotic conditions, or by focusing more effort on removal of C. helmsii vegetation which has colonised such sites. To investigate the effect of disturbance from generalist herbivores, a field-based experiment was set up, in which 4 m 2 fenced plots which excluded large vertebrates were erected along a C. helmsii invaded <b>drawdown</b> <b>zone.</b> The abundances of all plants species within the fenced plots and within adjacent unfenced plots were recorded repeatedly over a year, and compared, in order to explore the question: What is the effect of grazing on the abundance of C. helmsii within a wetland plant community? Crassula helmsii declined in abundance in the fenced plots compared to the unfenced plots, and the abundance of co-occurring vegetation was consistently higher in the fenced plots than in the unfenced plots. Crassula helmsii appeared to benefit from grazing disturbance, attaining a higher abundance in the unfenced plots, where competitor plant species had been grazed out. Crassula helmsii could have a negative impact on native plant species diversity, if it is able to fill a niche usually occupied by native plant species of open, grazed drawdown zones (e. g. Teucrium scordium). The relationship between C. helmsii abundance and the presence or absence of co-occurring plants was investigated in order to ascertain the effect of competition on the abundance of C. helmsii, and also to ascertain the effect of competition from C. helmsii on the abundance and diversity of co-occurring plants, therefore giving an indication of whether the spread of C. helmsii can have a negative impact on native species. Firstly a common garden experiment and a field based experiment were separately conducted, both assessing how well C. helmsii could spread into available bare ground compared to native competitors, and addressing the question: Is available bare ground an important pre-requisite to high C. helmsii abundance? These experiments found that C. helmsii can rapidly respond to available bare ground, but that simultaneous spread of native competitors might limit C. helmsii community dominance. The effect of C. helmsii on native plants was species specific; the common garden experiment showed that C. helmsii limited the spread of Anagallis tenella, but not Hypericum elodes or Hydrocotyle vulgaris. Secondly field survey data of plant species abundance and diversity were collected to explore the question: Can the invasion of C. helmsii negatively affect the plant community in a Phragmites australis dominated fen habitat? Survey data were analysed to determine whether C. helmsii was negatively correlated with variables of the plant community, a pattern indicating that C. helmsii could increase in abundance by displacing native plants. The variables ‘total community abundance’ and ‘species diversity’ were not significantly correlated with C. helmsii. At the single species level, C. helmsii and the dominant plant species P. australis showed a high capacity to coexist, although C. helmsii was most abundant where P. australis was absent. Based on these three experiments, evidence was not found to suggest that C. helmsii has a negative impact through direct displacement of native plants. However, because dominating C. helmsii growth may be more likely to occur in an area with ample bare ground into which this species can spread, and where tall competitive plant species (e. g. P. australis) are in low abundance, management activities designed to increase species diversity by creating patches of open vegetation structure, might instead just encourage a higher abundance and dominance of C. helmsii...|$|E
