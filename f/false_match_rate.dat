The <b>false</b> <b>match</b> <b>rate</b> {{is defined as the}} ratio of false matches to final matches.

Iris recognition uses video camera technology with subtle near infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris which are visible externally. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual.

40|$|AbstractCleansing {{data from}} {{synonyms}} and homonyms is a relevant task in fields where {{high quality of}} data is crucial, for example in disease registries and medical research networks. Record linkage provides methods for minimizing synonym and homonym errors thereby improving data quality. We focus {{our attention to the}} case of homonym errors (in the following denoted as ‘false matches’), in which records belonging to different entities are wrongly classified as equal. Synonym errors (‘false non-matches’) occur when a single entity maps to multiple records in the linkage result. They are not considered in this study because in our application domain they are not as crucial as false matches. False match rates are frequently computed manually through a clerical review, so without modelling the distribution of the false match rates a priori. An exception is the work of Belin and Rubin (1995) [4]. They propose to estimate the <b>false</b> <b>match</b> <b>rate</b> by means of a normal mixture model that needs training data for a calibration process. In this paper we present a new approach for estimating the <b>false</b> <b>match</b> <b>rate</b> within the framework of Fellegi and Sunter by methods of Extreme Value Theory (EVT). This approach needs no training data for determining the threshold for matches and therefore leads to a significant cost-reduction. After giving two different definitions of the <b>false</b> <b>match</b> <b>rate,</b> we present the tools of the EVT used in this paper: the generalized Pareto distribution and the mean excess plot. Our experiments with real data show that the model works well, with only slightly lower accuracy compared to a procedure that has information about the match status and that maximizes the accuracy...|$|E

While existing matching techniques consider only {{the relationship between the}} SIFT-points of the query image on one hand and the points in the reference image on the other hand, SGR-Matching also takes into account the geometric relationship between the SIFT-points within the query image in comparison with the relationship of the corresponding matched points in the reference image. Assessed with the proposed SGR-Matching, the SIFT-based palmprint identification system has been shown to improve the performance significantly. Furthermore, experimental results have shown the superiority of the proposed technique over state-of-the-art techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} purification {{method of}} matching points usually uses {{a small number}} of the points as initial input. Though it can meet most of the requirements of point constraints, the iterative purification solution is easy to fall into local extreme, which results in the missing of correct matching points.

And thorough mismatching points step eliminating and robust solving, more accurate global optimal solution, which intends to reduce the omission <b>rate</b> of correct <b>matching</b> points and thus reaches better purification effect, can be obtained. Experimental results show that this method can obtain the global optimal solution under a certain original <b>false</b> <b>matching</b> <b>rate,</b> and can decrease or avoid the omission of correct matching points...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{effective}} fusion {{method for}} combining information from single modality system requires Multimodal biometric crypto system. Fuzzy vault {{has been widely}} used for providing security, but the disadvantage is that the biometric data are easily visible and chaff points generated randomly can be easily found, {{so that there is}} a chance for the data to be hacked by the attackers. In order to improve the security by hiding the secret key within the biometric data, a new chaff point based fuzzy vault is proposed. For the generation of the secret key in the fuzzy vault, grouped feature vectors are generated by combining the extracted shape and texture feature vectors with the new chaff point feature vectors. With the help of the locations of the extracted feature vector points, x and y co-ordinate chaff matrixes are generated. New chaff points can be made, by picking best locations from the feature vectors. The optimal locations are found out by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In PSO, extracted feature locations are considered particles and from these locations, best location for generating the chaff feature point is selected based on the fitness value. The experimentation of the proposed work is done on Yale face and IIT Delhi ear databases and its performance are evaluated using the measures such as Jaccard coefficient (JC), Genuine Acceptance <b>Rate</b> (GAR), <b>False</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Rate</b> (FMR), Dice Coefficient (DC) and <b>False</b> Non <b>Matching</b> <b>Rate</b> (FNMR).

40|$|Abstract. The {{accuracy}} of Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) {{is dependent on}} many variables ranging from {{the quality of the}} friction skin surface itself, to the ability of the image acquisition device to accurately image the fingerprint, to the feature extract and match software to detect the feature set and declare a correlation (a match/no match) based on some criteria. The genesis of these systems exclusively used rolled impression fingerprint imagery. As AFIS developers attempted to reduce the cost and improve the usability of these systems for commercial applications, plain impression imagery was adopted and total scanned image area was significantly reduced. This paper will attempt to quantify the effects of reduced image area on overall system accuracy in a single finger plain impression environment. The results can be directly applied by AFIS designers as they attempt to meet systems requirements with respect to key accuracy parameters such as <b>false</b> <b>match</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>false</b> non-match rates and the resulting workload caused by the system. ...|$|R

Next, it implements a procedure for matching sets of minutiae data. This process goes through all possible alignments of the datasets and returns the matching score for the best possible alignment.

40|$|Aircraft {{recognition}} {{remains a}} challenging problem despite {{a great deal}} of effort to automate the recognition process. The majority of the aircraft recognition methods assume the successful isolation of the aircraft silhouette from the background, and only a few have actually addressed real world concerns, such as occlusion, clutter and shadows. This thesis presents an automatic aircraft recognition system, which shows improved performance with complex images. This system assumes from the start that the image could possibly be degraded, contain occlusions, clutter, camouflage, shadows and blurring. It is designed to tolerate and overcome the degradations at various analysis stages. The first part of the thesis focuses on the generic aircraft recognition problem using a generic description of aircraft parts and the geometric relationships that exist among them. The system implements line groupings in a hierarchical fashion, progressively leading towards a generic aircraft structure. A voting scheme is used to consolidate line groupings belonging to an aircraft while discouraging the formation of spurious line groupings. The aircraft identification process is carried out {{in the second part of}} the thesis, where the generically recognised aircraft is matched to model candidates. Model matching is carried out via pixellevel silhouette boundary matching. The system is tested on numerous real aircraft, scaled-down model aircraft and non-aircraft images with adverse image conditions. The developed system achieves a recognition rate of 84 % at a false alarm rate of 7 % on real aircraft images, and an correct <b>matching</b> <b>rate</b> of about 90 % and a <b>false</b> <b>matching</b> <b>rate</b> of 7 % on the generically recognised aircraft from model aircraft images...|$|R
