25|$|An {{excise duty}} is an {{indirect}} tax imposed upon goods {{during the process}} of their manufacture, production or distribution, and is usually proportionate to their quantity or value. Excise duties were first introduced into England in the year 1643, as part of a scheme of revenue and taxation devised by parliamentarian John Pym and approved by the Long Parliament. These duties consisted of charges on beer, ale, cider, cherry wine and tobacco, to which list were afterwards added paper, soap, candles, malt, hops, and sweets. The basic principle of excise duties was that they were taxes on the production, manufacture or distribution <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> which could not be taxed through the customs house, and revenue derived from that source is called excise revenue proper. The fundamental conception of the term is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation <b>of</b> such <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> luxury as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>articles</b> (a customs duty).|$|R
40|$|The International Trade Commission (ITC) {{has gained}} {{importance}} {{in recent years}} because of its increasingly powerful role in adjudicating patent disputes.

The Commission is now potentially the patent tribunal of first instance for electronic products and other products manufactured overseas. This paper examines possible biases in ITC decision making in favor of patent holders from both a positive and a normative perspective and offers suggestions for improving the efficiency of the ITC process for adjudicating complaints based on patent infringement. I provide the most comprehensive economic analysis to date of cases that arise under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. In particular, this is the first paper to compare the ITC decision-making process in patent disputes with the district courts in a systematic way. After empirically demonstrating a likely bias in decision making at the ITC, the paper provides specific remedies that could improve the efficiency of the patent dispute process.

60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that our prohibiting the <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> a {{particular}} <b>article,</b> which, but for the prohibition, would have been imported, enables us to obtain our other imports at smaller cost.

If our legislature prohibits this commodity, the other country will be obliged to offer any other article on easier terms, in order to force a sufficient demand for it to be an equivalent to what she purchases from us.|$|R

Still he was too true a patriot not to sympathize {{in the struggle for}} colonial rights which now agitated the whole country, and we find him gradually carried more and more into the current of political affairs. A letter written on the 5th of April, 1769, to his friend, George Mason, shows the important stand he was disposed to take. In the previous year the merchants and traders of Boston, Salem, Connecticut and New York, had agreed to suspend for a time the <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>articles</b> subject to taxation. Similar resolutions had recently been adopted by the merchants of Philadelphia. Washington's letter is emphatic in support of the measure.

But the manner of doing it, to answer the purpose effectually, is the point in question. That no man should scruple, or hesitate a moment in defence of so valuable a blessing, is clearly my opinion; yet arms should be the last resource--the dernier ressort. We have already, it is said, proved the inefficacy of addresses to the throne, and remonstrances to Parliament. How far their attention to our rights and interests is to be awakened, or alarmed, by starving their trade and manufactures, remains to be tried.|$|R

It states that, “any law, regulation, or requirement…which applies to an imported product and to the like domestic product and is…enforced {{in the case of the}} imported product at the time or point <b>of</b> <b>importation,</b> is nevertheless to be regarded as…a law, regulation, or requirement subject to the provisions <b>of</b> <b>Article</b> III.|$|R
