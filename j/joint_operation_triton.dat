30|$|Italy {{recently}} attempted {{but ultimately}} abandoned a more humane effort in managing people movements from North Africa. The Italian Operation Mare Nostrum began in October 2013 {{with the aim}} of intercepting people in distress and carrying them back to Italian reception centres (Mare Nostrum, no date). Because of its emphasis on rescuing and assisting, the operation Mare Nostrum received strong support from intergovernmental agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration but no support from other EU member states with the UK harshly criticising the operation as being a pull factor (Travis, 2014). While Italy was seeking support from the EU to continue the Operation, according to Amnesty International ‘the EU and its member states avoided any decisions which could help refugees and migrants leaving North Africa {{for as long as they}} could’ (Amnesty International, 2015, p. 34). On 27 August 2014, <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton,</b> an EU border patrol-only operation managed by Frontex, the European border agency, effectively replaced the Operation Mare Nostrum (European Commission, 2014). <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> only monitors the ‘external border’ (European Commission, 2014), up to 30 nautical miles from the European coasts, and is not a rescuing migrants at sea but ‘render[s] assistance to persons in distress’ (European Commission, 2014). Centred on these points, <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> was criticised as it was evident it resumed the harsher approach (“Frontex Launches <b>Joint</b> <b>Operation</b> Triton”, 2014). More recent tragedies on the Mediterranean have prompted the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres to say that Triton is a ‘woefully inadequate replacement for Italy's Mare Nostrum’ (“Hundreds of Migrants”, 2015, para. 4).|$|R

5000|$|The {{operation}} {{ended on}} 31 October 2014 and was superseded by Frontex's <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton,</b> which operates a smaller {{search and rescue}} capability. Unlike Mare Nostrum, <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> focused on border protection rather than search and rescue, and operates closer to the Italian coast The termination of Mare Nostrum has been criticized {{as a cause of}} the increased death rate among migrants to Europe in the Mediterranean, which increased tenfold between 2014 and 2015. Two major migrant shipwreck disasters which together killed more than 1000 people within the span of a week in April 2015 led to calls to renew the operation.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} paper examines {{the incidence of}} sub-optimal effects in successful <b>joint</b> <b>operations,</b> in particular the command function in one successful <b>joint</b> <b>operation.</b> This study has been undertaken because research about <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> tends to be normative {{and focus on the}} advantages and opportunities in <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> instead of examining the problems that may arise. Previous research suggests that the command function should be centralized to achieve synergies. It is also suggested that the command function should be decentralized to enable lower command echelons to act on situations occurring in the theatre of operations. Since no existing theories explain this command-dilemma in full, a theory has been developed for the study’s analysis. Research design is that of a single-case study of the German operation Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) 1940. Empirical data has been gathered through written documents covering the selected case. Results of analysis reveal that there were sub-optimal effects in terms of inefficiencies during the operation Fall Gelb and a conclusion can be drawn that successful <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> also have sub- optimal effects. The study contributes to existing research by providing a more nuanced understanding of <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> with a focus on sub-optimal aspects. ...|$|R
