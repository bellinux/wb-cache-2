5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat <b>exchangers</b> mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat <b>exchangers</b> did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The triple {{concentric}} pipes heat <b>exchanger</b> is {{an improved}} version of double pipe heat <b>exchanger.</b> Most {{of the previous}} study on the heat <b>exchanger</b> is confined to two fluids and few of many possible flow arrangements. The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes heat <b>exchanger</b> where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple concentric pipes heat <b>exchanger.</b> Length of triple pipe heat <b>exchanger</b> is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method. Overall heat transfer coefficient and length of the equivalent double pipe heat <b>exchanger</b> are {{compared with that of}} the triple pipe heat <b>exchanger.</b> The theoretical analysis shows that introducing an intermediate pipe to the double pipe heat <b>exchanger</b> reduces effective length of heat <b>exchanger,</b> which results in savings in material and space. The triple concentric pipes heat <b>exchanger</b> provides large heat transfer area per unit heat <b>exchanger</b> length and better heat transfer efficiencies compared to double pipe heat <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R

5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat <b>exchangers</b> can collect the heat.

These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
