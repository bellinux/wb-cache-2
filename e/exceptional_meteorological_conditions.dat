50|$|On 29 September 2009 {{there were}} reports from local news sources that {{indicated}} that a fumarole existing {{at the pinnacle of}} the mountain (Piquinho) began emitting volcanic gas. The region's seismic and volcanological monitoring centre (CIVISA Centro de Informação e Vigilância Sismovulcânica dos Açores) indicated that the phenomenon occurred in the early morning, turning intense and visible in various points throughout the island and from Faial. Although the event resulted from <b>exceptional</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and was visible in the Central Group, there was no liberation of anomalous volcanic gases and all other parameters fell within norms.|$|E

40|$|The UK {{experienced}} record average rainfall {{in winter}} 2013 – 14, leading to widespread and prolonged flooding. The immediate {{cause of this}} exceptional rainfall {{was a very strong}} and persistent cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the North East Atlantic Ocean. This was related to a very strong North Atlantic jet stream which resulted in numerous damaging wind storms. These <b>exceptional</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> have led to renewed questions about whether anthropogenic climate change is noticeably influencing extreme weather. The regional weather pattern responsible for the extreme UK winter coincided with highly anomalous conditions across the globe. We assess the contributions from various possible remote forcing regions using sets of ocean–atmosphere model relaxation experiments, where winds and temperatures are constrained to be similar to those observed in winter 2013 – 14 within specified atmospheric domains. We find that influences from the tropics were likely to have {{played a significant role in}} the development of the unusual extra-tropical circulation, including a role for the tropical Atlantic sector. Additionally, a stronger and more stable stratospheric polar vortex, likely associated with a strong westerly phase of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), appears to have contributed to the extreme conditions. While intrinsic climatic variability clearly has the largest effect on the generation of extremes, results from an analysis which segregates circulation-related and residual rainfall variability suggest that emerging climate change signals made a secondary contribution to extreme rainfall in winter 2013 – 14...|$|E
40|$|Warm salty Atlantic Water is {{the main}} source water for the Arctic Ocean and thus plays an {{important}} role in the mass and heat budget of the Arctic. This study explores interannual to decadal variability of Atlantic Water properties in the Nordic Seas area where Atlantic Water enters the Arctic, based on a reexamination of the historical hydrographic record for the years 1950 - 2009, obtained by combining multiple data sets. The analysis shows a succession of four multi-year warm events where temperature anomalies at 100 m depth exceed 0. 4 oC, and three cold events. Three of the four warm events lasted 3 - 4 years, while the fourth began in 1999 and persists at least through 2009. This most recent warm event is anomalous in other ways as well, being the strongest, having the broadest geographic extent, being surface-intensified, and occurring under <b>exceptional</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> Three of the four warm events were accompanied by elevated salinities consistent with enhanced ocean transport into the Nordic Seas, with the exception of the event spanning July 1989 -July 1993. Of the three cold events, two lasted for four years, while the third lasted for nearly 14 years. Two of the three cold events are associated with reduced salinities, but the cold event of the 1960 s had elevated salinities. The relationship of these events to meteorological conditions is examined. The results show that local surface heat flux variations act in some cases to reinforce the anomalies, but are too weak to be the sole cause...|$|E
40|$|A {{persistent}} and un usual bloom of Dinophysis acuta Ehrenberg in the Rías Bajas (Northwest Spain) from early July to mid-November 1989, {{was associated with}} a diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) outbreak that prevented mussel extraction in some areas from early August to mid-December. Integrated samples (0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 15 m) were taken {{once or twice a week}} at six stations. Maximum numbers of D. acuta (up to 2. 3 X 10 ^ 4 cells 1 ^- 1 in the integrated samples) and percentage of observed dividing cells (up to 31 %), appeared in August,and formed a maximum in the thermoeline. Cell numbers were minimal when upwelling caused a breakdown of stratification. High numbers of D. acuta (up to 1. 8 x 10 ^ 4 cells 1 ^- 1 y appeared again when persistentsouth winds in late October caused a reversal of the circulation. Thus, the two cell maxima occurred during two distinct hydrographic regimes, but in both cases at temperatures of 15 - 17 °C. Numerous cells with one typical D. acuta valve, but the other valve reduced in size, were seen during the bloom, as well as Dinophysis dens Pavillard cells that might be a life cycle stage of D. acuta. Other observations include doublewalled, unwinged forms that are perhaps some kind of cyst, and a hypothetical 'fertiuzmg tube' emerging from the larger cell of a D. acuta/D. dens couplet. It is suggested that the maxima during stratification and during downwelling episodes could correspond to periods with a predominance of in situ growth and physical accumulation, respectively, and that the <b>exceptional</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> during 1989 provided the optimum scenario for the unusual occurrence of D. acuta.

40|$|To control severe air {{pollution}} in China, comprehensive pollution control strategies have been implemented throughout the country in recent years. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} these strategies, the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on levels of {{air pollution}} needs to be determined. Using the intensive air pollution control strategies implemented during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in 2014 (APEC 2014) and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade (Victory Parade 2015) as examples, we estimated the role of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and pollution control strategies in reducing air pollution levels in Beijing. Atmospheric particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter [*]≤[*] 2. 5  µm (PM 2. 5) samples were collected and gaseous pollutants (SO 2, NO, NO x, and O 3) were measured online at a site in Peking University (PKU). To determine the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on the levels of air pollution, we first compared the air pollutant concentrations during days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, there were few days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> during the Victory Parade. As such, we were unable to estimate the level of emission reduction efforts during this period. Finally, a generalized linear regression model (GLM) based only on meteorological parameters was built to predict air pollutant concentrations, which could explain more than 70  % of the variation in air pollutant concentration levels, after incorporating the nonlinear relationships between certain meteorological parameters and the concentrations of air pollutants. Evaluation of the GLM performance revealed that the GLM, even based only on meteorological parameters, could be satisfactory to estimate the contribution of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> in reducing air pollution and, hence, the contribution of control strategies in reducing air pollution. Using the GLM, we found that the <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and pollution control strategies contributed 30 and 28  % to the reduction of the PM 2. 5 concentration during APEC and 38 and 25  % during the Victory Parade, respectively, {{based on the assumption that}} the concentrations of air pollutants are only determined by <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and emission intensities. We also estimated the contribution of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and control strategies in reducing the concentrations of gaseous pollutants and PM 2. 5 components with the GLMs, revealing the effective control of anthropogenic emissions...|$|R
