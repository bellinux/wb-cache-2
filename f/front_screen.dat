2500|$|President Roosevelt died at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. In {{the minutes}} after his death, Fala behaved very strangely. FDR biographer Jim Bishop {{wrote about the}} death scene: [...] "… a snapping, snarling series of barks was heard. No one had paid any {{attention}} to Fala. He had been dozing {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the <b>front</b> <b>screen</b> door and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence.

2500|$|A CRT is {{constructed}} from a glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e., long from <b>front</b> <b>screen</b> face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. [...] The {{interior of a}} CRT is evacuated to approximately [...] to , evacuation being necessary to facilitate the free flight of electrons from the gun(s) to the tube's face. That it is evacuated makes handling an intact CRT potentially dangerous due {{to the risk of}} breaking the tube and causing a violent implosion that can hurl shards of glass at great velocity. [...] As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{the length of}} exposure to screens and the prevalence of consumption of meals and snacks by Brazilian adolescents in <b>front</b> of <b>screens.</b> METHODS We evaluated 74, 589 12 to 17 -year old adolescents from 1, 247 schools in 124 Brazilian municipalities. A self-administered questionnaire was used. Its segment regarding nutrition contained questions about using TV, computers, and video game systems, having meals while watching TV, and consuming snacks in <b>front</b> of <b>screens.</b> Consumption of meals and snacks in <b>front</b> of <b>screens</b> was analyzed according to the following variables: geographical region, gender, age range, type of school (public or private), and school shift. The prevalences and their respective 95 % confidence intervals were estimated under a complex sampling design. RESULTS A {{great deal of the}} adolescents (73. 5 %, 95 %CI 72. 3 - 74. 7) reported spending two or more hours a day in <b>front</b> of <b>screens.</b> That habit was more frequent among male adolescents, private school students, morning shift students, and students from Brazil&# 8217;s South region. More than half of the adolescents (56. 6 %, 95 %CI 55. 4 - 57. 8) reported almost always or always having meals in front of TV, and 39. 6 % (95 %CI 38. 8 - 40. 5) of them said they consumed snacks in <b>front</b> of <b>screens</b> exactly as often. Both situations were the most prevalent ones among the girls, who attended public schools and were from Brazil&# 8217;s Midwest region. CONCLUSIONS Length of exposure to screens and consumption of meals and snacks almost always or always in <b>front</b> of <b>screens</b> are high among Brazilian adolescents. It is necessary to develop strategies aiming to reduce the length of screen use, considering the media reality that children and adolescents have been experiencing from earlier and earlier ages. That context must therefore be analyzed in an indissociable way...|$|R
