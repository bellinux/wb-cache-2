5|$|African-American {{history and}} culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was a {{consultant}} on the film, and researcher David Fiske, co-author of Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave, provided some material used to market the film. Nevertheless, news and magazine articles {{around the time of}} the film's release described a scholar alleging some license that Northup could have taken with <b>his</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> liberties that McQueen definitely took with Northup's original, for dramatic, modernizing, or other reasons.|$|E

5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on <b>his</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|Smith gave an {{interview}} to the Columbia newspaper The State about <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> his interest in researching {{the history of the}} Central Intelligence Agency. He explained that he was long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned him to ask if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history of the CIA. Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to Australia and led New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 1953–54. He topped the Australian first-class batting averages with 71.10, but had his poorest {{season with the}} ball, taking only 16wickets at 38.75. The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches. The season was also a transition point in Australian cricket, as Hassett retired upon return to Australia. Initially, Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy. Miller was the state captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller. At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position. As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in <b>his</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria. Johnson {{returned to}} form with 45wickets at 22.75 for the season.|$|E

25|$|Wilson, whilst not {{providing}} references {{to his own}} research, reports that the Hearth Tax Returns for Whitefield in 1666 show that there were 135 hearths. Further, that the population numbered in 1714 a total of 740; that in 1789 it was 2,455; and in 1793 that it was 2,780. Some of the population statistics which he quotes subsequently in <b>his</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> presumably based upon the Official Census returns since 1901, do on occasion differ very slightly from those quoted below.|$|E

In testimony before the committee, Wertham restated arguments from <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> pointed to comics as {{a major cause of}} juvenile crime. The committee's questioning of their next witness, EC publisher William Gaines, focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had described. Though the committee's final report did not blame comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily. Publishers then developed the self-censorship Comics Code Authority.|$|E

Johnson's family moved to Corvallis, Oregon, in 1980, and he attended Crescent Valley High School, graduating in 1981.

25|$|Rabbi Naphtali Cohen (1649–1718) was a kabbalist who was tricked {{into giving}} an {{approbation}} {{to a book}} by the Sabbatean Nehemiah Hayyun. Provided with this and with other recommendations secured in the same way, Hayyun traveled throughout Moravia and Silesia, propagating everywhere his Sabbatean teachings. Cohen soon discovered his mistake, and endeavored, without success, to recover his approbation, {{although he did not}} as yet realize the full import of the book. It was in 1713, while Cohen was staying at Breslau (where he acted as a rabbi until 1716), that Haham Tzvi Ashkenazi of Amsterdam informed him of its tenets. Cohen thereupon acted rigorously. He launched a ban against the author and <b>his</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> {{became one of the most}} zealous supporters of Haham Tzvi in his campaign against Hayyun.|$|E
25|$|The book covers {{almost all}} aspects of life in {{providing}} proper guidance of Islam such as the method of performing prayers and other actions of worship directly from the Prophet Muhammad. Bukhari finished his work around 846/232 AH, and spent the last twenty-four {{years of his life}} visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the hadith he had collected. In every city that Bukhari visited, thousands of people would gather in the main mosque to listen to him recite traditions. In reply to Western academic doubts as to the actual date and authorship of the book that bears his name, scholars point out that notable hadith scholars of that time, such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal (855 CE/241 AH), Yahya ibn Ma'in (847 CE/233 AH), and Ali ibn al-Madini (848 CE/234 AH), accepted the authenticity of <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> that the collection's immediate fame makes it unlikely {{that it could have been}} revised after the author's death without historical record.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư was {{modeled after the}} famous Zizhi Tongjian (資治通鑑, Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government) of the Song scholar Sima Guang, which means {{historical}} events were redacted in chronological order like annals. Ngô Sĩ Liên separated <b>his</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> the history of Vietnam into Ngoại kỷ (Peripheral Records) and Bản kỷ (Basic Records) by the 938 victory of Ngô Quyền in the Battle of Bạch Đằng River. This chronological method of compilation {{is different from the}} official historical texts of Chinese dynasties which had the layout divided in biographies of each historical figures, an approach which was initiated by Sima Qian in the Records of the Grand Historian. In record of each Vietnamese emperor, Ngô Sĩ Liên always started with a brief introduction of the emperor which provided an overview about the reigning ruler of the record. In listing the events, the historian sometimes noted an additional story about the historical figure who was mentioned in the event, some had extensive and detailed stories, notably Trần Quốc Tuấn or Trần Thủ Độ. Some important texts were also included in the original form by Ngô Sĩ Liên such as Hịch tướng sĩ or Bình Ngô đại cáo.|$|E
