Whenever a fishbone was stuck in his throat {{he would come to}} me and have me lick my index and middle fingers and rub his throat. He was always very old to me and I remember the skin on his throat being loose and soft. "Lolo, is it working? Is it loose?" I would ask and he would just point at my fingers and keep trying to clear his throat. It made me feel important when he would stand before me presenting his throat to my fingers. But I wondered what else it was that I was {{supposed to be able to}} heal people of. Mama said I was lucky. Being born upside down, I could have died before I got cut into the world. That's why I was so serious she said. Mama believed that children who had faced death in this way were either very serious or very lighthearted. This didn't make any sense to me at the time. I knew that I didn't laugh very often, and <b>I</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> things ever carefully. It seemed that I just didn't take life in as easy and reckless a manner as most other children. Maybe that's why I didn't really care for the company of other children...|$|R

40|$|Kelsie Blackston Artist Statement My {{interest}} in graphic design {{stems from the}} love of art and computers I had while growing up. Although I’ve {{always been interested in}} drawing and expressing my ideas through artistic means, I started college hoping to go into computer science. It didn’t take long for me to realize that I would enjoy taking a more artistic route, and that’s how I ended up here today. When I begin a project, I start by researching and sketching. Through researching, I find new styles and artists that inspire me constantly. However, there are artists that <b>I</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> always <b>think</b> of when starting a new project. A couple of them are Louise Fili, for her elegant and beautiful use of typography, and Saul Bass, because of his simple, yet iconic, logo designs. As a designer, I’ve learned to be flexible to fulfill the requirements of each project. While I believe my style is flexible, <b>I</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be drawn to certain things. Even as I got older, I found that I was always attracted to playful and bubbly styles; things that would often be described as “cute”. This <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> come through in my work, whether it be the typeface, color palette, or style of illustration I’ve chosen to use. When designing Cosmic Threads, a space themed girl’s underwear company, I could do whatever I wanted with little limitations. This allowed me to be overly playful with my designs and have fun with my pieces. Over all, Cosmic Threads is an example of who I am as a designer, and what I want my work to continue to be.

60|$|Did {{they really}} appear? Were the myths, say the myths of Daphne, really solar? That is {{precisely}} what we hesitate to accept. In the same way Mannhardt's preoccupation with vegetable myths has <b>tended,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> make many of his followers ascribe vegetable origins to myths and gods, where the real origin is perhaps for ever lost. The corn-spirit starts up in most unexpected places. Mr. Frazer, Mannhardt's disciple, is very severe on solar theories of Osiris, and connects that god with the corn- spirit. But Mannhardt did not go so far. Mannhardt thought that the myth of Osiris was solar. To my thinking, these resolutions of myths into this or that original source--solar, nocturnal, vegetable, or what not--are often very perilous. A myth so extremely composite as that of Osiris must be a stream flowing from many springs, and, {{as in the case}} of certain rivers, it is difficult or impossible to say which is the real fountain-head.|$|R

40|$|The works {{presented}} are, by presumption and by choice, a materialistic {{extension of}} my psyche. My pieces are executed directly and very personally. Being a "tactile" person, I enjoy the direct contact of touch and feel with materials as I create. I dream in color. Because of my heritage, (my Father was a builder of buildings and I was born {{under the sign}} of the 2 " x 4 "), <b>I</b> inherently <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in the "round". These factors, combined with other traits, past experiences and my education, dictate to me, sensibilities that encompass the manipulations of Basketry. Basketry, the earliest form of weaving, was common to primitive and tribal peoples throughout the world. Their baskets were created for utilitarian purposes and survival; they {{had to do with the}} mysteries of birth, life and death. Natural grasses and fibers, indigenous to their geographical regions, (reed, willow, seagrass, rush, raffia, etc.) were used for construction. Feather, hair, bone, beads, shells and natural dyes were often added for embellishment. Research of these cultures, promotes a quickening of insight and a feeling of kinship to their creativity. A study of basketry and its history opens doorways to the exploration of all other fiber traditions. My personal discovery of the basket, the mask, batik, varied looms, Peruvian weaving and all the other ramifications of the exploration became an inspiration for me. My work evolves from the excitement I experience as I assess the unlimited scope of fiber. Touching is a part of seeing, and as I "touch", I realize that fiber is a media through which I can fulfill my need for self-expression. It provides an ???open-end" for concept, composition and involvement with construction. Through research, study, practice and patience, I eventually became proficient in the arts of weaving, coiling, twining, netting and other fiber techniques which I incorporate into my work with meaning and focus.

6000|$|After endeavoring {{to point}} out to him the folly of such a proceeding, I finally {{suggested}} that we should take the other members of our Club into our confidence, and abide by their decision; to which he agreed. But, to his chagrin, the others, far from participating in his delicacy, seemed to enjoy Tournelli's unexpected wealth with a vicarious satisfaction and increase of dignity as if we were personally responsible for it. Although it had been unanimously agreed that we should make no allusions, jocose or serious, to him, nor betray any knowledge of it before him, I am afraid our attitude at the next dinner was singularly artificial. A nervous expectancy when he approached us, and a certain restraint during his presence, a disposition to check any discussion of shares or [...] "strikes" [...] in mining lest he should think it personal, an avoidance of unnecessary or trifling [...] "orders," [...] and a singular patience in awaiting their execution when given; a vague hovering between sympathetic respect and the other extreme of indifferent bluntness in our requests, <b>tended,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> make that meal far from exhilarating. Indeed, the unusual depression affected the unfortunate cause of it, who added to our confusion by increased solicitude of service and--as if fearful of some fault, or having incurred our disfavor--by a deprecatory and exaggerated humility that in our sensitive state seemed like the keenest irony. At last, evidently interpreting our constraint before him into a desire to be alone, he retired to the door of a distant pantry, whence he surveyed us with dark and sorrowful Southern eyes. Tallant, who in this general embarrassment had been imperfectly served, and had eaten nothing, here felt his grievance reach its climax, and in a sudden outbreak of recklessness he roared out, [...] "Hi, waiter--you, Tournelli. He may," [...] he added, turning darkly to us, [...] "buy up enough stock to control the board and dismiss ME; but, by thunder, if it costs me my place, I'm going to have some more chicken!" ...|$|R
40|$|The ICDE {{conference was}} held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and {{involved}} just over 400 participants. The conference was hosted by the Universidad del Caribe. About 90 % of the attendees were faculty and administrators from the Latin American university community and the rest were from Canada, United States, Korea, Australia, and New Zeeland. On Sunday November 23, I attended convocation for 930 University de Caribe students {{at the invitation of}} the conference organizers. It was a very moving experience. Not only have these students faced and persevered in terms of academic achievements, but they live in a developing country where residents face severe socioeconomic challenges as well. The conference itself took place from Nov 24 - 26, 2008. Key note speakers included: •	Dr. Michael Moore (Pennsylvania State University). His presentation was on his classic work on transaction distance in distance education •	Dr. Lalita Rajasingham (University of Wellington, New Zeeland. Her presentation was on her research and related projects on virtual reality, hyper reality and IT in terms of human communications. •	Several other key note speakers were from the Latin American countries. Each day, after the key note sessions and panel presentations, we were able to attend several conference tracks. My presentation was on Monday November 24 and it was well received. It was very interesting to discuss with the participants, the challenges we face in terms of faculty development and to hear that they also face similar challenges. The paper I presented was one that Dr. Heather Kanuka and I had written. It was a final paper from the work we did on faculty development in our roles in the Take Time for Good Instructional Fun committee. Prior to the conference, I had a more insular perspective of faculty development and distance education because my research and teaching experiences have been in North American universities. <b>I</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the cost, access, and quality issues {{in terms of what we}} face on a daily basis. I came away from the conference with a deeper appreciation of how issues in distance education go much further than cost, access, and quality, when we take the challenges that developing countries face into consideration. I was also very moved by the level of commitment that the attendees have towards improving distance education for their students. For example, one colleague spoke about his regular trips involving long commutes to remote villages in Colombia to meet with students taking distance education courses. Another discussed the need to offer university programs that would help graduates get meaningful work that would help improve the countries and their economic challenges. Still another spoke about telemedicine programs being offered through partnerships with Canadian and American universities using their old technology. On Monday evening, we went to the Uiversidad del Caribe for a book signing session that Dr. Marta Mena (ICDE Vice President for the Latin America and the Caribbean) had edited with a number of colleagues. This was followed by a festive Dominican dinner. Throughout the conference, we were able to network with many colleagues. It was very interesting to discuss distance education topics with them and to hear about the research they are doing. I also had the opportunity to talk to several students about their programs of study. In addition to my Power Point presentation, I am attaching a summary of the conference that was shared with us after the conference. I have uploaded my conference paper on my AUSPACE website. I received a conference CD at the conference and my paper and presentation is on the CD. Our university especially benefited because we were represented by Dr. Frits Pannekoek at the conference as the President of the ICDE (Canada) and Dr. Rory McGreal was in attendance and also presented a paper on learning objects. Athabasca University was well known to participants. When Dr. Michael Moore used a slide from his presentation on noted academics who have conducted research on distance education using related theories, I was able to recognize at least 5 names of Athabasca University faculty. It was a privilege to have been able to attend this conference. In addition to the conference value, I was able to make additional academic contacts and learn/practice a bit of Spanish. I truly appreciate the funding support from the A&PDF Committee. As distance education practices continue to evolve, so do the needs for effective faculty development practices. Faculty development needs can be somewhat unique in distance education. Faculty concerns relate to centralized service delivery, technology, course development time, concerns over the lack of autonomy, a sense of isolation, and feeling overworked. Such issues, if not addressed or clarified in the context of how distance education courses are delivered, can further isolate and disillusion faculty. In light of these challenges, we were interested in assessing our own university’s faculty development needs. In this paper, we present an overview of the scope of faculty development programs, related issues in distance education, and critical success factors. Thereafter, we discuss our university’s experience with faculty development. We conducted an online survey of our faculty that included open-ended questions (n= 182, 31 % response rate). The open-ended responses from participants focused on the need for a mentoring program, concerns over course development processes, issues related to information technology (IT), feelings of isolation, and the importance of collegial social interactions. The most striking and positive finding is that a majority of respondents believe their contributions to the teaching process to be important; there is a deep desire for good relationships with colleagues and the development of an effective teaching environment. The desire to develop teaching skills is an essential foundation to improving teaching practices. The results of the survey indicate that the preferred delivery methods for learning activities include both digitally based Web-spaces and face-to-face workshops facilitated by invited experts (outside of the institution). The findings confirmed a four-factor model for faculty development: (a) Technical (Internet / Web resources); (b) Social (interpersonal); (c) Moderating (cognitive / pedagogical); and (d) Management (teaching). The commitment to faculty development warrants more attention. As supported by the literature, effective faculty development programs involve needs assessments, responsiveness to faculty concerns, meaningful incentives, and faculty involvement. Continuing learning opportunities can reduce feelings of isolation, provide social interaction, and help improve teaching practices. New faculty that feel engaged and well supported in terms of teaching effectiveness and instructional support will be essential to our ability to achieve our strategic goals.
