40|$|A novel <b>distributed</b> <b>hunting</b> {{approach}} for multiple autonomous robots in unstructured mode‐free environments, {{which is based}} on effective sectors and local sensing, is proposed in this paper. The visual information, encoder and sonar data are integrated in the robot’s local frame, and the effective sector is introduced. The hunting task is modelled as three states: search state, round‐obstacle state, and hunting state, and the corresponding switching conditions and control strategies are given. A form of cooperation will emerge where the robots interact only locally with each other. The evader, whose motion is a priori unknown to the robots, adopts an escape strategy to avoid being captured. The approach is scalable and may cope with problems of communication and wheel slippage. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through experiments with a team of wheeled robots...|$|E

5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence <b>hunting,</b> and Canada <b>distributes</b> <b>hunting</b> permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|R
50|$|The {{territory}} of the ZEC has been divided into 28 sectors, to better <b>distribute</b> the <b>hunting</b> areas and provide better security for users. All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are prohibited from use during the hunting season, except for the transportation of wild animal killed.|$|R
50|$|Alligator {{hunting is}} the capture and killing of alligators. With the {{appropriate}} licenses and tags, the American alligator can legally be hunted in the Southeastern United States.The states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas all <b>distribute</b> alligator <b>hunting</b> licenses. North Carolina {{is the only}} state in the alligator's range which prohibits hunting. Alligators are protected in North Carolina and can only be killed by wildlife officials.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the modern}} era, the U.S. Forest Service has noted three {{important}} aspects of the conservation movement: the climate change, water issues, and the education of the public on conservation of the natural environment, especially among children. [...] In regards to climate change, the U.S. Forest Service has undertaken a twenty-year research project to develop ways to counteract issues surrounding climate change. However, some small steps have been taken regarding climate change. As rising greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, reforestation projects are seeking to counteract rising carbon emissions. In Oregon, the Department of Forestry has developed a small reforestation program in which landowners can lease their land for one hundred years to grow trees. In turn, these trees offset carbon emissions from power companies. Moreover, reforestation projects have other benefits: reforested areas serve as a natural filter of agricultural fertilizers even as new wildlife habitats are created. Reforested land can also contribute to the local economy as rural landowners also <b>distribute</b> <b>hunting</b> leases during the years between harvests.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} social unit was the clan. Clans organized <b>hunts,</b> <b>distributed</b> lands, arranged marriages, and punished lawbreakers. The {{authority of the}} micos was complemented by the clan mothers, mostly women elders. The Muscogee had a matrilineal kinship system, with children considered born into their mother's clan, and inheritance was through the maternal line. The Wind Clan {{is the first of}} the clans. The majority of micos have belonged to this clan.|$|R
2500|$|In Russia, government-backed wolf exterminations {{have been}} largely {{discontinued}} {{since the fall of}} the Soviet Union. As a result, their numbers have stabilized and are increasing, though they are still hunted legally. According to Alexander Tikhonov, head of the Department of Hunting Resources [...] "the more wolves you have, the more problems there are". His department currently licenses a national bag limit of up to 14,000 wolves annually, with permits given to hunt even within nature reserves. Currently, Russia is the only nation where poison is legally used to kill wolves. The government licensed a fluorine-acetate-barium compound and <b>distributed</b> it through <b>hunting</b> associations.|$|R
25|$|Wild boars are an {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Americas, and cause problems including outcompeting native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets, and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis, trichinosis, and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, {{it is illegal to}} import, breed, release, possess, sell, <b>distribute,</b> trade, transport, <b>hunt,</b> or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.|$|R
40|$|The chukar (Alectoris chukar, Galliformes) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} game birds as it is widely <b>distributed</b> and <b>hunted</b> over the whole of its range. The aim of this work was to assess the genetic differentiation as well as the possible presence of hybrid specimens in A. chukar populations from Italy, Greece and Cyprus. To provide phylogenetic context, conspecific, allopatric specimens from Israel, Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mongolia, China and USA were compared. Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Control Region supplied information on the ancestry of A. chukar populations, whereas Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting was used to assess whether hybridization had occurred. The Italian population was found to be an inter-specific mixture of A. chukar and A. rufa (i. e., the red-legged partridge) mtDNA lineages, whereas the representatives from Greece and Cyprus showed only the A. chukar maternal line. RAPD markers revealed introgression with A. rufa genes in the Italian population, whereas no A. chukar · A. rufa hybrid specimens were detected in the eastern Mediterranean populations. The genetic data obtained from the Italian A. chukar population as well as from a few Greek specimens pointed against their Mediterranean kinship, suggesting relationships with A. chukar subspecies from the easternmost part of the Asian continent...|$|R
40|$|PASION is a European project {{aimed at}} {{supporting}} mediated interaction of large networks {{of people and}} augmenting their communication with the provision of group presence cues. These cues consist of indices of the group’s activity, self-reported data and physiological information that {{will be presented to}} players, and they will improve the group presence. This is the main contribution of PASION. In this paper we present a first applications developer prototype and the first hunting game created with it, Bluenet. Bluenet supports a collaborative activity, treasure <b>hunting,</b> <b>distributed</b> across the large space of a city and mediated by mobile phones (later PDAs, etc.). As such it can be used for applications in which group cooperation must be improved, with the additional advantage of making the degree of cooperation immediately visible as feedback during the game...|$|R
40|$|The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, is Africa’s {{most widely}} <b>distributed</b> and {{commonly}} <b>hunted</b> fruit bat, often living {{in close proximity}} to human populations. This species has been identified as a reservoir of potentially zoonotic viruses, but uncertainties remain regarding viral transmission dynamics and mechanisms of persistence. Here we combine genetic and serological analyses of populations across Africa, {{to determine the extent of}} epidemiological connectivity among E. helvum populations. Multiple markers reveal panmixia across the continental range, at a greater geographical scale than previously recorded for any other mammal, whereas populations on remote islands were genetically distinct. Multiple serological assays reveal antibodies to henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus in all locations, including small isolated island populations, indicating that factors other than population size and connectivity may be responsible for viral persistence. Our findings have potentially important public health implications, and highlight a need to avoid disturbances that may precipitate viral spillover...|$|R
5000|$|When hunting small monkeys {{such as the}} red colobus, the {{chimpanzee}} hunts {{where the}} forest canopy is interrupted or irregular. This allows it to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team, {{so that they can}} corner their prey even in a continuous canopy. During an arboreal hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. [...] "Drivers" [...] serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. [...] "Blockers" [...] are stationed {{at the bottom of the}} trees and climb up to block prey that take off in a different direction. [...] "Chasers" [...] move quickly and try to make a catch. Finally, [...] "ambushers" [...] hide and rush out when a monkey nears. While both adults and infants are taken, adult male black-and-white colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps. In Gombe, the chimpanzee also fears adult female colobus monkeys, and prefers to snatch infants from their mother's bellies without harming the mothers. Male chimps hunt more than females. When caught and killed, the meal is <b>distributed</b> to all <b>hunting</b> party members and even bystanders.|$|R
40|$|NkMaDa {{fills the}} {{honeycombs}} into the bucket. In the meantime, the children collect big leaves and spread {{them on the}} ground so that the honey can be put on them, stays clean and can be <b>distributed</b> among the <b>hunting</b> party. When more pieces of honeycombs fall down, they pick their share, selecting the best parts and sharing with their grandmother. When the children are too close to the tree and suddenly the smoking branches fall down, they are scolded by the elders. Eventually, the bucket comes down the tree, filled with honeycombs. While the children and NkNama are unloading the bucket and spreading the honeycomby on the leaves, the others take a first piece to eat; the rest is being divided and distributed by NkMa. The Bagyeli eat their share immediately and alo give some honey to the DoBeS team. Back in the village, NkNaMa explains what the group has done during the day and how the Baygeli don't get lost in the forest: they follow their belly button which points the way. Finally, she asks the team to bring lots of food item the next time they come, including fish, onions, rice, oil and shoes. To measure the size of the needed shoes, they cut strings in the length of their feet, with a Bulu woman helping them. Finally, the team says goodbye for the day and gives a monetary gift to the chief...|$|R
