Numerous instances of animal abuse in circuses have been documented such as confining enclosures, lack of regular veterinary care, abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies. Animal trainers have argued that some criticism {{is not based on}} fact, including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> them, that caging is cruel and common, and the harm caused by the use of whips, chains or training implements.|$|E
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> her.|$|E

Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> himself in his stall.

The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round." [...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner {{was surprised to learn}} that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. I think that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> her more than anything." ...|$|E
