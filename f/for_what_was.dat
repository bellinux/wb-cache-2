5|$|After {{winning the}} December elections, the Fraser {{government}} took {{the approach that}} trade with Southeast Asia and political ties with Southeast Asia were {{too important to be}} put at risk <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> seen as a lost cause. Australia abstained from the 1976 and 1977 UN General Assembly Resolutions, and by 1978 became the only government to officially recognise East Timor as a province of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the debt}} markets were {{improving}} and KKR {{had moved on}} from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund. However, KKR was still burdened by {{the performance of the}} RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).|$|E
5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship {{for any number of}} reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was,</b> at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E

After two games, both victories, McMillin underwent surgery <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> thought to be stomach ulcers. The findings were far worse: stomach cancer, which ended his coaching career. On March 31, 1952 (exactly 21 years {{after the death of}} Knute Rockne), McMillin died of a heart attack; his funeral was attended by many fellow coaches and former players.|$|E
5|$|In {{relations}} with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, Gillard represented Australia at the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in London in April 2011 and hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth in October of that year. The Perth CHOGM saw the historic announcement, by Gillard and British Prime Minister David Cameron, of changes to the succession laws regarding to thrones of the Commonwealth realms, overturning rules privileging male over female heirs {{to the line of}} succession and removing a ban on Roman Catholic consorts. At the CHOGM, Gillard also hosted Queen Elizabeth II, <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> suggested to be the Monarch's final visit to Australia, due to her age.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Arthur Miller Boyd (11 November 1923 − 14 February 2008) was an English {{professional}} footballer who played 333 matches in the Football League in the 1940s and 1950s. After {{serving in the}} Royal Navy during the Second World War, Boyd signed for Second Division club Plymouth Argyle, where he spent two seasons playing as an inside forward. When he began playing as a wing half, a position {{to which he was}} better suited, he attracted attention, and soon secured a transfer to the First Division with Birmingham City <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> for Plymouth a record fee.|$|E

Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken".|$|R

5|$|Major-General Sir Isaac Brock KB (6 October 1769– 13 October 1812) was a British Army {{officer and}} colonial {{administrator}} from Guernsey. Brock {{was assigned to}} Lower Canada in 1802. Despite facing desertions and near-mutinies, he commanded his regiment in Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) successfully for many years. He was promoted to major general, and became responsible for defending Upper Canada against the United States. While many in Canada and Britain believed war could be averted, Brock began to ready the army and militia <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to come. When the War of 1812 broke out, the populace was prepared, and quick victories at Fort Mackinac and Detroit defeated American invasion efforts.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to become the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of}} the warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu had already lost the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E
5|$|On April 7, 2004, federal {{officials}} held a groundbreaking {{ceremony at the}} site <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> estimated to be a $70 million project. The site on East Eighth Avenue and Ferry Street formerly housed an Agripac cannery and is situated along the Willamette River. Local developers and officials hoped the courthouse and a potential new hospital in that area of town would spur further development and revitalize the area. In July 2004, construction began with site preparation including digging out a hole for underground parking. At that time the project {{was expected to be}} completed in August 2006.|$|E

5|$|Overcrowding and {{shortages}} of equipment in England {{meant that it}} was decided to keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter, during which time they would undertake further training in order to prepare them for their eventual use in the trenches in France. Despite this, however, the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received in this time could only be considered very rudimentary in nature, and despite popular opinion at the time, it did little to prepare them <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to come.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was {{the main reason for}} Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E

5|$|The quickest {{score in}} NFL history {{occurred}} on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a safety {{on the opening}} kickoff three seconds into the game.

The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.|$|E
5|$|Walsh was criticised in {{the press}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> seen as his {{excessive}} remuneration, but received admiration {{for his ability to}} build brands.

5|$|After Washington's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, {{and the city}} {{prepared}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> seen as an inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train {{to the town of}} Bethlehem. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, now Allentown, where it waited out the British occupation of Philadelphia under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.|$|E
