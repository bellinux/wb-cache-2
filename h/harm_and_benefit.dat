5000|$|Indeterminacy was {{discussed}} {{in one of}} Jacques Derrida's early works Plato's Pharmacy (1969), a reading of Plato's Phaedrus and Phaedo. Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between Socrates and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech. [...] Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point. As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment. Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a pharmakon for the Egyptian people. The Greek word pharmakon poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison. In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing {{to be a bad}} thing for the Egyptian people. The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided. The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.|$|E

40|$|A Simplified Conjoint Expected Risk (SCER: Holtgrave and Weber, 1993) model-based {{approach}} {{was used to}} explore differences in the perceived risk {{of a variety of}} financial and health activities among Caucasians, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Taiwanese-Americans. The SCER model postulates that the perceived risk of an activity is a function of five dimensions: the subjective probability of harm, benefit, and status quo, and the subjective expected <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> This model offers a framework in which to apply qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to identify and to assess the generality of ethnic group differences in the relative weight attached to probability and expected outcome information, the subjective valuation of probabilities and expected outcomes, and the perceived harms and benefits. Results demonstrated that the primary and most generalised locus of ethnic group perceived risk differences is the relative importance attached to probability and expected outcome information. As predicted, these differences tended to mirror ethnic group differences in orientation toward uncertainty. By decomposing differences in terms of the elements of the SCER model, these results demonstrate that risk communication and policy efforts in ethnically diverse countries should recognise the role of the relative weight attached to the likelihood and magnitude of <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> in risk perception. Clarifying the bases for differences in perceived risk among ethnic groups may provide a better understanding of conflict over environmental or other issues and aid in the development of effective strategies for communicating about risk and negotiating solutions to important policy problems. ...|$|E

40|$|The Delphi {{methodology}} {{was used}} to explore the underlying ethics of nonsexual dual relationship. The goal was to clarify the definitions of appropriate and inappropriate dual relationships, to generate a list that {{experts in the field}} endorse as <b>harms</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> from nonsexual dual relationships, and to generate a list that experts in the field endorse as causes of <b>harms</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> from nonsexual dual relationships. These three goals are in response to three obstacles to consensus in the debate on the ethics of nonsexual dual relationships. Clarifying the definition of dual relationship, the <b>harms</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of dual relationships, and the causes of these <b>harms</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> will shift the debate towards discussing the underlying ethical issues of nonsexual dual relationships and developing guidelines to assist therapists faced with negotiating dual relationships. This study makes use of Role Theory as a framework for developing guidelines for therapists. Three open-ended questions were posed in Delphi I to invited panelists. Delphi II consisted of follow-up phone or email contact requesting clarification of Delphi I responses. Delphi III asked 29 panelists to rank items generated from Delphi I and II on a seven-point Likert scale. The researcher compiled a final profile of items from the responses to Delphi III based on median scores and interquartile ranges. The panel agreed on far more definitions of inappropriate dual relationships than appropriate dual relationships. There were no items of agreement for benefits or causes of benefits from dual relationships. The term dual relationship carries a negative connotation affecting how panelists responded to the study. The underlying ethics of dual relationships are related to how therapists understand the role of the therapist {{and the nature of the}} therapeutic relationship. Directions for future research as well as implications for training therapists and writing the code of ethics are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{increasingly}} prevalent {{in patients with}} chronic systolic heart failure. Therefore, evidence-based therapies {{are more and more}} being used in patients with some degree of renal dysfunction. However, most pivotal randomized clinical trials specifically excluded patients with (severe) renal dysfunction. The benefit of these evidence-based therapies in this high-risk patient group is largely unknown. This paper reviews data from randomized clinical trials in systolic heart failure and the interactions between baseline renal dysfunction and the effect of randomized treatment. It highlights that most evidence-based therapies show consistent outcome benefit in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (stage 3 CKD), whereas there are very scarce data on patients with severe (stage 4 to 5 CKD) renal insufficiency. If any, the outcome benefit might be even greater in stage 3 CKD compared with those with relatively preserved renal function. However, prescription of therapies should be individualized with consideration of possible <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit,</b> especially in those with stage 4 to 5 CKD where limited data are available.

An economic analysis further discusses the findings in a trade-off between the extra costs of treating relapses and failures and the savings in future treatment costs. In complex emergencies, if a TB programme could offer 4 -month treatment for 75 % of its patients, it could still be considered beneficial in terms of public health. In addition, the proportion of patients following at least 4 months of treatment can be used as an indicator to help evaluate the public health <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> of the TB programme...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an article-based PhD. Against the {{backdrop}} of the almost universal acceptance of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the scholarly works comprising the ânew social studies of childhoodâ, the thesis reflects on a core ethical dilemma facing social scientists today. It explores how researchers can navigate the dichotomy between protecting children and young people from harm and respecting their competence and autonomy as individual beings to participate in research of relevance to their lives. The study is exploratory in nature, utilising primarily reflective strategies of inquiry to: reflect on participation and protection discourses and their influence on children and young peopleâs involvement in research; examine a researcherâs ethical duties and rights-based responsibilities; and explore solution focused strategies to support researchers to navigate the balance between protection and participation. The main body of the thesis comprises three publications. The first publication, referred to as paper one, reflects on a qualitative study with young carers in the Irish population. The paper reflects on the participation and protection discourses at play when seeking to access a representative sample of young carers. The success and limitations of the approaches adopted when obtaining parental consent and imposing limits on confidentiality are evaluated. The second publication, referred to as paper two, provides a more in-depth understanding of a researcherâs ethical duty to obtain parental consent. Drawing on the literature and a critical review of ethical frameworks, it explores how researchers can negotiate this ethical standard in the interests of involving young people in research when parental consent is not feasible or appropriate {{due to the nature of}} the study or the young participants involved. The third publication, referred to as paper three, argues that central to achieving a balance between participation and protection is the researcherâs ethical duty to conduct a rigorous and balanced assessment of <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> Reflecting on the authorâs experience of conducting an assessment of <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit,</b> during the course of a baseline study on children and young peopleâs participation in social care services and a youth-led research project on mental health awareness, the paper presents a strategy for conducting such an assessment. The thesis concludes by integrating the learning across the three publications. It distils key messages for ethical oversight bodies and the research and academic community...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Screening {{tests are}} often {{introduced}} into clinical practice without proper evaluation, despite the increasing awareness that screening is {{a double-edged sword}} {{that can lead to}} either net benefits or harms. Our objective was to develop a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of new screening strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Elaborating on the existing concepts proposed by experts, a stepwise framework is proposed to evaluate whether a potential screening test can be introduced as a screening strategy into clinical practice. The principle of screening strategy evaluation is illustrated for cervical cancer, which is a template for screening because of the existence of an easily detectable and treatable precursor lesion. RESULTS: The evaluation procedure consists of six consecutive steps. In steps 1 - 4, the technical accuracy, place of the test in the screening pathway, diagnostic accuracy, and longitudinal sensitivity and specificity of the screening test are assessed. In steps 5 and 6, the impact of the screening strategy on the patient and population levels, respectively, is evaluated. The framework incorporates a <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> trade-off and cost-effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSION: Our framework provides an outline toward the proper evaluation of potential screening strategies before considering implementation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} simple system to assess benefit and harm of {{treatment}} {{on a single}} scale. <b>Harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> signals from trials need {{to be placed in}} the proper perspective to decide on the value of a treatment. Several systems have been developed for assessment, but few attempt to incorporate both benefit and risk in the same metric while retaining enough simplicity to aid patients and clinicians in their decision making. Study Design and Setting: We designed a very simple 3 × 3 table (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology [OMERACT] 3 × 3) that comprises three ranks for both beneficial and harm outcomes: for benefit, these are "none," "substantial," and "(near) remission"; for harm, these are "none," "severe," and "(near) death. " Patients are ranked both for benefit and harm and subsequently counted in a 3 × 3 table. Results: The system was feasible when applied to one trial dataset (patient-level information) and a meta-analysis. To become applicable as a tool, several issues need to be resolved in further development, especially the definitions and cutoffs for the ranks. Conclusion: A simple 3 × 3 table to rank both benefit and harm outcomes is feasible. For rheumatology this will be further developed {{in the context of the}} OMERACT initiative...|$|E

It {{has been conducted}} to feed into a wider independent consultation on the commercial world and children’s wellbeing being conducted by Professor David Buckingham. The report provides a comprehensive account of the literature, combining research from several relevant and divergent disciplines. It addresses a very complex and controversial issue, and seeks not to advocate one point of view over another, but to carefully consider the evidence to bring us {{to a better understanding}} of how commercial messages may both <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> our children. The focus on effects, uses and interpretations is important, as we move away from the arguably simplistic notion of the child as passive recipient to a more sophisticated perception of children as active negotiators of message meanings. Because the scope of the review is so wide ranging, it aims to provide a broad overview of key findings in each of the relevant areas rather than a detailed appraisal of individual studies. Although the growth of new media and divergence of traditional media potentially mean that children are exposed to far more commercial messages, the majority of published research concerns television advertising.

40|$|Changes in {{the scope}} of health {{research}} in the last 50 years require evidence to support assumptions about what constitutes <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> to research participants. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the actual benefits and harm individuals experienced while participating in potentially distressing qualitative research. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and subjected to thematic analysis. Five themes emerged: (i) motivation to participate, (ii) expectations of participation, (iii) sources of harm, (iv) mitigating harm and (v) benefits of participation. Results indicated that all participants benefited through participation in the qualitative research. Most participants also reported varying degrees of distress during the interviews, but did not consider this harmful. In contrast, dissemination of the findings did constitute an unexpected source of potential harm for the participants and researcher. It is concluded that for these participants, distress during qualitative interviewing is not in itself harmful, and that participant information sheets need to reflect the harms and benefits of participation more accurately in a user-friendly format. Furthermore, the sensitivity with which research is disseminated needs to be considered as a fundamental protection for participants from unwarranted criticism by third parties. Recommendations include that researchers conducting interviews have specific personal and professional attributes relevant to the participant group, and that transcripts/raw data should not be sent automatically to participants...|$|E
40|$|Suppose Owner {{can improve}} his {{property}} {{at a cost}} of 15, thereby creating benefits of 10 for himself and 10 for his Neighbors. Since each Neighbor expects to reap the benefits regardless of whether she pays Owner or not for this enhancement, all Neighbors may refuse to share the burden and the welfare enhancing activity will not take place. This paper advocates correcting this failure by recognizing an Expanded Duty of Restitution (“EDR”) that obligates recipients of benefits, under certain, well-defined conditions, to compensate benefactors for unrequested benefits voluntarily conferred upon them. Part I of the paper compares the law’s approach to harm cases with its treatment of benefit cases and offers a novel explanation as to why injurers are commonly allowed to create risks and internalize the resulting harms, while benefactors are not entitled to internalize the unrequested benefits they create. This explanation derives from the different types of obstacles that may preclude reaching agreements between injurers and victims, on the one side, and between benefactors and recipients of benefits on the other. By elucidating the differences between <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> cases, and notwithstanding the explanation offered in Part I, the paper proceeds in Part II to advocate recognition of an Expanded Duty of Restitution. Here, the framework of the duty is outlined, and a wide range of examples is presented to illustrate in which cases such a duty would be warranted...|$|E

This review of international literature, drawn from the authors′ own prior research and searches on relevant databases, synthesises findings on the implications of amenity migration for the creation and distribution of environmental <b>harms</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits.</b> Further, we critique common framings of amenity migration-related environmental transformations and offer suggestions for future research. Analysis is positioned within a review of five common themes reflected in the cases we consider: land subdivision and residential development; changes in private land use; cross-boundary effects; effects on local governance institutions; and displacement of impacts. Within each of these themes, we discuss the uneven geographies of environmental transformation formed by diverse conceptions of ′nature′, patterns of local management of amenity-driven transformations, and ecological contexts. We conclude that, through both intended and unintended environmental consequences of dominant activities and land uses, amenity migration results in a redistribution of environmental <b>harms</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> at multiple scales, as rural landscapes are (partially and incompletely) re-created {{in line with the}} ideals and expectations of amenity migrant populations...|$|R
