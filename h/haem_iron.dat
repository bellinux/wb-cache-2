50|$|The 3D {{structure}} of Brassica rapa (Turnip) cyt f has been determined. The lumen-side segment of cyt f includes two structural domains: {{a small one}} above a larger one that, in turn, {{is on top of}} the attachment to the membrane domain. The large domain consists of an anti-parallel beta-sandwich and a short haem-binding peptide, which form a three-layer structure. The small domain is inserted between beta-strands F and G of the large domain and is an all-beta domain. The haem nestles between two short helices at the N terminus of cyt f. Within the second helix is the sequence motif for the c-type cytochromes, CxxCH (residues 21-25), which is covalently attached to the haem through thioether bonds to Cys-21 and Cys-24. His-25 is the fifth <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> ligand. The sixth <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> ligand is the alpha-amino group of Tyr-1 in the first helix.

Subunit II probably binds one of the copper ions (CuA) whilst subunit I is likely to bind the two haems (a and a 3) and the other redox-active copper (CuB). Two cysteine and two histidine residues of subunit II are the likely ligands of CuA, forming a centre that may be structurally similar to that in azurin. The two haems may be sandwiched between two transmembranous segments of subunit I, one of which also provides a histidine ligand to CuB. A third segment may provide two more histidine ligands to the latter. The model was constructed with a 4 A Fe-Cu distance in the binuclear haem a 3 -CuB centre, and a 14 A distance between the <b>haem</b> <b>irons.</b> The subunit I model involves only three transmembranous helices which bind three catalytic metal groups.

These proteins are generally thought to catalyse electron transport between the quinone/quinol pool and periplasmic oxidoreductases. The best-characterized members, the tetrahaem c-type cytochromes NrfH and NapC, mediate electron transport to NrfA and NapA respectively. Amino acid sequence alignments suggest that the nature and position of distal <b>haem</b> c <b>iron</b> ligands differs in NrfH and NapC proteins. Site-directed modification of potential haem c iron-ligating histidine, lysine and methionine residues in Wolinella succinogenes NrfH was performed to determine the implication in electron transport from formate to nitrite. Two histidine, one lysine and one methionine residues were found to be essential, whereas the replacement of three other conserved histidine residues, one methionine and two lysines did not prevent growth by nitrite respiration. The results contrast those previously obtained for Paracoccus pantotrophus NapC, in which four essential histidine residues have been identified that are highly likely to serve as distal <b>haem</b> c <b>iron</b> ligands.

We have purified a small, acidic, low-potential tetrahaem cytochrome with similarities to the cytochromes c(3) from sulphate-reducing bacteria. The N-terminal sequence was used to design PCR primers and the cctA gene encoding cytochrome c(3) was isolated and sequenced. The EPR spectrum of purified cytochrome c(3) indicates that all four <b>haem</b> <b>irons</b> are ligated by two histidine residues, a conclusion supported by the presence of eight histidine residues in the polypeptide sequence, each of which is conserved in a related cytochrome c(3) and in the cytochrome domains of flavocytochromes c(3).

Design: In a masked, stratified-randomised intervention trial, children received five 156 -g cans of refried black beans per week for 10 consecutive weeks. The beans-only (control), FeSO 4 and <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> groups were offered a cumulative dose of 155 mg, 1625 mg and 1700 mg of iron from the bean intervention, respectively. Haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin concentrations were determined at baseline and after 5 and 10 weeks. Compliance was examined weekly. Setting: A low-income community in Guatemala City. Subjects: One hundred and ten children aged 12 - 36 months with initial Hb values between 100 and 115 g l(- 1). Results: The cumulative intake of beans was approximately 80 % of that offered, signifying an additional similar to 1300 mg of either haem or inorganic iron in the corresponding treatment groups over 10 weeks. Hb concentrations increased by the order of 7. 3 - 11. 4 g l(- 1) during the intervention, but without significant differences across treatments. Average ferritin concentrations were unaffected by treatment assignment. However, post hoc analysis by subgroups of initial high ferritin and initial low ferritin found the Hb increments after 10 weeks in the <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> group (13. 1 +/- 7. 7 g l(- 1)) to be significantly greater than the respective increases (6. 8 +/- 11. 2 and 6. 4 +/- 8. 5 g l(- 1)) in the inorganic iron and beans-only groups.

Interestingly, together with the switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism in these parasites, there is clear evidence pointing to an increase in their antioxidant defences. As the respiratory chain in mitochondria is a major site of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we propose here that the arrest of respiration constitutes an adaptation to avoid the toxic effects of ROS.

40|$|Haem {{proteins}} are functionally and structurally extremely diverse biomolecules {{and play}} a vital role in aerobic life. They perform a vast range of functions like transport of oxygen and electron transfer, gene regulation, redox-sensing and drug metabolism. This many-sidedness of haem-proteins is due to the extremely versatile chemical properties of the <b>iron</b> in the <b>haem</b> prosthetic group. <b>Iron,</b> or iron in the form of haem, plays a key role in many biological processes and it is an essential nutrient for the majority of living organisms. Despite being one of the most abundant chemical elements, iron is scarcely available under physiological conditions, because of its insolubility and toxicity. Pathogenic bacteria rely on their host as a source of <b>haem</b> and/or <b>iron</b> and a strong link between <b>iron</b> / <b>haem</b> acquisition, virulence factors and pathogenicity exists. Therefore they have evolved a set of specialised haem receptors and carriers to circumvent their iron dependency, often involving the 'stealing' of haem as a source of iron from host's haem-proteins, which in the host is the most abundant and relatively available source of iron. These proteins are both vital and unique to bacteria and so have been considered as possible drug targets. At the beginning of this thesis work, the fascinating cell and molecular biology mechanisms of these novel haem binding proteins were still largely unexplored. In this thesis the cloning, expression, purification of four novel bacterial haem transport proteins for biochemical and biophysical characterisation and structural studies is described: HemS and HemT from Yersinia enterocolitica and Shp and HtsA from Streptococcus pyogenes.

The average daily intake of <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> was significantly lower in the iron depleted group (t = 2. 392, P = 0. 018); there was a tendency towards a lower average daily intake of non-haem iron (t = 1. 724, P = 0. 086) and vitamin C (t = 1. 921, P = 0. 057) for iron depleted children.

Cytochrome P- 450 b was found to have a higher affinity for paracetamol than cytochrome P- 450 c and demonstrated a type I spectral change, whereas in the case of cytochrome P- 450 c a reverse type I spectral change was observed. Proton n. m. r. longitudinal relaxation rate measurements revealed {{that in the case of}} cytochrome P- 450 c, paracetamol was orientated with its phenolic hydroxyl group in closest proximity to the central <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> ion. In the case of cytochrome P- 450 b, the acetylamino group of paracetamol most closely approached the <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> ion...|$|E
40|$|Summary Cytochrome P 450 BM 3 (CYP 102 A 1) from Bacillus megaterium, a {{fatty acid}} hydroxylase, {{is a member}} of a very large {{superfamily}} of monooxygenase enzymes. The available crystal structures of the enzyme show non-productive binding of substrates with their ω-end distant from the iron in a hydrophobic pocket at one side of the active site. We have constructed and characterised mutants in which this pocket is filled by large hydrophobic sidechains replacing alanine at position 82. The mutants having phenylalanine or tryptophan at this position have very much (~ 800 -fold) greater affinity for substrate, with a greater conversion of the <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> to the high-spin state, and similarly increased catalytic efficiency. The enzyme as isolated contains bound palmitate, reflecting this much higher affinity. We have determined the crystal structure of the haem domain of the Ala 82 Phe mutant with bound palmitate; this shows that the substrate is binding differently from the wild-type enzyme but still distant from the <b>haem</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{hypothesis}} that <b>haem</b> <b>iron</b> derived from synovial microbleeding has a proinflammatory {{effect on the}} synovial membrane was tested by adding autologous whole blood and fractions derived from it to a naturally remitting rat air pouch model of allergic inflammation. The induction of such a subcutaneous air pouch produces a cavity lined by mesenchymal cells comparable to the synovial membrane. Autologous whole blood was found to prolong a low grade inflammatory state, this effect being attributable to a red cell component, most probably <b>haem</b> <b>iron.</b> Whole blood {{in the absence of}} an inflammatory stimulus does not have this effect, indicating that the mechanism is one of prolonging or promoting existing allergic inflammation, rather than inducing an inflammatory response. Rheumatoid inflammation is highly variable in its clinical manifestations. At one extreme it is a self limiting, non-destructive state, at the other a pro-gressive locally invasive inflammatory condition. The histological appearance of the synovial mem...|$|E

While at the colour brightness L* measuring 24 h post mortem 90 % of the animals corresponded to the quality requirements at intact muscles the same samples of minced meat measuring 25 h post mortem presented {{a lower level of}} colour brightness L* predominantly. The haem pigment as well as the iron content (n = 104) showed means average values (1, 06 mg/g resp. 4, 18 mg/kg) which were too low in comparison with bibliographical references. The reflection at 525 nm was correlated with R = 0. 7 to the extractive determined haem pigment content...|$|R
40|$|Impaired {{wound healing}} {{can lead to}} scarring, and aesthetical and {{functional}} problems. The cytoprotective haem oxygenase (HO) enzymes degrade <b>haem</b> into <b>iron,</b> biliverdin and carbon monoxide. HO- 1 deficient mice suffer from chronic inflammatory stress and delayed cutaneous wound healing, while corneal wound healing in HO- 2 deficient mice is impaired with exorbitant inflammation and absence of HO- 1 expression. This study addresses the role of HO- 2 in cutaneous excisional wound healing using HO- 2 knockout (KO) mice. Here, we show that HO- 2 deficiency also delays cutaneous wound closure compared to WT controls. In addition, we detected reduced collagen deposition and vessel density in the wounds of HO- 2 KO mice compared to WT controls. Surprisingly, wound closure in HO- 2 KO mice was accompanied by an inflammatory response comparable to WT mice. HO- 1 induction in HO- 2 deficient skin was also similar to WT controls and may explain this protection against exaggerated cutaneous inflammation but not the delayed wound closure. Proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation were similar in both two genotypes. Next, we screened for candidate genes to explain the observed delayed wound closure, and detected delayed gene and protein expression profiles of the chemokine (C-X-C) ligand- 11 (CXCL- 11) in wounds of HO- 2 KO mice. Abnormal regulation of CXCL- 11 {{has been linked to}} delayed wound healing and disturbed angiogenesis. However, whether aberrant CXCL- 11 expression in HO- 2 KO mice is caused by or is causing delayed wound healing needs to be further investigated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The chronic microcytic anaemia of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) occurs {{despite the presence}} of adequate reticulo-endothelial iron stores. The red cell microcytosis is evidence of impaired haemoglobin production. This study has examined possible abnormalities of erythroid haem biosynthesis that may contribute to the anaemia. METHODS [...] 5 -Aminolaevulinate (ALA) synthase and ferrochelatase activities were assayed in whole bone marrow and in purified erythroblasts from patients with RA and in control subjects. All patients were iron replete with demonstrable iron in the bone marrow. RESULTS [...] ALA synthase activity was significantly reduced in both whole bone marrow and purified erythroblasts from patients with the anaemia of RA. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels were raised in nine of 12 patients tested while ferrochelatase activity was normal. CONCLUSION [...] These abnormalities provide absolute evidence of abnormal erythroblast <b>haem</b> biosynthesis and <b>iron</b> metabolism in the anaemia of RA and most likely reflect decreased ALA synthase mRNA translation and some abnormality of erythroblast iron transport. Further studies using highly purified erythroblast populations will attempt to identify the causal factors leading to this abnormal erythroblast metabolism...|$|R
