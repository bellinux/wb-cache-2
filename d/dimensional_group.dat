5000|$|If {{the even}} lattice [...] is {{generated}} by its [...] "root vectors" [...] (those satisfying (α,α)=2), and any two root vectors are joined by a chain of root vectors with consecutive inner products non-zero then the vertex operator algebra is the unique simple quotient of the vacuum module of the affine Kac-Moody algebra of the corresponding simply laced simple Lie algebra at level one. This {{is known as the}} Frenkel-Kac (or Frenkel - Kac - Segal) construction, and is based on the earlier construction by Sergio Fubini and Gabriele Veneziano of the tachyonic vertex operator in the dual resonance model. Among other features, the zero modes of the vertex operators corresponding to root vectors give a construction of the underlying simple Lie algebra, related to a presentation originally due to Jacques Tits. In particular, one obtains a construction of all ADE type Lie groups directly from their root lattices.
