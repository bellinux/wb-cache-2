However, more complex tools require multiple steps from the programmed robot. For instance, some complex tools can have multiple conventional side pulls that mate with the core to add rigidity to the core and reduce the core mass. After the core is loaded and the press closed the plastic is shot.|$|E

500|$|According to Judith B. Rosenfeld of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, Naylor {{makes the}} {{statement}} that children raised in healthy families make ethical choices and ultimately thrive. In a 1994 interview Naylor said: [...] Naylor believes {{that there is much}} [...] "gray area between right and wrong". Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of The Times-Picayune believed that the book's main moral is that [...] "nothing <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> it seems". Entertainment Weekly Michele Landsberg praised the novel, writing that Shiloh is a [...] "strongly persuasive story of moral growth, told without a hint of moralizing and with acute insight into a preadolescent's inner life".|$|E
500|$|Its plot {{received}} mixed reviews. GameTrailers {{said that}} God of War IIIs storyline makes Greek mythology more interesting. GameFront's Phil Hornshaw {{said it had}} an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. According to Donlan, the story <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> it can get. McShea said that although it does not pick up until near the end, it [...] "becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways, peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale." [...] Juba, on the other hand, considered that the plot [...] "doesn't have any standout revelations or developments".|$|E

500|$|The redshifts {{of galaxies}} include both a {{component}} related to recessional velocity from {{expansion of the}} Universe, and a component related to peculiar motion (Doppler shift). The redshift due to expansion of the Universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe {{the expansion of the}} Universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity. Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said, [...] "Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> that..." [...] Steven Weinberg clarified, [...] "The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of [...] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of [...] in the whole period from emission to absorption." ...|$|E

To answer a question, one often repeats the verb of action that was used in the question to indicate that that action was or will be completed.

2500|$|Behavior-based {{treatment}} options {{can be useful}} for developmentally disabled and mentally ill individuals with pica. These may involve using positive reinforcement normal behavior. Many use aversion therapy, where the patient learns through positive reinforcement which foods are good and which ones they should not eat. Often treatment {{is similar to the}} treatment of obsessive compulsive or addictive disorders (such as exposure therapy). In some cases treatment <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> addressing the fact they have this disorder and why they may have it.

And {{the only}} answer {{to be given to}} this manager who came out, {{impatient}} and indignant, from behind the plate- glass windows of his shop to be discovered by this inquiry, and to tell us that he, they, the whole three million (or thirty million, for all I know) capital Organisation for selling passages has considered the problem of boats--{{the only answer}} to give him is: {{that this is not a}} problem of boats at all. It is the problem of decent behaviour. If you can't carry or handle so many boats, then don't cram quite so many people on board. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> that--this problem of right feeling and right conduct, the real nature of which seems beyond the comprehension of ticket-providers. Don't sell so many tickets, my virtuous dignitary. After all, men and women (unless considered from a purely commercial point of view) are not exactly the cattle of the Western-ocean trade, that used some twenty years ago to be thrown overboard on an emergency and left to swim round and round before they sank. If you can't get more boats, then sell less tickets. Don't drown so many people on the finest, calmest night that was ever known in the North Atlantic--even if you have provided them with a little music to get drowned by. Sell less tickets! That's the solution of the problem, your Mercantile Highness.|$|E
6000|$|The clue to {{all this}} tangle <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> it is terrible. If England is an aristocracy, England is dying. If this system IS the country, as some say, the country is {{stiffening}} into more than the pomp and paralysis of China. It is the final sign of imbecility in a people that it calls cats dogs and describes the sun as the moon&mdash;and is very particular about the preciseness of these pseudonyms. To be wrong, and to be carefully wrong, that {{is the definition of}} decadence. The disease called aphasia, in which people begin by saying tea when they mean coffee, commonly ends in their silence. Silence of this stiff sort is the chief mark of the powerful parts of modern society. They all seem straining to keep things in rather than to let things out. For the kings of finance speechlessness is counted a way of being strong, though it should rather be counted a way of being sly. By this time the Parliament does not parley any more than the Speaker speaks. Even the newspaper editors and proprietors are more despotic and dangerous by what they do not utter than by what they do. We have all heard the expression [...] "golden silence." [...] The expression [...] "brazen silence" [...] is the only adequate phrase for our editors. If we wake out of this throttled, gaping, and wordless nightmare, we must awake with a yell. The Revolution that releases England from the fixed falsity of its present position will be not less noisy than other revolutions. It will contain, I fear, a great deal of that rude accomplishment described among little boys as [...] "calling names"; but that will not matter much so long as they are the right names.|$|E
