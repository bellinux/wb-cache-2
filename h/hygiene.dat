5|$|Practice {{of sleep}} <b>hygiene</b> and {{knowledge}} of sleep <b>hygiene</b> practices can be assessed with measures such as the Sleep <b>Hygiene</b> Index, Sleep <b>Hygiene</b> Awareness and Practice Scale, or the Sleep <b>Hygiene</b> Self-Test. For younger individuals, sleep <b>hygiene</b> can be assessed by the Adolescent Sleep <b>Hygiene</b> Scale or the Children's Sleep <b>Hygiene</b> Scale.|$|E
5|$|As {{attention}} {{to the role of}} sleep <b>hygiene</b> in promoting public health has grown, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep <b>hygiene</b> resources, such as tips for sleep <b>hygiene,</b> instructional videos, sleep <b>hygiene</b> self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep <b>hygiene,</b> and tools to find sleep professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep <b>hygiene</b> awareness.|$|E
5|$|Sleep <b>hygiene</b> is {{a central}} {{component}} of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Sleep <b>hygiene</b> recommendations {{have been shown to}} reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific sleep disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} {{inconclusive}} evidence that sleep <b>hygiene</b> alone is {{effective as a}} treatment for insomnia, some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep <b>hygiene</b> education in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy practices.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor <b>hygiene,</b> as is improvement of <b>hygiene</b> generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep <b>hygiene</b> and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep <b>hygiene</b> education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep <b>hygiene,</b> such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep <b>hygiene</b> education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Amdur was {{inducted}} {{as a member}} of Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health. In 1974, she received the Donald E. Cummings Memorial Award from the American Industrial <b>Hygiene</b> Association in recognition of her lifetime contributions and application of her knowledge in the field. The American Academy of Industrial <b>Hygiene</b> Council awarded her the Henry F. Smyth Jr. Award in 1984 for identifying and fulfilling research needs within the industrial <b>hygiene</b> profession. In 1986 she received the Inhalation Section of the Career Achievement Award from the Society of Toxicology. She received the Herbert E. Stockinger Award from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in 1989 In 1988 she gained, the Mid-Atlantic Section, Society of Toxicology Ambassador Award. Then in 1997, she was awarded the Merit Award from the same society, in celebration of her achievements throughout her life and her contributions to Toxicology.|$|E
5|$|In her will, she {{specified}} bequests to the Open Door International for the Economic Emancipation of the Woman Worker, {{and to the}} Association for Moral and Social <b>Hygiene.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of <b>hygiene</b> {{was created to}} prevent infection or food spoiling by eliminating microbes, especially bacteria, from the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|There is support showing {{positive}} sleep {{outcomes for}} people who follow more than one sleep <b>hygiene</b> recommendation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile <b>hygiene</b> easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the <b>hygiene</b> hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The <b>hygiene</b> hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The <b>hygiene</b> hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Sleep <b>hygiene</b> {{strategies}} include {{advice about}} timing {{of sleep and}} food intake in relationship to exercise and sleeping environment. Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation; counselling {{is presented as a}} form of patient education.|$|E
5|$|Some establishments allow or {{encourage}} sex {{in specific}} group sex areas. In some jurisdictions such activity is prohibited, and sex must {{be confined to}} private rooms. Some forbid sex in pools for <b>hygiene</b> reasons. In the United Kingdom, the requirement is often set by the local authority's Environmental Health department.|$|E
5|$|Specific sleep <b>hygiene</b> {{recommendations}} {{have changed}} over time. For example, advice to simply avoid sleeping pills was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced, recommendations concerning their use have become more complex.|$|E
5|$|The Canning Reservoir, Canning River and tributaries are {{illegally}} fished for marron, {{especially during}} summer. Boating, fishing and swimming are prohibited in the reservoir {{for health and}} <b>hygiene</b> reasons. Unauthorised camping (including overnight stays and/or outside of designated areas) and unauthorised trail establishment occur more and more frequently in the Canning catchment.|$|E
5|$|The San Antonio Express {{reported}} in 1939 that the funds {{granted to the}} Hogg Foundation for Mental Health {{would be used to}} establish mental <b>hygiene</b> clinics and conduct lectures and teacher training courses across Texas, for mental health research, and to survey mental <b>hygiene</b> conditions in Texas. On the entry of the United States into World War II, the Foundation researched methods to prevent mentally unsuitable candidates from enlisting in the military, and provided counseling to those traumatized by the war. After the war, the Foundation expanded its educational and philanthropic focus, providing mental health care to the poor and the aged. The Foundation continues to award five $5,000 annual scholarships to individuals pursuing a Master's degree in Social Work.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral <b>hygiene</b> instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|The vulture's {{head and}} neck are featherless as an {{adaptation}} for <b>hygiene,</b> though there are black bristles on parts of the head; this lack of feathers prevents bacteria from the carrion it eats from ruining its feathers and exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of the sun.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating in}} 1995 with a {{first-class}} honours degree in medicine from Magdalen College, Oxford, Goldacre obtained an MA in philosophy from King's College London, then undertook clinical training at UCL Medical School, qualifying {{as a medical}} doctor in 2000 and as a psychiatrist in 2005. As of 2014 he was Wellcome Research Fellow in Epidemiology at the London School of <b>Hygiene</b> and Tropical Medicine.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015 {{the center}} has 12full-time volunteers: an Arabic teacher, two English {{teachers}}, two French teachers, a translator, a life coach, two <b>hygiene</b> teachers, a psychologist, and two teachers who help the trainees develop conflict-resolution and communication skills. There are also several part-time volunteers, who help in various capacities as needed. The center also employs a social worker with a PhD in clinical psychology, who provides counselling.|$|E
5|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{different}} medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, <b>hygiene</b> problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed {{when they do}} arise. During {{the final stages of}} the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle <b>hygiene</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the <b>hygiene</b> of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for <b>hygiene,</b> sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E
5|$|Education about oral <b>hygiene</b> for {{long-term}} methamphetamine users is sometimes required. Changes in diet are often necessary for recovering drug users that are receiving dental treatment, {{and the use}} of sugar-free gum may be beneficial. The consumption of water and the avoidance of beverages with a diuretic (dehydrating) effect can also help patients with meth mouth.|$|E
5|$|For inbound tourism, Japan {{was ranked}} 16th {{in the world}} in 2015. In 2009, the Yomiuri Shimbun {{published}} a modern list of famous sights under the name Heisei Hyakkei (the Hundred Views of the Heisei period). The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 ranks Japan 4th out of 141 countries overall, which was the best in Asia. Japan gained relatively high scores in almost all aspects, especially health and <b>hygiene,</b> safety and security, cultural resources and business travel.|$|E
5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, {{have been}} implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler. <b>Hygiene</b> is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.|$|E
5|$|Good husbandry, proper feeding, and <b>hygiene</b> are {{the main}} {{contributors}} to animal health on the farm, bringing economic benefits through maximised production. When, despite these precautions, animals still become sick, they are treated with veterinary medicines, by the farmer and the veterinarian. In the European Union, when farmers treat their own animals, {{they are required to}} follow the guidelines for treatment and to record the treatments given.|$|E
5|$|He gave nearly $250 {{million to}} the {{foundation}}, which focused on public health, medical training, and the arts. It endowed Johns Hopkins School of <b>Hygiene</b> and Public Health, {{the first of its}} kind. It also built the Peking Union Medical College in China into a notable institution. The foundation helped in World War I war relief, and it employed William Lyon Mackenzie King of Canada to study industrial relations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hygiene</b> {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of <b>Hygiene</b> and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of <b>Hygiene</b> at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. Airbus says it offers better luggage storage and a quieter cabin, packaged with a more modern look and feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food <b>hygiene,</b> and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|In all, 65,000people were {{affected}} by Tropical Storm Odette. The Dominican Republic Red Cross and Red Crescent deployed 105 volunteers to the impacted areas, primarily {{in the area of}} Monte Cristi. The organization provided food and <b>hygiene</b> kits to thousands of people, as well as mosquito nets. The Red Cross also gave a 5,000liter water tank for the citizens in Monte Cristi, an area without clean water or sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and <b>hygiene,</b> and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
