50|$|The <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> is a {{geodetic}} reference ellipsoid, {{named after}} the US geodesist John Fillmore Hayford (1868-1925), which was introduced in 1910. The <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> was {{also referred to as}} the International ellipsoid 1924 after it had been adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics IUGG in 1924, and was recommended for use all over the world. Many countries retained their previous ellipsoids.|$|E
50|$|An {{ellipsoidal}} model describes {{only the}} ellipsoid's geometry and a normal gravity field formula {{to go with}} it. Commonly an ellipsoidal model {{is part of a}} more encompassing geodetic datum. For example, the older ED-50 (European Datum 1950) is based on the <b>Hayford</b> or International <b>Ellipsoid.</b> WGS-84 is peculiar in that the same name is used for both the complete geodetic reference system and its component ellipsoidal model. Nevertheless, the two concepts—ellipsoidal model and geodetic reference system—remain distinct.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> {{is defined}} by its semi-major axis a = 6,378,388.000 and its {{flattening}} f = 1:297.00. Unlike some of its predecessors, such as the Bessel ellipsoid (a = 6,377,397 m, f = 1:299,15), which was a European ellipsoid, the <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> also included measurements from North America, {{as well as other}} continents (to a lesser extent). It also included isostatic measurements to reduce plumbline divergences. Hayfords ellipsoid did not reach the accuracy of Helmerts ellipsoid published 1906 (a = 6378 200 m Erdabplattung f = 1 : 298.3).|$|E

50|$|Many methods {{exist for}} {{determination}} of the axes of an Earth ellipsoid, ranging from meridian arcs up to modern satellite geodesy or the analysis and interconnection of continental geodetic networks. Amongst the different set of data used in national surveys are several of special importance: the Bessel ellipsoid of 1841, the international <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> of 1924, and (for GPS positioning) the WGS84 ellipsoid.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 about 50% of the European {{triangulation}} {{networks and}} about 20% of other continents networks {{were based on}} the Bessel ellipsoid. In the following decades the American states switched mainly to the <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> 1908 ("internat. Ell. 1924") which was also used for the European unification project ED50 sponsored by the United States after World War II. Russia forced its satellite states in Eastern Europe to use the Krassowski ellipsoid of about 1940.|$|E
50|$|Jordan Transverse Mercator (JTM) is a {{grid system}} {{created by the}} Royal Jordan Geographic Center (RJGC). This system is based on 6° belts with a Central Meridian of 37° East and a Scale Factor at Origin (mo) = 0.9998. The JTM {{is based on the}} <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> adopted by the IUGG in 1924. No {{transformation}} parameters are presently offered by the government. However, Prof. Steven H. Savage of Arizona State University figured out that the JTM has a False Easting of 500 km, a False Northing of -3,000 km, and the three-parameter transformation to WGS84 is: ΔX = -86 meters, ΔY = -98 meters, and ΔZ = -119 meters.|$|E
50|$|The {{ellipsoid}} data {{published by}} Bessel (1841) were then {{the best and}} most modern data mapping the Earth's figure. They were used by almost all national surveys. Some surveys in Asia switched to the Clarke ellipsoid of 1880. After the arrival of the geophysical reduction techniques many projects used other examples such as the <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> of 1910 which was adopted in 1924 by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) as the International ellipsoid 1924. All of them are influenced by geophysical effects like vertical deflection, mean continental density, rock density and the distribution of network data. Every reference ellipsoid deviates from the worldwide data (e.g. of satellite geodesy) {{in the same way as}} the pioneering work of Bessel.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{standard}} {{parameter sets for}} the 7-parameter transformation (or data transformation) between two ellipsoids. For a transformation in the opposite direction, the signs of all the parameters must be changed. The translations cx, cy, cz are sometimes described as tx, ty, tz, or dx, dy, dz. The rotations rx, ry, and rz are sometimes also described as , [...] and [...] In the United Kingdom the prime interest is the transformation between the OSGB36 datum used by the Ordnance survey for Grid References on its Landranger and Explorer maps to the WGS84 implementation used by GPS technology. The Gauss-Krüger coordinate system used in Germany normally refers to the Bessel ellipsoid. A further datum of interest was ED50 (European Datum 1950) based on the <b>Hayford</b> <b>ellipsoid.</b> ED50 {{was part of the}} fundamentals of the NATO coordinates up to the 1980s, and many national coordinate systems of Gauss-Krüger are defined by ED50.|$|E
