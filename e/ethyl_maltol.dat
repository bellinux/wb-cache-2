40|$|WOS: 000295167200002 International audienceProcessing of odor {{mixtures}} by neonates is weakly understood. Previous {{studies showed}} that a binary mixture of <b>ethyl</b> isobutyrate/ethyl <b>maltol</b> (odorants A/B) blends in newborn rabbits at the 30 / 70 ratio: Pups would perceive a configural odor {{in addition to the}} components' odors. Here, we investigated whether the emergence of this additional odor in AB is determined by specific ratio(s) of A and B. To that goal, we tested whether pups discriminated between AB mixtures with lower (A(-) B, 8 / 92 ratio) or higher (A(+) B, 68 / 32) proportion of A. In Experiment 1, pups conditioned to A (or B) responded to A(-) B and A(+) B but not to AB. In Experiment 2, pups responded to A(-) B after learning of A(-) (and to A(+) B after learning of A(+)) but not to AB. In Experiment 3, after conditioning to A(-) B pups responded to A(-) and B (and to A(+) and B after learning of A(+) B) but not or less to AB. In Experiment 4, pups responded to A(-) B and A(+) B after conditioning to AB. These results confirm the configural perception of certain odor mixtures by young organisms and reveal that the proportion of components is a key factor influencing their coding, recognition, and discrimination of complex stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{olfactory}} perception on sweetness was explored {{in a model}} solution using odorants at subthreshold concentra-tions. First, the impact of 6 odorants, previously described in the literature as congruent with sweetness, was investigated at suprathreshold level in a sucrose solution. <b>Ethyl</b> butyrate and <b>maltol</b> were selected as they had the highest and the lowest sweetness-enhancing properties, respectively. Second, the impact on sweetness of the 2 odorants was investigated at subthresh-old concentrations. A system delivering a continuous liquid flow at the same sucrose level, but with varying odorant concen-trations, was used. At a subthreshold level, ethyl butyrate but not maltol significantly enhanced {{the sweetness of the}} sucrose solution. This study highlights that olfactory perception induced by odorants at a subthreshold level can significantly modulate taste perception. Finally, contrary to results observed with ethyl butyrate at suprathreshold levels, at subthreshold levels, the intensity of sweetness enhancement was not proportional to ethyl butyrate concentration...|$|R

Its {{monitoring}} in foods is very important due to the potential harmfulness to human beings if large amounts of this flavor enhancer are ingested. A novel electrochemical method for the determination of <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> in food samples based on the electrochemical catalytic activity of graphene modified glassy carbon electrode is reported in this paper. The sensor exhibited excellent oxidation activity towards <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol.</b> Using 1 mol L- 1 NH 3 ·H 2 O–NH 4 Cl buffer solution (pH 8. 0) as supporting electrolyte, <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> yielded a sensitive oxidation peak on the modified electrode.

Because their safety is undocumented, the toxicity study of <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> and iron complexes was conducted in male and female Kunming (KM) mice. The animal study was designed based on the preliminary study conducted to determine the median lethal dose (LD 50).

40|$|Background: Although {{zinc sulfate}} {{has been used}} to improve {{disorders}} originated from zinc deficiency, its low compliance is due to gastrointestinal complications; therefore, other zinc compounds have been suggested as replacers for zinc deficient people. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the absorption of ethyl and methyl zinc-maltol with that of zinc sulfate to substitute zinc sulfate with those complexes. Materials and Methods: After five weeks of being fed by zinc deficient food, zinc deficient rats were divided into four groups randomly receiving medicinal solutions of zinc sulfate, zinc <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> and zinc methyl maltol using feeding tube method for two weeks while the control was received distilled water. Serum zinc concentration and ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) and LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) activity of rats were determined before and after the study. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11. 5. The study was conducted from 2008 to 2010. Results: Serum zinc concentration and enzyme activity in all groups receiving drug solution increased. The most and least increase were in zinc sulfate and zinc methyl maltol groups, respectively. The difference between zinc methyl maltol and zinc sulfate group was significant (P < 0. 05); however, this difference was not significant in the case of zinc <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol.</b> Conclusion: Zinc <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> can be a suitable and preferable substitute for zinc sulfate...|$|E
40|$|A {{fast and}} {{accurate}} procedure {{has been researched}} and developed for the simultaneous determination of maltol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol,</b> based on their reaction with iron(III) {{in the presence of}} o-phenanthroline in sulfuric acid medium. This reaction was the basis for an indirect kinetic spectrophotometric method, which followed the development of the pink ferroin product (λmax = 524 nm). The kinetic data were collected in the 370 – 900 nm range over 0 – 30 s. The optimized method indicates that individual analytes followed Beer’s law in the concentration range of 4. 0 – 76. 0 mg L− 1 for both maltol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol.</b> The LOD values of 1. 6 mg L− 1 for maltol and 1. 4 mg L− 1 for <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> agree well with those obtained by the alternative high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). Three chemometrics methods, principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS) and principal component analysis–radial basis function–artificial neural networks (PC–RBF–ANN), were used to resolve the measured data with small kinetic differences between the two analytes as reflected by the development of the pink ferroin product. All three performed satisfactorily {{in the case of the}} synthetic verification samples, and in their application for the prediction of the analytes in several food products. The figures of merit for the analytes based on the multivariate models agreed well with those from the alternative HPLC-UV method involving the same samples...|$|E

40|$|Tracking cell {{migration}} in vivo by scintigraphy using cells labelled with gamma-emitting radionuclides (especially indium- 111) is a well-established clinical and research tool. Positron emission tomography offers improved sensitivity and resolution, {{but there are}} no established cell labelling methods using suitable long-lived isotopes. The long half-life positron emitter zirconium- 89 (half-life 78. 4 h) is a strong candidate for cell labelling and cell tracking, and is becoming increasingly available. It has no known biological role or transport mechanisms. The aim of this research was to produce a range of candidate neutral zirconium L 4 lipophilic complexes that could be prepared under radiopharmaceutical conditions and used in cell labelling. This aim was achieved with the ligands; oxine, tropolone and <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol.</b> The resulting complexes can be prepared in high yield from zirconium precursors in hydrochloric or oxalic acid solution. A deferiprone complex was prepared from deferiprone and zirconium tetrachloride, but was found to lack lipophilic properties and {{it was not possible to}} prepare the deferiprone complex under radiopharmaceutical conditions. Analytical techniques such as carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy have been used to characterise the complexes. The oxine and tropolone complexes were the most amenable to chromatographic characterisation and high performance liquid chromatography and instant thin layer chromatography protocols have been established to monitor radiochemical purity.

40|$|Extraction of {{relevant}} information from highly complex environments {{is a prerequisite}} to survival. Within odour mixtures, such information is contained in the odours of specific elements or in the mixture configuration perceived as a whole unique odour. For instance, an AB mixture of the element A (ethyl isobutyrate) and the element B (<b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol)</b> generates a configural AB percept in humans and apparently in another species, the rabbit. Here, we examined whether the memory of such a configuration is distinct from {{the memory of the}} individual odorants. Taking advantage of the newborn rabbit's ability to learn odour mixtures, we combined behavioural and pharmacological tools to specifically eliminate elemental memory of A and B after conditioning to the AB mixture and evaluate consequences on configural memory of AB. The amnesic treatment suppressed responsiveness to A and B but not to AB. Two other experiments confirmed the specific perception and particular memory of the AB mixture. These data demonstrate the existence of configurations in certain odour mixtures and their representation as unique objects: after learning, animals form a configural memory of these mixtures, which coexists with, but is relatively dissociated from, memory of their elements. This capability emerges very early in life...|$|E

Formation of mono-ligand complexes with moderate stability {{was found in the}} case of the hydroxypyrone ligands (<b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> and allomaltol) predominating at the physiological pH range. These complexes decompose to the dinuclear tri-hydroxido bridged species [(Ru-II(eta(6) -p-cymene) h(OH) (3) ](+) and to the metal-free ligand at basic pH values. In addition, formation of a hydroxido [Ru-II(eta(6) -p-cymene) (L) (OH) ] species was found. The hydroxythiopyr(id) one ligands (thiomaltol, thioallomaltol, 3 -hydroxy- 1, 2 -dimethyl-thiopyridone) form complexes of significantly higher stability compared with the hydroxypyrones; their complexes are biologically more active, the simultaneous bi- and monodentate coordination of the ligands in the bis complexes (ML 2 and ML 2 H) was also demonstrated. In the case of thiomaltol, formation of tris complexes is also likely at high pH. The replacement of the chlorido by the aqua ligand in the [Ru-II(eta(6) -p-cymene) (L) (CI) ] species was monitored, which is an important activation step in the course of the mode of action of the complexes, facilitating binding to biological targets...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOrganisms are {{surrounded}} throughout life by chemically complex odors. How individuals process an odorant within a mixture or a mixture {{as a whole}} is a key question in neuroethology and chemical senses. This question is addressed here by using newborn rabbits, which can be rapidly conditioned to a new stimulus by single association with the mammary pheromone. After conditioning to <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> (odorant B), pups behaviorally respond to B and an A'B' mixture (68 / 32 ratio) but not to ethyl isobutyrate (odorant A) or an AB mixture (30 / 70 ratio). This suggests elemental and configural perception of A'B' and AB, respectively. We then explored the neural substrates underlying the processing of these mixtures with the hypothesis that processing varies according to perception. Pups were pseudoconditioned or conditioned to B on postnatal day 3 before exposure to B, A'B' or AB on day 4. Fos expression was not similar between groups (mainly in the olfactory bulb and posterior piriform cortex) suggesting a differential processing of the stimuli that might reflect either stimulus complexity or conditioning effect. Thus, the ratio of components in A'B' vs AB leads to differential activation of the olfactory system which may contribute to elemental and configural percepts of these mixtures. In addition, together with recent behavioral data, this highlights that configural perception occurs even in relatively immature animals, emphasizing the value of the newborn rabbit for exploration of odor mixture processing from molecules to brain and behavior...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElemental and configural {{olfactory}} perception allows {{interaction with the}} environment from very early in life. To evaluate how newborn rabbits can extract and respond to information from the highly complex chemical surroundings, and how experience acts on this sensory, cognitive and behavioural capability, we ran a study in four steps including a total of eight experiments. We mainly used a binary AB mixture comprising ethyl isobutyrate (component A) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> (component B), previously shown as a bearer of blending properties; in rabbit pups (as in human adults), the mixture elicits a weak configural perception, i. e. the perception of a configural odour different from the odours of the components. First, a repeated exposure to one component of AB led to a more elemental perception of this mixture; conversely, a repeated exposure to AB facilitated its configural processing. Second, similar impact of experience did not appear with a non-blending AC mixture (ethyl isobutyrate-guaïacol). Third, repeated exposure to AB impacted not only the perception of AB, but also {{and in the same}} way the perception of the AC mixture sharing one component, and reciprocally. However, facilitation to perceive one mixture in one mode (configural/elemental) was not generalized to a mixture sharing no components with the experienced mixture [AB versus DE (damascenone and vanillin) ]. Thus, experience contributes to the neonatal perception of odour mixtures and adds plasticity to the perceptual system. However, this impact remains dependent on the chemical composition of the mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Interacting {{with the}} mother during the daily nursing, newborn rabbits {{experience}} her body odor cues. In particular, the mammary pheromone (MP) contained in rabbit milk triggers the typical behavior which helps to localize and seize the nipples. It also promotes the very rapid appetitive learning of simple or complex stimuli (odorants or mixtures) through associative conditioning. We previously showed that 24 h after MP-induced conditioning to odorants A (ethyl isobutyrate) or B (<b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol),</b> newborn rabbits perceive the AB mixture in a weak configural way, i. e., they perceive the odor of the AB configuration {{in addition to the}} odors of the elements. Moreover, after conditioning to the mixture, elimination of the memories of A and B does not affect the memory of AB, suggesting independent elemental and configural memories of the mixture. Here, we evaluated whether configural memory persistence differs from elemental one. First, whereas 1 or 3 -day-old pups conditioned to A or B maintained their responsiveness to the conditioned odorant for 4 days, those conditioned to AB did not respond to the mixture after the same retention period. Second, the pups conditioned to AB still responded to A and B 4 days after conditioning, which indicates stronger retention of the elements than of the configuration when all information are learned together. Third, we determined whether the memory of the elements competes with the memory of the configuration: after conditioning to AB, when the memories of A and B were erased using pharmacological treatment, the memory of the mixture was extended to day 5. Thus, newborn rabbits have access to both elemental and configural information in certain odor mixtures, and competition between these distinct representations of the mixture influences the persistence of their memories. Such effects certainly occur in the natural context of mother-pup interactions and may contribute to early acquisition of knowledge about the surroundings...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} of odor {{perception}} is an interaction between odorants and olfactory receptors (ORs) [1]. It is now accepted that the main strategy used by Humans to perceive thousands of odors results from a combinatorial coding [2]. Moreover, odors we perceived in our environment are mainly the result of mixtures of odorants; however, the processes involved remain poorly understood [3]. In previous studies performed in the CSGA of Dijon[4, 5], the perception of a mixture of specific proportions of ethyl isobutyrate (Et-iB, strawberry-like odor) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>maltol</b> (Et-M, caramel-like odor) was investigated in comparison with a reference (allyl hexanoate, Al-H, pineapple-like odor) chosen to evoke an odor close to the one expected in the mixture. The binary specific mixture of Et-iB and Et-M was judged as more typical of a pineapple odor than the individual components, whereas Al-H constitutes a good pineapple odor reference. Assuming that combinations of activated ORs encode odor qualities and that molecules sharing a same odorant quality possess common structural molecular property [6, 7], our assumption was that molecules sharing strawberry, caramel or pineapple odor should also share several common structural characteristics. We used Common Feature Pharmacophore Generation protocol (Discovery Studio 4. 1, Biovia) to generate pharmacophore hypotheses [8]; {{the maximum number of}} generated hypothesis for each run was set to 10. In our study, the pharmacophoric features considered are hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and hydrophobic regions (HY). On the one hand, pharmacophore generation performed with the three molecules allowed to obtain 10 hypotheses, and the best model is made up of 2 HY and 2 HBA. On the other hand, the best models obtained on each molecule (all conformers in a range 0 - 20 kcal/mol) are made up of at least 1 HY and 2 HBA. Side-by-side comparisons of pharmacophores reveal inter-features distance commonalities. By performing three tests by mapping of each molecules pair on the pharmacophore of the third molecule, we obtained good fit values for mapping of Et-M and Al-H on Et-iB model (3. 9 - 2. 3; the smallest values correspond to the mapping of Et-M conformers) and for mapping of Et-iB and Al-H on Et-M model (2. 8 - 2. 5; the smallest values correspond to the mapping of Et-iB conformers). Conversely, none of Et-M conformers and only half of Et-iB conformers map on Al-H model and fit values do not exceed 2. Taken together, these results suggest that a common binding site could exist for the three molecules, and Al-H could also bind on sites of Et-iB and Et-M. This is in good accordance with the schema of combinatorial coding [2], that is to say that each of the odor quality results from activation of a pattern of ORs. The existence of an intersection of these ORs patterns supports the hypothesis that molecules involved in a mixture that elicits an emergent odor, recognize a common set of ORs. References 1.
