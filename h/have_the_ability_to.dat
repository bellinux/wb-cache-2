5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
50|$|Deathwatch is {{a native}} of an alien demonic {{dimension}} and so derived at least some of his superhuman powers from his non-human heritage. Deathwatch <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> absorb life from another creature that is experiencing pain or death and enhance his own health, strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> physically penetrate a victim's body and disrupt internal organs without creating a surface wound. He also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> absorb and access a victim's short-term memories by penetrating the victim's brain physically with his fingers, and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> derive surges of physical and emotional pleasure from the proximity of death.|$|R

5|$|Sharks <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} {{the direction of}} a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril. This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.|$|E
5|$|Some snakes <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{change the}} hue of their scales slowly. This is {{typically}} seen {{in cases where}} the snake becomes lighter or darker with change in season. In some cases, this change may take place between day and night.|$|E
5|$|Spiral arms also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cause climatic {{changes on}} a planet. Passing through the dense {{molecular}} clouds of galactic spiral arms, stellar winds may be pushed {{back to the}} point that a reflective hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet's atmosphere, perhaps leading to a snowball Earth scenario.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The Long Valley to Mono Lake {{region is}} one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey's {{volcanic}} hazards program. These areas are in the program because they have been active in the last 2,000 years and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce explosive eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The pantropical {{subfamily}} Nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers, {{known as}} nasutes, that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> exude noxious liquids through a horn-like frontal projection {{that they use}} for defence. Nasutes have lost their mandibles {{through the course of}} evolution and must be fed by workers. A wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in the liquids that nasutes secrete.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue for}} argue for {{extending}} the conventional distributed objects model in two important ways: (1) <b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> insert injectors (filters, wrappers) into the communication path between components, and (2) <b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> annotate communications with additional information, and to propagate these annotations through an application...|$|R
50|$|Locus <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{teleport}} herself, other people, {{or other}} objects {{she is in}} physical contact with, to anywhere that she, or they, have been before. This makes her different from other teleporters like Nightcrawler who can teleport himself to anywhere in his range he can visualize. She also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> levitate. She <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> select parts of people or objects (say a hand or head), and teleport them away, leaving the rest behind, often with deadly results. She also displayed the power to fire energy blasts.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> search a {{range of}} formats in {{addition}} to range of HTML files. These include PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, images, and XML. It also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> connect to, and index databases. Adapters currently exist for MySQL and TRIM Context, and {{the design of the}} system allows users to create their own connectors should they not exist.|$|R
5|$|Web-spinning {{also caused}} the {{association}} of the spider with creation myths, as they seem to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce their own worlds. Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> predict seizures before they occur.|$|E

50|$|HpaII (IntEnz: EC 3.1.21.4) is a {{restriction}} enzyme {{obtained from the}} microorganism called Haemophilus parainfluenzae. It is a DNA {{restriction enzyme}}, therefore it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cut <b>the</b> DNA from certain region as demonstrated below. It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce cohesive ends, which are rather useful in constructing plasmids.|$|R
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body it results in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform this test.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person view. Players {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's open world, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the islands are unlocked to players as the story progresses.|$|E
50|$|Programmable {{matter is}} matter which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> change its {{physical}} properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing. Programmable matter is thus {{linked to the}} concept of a material which inherently <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform information processing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>abilities</b> {{associated}} with each character vary and include defensive, offensive, and bonus earning powers.
