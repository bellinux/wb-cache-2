While aiming to study spin injection/detection with 1 D <b>edge</b> <b>contacts,</b> a spurious magnetoresistance signal was observed, which {{is found to}} originate from the local Hall effect in graphene due to fringe fields from ferromagnetic <b>edge</b> <b>contacts</b> and {{in the presence of}} charge current spreading in the nonlocal measurement configuration. Such behavior has been confirmed by the absence of a Hanle signal and gate-dependent magnetoresistance measurements that reveal a change in sign of the signal for the electron-and hole-doped regimes, which is in contrast to the expected behavior of the spin signal. Calculations show that the contact-induced fringe fields are typically on the order of hundreds of mT, but can be reduced below 100 mT with careful optimization of the contact geometry. There may be an additional contribution from magnetoresistance effects due to tunneling anisotropy in the contacts, which needs further investigation.

40|$|Graphene is a two {{dimensional}} material which has combination of unique mechanical, electrical and optical properties. Due {{to the unique}} properties of graphene, it has potential for several applications such as radio frequency applications and ultrafast photodetectors. Reducing contact resistance of metal-graphene is important for further improvement of graphene devices and for realization of graphene based electronics. Contact between graphene and metal can be improved by <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> length. <b>Edge</b> <b>contact</b> length improves coupling between metal and graphene; therefore, contact resistance is reduced. <b>Edge</b> <b>contact</b> length can be introduced by generating nanostructures under metal.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{capillary condensation}} transitions occurring in open slits of width L and finite height H {{immersed in a}} reservoir of vapor. In this case the pressure at which condensation occurs is closer to saturation compared to that occurring in an infinite slit (H = ∞) due {{to the presence of}} two menisci that are pinned near the open ends. Using macroscopic arguments, we derive a modified Kelvin equation for the pressure p c c (L; H) at which condensation occurs and show that the two menisci are characterized by an <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> angle θ e that is always larger than the equilibrium contact angle θ, only equal to it in the limit of macroscopic H. For walls that are completely wet (θ = 0) the <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> angle depends only on the aspect ratio of the capillary and is well described by θ e ≈ √ π L / 2 H for large H. Similar results apply for condensation in cylindrical pores of finite length. We test these predictions against numerical results obtained using a microscopic density-functional model where the presence of an <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> angle characterizing the shape of the menisci is clearly visible from the density profiles. Below the wetting temperature T w we find very good agreement for slit pores of widths of just a few tens of molecular diameters, while above T w the modified Kelvin equation only becomes accurate for much larger systems...|$|E

In this dissertation, the effect of tape <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> as well as tape tension transients on LTM is investigated. An optical non-contact tension sensor is developed and a correlation between LTM and tension transients is observed. Additionally, a method based on acoustic emission is established to measure tape <b>edge</b> <b>contact.</b> Tape <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> is observed to cause high frequency LTM, and the magnitude of the impact is shown to be function of the tape pack size.

A model for the friction coefficient between a tape and a cylindrical guide is presented and evaluated with experimental data. Finally, the use of laser surface texturing (LST) for improved tape guiding is proposed and investigated both experimentally and numerically. LST guides are observed to create an air bearing at low tape speeds and thus reduce the transition speed between boundary lubrication and full fluid lubrication.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of <b>edge</b> <b>contact</b> on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of gear supporting shafts. As {{a result of an}} <b>edge</b> <b>contact,</b> a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid <b>edge</b> <b>contact.</b> An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft deflections, (2) compensation of predicted shaft deflections during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises pinion and gear supporting shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by shaft deflections in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.
