40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on ways of <b>defining</b> the <b>requirements</b> for {{performance}} testing software, both in practice (based on survey) {{as well as in}} theory. The aim of this thesis is to analyze ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements,</b> which are actually used on IT projects. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to define concepts of performance testing, implement and evaluate the survey of the using ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> in practice and then analyze ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> in terms of their applicability to different types of IT projects. The contribution of this thesis is the comprehensive introduction performance testing software issues and mainly insight into ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> used in practice and problems associated with them, through the survey, which was implemented and evaluated by myself. The conclusions resulting from this survey summarize which ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> are applied to specific types of IT projects, which of these ways worked and which problems in certain cases that occur in practice. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part explains the basic concepts associated with performance testing software. In this part, there is also described the methodology of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> according to Tom Gilb. The practical part {{is focused on}} the realization and evaluation of survey of the using ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> in practice and on the analysis ways of <b>defining</b> performance <b>requirements</b> with respect to certain types of projects...|$|R
50|$|A {{password}} {{policy is}} a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly. A password policy is often part of an organization's official regulations and may be taught as part of security awareness training. Either the password policy is merely advisory, or the computer systems force users to comply with it. Some governments have national authentication frameworks that <b>define</b> <b>requirements</b> for user authentication to government services, including requirements for passwords.|$|E
