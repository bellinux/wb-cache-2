5|$|Eugene Victor Debs (November 5, 1855 – October 20, 1926) was an American union leader, {{one of the}} {{founding}} members of the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World (IWW or the Wobblies), and five times the candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States. Through his presidential candidacies, as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World rally.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{facilities at}} Black Moshannon State Park were {{constructed by the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, from 1933to 1937. The CCC created many jobs for unemployed <b>industrial</b> <b>workers</b> from throughout the United States.

However, many people used the area for recreation {{as far back as the}} early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Leopold II saw {{the rise of}} {{organized}} socialist political groups and parties, most notably among the <b>industrial</b> <b>workers</b> in Wallonia. The early socialist movement was characterized by a successful co-operative movement in Flanders. Trade unions were legalized in 1866, opening the way to organized labor politics. The International Workingmen's Association held its first conference outside Switzerland in Brussels in 1868 as Belgian socialism, under figures such as César De Paepe, expanded dramatically.|$|E

5|$|The {{years before}} the First World War were {{the golden age of}} the inshore fisheries. Landings reached new heights, and Scottish catches {{dominated}} Europe's herring trade, accounting for a third of the British catch. High productivity came about thanks to the transition to more productive steam-powered boats, while the rest of Europe's fishing fleets were slower because they were still powered by sails. However, in general the Scottish economy stagnated leading to growing unemployment and political agitation among <b>industrial</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Georgian {{buildings}} survive, including St Philip's Cathedral, Soho House, Perrott's Folly, the Town Hall {{and much of}} St Paul's Square. The Victorian era saw extensive building across the city. Major civic buildings such as the Victoria Law Courts (in characteristic red brick and terracotta), the Council House and the Museum & Art Gallery were constructed. St Chad's Cathedral was the first Roman Catholic cathedral {{to be built in}} the UK since the Reformation. Across the city, the need to house the <b>industrial</b> <b>workers</b> gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces, many of back-to-back houses, some of which were later to become inner-city slums.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of union radicals in the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World, Disque sponsored an alternative union based on patriotism and labor–management cooperation. The new union, the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, was established in 1917 and put {{under the leadership of}} Portland attorney Captain Maurice E. Crumpacker, who would later serve as a U.S. Congressman. The union was initially opposed by both labor and mill owners, but due to Disque's strong advocacy, within six months nearly all of the mill owners had agreed to support the union; by October 1918, it had 125,000members. In fact, the union lasted 20 years longer than the Spruce Production Division.|$|E

5|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war in 1917, General John J. Pershing sent Brice P. Disque, a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to {{determine}} if local labor issues within the forest products industry could be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.|$|E
5|$|A {{resident}} of Tiruchirappalli is generally {{referred to as}} a Tiruchiite. Situated {{at the edge of the}} Kaveri Delta, the culture of Tiruchirappalli is predominantly , prevalent elsewhere in the delta. With a substantial population of students and migrant <b>industrial</b> <b>workers</b> from different parts of India, Tiruchirappalli has a more cosmopolitan outlook than the surrounding countryside. The main festival celebrated in Tiruchirappalli is Pongal, a regional harvest festival celebrated during January. As part of the Pongal celebrations, Jallikattu, a bull-taming village sport played on the last day of the festival, is occasionally held on the outskirts of the city. Aadi Perukku, Samayapuram flower festival, Vaikunta Ekadasi, Srirangam car festival, and the Teppakulam float festival are some of the prominent festivals that are held locally. Bakrid and Eid al-Fitr are also widely celebrated, owing to the substantial number of Muslims in the city. Nationwide festivals such as the Gregorian New Year, Christmas, Deepavali and Holi are also celebrated in Tiruchirappalli.|$|E
5|$|After a {{nighttime}} rifle and dynamite attack by striking miners on two mines during the Leadville Miners' Strike in 1896, which succeeded in burning down the surface works {{of one of}} the mines, even the pro-union county sheriff requested Gov. McIntire to send in the state militia, and the WFM lost the strike, and its influence in Leadville. The collapse of the 1896 Leadville strike caused the WFM to sever its relationship with the American Federation of Labor and to turn strongly to the left politically. After the Colorado Labor Wars, the WFM was instrumental in launching the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World (IWW) in 1905, but withdrew from the IWW a few years later. Although the IWW's heyday was short-lived, the union was symbolically important and the ideals embodied by it continue to deeply influence the American labor movement to this day.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reasonably}} well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer <b>industrial</b> <b>workers</b> in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or <b>industrial</b> <b>workers.</b> Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would have required 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.|$|E
5|$|Born in Sydney, New South Wales to {{a middle-class}} family of English descent, Childe studied Classics at the University of Sydney {{before moving to}} England to study Classical {{archaeology}} at the University of Oxford. Here, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists {{to the detriment of}} Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Australian Labor Party as the private secretary of politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he authored an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and continued his research into European prehistory through various journeys across the continent, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture to the British archaeological community.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{making a}} rapid recovery, the Belgian Workers' Party was still penalized by the Belgian electoral system, which based {{suffrage}} on wealth, stopping {{most of the}} party's support base among <b>industrial</b> <b>workers</b> from voting. In August 1885, the party began its Antwerp Programme, which called for universal suffrage while confirming the party's intention to pursue its goals through parliamentary democracy rather than revolution. The culmination of this policy was the 1893 Belgian General Strike, involving some 250,000 workers. Fearing a revolution, the government adopted universal male suffrage in 1894, but only with plural voting, which allowed up to two additional votes for wealthy or educated citizens. Nevertheless, {{the percentage of the}} population eligible to vote rose from 3.9 to 37.3 percent, and in the 1894 elections the socialists won 28 of 152 seats. The Belgian Workers' Party called two further unsuccessful general strikes in 1902 and 1913 in an attempt to end the plural voting system.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor union periodicals, including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|E
5|$|Jerome made news in 1917, when strikes {{involving}} the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Workers</b> of the World (IWW) {{led to the}} expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again {{during and after the}} Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100 by the mid-1950s. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21stcentury, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.|$|E
