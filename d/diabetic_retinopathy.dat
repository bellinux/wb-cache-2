From the detected vessel structure, {{the position of the}} optic disc is derived and the region inside which the AVR data are to be measured is determined. Vessels within this region are labeled as either arteries or veins and their caliber is estimated from tracing data. From these values, the AVR parameter is computed.

40|$|In the retina, peptidergic {{signalling}} {{participates in}} multiple circuits of visual information processing. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF) is localised to amacrine cells and, in some instances, in {{a subset of}} ganglion cells. The variegated expression patterns of SRIF receptors (sst 1 -sst 5) and the variety of signalling mechanisms activated by retinal SRIF suggest that this peptide may exert multiple actions on retinal neurons and on retinal physiology, although our current understanding reflects a rather complicated picture. SRIF, mostly through sst 2, may act as a positive factor in the retina by regulating retinal homeostasis and protecting neurons against damage. In this respect, SRIF analogues seem to constitute a promising therapeutic arsenal to cure different retinal diseases, as for instance ischemic and <b>diabetic</b> <b>retinopathies.</b> However, further investigations are needed not only to fully understand the functional role of the SRIF system in the retina but also to exploit new chemical space for drug-like molecules.

Bearing {{in mind that}} haemoglobin in poorly controlled diabetes is abnormal and that extremely low oxygen tensions (known to cause sickling) exist in the healthy cat retina, we wished to explore the possibility that diabetic blood, like that of sickle cell disease, may become more viscous when deoxygenated. To do this we measured whole blood viscosity, under oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions, of 23 normal persons, 23 <b>diabetic</b> patients without <b>retinopathy,</b> and 34 <b>diabetic</b> patients with <b>retinopathy.</b> The shear rate used was 230 s- 1, {{which is similar to}} that thought to prevail in the major retinal veins. The viscosity of blood from normal persons, corrected for packed cell volume, did not change significantly on deoxygenation: mean 4. 54 (SD 0. 38) cps, versus, 4. 57 (0. 39) paired t test, p = 0. 66. Similarly the blood from <b>diabetics</b> without <b>retinopathy</b> showed no change: 4. 42 (0. 45) versus 4. 42 (0. 30), p = 0. 98; whereas the blood from patients with retinopathy changed from 4. 82 (0. 48) to 4. 95 (0. 63), p = 0. 027. The hypoxic viscosity ratio (deoxygenated divided by oxygenated viscosity) correlated with total serum cholesterol (r = 0. 44, p = 0. 018) but not with HbA 1, serum glucose, triglycerides, or age. A disproportionate increase in venous viscosity relative to arterial viscosity would lead to increased intraluminal and transmural pressure and therefore exacerbate leakage across capillary walls...|$|R

Angiogenesis meaning branching and extension of preexisting capillaries is carefully balanced by different biological activities in the body. It is stimulated by factors like VEGF and angiopoetins but it is inhibited by factors like tromboplastin.

Induction of angiogenesis would be of great help in patients with an ischemic heart. Inhibition of aberrant angiogenesis would probably be the perfect way to eradicate tumor growth in the body.

40|$|Interactions between endothelial cells (ECs) and {{perivascular}} mural cells (MCs) via signaling molecules {{or physical}} contacts are implicated both in vascular remodeling {{and maintenance of}} vascular integrity. However, it remains unclear how MCs regulate the morphogenic activity of ECs to form an organized vascular architecture, comprising distinct artery, vein, and capillary, from a simple mesh-like network. A clear elucidation of this question requires an experimental model system in which ECs are separated from MCs and yet form vascular structures. Here we report that injection of an antagonistic mAb against PDGFR-β into murine neonates provides such an experimental system in the retina by completely blocking MC recruitment to developing vessels. While a vascular network was formed {{even in the absence}} of MCs, it was poorly remodeled and leaky. Using this vascular system ideal for direct assessment of the activities of MC-derived molecules, we show that addition of recombinant modified angiopoietin- 1 restored a hierarchical vasculature, and also rescued retinal edema and hemorrhage in the complete absence of MCs.

We propose {{a new model of}} Neonatal Hyperglycemia-induced Retinopathy (NHIR) that mimics many aspects of retinopathy of prematurity. Hyperglycemia was induced in newborn rat pups by injection of streptozocine (STZ) at post natal day one (P 1). At various time points, animals were assessed for vascular abnormalities, neuronal cell death and accumulation and activation of microglial cells. We here report that streptozotocin induced a rapid and sustained increase of glycemia from P 2 / 3 to P 6 without affecting rat pups gain weight or necessitating insulin treatment. Retinal vascular area was significantly reduced in P 6 hyperglycemic animals compared to control animals. Hyperglycemia was associated with (i) CCL 2 chemokine induction at P 6, (ii) a significant recruitment of inflammatory macrophages and an increase in total number of Iba+ macrophages/microglia cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL), and (iii) excessive apoptosis in the INL. NHIR thereby reproduces several aspects of ischemic retinopathies, including ROP and <b>diabetic</b> <b>retinopathies,</b> and might be a useful model to decipher hyperglycemia-induced cellular and molecular mechanisms in the small rodent...|$|R
