5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talents he possessed as a player; {{there is some evidence}} that he sought to influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: {{if he tried to}} sue for peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with the Mark 14 torpedo and the influence feature of the Mark 6 exploder. Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, Christie was not <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact of the situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 torpedo, with a contact-only pistol. Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors {{on the part of the}} captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of the Mark 18 electric torpedo. Christie resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the torpedo issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, Christie was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

5000|$|Conscious human action, Mandel argues, {{is mainly}} non-arbitrary and practical, {{it has a}} certain [...] "logic" [...] to it even if people are not (yet) <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this. <b>The</b> reality they face is ordered in basic ways, and {{therefore}} can be meaningfully understood. Masses of people might go into a [...] "mad frenzy" [...] sometimes that might be difficult to explain in rational terms, {{but this is the}} exception, not the rule. What is true is that a situation of chaos and disorder (when nothing in society seems to work properly anymore) can powerfully accentuate the irrational and non-rational aspects of human behaviour. In such situations, people with very unreasonable ideas can rise to power. This is, according to Mandel, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explanation <b>of</b> fascism.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{the monarch}} plays {{a very large}} but {{completely}} unofficial role in <b>the</b> running <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country as advisor and confidant to the government.

It is assumed that the monarch exerts most of his influence (as such) in these meetings, in that he can bring his knowledge and experience to bear in what he tells the Prime Minister. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Queen Beatrix, several former Prime Ministers have remarked that her case knowledge {{of each and every}} dossier is extensive and that she makes sure to be <b>fully</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> details surrounding everything that lands on her desk.|$|R
