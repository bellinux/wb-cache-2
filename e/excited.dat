5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first <b>excited</b> state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split {{into a pair of}} energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest <b>excited</b> state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the <b>excited</b> levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent that}} it becomes the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first <b>excited</b> state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first <b>excited</b> state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138pm.|$|E
