5|$|The next {{assignment}} for 2e DB, {{and the one}} that it had been brought from Africa for, was the liberation of Paris. Allied troops initially avoided the historic city, moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> and Leclerc persuaded General Dwight D. Eisenhower to help. Leclerc's men had to fight their way into Paris, and when they got there they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city. The German commander, General der Infanterie Dietrich von Choltitz, was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and Henri Rol-Tanguy of the French Forces of the Interior at the Gare Montparnasse on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for Ensign Philippe <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle,</b> who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender. The next day <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, Alphonse Juin, Marie-Pierre Kœnig and Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is <b>De</b> <b>Gaulle’s</b> vision of foreign policy and {{international}} relations. The concept “Grandeur de la France” indicates that <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle’s</b> foreign policy was exclusively concerned with great power politics. However, the majority of states that France had to deal with were minor and middle powers. On these grounds, Olav Riste discusses what place these states occupied in <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle’s</b> view of international relations...|$|R
5000|$|Following Gen. <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle's</b> {{return to}} power in 1958, Chaban-Delmas agreed to {{the advent of the}} French Fifth Republic and the new Constitution. He took part in the {{foundation}} of the Union for the New Republic (UNR) and was elected, against <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle's</b> will, chairman of the National Assembly. He kept this function until the end of <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle's</b> presidency in 1969. Unlike some Gaullists, for instance, Jacques Soustelle, he supported <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle's</b> policy to end the Algerian War of Independence. During the 1959 UNR Congress, he was the first politician to evoke a [...] "reserved presidential domain," [...] composed chiefly of defence and diplomacy. This interpretation of the Constitution of 1958 has survived.|$|R
50|$|Mollet {{resigned}} from <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle's</b> cabinet in 1959 {{and did not}} hold office again. He remained Secretary General of the SFIO, but under <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle's</b> new system, the Fifth Republic, it was a powerless opposition party, and by the 1960s it was in terminal decline.|$|R
5|$|Considering the {{response}} given to be unsatisfactory, <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> began {{the development of}} an independent French nuclear deterrent and in 1966 withdrew from NATO's military structures and expelled NATO troops from French soil.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, <b>De</b> <b>Gaulle</b> spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E

5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were stirred by remarks given by General Charles <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. <b>De</b> <b>Gaulle</b> accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E

5|$|Rakoto's {{opportunity}} for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President Charles <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> to Madagascar. The visit was {{in conjunction with}} the dissolution of colonial status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18musicians to accompany <b>de</b> <b>Gaulle</b> and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's walking tour through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became president of Madagascar two years later, was the first to refer to the artist as Rakoto Frah, the name that the musician would use {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
