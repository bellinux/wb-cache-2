40|$|The {{human genome}} {{contains}} numerous blocks of highly homologous duplicated sequence. This higher-order architecture provides a substrate for recombination and recurrent chromosomal rearrangement associated with <b>genomic</b> <b>disease.</b> However, {{an assessment of}} the role of segmental duplications in normal variation has not yet been made. On the basis of the duplication architecture of the human genome, we defined a set of 130 potential rearrangement hotspots and constructed a targeted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray (with 2, 194 BACs) to assess copy-number variation in these regions by array comparative genomic hybridization. Using our segmental duplication BAC microarray, we screened a panel of 47 normal individuals, who represented populations from four continents, and we identified 119 regions of copy-number polymorphism (CNP), 73 of which were previously unreported. We observed an equal frequency of duplications and deletions, as well as a 4 -fold enrichment of CNPs within hotspot regions, compared with control BACs (P 4 -fold within regions of CNP. Almost without exception, CNPs were not confined to a single population, suggesting that these either are recurrent events, having occurred independently in multiple founders, or were present in early human populations. Our study demonstrates that segmental duplications define hotspots of chromosomal rearrangement, likely acting as mediators of normal variation as well as <b>genomic</b> <b>disease,</b> and it suggests that the consideration of genomic architecture can significantly improve the ascertainment of large-scale rearrangements. Our specialized segmental duplication BAC microarray and associated database of structural polymorphisms will provide an important resource for the future characterization of human genomic disorders...|$|E

This perspective is ill informed for non-mendelian complex disorders which result as an interaction between genetics and environment. To understand health and disease we must study how nature and nurture interact. Recent advances in human genomics and high-throughput biotechnology make it possible to study large numbers of genetic markers and gene products simultaneously to explore their interactions with environment. The purpose of this review is to discuss design and analytic issues for gene-environment interaction studies in the “-omics” era, with a focus on environmental and genetic epidemiological studies.

40|$|Cancer is a <b>genomic</b> <b>disease</b> {{associated}} with a plethora of gene mutations resulting {{in a loss of}} control over vital cellular functions. Among these mutated genes, driver genes are defined as being causally linked to oncogenesis, while passenger genes are thought to be irrelevant for cancer development. With increasing numbers of large-scale genomic datasets available, integrating these genomic data to identify driver genes from aberration regions of cancer genomes becomes an important goal of cancer genome analysis and investigations into mechanisms responsible for cancer development. A computational method, MAXDRIVER, is proposed here to identify potential driver genes on the basis of copy number aberration (CNA) regions of cancer genomes, by integrating publicly available human genomic data. MAXDRIVER employs several optimization strategies to construct a heterogeneous network, by means of combining a fused gene functional similarity network, gene-disease associations and a disease phenotypic similarity network. MAXDRIVER was validated to effectively recall known associations among genes and cancers. Previously identified as well as novel driver genes were detected by scanning CNAs of breast cancer, melanoma and liver carcinoma.

We have developed rapid computational heuristics based on BLAST analysis to detect segmental duplications, as well as regions containing potential sequence misassignments in the human genome assemblies. Results: Our analysis of the June 2002 public human genome assembly revealed that 107. 4 of 3, 043. 1 megabases (Mb) (3. 53 %) of sequence contained segmental duplications, each with size equal or more than 5 kb and 90 % identity. We have also detected that 38. 9 Mb (1. 28 %) of sequence within this assembly is likely to be involved in sequence misassignment errors. Furthermore, we have identified a significant subset (199, 965 of 2, 327, 473 or 8. 6 %) of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the public databases that are not true SNPs but are potential paralogous sequence variants. /nConclusion: Using two distinct computational approaches, we have identified most of the sequences in the human genome that have undergone recent segmental duplications.

The results suggested that major transitions in diet selected for different communities of commensals and likely {{played a role in}} the emergence of modern oral pathogens. Adler et al., (2013) studies indicated that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming shifted the oral microbial community to a disease-associated configuration. Modern oral microbiotic ecosystems were markedly less diverse than historic populations, which might be contributing to chronic oral disease in postindustrial lifestyles. Brito et al., (2016) compared the mobile genes found in the microbiomes of 81 metropolitan North Americans with those of 172 agrarian Fiji islanders using a combination of single-cell genomics and metagenomics. They found large differences in mobile gene content between the Fijian and North American microbiomes. These results suggested that the abundance of some genes may reflect environmental selection.

40|$|Abstract Genomic {{instability}} (GIN) and chromosome instability (CIN) are two {{closely related}} ways {{to produce a}} variety of pathogenic conditions, i. e. cancer, neurodegeneration, chromosomal and <b>genomic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The GIN and CIN manifestation that possesses the most appreciable impact on cell physiology and viability is aneuploidy. The latter has been consistently shown {{to be associated with}} aging. Classically, it has been considered that a failure of mitotic machinery leads to aneuploidy acquiring throughout aging in dividing cells. Paradoxically, this model is inapplicable for the human brain, which is composed of post-mitotic cells persisting throughout the lifetime. To solve this paradox, we have focused on mosaic neural aneuploidy, a remarkable biomarker of GIN and CIN in the normal and diseased brain (i. e. Alzheimer's disease and ataxia-telangiectasia). Looking through the available data on genomic variations in the developing and adult human central nervous system, we were able to propose a hypothesis suggesting that neural aneuploidy produced during early brain development plays a crucial role of genetic determinant of aging in the healthy and diseased brain. </p...|$|R

The linkage peak of prostate cancer overlies a region of ∼ 750 kb containing five SPANX genes (SPANX-A 1, -A 2, -B, -C, and -D) encoding sperm proteins associated with the nucleus; their expression was also detected {{in a variety of}} cancers. SPANX genes are > 95 % identical and reside within large segmental duplications (SDs) {{with a high level of}} similarity, which confounds mutational analysis of this gene family by routine PCR methods. In this work, we applied transformation-associated recombination cloning (TAR) in yeast to characterize individual SPANX genes from prostate cancer patients showing linkage to Xq 27 – 28 and unaffected controls. Analysis of genomic TAR clones revealed a dynamic nature of the replicated region of linkage. Both frequent gene deletion/duplication and homology-based sequence transfer events were identified within the region and were presumably caused by recombinational interactions between SDs harboring the SPANX genes. These interactions contribute to diversity of the SPANX coding regions in humans. We speculate that the predisposition to prostate cancer in X-linked families is an example of a <b>genomic</b> <b>disease</b> caused by a specific architecture of the SPANX gene cluster...|$|E

40|$|The {{propensity}} of segmental duplications (SDs) to promote genomic instability is of increasing interest since {{their involvement in}} numerous human <b>genomic</b> <b>diseases</b> and cancers was revealed. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for their appearance remain mostly speculative. Here, we show that in budding yeast, replication accidents, which are most likely transformed into broken forks, play a causal role {{in the formation of}} SDs. The Pol 32 subunit of the major replicative polymerase Pold is required for all SD formation, demonstrating that SDs result from untimely DNA synthesis rather than from unequal crossing-over. Although Pol 32 is known to be required for classical (Rad 52 -dependant) break-induced replication, only half of the SDs can be attributed to this mechanism. The remaining SDs are generated through a Rad 52 -independent mechanism of template switching between microsatellites or microhomologous sequences. This new mechanism, named microhomology/microsatellite-induced replication (MMIR), differs from all known DNA double-strand break repair pathways, as MMIR-mediated duplications still occur in the combined absence of homologous recombination, microhomology-mediated, and nonhomologous end joining machineries. The interplay between these two replication-based pathways explains important features of higher eukaryotic genomes, such as the strong, but not strict, association between SDs and transposable elements, as well as the frequent formation of oncogenic fusion genes generating protein innovations at SD junctions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{segmental}} duplications {{are relatively}} large (≥ 1 kb) genomic regions of high sequence identity (≥ 90 %). They cover approximately 4 – 5 % {{of the human}} genome and play important roles in gene evolution and <b>genomic</b> <b>disease.</b> The DNA sequence differences between copies of a segmental duplication represent the result of various mutational events over time, since any two duplication copies originated from the same ancestral DNA sequence. Based on this fact, we have developed a computational scheme for inference of point mutational events in human segmental duplications, which we collectively term duplication-inferred mutations (DIMs). We have characterized these nucleotide substitutions by comparing them with high-quality SNPs from dbSNP, both in terms of sequence context and frequency of substitution types. Results Overall, DIMs show a lower ratio of transitions relative to transversions than SNPs, although this ratio approaches that of SNPs when considering DIMs within most recent duplications. Our findings indicate that DIMs and SNPs in general are caused by similar mutational mechanisms, with some deviances at the CpG dinucleotide. Furthermore, we discover a large number of reference SNPs that coincide with computationally inferred DIMs. The latter reflects how sequence variation in duplicated sequences can be misinterpreted as ordinary allelic variation. Conclusion In summary, we show how DNA sequence analysis of segmental duplications can provide a genome-wide mutational spectrum that mirrors recent genome evolution. The inferred set of nucleotide substitutions represents a valuable complement to SNPs for the analysis of genetic variation and point mutagenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genome comprises a cir-cular, histone-free 'chromosome ' of 16. 6 kb of DNA, {{present in}} one or more copies in every mitochondrion. This chromosome has been tightly conserved {{for more than half a}} billion years, coding in every multicellular animal so far investigated, both vertebrate and invertebrate: (i) the same 13 protein subunits required for oxidative phospho-rylation; (ii) a component of each of the two mitochondrial ribosome subunits; and (iii) the 22 transport RNAs present within the mitochondrion. Exons on the circle are tightly packed, with no spacing introns. Mitochondrial DNA is histone-free, has lim-ited repair ability, and has a relatively high mutation-fixation rate. Inheritance is cytoplasmic and maternal, with epidemiol-ogical evidence (namely the familial distri-bution of polymorphisms) indicating that recombination with mtDNA of paternal ori-gin is exceedingly rare. Thus the mainten-ance and evolution of mtDNA (its remarkably successful symbiotic persist-ence with the nuclear genome) has been essentially asexual. The machinery for homologous recombination is present in mitochondria of at least some species, how-ever, and it might be surprising if it did not occur between circles in some circum-stances. By bringing together the fields of mitochondrial biochemistry, evolutionary genetics, reproductive physiology, and neuromuscular medicine in focusing on the inheritance of normal and abnormal human mtDNA, we can hope to better understand the forces behind this genome's inheritance and what might be required of ovarian function to satisfy its accurate persistence over millions of years.

In this report, we aimed at applying array-CGH to urinary samples to characterize bladder cancer. Methods: Urinary DNA from bladder cancer patients and controls were hybridized on 44 K oligonucleotide arrays. Validation analyses of identified regions and candidates included fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry in an independent set of bladder tumors spotted on custom-made tissue arrays (n[*]=[*] 181). Results: Quality control of array-CGH provided high reproducibility in dilution experiments and when comparing reference pools. The most frequent genomic alterations (minimal recurrent regions) among bladder cancer urinary specimens included gains at 1 q and 5 p, and losses at 10 p and 11 p. Supervised hierarchical clustering identified the gain at 1 q 23. 3 -q 24. 1 significantly correlated to stage (p[*]=[*] 0. 011), and grade (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). The amplification and overexpression of Prefoldin (PFND 2), a selected candidate mapping to 1 q 23. 3 -q 24. 1, correlated to increasing stage and tumor grade by means of custom-designed and optimized FISH (p[*]=[*] 0. 013 and p[*]=[*] 0. 023, respectively), and immunohistochemistry (p ≤ 0. 0005 and p[*]=[*] 0. 011, respectively), in an independent set of bladder tumors included in tissue arrays.

40|$|The {{human genome}} {{demonstrates}} variable levels of instability during ontogeny. Achieving {{the highest rate}} during early prenatal development, it decreases significantly throughout following ontogenetic stages. A failure to decrease or a spontaneous increase of genomic instability can promote infertility, pregnancy losses, chromosomal and <b>genomic</b> <b>diseases,</b> cancer, immunodeficiency, or brain diseases depending on developmental stage at which it occurs. Paradoxically, late ontogeny is associated with increase of genomic instability that is considered a probable mechanism for human aging. The latter is even more appreciable in human diseases associated with pathological or accelerated aging (i. e. Alzheimer’s disease and ataxia-telangiectasia). These observations resulted in a hypothesis suggesting that somatic genomic variations throughout ontogeny are determinants of cellular vitality in health and disease including intrauterine development, postnatal life and aging. The most devastative effect of somatic genome variations is observed when it manifests as chromosome instability or aneuploidy, which has been repeatedly noted to produce pathologic conditions and to mediate developmental regulatory and aging processes. However, no commonly accepted concepts {{on the role of}} chromosome/genome instability in determination of human health span and life span are available.

40|$|Identification of {{biomarkers}} {{that contribute}} to complex human disorders is a principal and challenging task in computational biology. Prognostic biomarkers are useful for risk assessment of disease progression and patient stratification. Since treatment plans often hinge on patient stratification, better disease subtyping {{has the potential to}} significantly improve survival for patients. Additionally, a thorough understanding of the roles of biomarkers in cancer pathways facilitates insights into complex disease formation, and provides potential druggable targets in the pathways. Many statistical methods have been applied toward biomarker discovery, often combining feature selection with classification methods. Traditional approaches are mainly concerned with statistical significance and fail to consider the clinical relevance of the selected biomarkers. Two additional problems impede meaningful biomarker discovery: gene multiplicity (several maximally predictive solutions exist) and instability (inconsistent gene sets from different experiments or cross validation runs). Motivated by a need for more biologically informed, stable biomarker discovery method, I introduce an integrated module-based biomarker discovery framework for analyzing high- throughput <b>genomic</b> <b>disease</b> data. The proposed framework addresses the aforementioned challenges in three components. First, a recursive spectral clustering algorithm specifically 4 tailored toward high-dimensional, heterogeneous data (ReKS) is developed to partition genes into clusters that are treated as single entities for subsequent analysis. Next, the problems of gene multiplicity and instability are addressed through a group variable selection algorithm (T-ReCS) based on local causal discovery methods. Guided by the tree-like partition created from the clustering algorithm, this algorithm selects gene clusters that are predictive of a clinical outcome. We demonstrate that the group feature selection method facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant genes through their association with a statistically predictive driver. Finally, we elucidate the biological relevance of the biomarkers by leveraging available prior information to identify regulatory relationships between genes and between clusters, and deliver the information {{in the form of a}} user-friendly web server, mirConnX...|$|E
40|$|As a <b>genomic</b> <b>disease</b> {{cancer is}} unique in that the entire genome can be highly unstable, with new {{mutations}} accumulating at a rapid rate and massive alterations to the chromosomal structure. Structural aberrations can be highly significant to a patient’s disease, resulting in aberrant proteins that can drive a cancer to progress faster or metastasize. Such aberrations may also have more subtle effects, enabling the cellular population to more rapidly develop drug resistance or simply generate highly diverse populations within a tumor making targeted therapies less effective. In fact it is these diverse or heterogeneous cellular populations, with highly mutated and frequently structurally aberrant genomes, that make understanding the extent of a tumor genome’s variation so challenging. Large scale sequencing efforts through the Cancer Genome Atlas and the International Cancer Genome Consortium have sequenced thousands of cancer genomes, and while small-scale variants have enabled researchers to begin to trace the evolutionary history and diversity of tumor genomes, large-scale structural variations have continued {{to be difficult to}} identify. Current methods and technologies for short-read sequencing generally rely on fitting genomes to a single reference assembly that is assumed to be representative of all individuals. Tumor genomes, which consist of heterogeneous cellular populations with unique aberrations can vary significantly from a ‘normal’ genome. This means that such single references are poor representations of a cancerous cell population, and so methods that rely less directly on the reference offer better opportunities to investigate these aberrations. In this project, a new method for large-scale structural variant identification, called MultiSieve, is proposed. This method uses prior knowledge to generate and test multiple references for each patient genome. Validation using simulated data establishes the utility of the method, and a comparison with commonly used methods demonstrates that MultiSieve is capable of finding variations often missed by traditional methods and that there {{are likely to be more}} structural variants in patients than have been identified previously...|$|E

Initially, we considered only large recent duplication events that fell well-below levels of draft sequencing error (alignments 90 %– 98 % similar and ≥ 1 kb in length). Duplications (90 %– 98 %; ≥ 1 kb) comprise 3. 6 % of all human sequence. These duplications show clustering and up to 10 -fold enrichment within pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. In terms of assembly, duplicated sequences were found to be over-represented in unordered and unassigned contigs indicating that duplicated sequences are difficult to assign to their proper position. To assess coverage of these regions within the genome, we selected BACs containing interchromosomal duplications and characterized their duplication pattern by FISH. Only 47 % (106 / 224) of chromosomes positive by FISH had a corresponding chromosomal position by BLAST comparison. We present data that indicate that this is attributable to misassembly, misassignment, and/or decreased sequencing coverage within duplicated regions. Surprisingly, if we consider putative duplications > 98 % identity, we identify 10. 6 % (286 Mb) of the current assembly as paralogous. The majority of these alignments, we believe, represent unmerged overlaps within unique regions. Taken together the above data indicate that segmental duplications represent a significant impediment to accurate human genome assembly, requiring the development of specialized techniques to finish these exceptional regions of the genome. The identification and characterization of these highly duplicated regions represents an important step in the complete sequencing of a human reference genome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{human genome}} {{demonstrates}} variable levels of instability during ontogeny. Achieving {{the highest rate}} during early prenatal development, it decreases significantly throughout following ontogenetic stages. A failure to decrease or a spontaneous increase of genomic instability can promote infertility, pregnancy losses, chromosomal and <b>genomic</b> <b>diseases,</b> cancer, immunodeficiency, or brain diseases depending on developmental stage at which it occurs. Paradoxically, late ontogeny is associated with increase of genomic instability that is considered a probable mechanism for human aging. The latter is even more appreciable in human diseases associated with pathological or accelerated aging (i. e. Alzheimer’s disease and ataxia-telangiectasia). These observations resulted in a hypothesis suggesting that somatic genomic variations throughout ontogeny are determinants of cellular vitality in health and disease including intrauterine development, postnatal life and aging. The most devastative effect of somatic genome variations is observed when it manifests as chromosome instability or aneuploidy, which has been repeatedly noted to produce pathologic conditions and to mediate developmental regulatory and aging processes. However, no commonly accepted concepts {{on the role of}} chromosome/genome instability in determination of human health span and life span are available. Here, a review of these ontogenetic variations is given to propose a new “dynamic genome ” model for pathological and natural genomic changes throughout life that mimic those of phylogenetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} {{a small number of}} genomic rearrangements that occur frequently in the general population. Bioinformatics tools are now available for systematic genome-wide surveys of higher-order structures predisposing to such common variations in genomic architecture. Segmental duplications (SDs) constitute up to 5 per cent of the genome and {{play an important role in}} generating additional rearrangements and in disease aetiology. We conducted a genome-wide database search for a form of SD, palindromic segmental duplications (PSDs), which consist of paired, inverted duplications, and which predispose to inversions, duplications and deletions. The survey was complemented by a search for SDs in tandem orientation (TSDs) that can mediate duplications and deletions but not inversions. We found more than 230 distinct loci with higher-order genomic structure that can mediate genomic variation, of these about 180 contained a PSD. A number of these sites were previously identified as harbouring common inversions or as being associated with specific <b>genomic</b> <b>diseases</b> characterised by duplication, deletions or inversions. Most of the regions, however, were previously unidentified; their characterisation should identify further common rearrangements and may indicate localisations for additional genomic disorders. The widespread distribution of complex chromosomal architecture suggests a potentially high degree of plasticity of the human genome and could uncover another level of genetic variation within human populations. </p...|$|R
