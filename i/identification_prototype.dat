5000|$|The {{original}} fingerprint <b>identification</b> <b>prototype</b> {{was made}} mostly from items Mr. Fowler and Mr. Ruby found in Mr. Fowler's garage. The moving parts (cams, drive-trains, rotating spindles, articulated platforms, etc) were all homemade. Rotation came by cannibalizing old drill motors. Old projection lights and lenses illuminated the ridges and valleys of the fingerprints {{along the length}} of the finger one line at a time. The optical elements had to be made from machined and polished plastic, but the structure that housed all the mechanics was built out of wood. By using photosensitive paper and film, the only media available at the time for recording, the result was a machine that could simulate the effects of rolling the finger and capture an entire print without distortion.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} for identifying the language type of character images. We do this by classifying individual character images to determine the language boundaries in multilingual documents. Two effective methods are considered for this purpose: the prototype classification method and support vector machines (SVM). Due to the large size of our training dataset, we further propose a technique {{to speed up the}} training process for both methods. Applying the two methods to classifying characters into Chinese, English, and Japanese (including Hiragana and Katakana) has produced very accurate and comparable test results.

30|$|We {{used the}} NVIVO™ {{software}} program to code {{and analyze the}} student interviews according to a sequential qualitative analysis process (Miles et al. 2014). We completed qualitative coding in two phases. In the first phase, a single coder categorized student responses according to the major topic areas included in the interview protocol. In the next phase, a group of four coders applied a provisional list of sub-codes to a cross-sectional sample of interview transcripts. These sub-codes included process codes aligned to individual phases of the EDP (e.g., problem <b>identification,</b> <b>prototyping,</b> and testing solutions) and magnitude codes indicating positive and negative examples.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automatically {{identifying}} {{the person you}} are talking with using continuous audio sensing {{has the potential to}} enable many pervasive computing applications from memory assistance to annotating life logging data. However, a number of challenges, including energy efficiency and training data acquisition, must be addressed before unobtrusive audio sensing is practical on mobile devices. We built SpeakerSense, a speaker <b>identification</b> <b>prototype</b> that uses a heterogeneous multi-processor hardware architecture that splits computation between a low power processor and the phone's application processor to enable continuous background sensing with minimal power requirements. Using SpeakerSense, we benchmarked several system parameters (sampling rate, GMM complexity, smoothing window size, and amount of training data needed) to identify thresholds that balance computation cost with performance. We also investigated channel compensation methods that make it feasible to acquire training data from phone calls and an automatic segmentation method for training speaker models based on one-to-one conversations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A way to {{discourage}} illicit reproduction of copy-righted or sensitive documents is to watermark each copy before distribution. A unique mark {{is embedded in}} the text whose recipient is registered. The mark can be extracted from a possibly noisy illicit copy, identifying the registered recipient. Most image marking techniques are vulnerable to binarization attack and, hence, not suitable for text marking. We propose a different approach where a text document is marked by shifting certain text lines slightly up or down or words slightly left or right from their original positions. The shifting pattern constitutes the mark and is different on different copies. In this paper we develop and evaluate a method to detect such minute shifts. We de-scribe a marking and <b>identification</b> <b>prototype</b> that implements the proposed method. We present preliminary experimental results which suggest that centroid detection performs remarkably well on line shifts even in the presence of severe distortions introduced by printing, photocopying, scanning, and facsimile transmission.

40|$|This practicum. report {{describes}} an <b>identification</b> <b>prototype</b> {{used by a}} large metropolitan school district (Gwinnet County, Georgia) to identify giftedness in black and limited English speaking students. Underrepresentation of these groups in gifted programs is seen to result from: teacher reluctance to refer students from the target populations; the inappropriateness of conventional assessment measures for evaluating the intellectual ability of these students; {{and the problem of}} a narrow definition of giftedness mandated by state regulations. Five pilot schools across three instructional levels were used to evaluate the intervention. A three step solution strategy included: (1) staff development for classroom teachers; (2) an expanded evaluation sequence using nontraditional subjective and objective evaluation instruments; and (3) the use of multiple criteria for making gifted program placement recommendations. Implementation of the procedures reduced the underrepresentation of target populations in gifted programs in the five pilot schools. Forty-two appendices provide project details, assessment forms used in the gifted program, letters, data tables, and other supporting material. (Contains 46 references.)

The study may be broadly divided into three main sections. The first part offers an introduction to standard vision systems, focusing on the hardware architectures and the image analysis techniques used on them. Hardware configurations depend mainly on the selected frame-grabber and processor type. Parallel architectures are highlighted, as they represent the most suitable platform for a real-time digitized video image analysis system. The image analysis techniques discussed include: image preprocessing, segmentation, edge detection, optical flow analysis and optical character recognition. The {{second part of the}} study covers a number of real-world computer vision applications, and commercially available development environments. Several traffic surveillance systems are discussed in detail, as they relate to the practical vehicle identification system developed in the third part of the study. As mentioned above, the development of a Vehicle <b>Identification</b> <b>Prototype,</b> called VIP, forms the basis for the third and final part of this study. The VIP hardware requirements are given, and the software development and use is explained.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) is {{to act as an}} {{electronic}} organizer or day planner that is portable, easy to use and capable of sharing information with a Personal Computer (PC). It's supposed to be an extension of the PC, not a replacement. The traditional PDAs are actually descendents of the original Palm Pilot and Microsoft's Handheld PC devices. Pocket PC is the generic name for Windows Mobile PDAs. The scope of the project is to develop a prototype of a Pocket PC application and Windows based system that will be used as a traffic counter and evaluation program. Prototyping technique was chosen for this project because a prototype is an initial version of software system which is used to demonstrate concepts, try out design options and generally it is easier to come up with probable solutions and problem <b>identification.</b> <b>Prototyping</b> involves a repetitive sequence of Analysis, Design, Modeling and Testing. Prototyping allows users to examine a model that accurately represent system outputs, inputs, interfaces and processes. Decision on what development tools to use is very important because there many other programming tools or language available in the market. A study on various languages and tools must be done in order to find out {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each programming language and tool.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} of this ex post facto study was to test the divergent validity (degree of discrimination) of anorexia prototype narrative according to anorectic close confidents (relatives), as well as explore different characteristics of the participants which {{may be associated with}} the degree of prototype discrimination. Sixty-four relatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa participated in the study and were asked to indicate their degree of identification, according to their relative, with five different narrative prototypes (depressive, agoraphobia, anorexic, alcoholic, and drug addiction prototypes). Results did not confirm the divergent validity of the anorexic prototype narrative. The participants tended to identify primarily their relative with the agoraphobia prototype. Once again, {{no significant differences were found}} between the identification with the anorexic prototype and depression, agoraphobia and alcoholism prototype. The only significant differences found were for the comparison between the anorexic and drug addiction prototype.

30|$|Combining {{data from}} two {{anatomical}} locations seemingly does not yield substantial {{improvements in the}} strength of correlations or EE estimation error [39, 54]. In some research and development laboratories, accelerometers have been arranged in parallel arrays and positioned at various anatomical locations to monitor the types of activity being performed by postural <b>identification.</b> Such <b>prototype</b> PA monitors were developed to primarily target specific population groups during rehabilitation, including amputees [55] or inpatients with SCI [56]. Devices with multiple arrays have shown good specificity (92 %), agreement (92 %) and sensitivity (87 %) {{for the detection of}} wheelchair propulsion in observational studies [57]. Yet, even when worn for {{a relatively short period of}} time, participants self-reported moderate burden [58]. These monitors are relatively obtrusive and, due to reduced memory capacity and battery life, are restricted to short monitoring durations (< 48  h). This is not in keeping with current end user requirements of PA monitors. Multi-site prototype arrays are also not typically available outside of the developing laboratory, making validation by other researchers challenging.|$|R
