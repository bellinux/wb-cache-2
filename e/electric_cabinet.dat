30|$|The PEMFC power plant, two {{traction}} inverters, <b>electric</b> <b>cabinet,</b> {{and cooling}} subsystem {{are housed in}} the remaining half of the machinery compartment. The air-braking subsystem already housed in the locomotive stands aside the hydrogen storage subsystem, which {{is used for the}} deceleration and braking of the locomotive. There is a low-power air compressor dedicated for the air pressurization, which is located at the lower left side of the locomotive framework. The air compressor will automatically startup when the operation pressure falls below 400  kPa and shutdown, when the operation pressure reaches 850  kPa in order to provide enough air for braking at low speed.|$|E

For the purpose, two type of slices from peeled and unpeeled fruits of four commercial grown varieties viz. Desi, Sindhri, Langra and Chaunsa were prepared. These slices were categorized into three groups A, B and C. In group A, slices were kept in controlled conditions in <b>electric</b> <b>cabinet</b> chamber (dehydrator) at 65 o C temperature, while in group B, slices were dried by open sun drying method using muslin cloth over the cots at (43 ± 5 o C) and in group C, slices were kept in wooden glass dehydrator at (48 ± 4 o C). The statistical analysis reveals highly significant differences for all main factors including varieties, dehydration methods, type of mango powder and their interactions. Chaunsa had the highest mean calcium (389. 54 mg kg- 1), potassium (912. 07 mg kg- 1) and magnesium (90. 92 mg k...|$|E

50|$|Moelwyn Slate Quarry {{is located}} above the {{enlarged}} Llyn Stwlan. It was worked sporadically between the 1820s and 1897, but {{was connected to}} the Ffestiniog Railway by a spectacular series of seven inclines, descending some 1100 ft. Most are still visible in the landscape, but the enlargement of Llyn Stwlan destroyed the sixth incline, parts of the fifth and seventh, and much of the abandoned mill area, which was located between the fourth and fifth inclines, rather than at the quarry level, in order to benefit from the water supply provided by the lake. There are a number of inspection hatches and <b>electric</b> <b>cabinets</b> on the inclines, which are presumably connected with the power station infrastructure.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} and shelf life of high-iron, dried, pre-cooked rice porridge with ferrous sulphate and other high-iron materials was studied. Broken brown rice was soaked {{in water and}} ferrous sulphate was added at 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 % of the dried brown rice. The mixture was steamed for 20 min and dried in a double drum dryer. Green shallot, young ginger and cooked chicken fillet were dried in an <b>electric</b> <b>cabinet</b> dryer. Chicken blood and edible fern were dried in a double drum dryer and vacuum freezer respectively. The optimum ferrous sulphate added to the rice was 0. 05 % and the developed formulation of dried porridge consisted of ferrous sulphate rice (67. 80 %), chicken fillet (20 %), chicken blood (3 %), green shallot (0. 7 %), young ginger (1 %), edible fern (0. 5 %), pepper powder (0. 5 %), sucrose (3 %), salt (3 %) and monosodium glutamate (0. 5 %). The dried porridge had a high iron content of 10. 18 mg/ 50 g and the shelf life was three months at room temperature when stored in either aluminum foil laminated bag or metalite bag...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} a test rig, with electro-hydraulic actuation, adopted to characterize vibration isolators (vibration absorbers for machineries, seismic isolators, etc.). The machine was designed primarily to characterize elastomeric seismic isolators {{in order to find}} their hysteretic response under periodic deformations and to give its mathematical expression (i. e. by means of the Bouc-Wen model). The test rig can also be used as a vibrating table in order to simulate horizontal ground motions and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of small isolated systems, sensitive to accelerations. An application could be the study of <b>electric</b> <b>cabinets</b> or statues subject to seismic accelerations. In the first application the motion of the shake table of the rig is contrasted by the insulators restoring force; in the second case the actions derive from the relative motion between the shake table itself and the suspended body; in both cases the control system must guarantee the desired motion of the shake table or the desired force acting on it. The goal of the paper is to present a mathematical model of the electro-hydraulic actuation necessary to develop an accurate control system. The model parameters have been obtained using an iterative optimization technique starting from experimental data. The proposed method can be also used in many systems hydraulically actuated, whereby the identification of several parameters, is required to study the system dynamics...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of speaker combinations used in guitar speaker cabinets, including one 12" [...] speaker, one 15" [...] speaker (this {{is more common}} for bass amplifiers than for <b>electric</b> guitar <b>cabinets),</b> two 10" [...] speakers, four 10" [...] speakers, four 12" [...] speakers, or eight 10" [...] speakers. Less commonly, guitar cabinets may contain different sizes of speaker in the same cabinet. Cabinets with eight 10" [...] speakers are large and heavy, and they are often equipped with wheels and a [...] "towel bar"-style handle for transport. Some cabinets use mixed speaker types, such as one 15" [...] speaker and two 10" [...] speakers.|$|R
5000|$|The cones {{of these}} drivers {{typically}} {{range in size}} from 6.5&thinsp;in to 15&thinsp;in with 10 and 12&thinsp;in models being the most popular for electric guitar and electric bass combo amps and speaker cabinets. As with all loudspeaker drivers, the magnets are usually made from Alnico, ceramic, or, to reduce weight on more expensive models, neodymium. Higher quality Alnico magnets are reserved for more expensive models. Well-known guitar speaker manufacturers include Jensen, Celestion, Eminence, Electro-Voice, JBL, Peavey, and Vox. Small practice amps often have 6.5&thinsp; or 8&thinsp; speakers. Combination (or [...] "combo") amplifier cabinets often have one or more 10 and 12&thinsp; speakers. The largest speaker [...] "stacks", used in stadium concerts, have eight 10 or 12&thinsp;in speakers. Bass amplifier speaker cabinets for the bass guitar also often use one or more 10 or 12&thinsp;in speakers (both 2x10&thinsp;in and 4x10&thinsp;in cabinets are popular; in addition, bass cabinets are more likely than <b>electric</b> guitar <b>cabinets</b> to use 15&thinsp;in speakers.|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of project}} is to develop and realize AS-I bus {{repeater}} with interface to optical wire. Communication over optical wires can prolong distances between AS-I units to hundred of meters. This solution is advantage in industry where each of AS-I units are placed far away {{of each other and}} electromagnetic field disturbance can affect communication over network. AS-I is lowest control level in industrial communication technology. Here, binary actuators and sensors in the field and process area are networked. Many of the devices connected, supply or require binary signals. The necessary data volume is small, but the speed of data transmission is very high. The first part of {{project is to}} design schematic and printed circuit board in developing system EAGLE 4. 11. Verify function on testing board and make measurements with optical wire. A criterion for communication is data speed communication which has to be lower than 5 ms in complete occupied 31 slaves’ bus. The second part of project is to made function sample of AS-I Repeatr and build it to package that is suitable for assembly to DIN ledge and into industrial <b>electric</b> switching <b>cabinet...</b>|$|R
50|$|Alzheimer disease {{presents}} specific {{challenges for}} caregivers, {{who need to}} make the home as accessible as possible to the elderly resident, while keeping safety features in mind. Removable stove switch knobs, locks on kitchen <b>cabinets,</b> <b>electric</b> kettles with automatic shut-off, and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person with Alzheimer disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.|$|R
40|$|An energy {{efficient}} method of defrosting the evaporator on a frozen retail display cabinet {{was developed and}} its performance {{compared with that of}} the existing <b>electric</b> defrost. The <b>cabinet</b> was modified so that either defrost system could be deployed, leaving the rest of the system operation untouched. Performance of the cabinet during EN 23953 standard tests was compared. Total energy consumption during the tests was 40 % lower with the novel defrost. This was partly due to elimination of the use of electrical defrost power (which reduced direct electrical power by 39 %). Since the system leads to lower liquid refrigerant temperatures at the expansion valve there is a saving in compressor power for the same refrigeration effect and as the defrost is quicker, the temperature excursions inside the cabinet are smaller, reducing the amount of heat which has to be removed after a defrost. The cabinet can also be run at a higher evaporating temperature, further reducing energy consumption...|$|R
5000|$|Speaker {{cabinets}} {{designed for}} bass usually use larger loudspeakers (or more loudspeakers, {{in the case}} of the popular 4x10" [...] cabinets, which contain four 10" [...] speakers) than the cabinets used for other instruments, so that they can move the larger amounts of air needed to reproduce low frequencies. Bass players have to use more powerful amplifiers than the electric guitarists, because deep bass frequencies take more power to amplify. As such, in a band in which the electric guitar player is using a 50 watt guitar amp, the bass player will typically use a 200 watt to 300 watt bass amp. While the largest speakers commonly used for regular electric guitar are 12" [...] speakers, <b>electric</b> bass speaker <b>cabinets</b> often use 15" [...] speakers. Bass players who play styles of music that require an extended low-range response, such as death metal, sometimes use speaker cabinets with 18" [...] speakers or add a large subwoofer cabinet to their rig.|$|R
