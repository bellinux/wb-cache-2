25|$|Ben-Gal {{described}} {{the battle to}} Eitan {{and told him he}} was not sure he could hold on. Eitan asked him to hold on for another half-hour. At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of the}} nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Chartjackers was overwhelmingly negative. Although radio stations, {{newspapers and magazines}} were all canvassed, the show was largely ignored by the mainstream media and received generally negative reviews. It was misrepresented in an article on The Times website, which mistook the four boys for a new boy band. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Radio 1's Chart Blog said that the project showed a basic [...] "contempt for music" [...] and [...] "the public at large". James Masterton of Yahoo! Music called Chartjackers [...] "something of a failure" [...] and its charting [...] "lacklustre". He did not mention it at all in his weekly chart podcast. Neither Reggie Yates nor Scott Mills, two of the DJs whose Twitter feeds were spammed during episode eight, were impressed by {{the way that the}} Chartjackers team had tried to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E

500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} {{what it felt like}} to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention.</b> Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E

2500|$|In a New York City park, hippies have {{gathered}} with guitars to sing protest songs. Fritz {{and his buddies}} show up {{in an attempt to}} meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves trying to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention,</b> but find that the girls are more interested in the crow standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about blacks, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark, indicates that he is gay and walks away. Fritz invites the girls to [...] "seek the truth", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have group sex in the bathtub. Meanwhile, the police (portrayed as pigs) arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the party-goers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in marijuana. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a synagogue. Fritz manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into Israel.|$|E

If he asks the wrong question, makes a wrong assumption, shows the wrong item, or encounters someone at a restricted place (either by noticing him or <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention),</b> he may confuse or anger the person.

'The challenge was <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> to let them know of the work we do and the people whose lives we help improve'. The result is a platformer-style game where players use a Mario-like character (with mustache, overalls and hat) to interact with 'depression' themed items, such as giving sad (black) dogs bones, opening locked doors with keys, and avoiding pounding boxing gloves.

Ever since, the trio have wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele who has always hated the trio. Ten years later, in 1987, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually adding a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters (Stephen Collins and Carly Craig), decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} if a technology that is recently available for the majority of the consumers, like Augmented Reality, can be an interesting component in their buying process, and at the same time understand if this technology can be used by the companies to effectively reach the customers. Augmented Reality is a technology that mixes the real and virtual worlds through proper devices and applications, generating augmented content that is not possible to see without the devices, and it is recently being used by the companies in campaigns and in different ways to promote their products and brands. From conducting this study, it is possible to understand that the consumers are open to embrace this new technology in their daily lives, and use them in their buying process not only to have fun and entertainment, but also to get discount opportunities before buying a product. It is also understandable that by using this technology to promote products and create new campaigns, the companies can establish a strong relation/connection with the customers by reaching them in different and original ways, <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> and participation in specific campaigns...|$|R

40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a “sequentially flashing diamond” arrow panel display as an advance caution warning in temporary work zones. This display was evaluated by comparing it to flashing line and flashing four-corner modes. When surveyed, 33 state transportation agencies rated each display about the same in terms of effectiveness. Daytime and nighttime field trials using the three modes were conducted in two work zones set up on highway shoulders. Nine hours of evaluation time at each site was divided into three, three-hour test periods, with each display operating for one hour. Hourly average and 85 th percentile speeds recorded during the tests were lower than corresponding hourly baseline speeds for all display modes. The greatest speed reductions occurred when the diamond display was operating. Additionally, motorists at a highway rest area were surveyed about the three displays that were operating in the parking area. Over 70 % of 274 respondents chose the diamond display as the most effective at <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention,</b> and 80 % said {{they would like to see}} the diamond used when work is taking place on Oregon highways. However, 61 % found the three displays confusing, particularly the line and the four-corner.

40|$|Purpose/Aim: To {{create a}} {{communication}} strategy for PADI Nordic {{with the intention}} of getting Swedish divers, who have been certified abroad, to Swedish dive centers. Material/Method: The study is based on a number of personal interviews conducted with a) divers who are active in Sweden, b) divers who are not active in Sweden and c) representatives from PADI and PADI affiliated dive centers. Main results: The main reason that people who have been certified abroad do not dive in Sweden is that they regard it as being too complicated, too cold, too expensive and with nothing interesting to see. These might partly be misconceptions that can be corrected through a communication strategic effort. The best way to change this perception is by two different forms of communication. One will go from PADI Nordic straight to the divers through an email. This will have the purpose of <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention,</b> making diving sound interesting and raise their awareness in preparation for {{the other part of the}} process. The other part is communication from PADI affiliated dive centres directed towards the divers. This will be in the form of more traditional marketing, and will have the purpose of making diving in Sweden sound easy, uncomplicated and price worthy. Hopefully this will bring people in to the dive centres, and in the ideal case they will in time also bring their friends along – by becoming the first link in a two step flow of communication. ...|$|R
