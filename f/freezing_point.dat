30|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the effect of molecular branching and carbon number distribution on the viscosity and <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> properties of synthetic jet fuel, it was required to prepare mixtures consisting of different i:n mass ratios and carbon number distributions. The statistical design of experiments was employed for specifying the optimal set of blends to achieve the objectives of this study. The <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> of each blend was measured using a Phase Technology® FP- 70 X <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> analyser conforming to the requirements of the ASTM D 5972 method.

Reducing the <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent—in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E

One adaptation of lepidopteran insects for overwinter survival is the sequestration of antifreeze solutes in the hemolymph prior to pupal diapause.

5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b> The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b> This is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together.

In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E

30|$|Coetzer et al. [19] applied dual {{response}} surface optimization for optimising the variable {{conditions for a}} coal gasification process, and discussed a number of approaches for multiple response optimizations. The Design-Expert® software [16] applies the desirability function approach of Derringer and Suich [20] for multiple response optimizations. Two properties of jet fuel blends were measured in this study, i.e., viscosity (y_ 1) and <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> (y_ 2), as functions of the i:n mass ratio and carbon number distribution. According to APU specifications the <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> of Jet A- 1 is required to be lower than −[*] 47  °C with minimum viscosity. Let the target for <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> be T_ 2 = ŷ_ 2,min, i.e., the minimum value of the predicted <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> from the model. Now the predicted value is transformed to a new value d_ 2 through a desirability function, which can also {{be viewed as the}} degree of satisfaction in reaching the target. The degree of satisfaction of the experimenter with respect to the mean response is maximised when ŷ_ 2 = T_ 2 and decreases as ŷ_ 2 moves away from T_ 2. The experimenter does not accept any solution for which ŷ_ 2 > ŷ_ 2,max, which in the case of <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> is specified as ŷ_ 2,max = - 47  °C. Thus the satisfaction level with respect to the mean response can be modelled by a function which increases monotonically from 0, at ŷ_ 2 = ŷ_ 2,max to 1, at ŷ_ 2 = T_ 2. The desirability value of the mean response, which is denoted as d_ 2, is interpreted as the degree to which ŷ_ 2 satisfies the target on the mean and is a value between 0 and 1.|$|R

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b> The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
30|$|The major flaw of the {{experimental}} observations and the developed model was that it could account neither for {{the strength of the}} crystal lattice, nor for the fact that many organic molecules crystallise in different crystal structures (polymorphism).

5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the <b>freezing</b> <b>point.</b> Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E

30|$|If {{the effects}} of crystal {{formation}} were disregarded, it could be concluded that the ideal i:n mass ratio and carbon number distribution for jet fuels with a maximum viscosity of 4.5  cSt at −[*] 20  °C and a maximum <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> of −[*] 47  °C, is as presented in Table  4. Furthermore, if {{the aim was to}} minimise both <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> and viscosity, the ideal i:n mass ratio would be 1 : 0 and the mixture would consist largely of C 9 –C 11 mixture components. However, if the model was able to account for crystal formation, the ideal i:n mass ratio as well as the ideal carbon number distribution of the above mentioned optimisation studies may have differed. From the results obtained it is evident that i:n mass ratio and carbon number distribution cannot be treated as two separate entities. Altering either of these compositional parameters would impact on the remaining parameter. To adhere to the <b>freeze</b> <b>point</b> specification maximum, the carbon number distribution of jet fuel mixtures would have to be decreased and the relative proportions of the C 9 –C 11 components should be increased as the n-paraffin content of the mixtures is increased.|$|R
