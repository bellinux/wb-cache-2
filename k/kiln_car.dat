40|$|The <b>kiln</b> <b>car</b> {{is widely}} used {{as a kind of}} {{transport}} equipment in the current ceramic industry, and it is heated to the firing temperature and cooled down to the ambient temperature with products in the tunnel kiln. And the burning of the ceramics requires a lot of energy, and the efficiency is relatively low within 30 % or even less. In addition, the mass ratio between car and ware can be more than 50 %. So the energy loss of car also occupies a great part in total energy consumption. In this work, a mathematical model will be created to describe the temperature distribution inside the <b>kiln</b> <b>car</b> while it travels through the tunnel kiln. All the used parameters are from real ceramic industry. The operative process is assumed as a countercurrent heat exchanger. Both the convection and radiation are considered as boundary condition in the model. Furthermore, the thermal results of car and the specific energy consumption of car in the standard case will be demonstrated. Finally, the influences of different thermal physical parameters on the energy consumption of car will be investigated, and the possible optimization measures of car are proposed through comparing the different specific energy losses...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{history of}} civilization is {{concurrent}} {{to the use}} of brick and its manufacturing. Brick kiln is the most important component in the manufacturing of clay-burnt bricks. Poorly operated brick kilns are considered as the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission nowadays. Various types of brick kilns are in operation throughout the world. Tunnel kiln is the most widely used technology in developed countries as it is highly automated. Other technologies which are quite popular in developing countries are: Hoffman kiln, Vertical Shaft kiln, Fixed Chimney kiln, Zigzag kiln, etc. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS CFX is being applied to evaluate performance of Tunnel kiln using natural gas as its fuel. The idea of a typical Tunnel kiln layout geometry has been envisaged from local brick industries. The length, width and height of the Tunnel kiln geometry are taken as 100 m × 3. 24 m × 1. 48 m. The length and width of the brick stack is taken as 920 mm × 440 mm. With a gap of 400 mm and 100 mm between two brick stacks longitudinally and laterally respectively, a total of 450 (6 × 75) stacks can be accommodated inside the kiln at a time. Brick stack height including the <b>kiln</b> <b>car</b> height is taken as 1. 38 m. There is a clearance of 100 mm between the stack and the kiln roof. To produce certain quality bricks/ceramics, a particular temperature distribution throughout the kiln needs to be maintained. This temperature distribution with respect to the kiln length is known as Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the Tunnel kiln curve obtained from industry for ordinary brick type, some design parameters need to be optimized for a given geometry.  Selection of these optimized design parameters are obtained through a series of trial and error runs of the CFD model. The total length of the tunnel can be divided into pre-heating, firing and cooling zones. Green bricks pass through the pre-heating, then firing and finally the cooling zones, while fresh air flows in opposite direction of the brick stack move. It is to be noted that brick industries are very reluctant to disclose any of those technical secrets related to their brick kiln design. In this regard, this design is based on initial guesses of those parameters and slowly come up with best performing scenario with respect to considered Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the Tunnel kiln curve, the design parameters that need to be played around are gas and air flow rates, flow directions, their inlet-outlet number, spacing and placements at different locations of the kiln are considered very crucial. Other important parameters that are varied include brick stack placement with respect to air and gas inlet-outlets, gaps between iv kiln roof and stacks and gaps between two consecutive stacks. To supply adequate air, a large rectangular air inlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed at the roof of the exit end of the kiln. To maintain the air temperature distribution as given in Tunnel kiln curve, one intermediate size air outlet with an area of 0. 4 m 2 and a series of 13 rows × 12 columns small air inlet-outlets (openings) are also placed at the roof of the kiln in the cooling zone. All these heated air has been transferred to dryer to dry the green bricks. A series of 12 rows × 12 columns of gas inlets are placed in the roof of the firing zone. At the entry end of the tunnel, a flue gas outlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed in the roof.  Due to three dimensional nature of the kiln geometry, the CFD simulation of the whole system would be very time consuming. A close look of the geometry dictates that, a one-sixth slit of the total geometry (100 m × 3. 24   61 × m) containing 1 row × 75 stacks of bricks is enough to simulate the whole geometry of the kiln. This modelled geometry is meshed and mesh independency is checked using ANSYS Mesh. Turbulence, combustion and radiation models are adopted to simulate a realistic Tunnel kiln environment using ANSYS CFX Pre.  Several model runs are performed until the simulated temperature distributions obtained closely replicate the Tunnel kiln curve of the industry. From these simulations, the optimum Tunnel kiln design is suggested. The resulting CO 2 and NO emissions are also obtained from these simulations. Gas inlet velocity is proposed to be 6 m/s with an inlet diameter of 25 mm.  Gas velocity direction is suggested to be normal to the kiln roof. Air flow direction should be at 14 o with kiln roof towards firing zone. Gaps between brick stacks and the kiln roof should be about 200 mm. To get a uniform distribution of heated gases, positions of the brick stacks are such that on each occasion of its changed position it would be just directly below the inlet jets. Gaps between two consecutive brick stacks should also be reduced to 200 mm instead of the initially assumed 400 mm spacing. Hence additional number of bricks could be accommodated inside the kiln at a time which will result higher production of bricks with the same amount of fuel...|$|E

50|$|Shuttle Kilns: {{this is a}} car-bottom kiln with a door on one or both ends. Burners are {{positioned}} top and bottom on each side, creating a turbulent circular air flow. This type of kiln is generally a multi-car design and is used for processing whitewares, technical ceramics and refractories in batches. Depending upon size and mass of ware, shuttle kilns may be equipped with car moving devices to transfer fired and unfired ware {{in and out of}} the kiln. Shuttle kilns can be either updraft or downdraft in design. A Shuttle Kiln derives its name from the fact that <b>kiln</b> <b>cars</b> can enter a shuttle kiln from either end of the kiln for processing, whereas a tunnel kiln has flow in only one direction.|$|R

It was written by Kanagae Sanbee himself and given to Taku, the ruling family of the region of Taku. In this memorandum, he claimed that after the arrival in Japan, he had taken service with Taku Yasutoshi [...] "for few years," [...] and then had moved with some 18 people, mostly children, from Taku to Arita in 1616. It is not clear how he earned his living for nearly 20 years, between the end of his service and the supposed migration of 1616. A more interesting fact is that he did not claim that he had been a potter before his arrival or brought to Japan for his talent. He claimed that he carried (<b>kiln)</b> <b>cars</b> in his supposed migration of 1616. Also he noted that his men had included three of the [...] "original potters of Taku" [...] (多久本皿屋), whose identity is unclear.|$|R

The type of pollutant, storage conditions, storage time, and method of sample conditioning significantly affected the reported weights of air pollutants. It was found that the magnitude of the weight loss caused by a particular type pollutant and pre-weighing procedure was dependent on the percent of organic matter initially present. The method of sample conditioning had the greatest effect on weight losses. This effect, again, was dependent on the percent of organic matter initially present.
