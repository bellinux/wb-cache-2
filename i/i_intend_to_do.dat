2500|$|On March 7, 2013, {{after hearing}} {{arguments}} in the case, Friedman {{announced that he would}} delay ruling pending the outcome of two same-sex marriage cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. National LGBT advocacy groups had recommended the delay. On July 1, citing the recent Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, he denied the state officials' motion to dismiss the suit. Friedman heard arguments on motions in the case on October 16, 2013, and said he was unable to rule {{on the basis of the}} arguments. He said: [...] "I'm in the middle. I have to decide this as a matter of law. <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." [...] An attorney for one of the defendants, Oakland County Clerk Lisa Brown, said she was eager to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples as soon as the law allowed her to do so. At the end of that hearing, Friedman scheduled the trial for February 25, 2014. On a motion by the plaintiffs, and over the objections of the defense, Friedman agreed on January 3, 2014, to divide the trial in two, reserving for a second phase, if needed, all discussion of the level of scrutiny appropriate to Michigan's denial of adoption and marriage rights to same-sex couples.|$|E
2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E

60|$|As we rode to Sekera to {{find the}} holy Tanofir I told Bes also, adding that I had {{forgotten}} to reveal that it was I who had spoken Amada's name to the king, but that <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so ere long.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I have silenced him for {{a little}} time only," [...] he said. [...] "And I confess that <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better. <b>I</b> hope, however, that the lesson will suffice {{and that he will}} lie no more--at least {{concerning}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} at {{once and}} with decision that <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{nothing of the sort}} and immediately regretted my words, since, although I spoke in Zulu, I suppose she read their meaning from my face. At any rate she understood the drift of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{ashamed to}} say," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Lavender, [...] "that I do not. But <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in future, {{since it has}} brought me such a vision." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't doubt it, Sam," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "But let {{him come}} on. <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my duty as a cadet, and I am not afraid of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{intend to}} do so. <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that also. But I know that a wife ought to have {{influence}} over her husband, and I believe that you have influence over yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{getting back}} to the house I {{informed}} Miss Halcombe of what <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She looked surprised and uneasy while I was explaining my purpose, but she made no positive objection to the execution of it. She only said, [...] "I hope it may end well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If anybody {{connected}} {{with my family}} has presumed {{to tell you that}} <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more for my niece Lilian than I have already done, such person has not only been false, but ungrateful. I have given to no one any authority to make any promise on behalf of my niece." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, if <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> you harm, little lad, the readiest way were {{to leave}} you here. What! you <b>do</b> not fear <b>to</b> sit beneath the gallows on a new-made grave, and yet you tremble at a friend's touch. Take heart, child, {{and tell me what}} is your name and where is your home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So much so, Louis," [...] I answered, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{everything}} I can {{to solve}} the mystery of Delora's disappearance. I am an idle man, and it will amuse me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps not. We'll {{say nothing}} about that. What <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is this;--to give up the {{property}} into your hands at Lady-day. You shall be master of The Cleeve from that time forth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, as I said before, I {{wished to}} sift the matter myself, if I could. I know I am {{nothing but a}} boy, but <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all I can toward getting back your bonds." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{locked the}} door from the kitchen {{into the house and}} then the outside door of the kitchen, and when my wife came down we hurried off. On the way I told her what <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and what <b>I</b> thought of our guest. She {{answered}} scarcely a word, and I hoped that she was frightened. I think she was.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{made his}} request to me, and I refused it. Had I consented {{to marry him}} last year, all {{this would have been}} different. <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right, and even now I do not think that I was wrong. But I cannot impute fault <b>to</b> him. He <b>does</b> all this in order that I may impute it, and that then he may have his revenge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. I {{will give}} you my reasons this evening when, after a day's consideration, I shall have them ready in a more {{definite}} shape. In the meantime, we had better continue the mining." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{called you}} any names, nor do <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; I only wanted mother {{to know the}} truth of the {{business}} between us. Do you really believe I had any hand in breaking into your store?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My Lord Count," [...] {{answered}} Crawford, [...] "I {{have ordered}} my command for these fifty years without advice either from Frenchman or Burgundian; and <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, under your favour, {{so long as}} I shall continue to hold it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{wonder that}} you ask," [...] said he. [...] "Faith, I should have warned you that <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my best {{from the start}} to put the {{audience}} in a good humour with me. Mademoiselle very nearly ruined everything by refusing to reflect any of my terror. She was not even startled. Another time, mademoiselle, I shall give you full warning of my every intention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. I cannot {{tell what}} Mrs. Gill did; {{but it seemed}} {{impossible}} to me, at the moment, to venture to dispose of your property by sending supplies to soldiers. Provisions for a company of soldiers sounds formidable. How many there are I did not ask; but I {{could not think of}} allowing them to pillage the house, as it were. <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what was right, yet I did not see the case quite clearly, I own." ...|$|R
60|$|This idea {{occurred}} to me when I {{was close to the}} new lodgings which we had taken on returning from the sea-side. I went in without disturbing any one, by the help of my key. A light was in the hall, and I stole up with it to my workroom to make my preparations, and absolutely to commit myself to an interview with the Count, before either Laura or Marian could have the slightest suspicion of what <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do; I can't go myself, but I {{can buy a}} pair {{of strong}} arms to fight for me, and <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. I only hope he'll have the right sort of courage, and be a credit to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} young man, [...] "I {{have come to}} ask your {{permission}} to address her; but whether you give it or not I shall go {{to her mother and}} speak to her. I know her address, and <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything in an honorable way." ...|$|E
60|$|BRASSBOUND. <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The {{law of the}} Atlas Mountains is {{administered}} by the Sheikh Sidi el Assif. He will be here within an hour. He is a judge like yourself. You can talk law to him. He will give you both the law and the prophets.|$|E
60|$|She {{wanted me}} to be happy, to amuse myself, to take exercise, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{whatever}} I thought was pleasant, but she, herself, was so much engrossed with the child, that she was often ignorant of what <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> or had done. She thought she was listening to what I said to her, but, in reality, she was occupied, mind and body, with the baby, or listening for some sound which should indicate that she ought to go and be occupied with it.|$|R
60|$|Luc. Do you {{contradict}} yourself so soon? Then know, sir, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it; and <b>I</b> am {{glad you}} have given me advice so agreeable to my inclinations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, very much; {{that would}} suit me well. It {{is just what}} <b>I</b> had <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but in the {{darkness}} I have no great chance of finding a wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} it won't be sufficient {{for me to}} give it up without making it yours by law also,--which <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I shall stay in town to-morrow and give instructions to Mr. Green. I have thought it proper to tell you this now, in order that you may mention it to Captain Aylmer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the story," [...] he said, concluding. [...] "I love her, though I've {{never told}} her. If I did tell her I'd {{be ready to}} marry her, and that seems {{impossible}} in this country. I'd be afraid to risk taking her anywhere. So <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the best I can for her here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Laughed till {{he cried}} again, {{and told me}} if I did not like it I might leave it; which is just what <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Only mind, if we go, we must needs take Jack Brimblecombe with us, or he will surely heave himself over Harty Point, and his ghost will haunt us to our dying day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Yes, I {{should have}} spoken; I should have put {{everything}} before you; <b>I</b> came <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. But <b>I</b> {{never could have}} spoken to you as you have spoken to me, Rosa.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{think it}} was mean to tie you, when you were so tired and sleepy, for <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it this morning, any way, for you always sleep sound enough in the mornings to let a fellow tie you {{up as much as}} he pleases. And I suppose you'll say it was mean to tie you, any way, but you know well enough that it's no use for me to argue with you, for you wouldn't listen. But now you've got to listen, and I wont let you up till you promise never to call me Rectus again." ...|$|R
60|$|It was, however, {{impossible}} for me entirely to restrain my impulses, and without knowing exactly what <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> advanced toward the house. Very soon I saw its chimneys above the trees which partly surrounded it. Then, peeping under cover of a thicket, I went still nearer, so that, {{if there had been}} any people in the surrounding grounds, I could have seen them; but I saw no one, and I sat down on a log and waited. It shamed me to think that I was secretly watching a house, but despite the shame I continued to sit and watch.|$|R
