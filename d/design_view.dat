40|$|Modern {{product design}} {{complexity}} {{is a problem}} faced by designers of complex geometric products. It {{is very difficult for}} a designer to assimilate the vast amounts of data necessary to produce and understand such complex designs in their totality. Recently, research has been done to better manage design complexity, but little or no work has been done with respect to user interfaces for complexity management tools. In this research, we present a concurrent <b>design</b> <b>views</b> interface to enhance design complexity management. This user interface assists the designer in creation and visualization of complex design frameworks. These <b>design</b> <b>views</b> support different levels of design detail and complexity, and also provide hierarchical design decomposition of complex design frameworks. Concurrency between <b>design</b> <b>views</b> is maintained, thus increasing the overall power of the system. To demonstrate the validity and applicability of this approach in solving complexity management issues, a prototype system implementation of an intuitive user interface built upon an existing complexity management framework is presented...|$|R

In this paper, we propose an approach to designing valid and reversible semistructured views. We employ four types of view operators, namely, select, drop, join and swap operators, and develop a set of rules to maintain the semantics of the views when the swap operator is applied. We also examine the reversible view problem and develop rules to guarantee the <b>designed</b> <b>views</b> are reversible.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{chip design}} {{complexity}} is further increasing through multi-processor system-on-chip built up from macro blocks. System-level design promises {{to close the}} growing productivity gap between hardware and software design but more sophisticated design models are needed. Therefore, we developed {{a new model of}} system-level design abstraction. Therein, three <b>views</b> divide the <b>design</b> space to reduce design complexity. A unified design process with five steps has been defined for the <b>design</b> <b>views.</b> Furthermore, we show that the model is able to formalize system-level design exploration. Finally, exploration has been considered as walk through the <b>design</b> <b>views</b> connected via inter-view links. With the proposed system-level model, the authors provide conceptual foundations to more holistic design and introduce formalization of design exploration.

At the beginning of an episode, McCloud meets the clients embarking on the project; he visits the site with them, and discusses the plans for the building. A computer visualisation or computer-aided <b>design</b> <b>view</b> of the intended project is shown. Once ground work commences, he visits the site periodically, following the build progress, noting any changes, hitches or delays; the build frequently runs over budget and completes later than scheduled. McCloud will often do a piece to camera concentrating on any unique materials or features in the house. He visits again once the building is then made watertight, and the first and second fixes have commenced. He makes a final visit to the site in its finished or near-finished state, once the occupants have moved in. A tour of the house is then given; McCloud brings the episode to a close summarising the house, its construction, and his opinions.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years many views have emerged that {{maximize}} the utilization of design research in Information Systems (IS) application development. A recent insightful debate in the IS community has suggested two major <b>design</b> <b>views</b> in IS research: a) a pragmatic technical artifact orientation, and b) a theory-grounded user and meta-artifact focus. The first (pragmatic design-based) view focuses on explicit knowledge and on a step-by-step methodology for innovative artifact design and building. The second (theory-grounded) view more broadly emphasizes meta-artifact design in IS development and a more prescriptive guidance approach that is grounded in design research. The debate between these two views leads to the question: which method is more suitable for Decision Support System (DSS) design? In extending the debate on <b>design</b> <b>views</b> in IS research, this paper evaluates a DSS application through both the utility of the pragmatic and the socio-technical <b>design</b> research <b>views.</b> This helps create a methodological foundation for industry-oriented DSS design and evaluation. The findings suggest that both positions have merit, but the latter <b>view</b> of <b>design</b> science is more suitable for industry-oriented DSS design...|$|R

Satisfaction is one of these factors that affect usability of the system which also directly affect instructors’ performance. In this study, factors related to instructors’ satisfaction in e-learning systems have been investigated in order to develop a basic model called “E-Learning Success Model for Instructors’ Satisfactions” which is related to social, intellectual and technical interactions of instructors in whole e-learning system. “E-Learning Success Model for Instructors’ Satisfactions” could be a basic guide for e-learning designers, online instructors and policy makers to understand interaction and usability outcomes related to satisfaction of instructors...|$|E
40|$|One {{difficulty}} in software maintenance {{is that the}} relationship between observed program behavior and source code is not always clear. In this paper we are concerned specifically with the maintenance of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). User interface code can crosscut the decomposition of applications making GUIs hard to maintain. A popular approach to develop and maintain GUIs is to use “What {{you see is what you}} get ” editors. They allow developers to work directly with a graphical <b>design</b> <b>view</b> instead of scattered source elements. Unfortunately GUI editors are limited by their ability to statically reconstruct dynamic collaborations between objects. In this paper we investigate the combination of a hybrid dynamic and static approach to allow for view-based maintenance of GUIs. Dynamic analysis reconstructs object relationships, providing a concrete context in which maintenance can be performed. Static checking restricts that only changes in the <b>design</b> <b>view</b> which can meaningfully be translated back to source are allowed. We implemented a prototype IDE plugin and evaluate our approach by applying it to five open source projects. 1...|$|E
40|$|Most {{approaches}} in reverse engineering literature generate a single {{view of a}} software system that restricts {{the scope of the}} reconstruction process. We propose an orchestrated set of techniques and a multi-view toolkit to reconstruct three views of a software system such as design, behavior, and structure. Scenarios are central in generating design and behavior views. The <b>design</b> <b>view</b> is reconstructed by transforming a number of scenarios into design diagrams using a novel scenario schema and generating an objectbase of actors and actions and their dependencies. The behavior view is represented by different sets of functions that implement different features of the software system corresponding to a set of feature-specific scenarios that are derived from the <b>design</b> <b>view.</b> Finally, the structure view is reconstructed using modules and interconnections that are resulted by growing the core functions related to the software features that are extracted during the behavior recovery. This orchestrated view reconstruction technique provides a more accurate and comprehensive means for reverse engineering of a software system than a single view reconstruction approach. As case studies we applied the proposed multi-view approach on two systems, Xfig drawing tool and Pine email system...|$|E
