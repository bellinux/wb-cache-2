5|$|In both corpora {{there were}} many more monosyllables/single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon. That is, in both a {{relatively}} small number of such forms are very frequent, suggesting that rongorongo <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with Rapanui, which has a small number of very frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles. Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and final position within a word/ligature.|$|E
5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|The K-TAG <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with NationalPass, used {{in several}} other states, PikePass in {{neighbouring}} Oklahoma, and as of May 17, 2017, the K-TAG became compatible with the TxTag, EZ TAG, and Toll Tag in Texas.

50|$|Disparate {{pieces of}} glass must <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> {{in order to}} ensure they can be fused properly. It is a common {{misconception}} that glasses having the same coefficient of expansion (COE) will <b>be</b> <b>compatible.</b> Coefficient of expansion is one indicator that glasses may <b>be</b> <b>compatible,</b> but there <b>are</b> many other factors that determine whether glasses <b>are</b> <b>compatible.</b> If incompatible glasses are fused together, {{it is unlikely that the}} fused piece will be able maintain structural integrity. The piece may shatter during the cooling process, or develop stress originating from the point of contact between the incompatible glasses over time, leading to fractures within the glass, and eventually breakage.|$|R

5|$|The PC {{version was}} poorly {{received}} due to numerous performance and stability issues, mostly on Nvidia GPUs, along with restrictions {{imposed by the}} Universal Windows Platform that keep users from resorting to third-party workarounds. Remedy later announced that they were working actively to fix the issues. A Steam release was announced, and this version <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with Windows 7 or higher.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with iOS 7, {{which was}} {{released}} on September 18, 2013. However, some features are not supported.

5000|$|Borland {{used the}} name Object Pascal for the {{programming}} {{language in the}} first versions of Delphi, but later renamed it to the Delphi programming language. However, compilers that claim to <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with Object Pascal are often trying to <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with Delphi source code. Because Delphi <b>is</b> trademarked, <b>compatible</b> compilers continued using the name Object Pascal.|$|R

5|$|Vanadium foil {{is used in}} {{cladding}} titanium {{to steel}} because it <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with both iron and titanium. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor.|$|E
5|$|While anti-statism {{is central}} to all forms of anarchism, some schools of anarchism also oppose other forms of {{authority}} {{in the conduct of}} human relations. Anarchism <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with various economic systems, and there are capitalist, geoist, mutualist, and socialist forms. Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics.|$|E

It plays an important role in breaking down wood and recycling nutrients into the soil.|$|E
5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device {{includes a}} dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector {{is used for}} both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E
5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E

50|$|Upgrades of {{hardware}} involve {{a risk that}} new hardware will not <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with other pieces {{of hardware}} in a system. For example, an upgrade of RAM may not <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with existing RAM in a computer. Other hardware components may not <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> after either an upgrade or downgrade, due to the non-availability of compatible drivers for the hardware with a specific operating system. Conversely, there is the same risk of non-compatibility when software is upgraded or downgraded for previously functioning hardware to no longer function.|$|R
5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.|$|E
5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, <b>is</b> <b>compatible</b> with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
