500|$|Beginning {{on the day}} of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each {{attempting}} to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. [...] Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen. [...] Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. [...] Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. [...] Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred. [...] Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself. [...] There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. [...] When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, [...] "On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [...] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> very heartily and ordered him from the Point." ...|$|E

But, oh, Doc," [...] I said, with a sigh, as <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> on the shin--"good old Doc--it was glorious!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So {{he came up}} {{and caught}} us. And wasn't he in a jolly good rage? that's all. He stamped, and called me names, and got hold of me to shake me, but I know <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> well, and I had quite a handful out of his whisker; but you see poor little Awkey is only a girl, and couldn't help squalling, so papa came up.' ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{a debate}} for an Anti-Puppy Mill Bill, {{which was a}} central focus for the First Lady of North Carolina, Ann McCrory's {{legislative}} interests, Speciale stated: “Exercise {{on a daily basis}} - if <b>I</b> <b>kick</b> <b>him</b> across the floor, is that daily exercise? ‘Euthanasia performed humanely’ - so I should choose the ax or the baseball bat?” ...|$|R
60|$|REGINALD [rising] How could <b>I</b> <b>kick</b> <b>him</b> {{out of the}} house? He's {{stronger}} than me: he could have kicked me out {{if it came to}} that. He did kick me out: what else was it but kicking out, to take my wife's affections from me and establish himself in my place? [He comes to the hearth].|$|R
6000|$|Ned Hampton laughed derisively. 'You hulking giant,' he said, 'if you or any {{one else}} {{attempts}} to dictate to me <b>I</b> will <b>kick</b> <b>him</b> {{out of the}} saloon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{after days}} Bastin, by some {{peculiar}} mental process, canonised {{her in his}} imagination {{as a kind of}} saint. [...] "So loving," [...] he would say, [...] "such a devoted wife! Why, my dear Humphrey, I can assure you that {{even in the midst of}} her death-struggle her last thoughts were of me," [...] words that caused Bickley to snort with more than usual vigour, until <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> to silence beneath the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I got held up in {{an alley}} off Washington Avenue, and they got the last twenty bones off'n me, and I was flatter 'n a pancake. So I says 'ish kabibble,' and I sneaks onto the blind baggage, and bums my way West. You'd 'a' died {{laughing}} to seen me throwing my feet for grub. Oh, I'm some panhandler! There was one Frau sicked her dog onto me, and <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> in the jaw and---- Oh, it was one swell hike." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am reasonable, Mary," [...] roared the gallant soldier, {{becoming}} a rich purple. [...] "I know my duty, thank God! and I'm {{going to do}} it. When a man insults my daughter, it's my duty, as a gentleman and an officer, {{to give him a}} jolly good thrashing. When that twopenny sawbones of a doctor was rude to you, I licked him within an inch of his life. <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> till he begged for mercy; and if more men had the courage to take the law into their own hands, there'd be fewer damned blackguards in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{landlord}} annoyed me," [...] he said. [...] "I {{had to go}} back.... I wish <b>I</b> had <b>kicked</b> <b>him.</b> Hairy beast! If anything had happened, you see, {{he would}} have had his mean money. I couldn't bear to leave him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, we {{just ran}} wild, you know. Fool stunts!... Once Roy was sore because <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> {{cigarettes}} out of Bob's mouth.

But if you do the same for another boy--good night!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are broad spears {{that would}} make a big hole," [...] remarked Hans again, whereupon <b>I</b> rose to <b>kick</b> <b>him</b> out, for his ideas were, as usual, unpleasant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pan, you {{remember}} me tellin' you aboot Purcell, who jumped my claim with young Hardman?" [...] queried Blinky. [...] "Wal, Purcell was there, settin' some tables back of where you made your stand. I seen him when we first went in. Course everybody quit playin' cards when you called old Hardman. An' I made it my particular biz {{to get close to}} Purcell. He was pullin' his gun under the table when <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him.</b> An' when he looked up he seen somethin', you can bet on thet.... Wal, Purcell is one man in Hardman's outfit we'll have to kill.... Gus will back me up on thet." ...|$|E
60|$|My first {{interview}} with Dr. James Winter was under dramatic circumstances. It occurred {{at two in}} the morning in the bedroom of an old country house. <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> twice on the white waistcoat and knocked off his gold spectacles, while he with the aid of a female accomplice stifled my angry cries in a flannel petticoat and thrust me into a warm bath. I am told that one of my parents, who happened to be present, remarked in a whisper that there was nothing the matter with my lungs. I cannot recall how Dr. Winter looked at the time, for I had other things to think of, but his description of my own appearance is far from flattering. A fluffy head, a body like a trussed goose, very bandy legs, and feet with the soles turned inwards--those are the main items which he can remember.|$|E
60|$|Later on I {{also must}} have slept, for I dreamt {{that as the}} result of my having engaged in single combat with a dragon, the dragon, {{ignoring}} all the rules of Fairyland, had swallowed me. It was hot and stuffy in the dragon's stomach. He had, so it appeared to me, disgracefully overeaten himself; there were hundreds of us there, entirely undigested, including Mother Hubbard and a gentleman named Johnson, against whom, at that period, I entertained a strong prejudice by reason of our divergent views upon the subject of spelling. Even in this hour of our mutual discomfort Johnson would not leave me alone, but persisted in asking me how I spelt Jonah. Nobody was looking, so <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him.</b> He sprang up and came after me. I tried to run away, but became wedged between Hop-o'-my-Thumb and Julius Caesar. I suppose our tearing about must have hurt the dragon, for at that moment he gave vent to a most fearful scream, and I awoke to find the fat man rubbing his left shin, while we struggled slowly, with steps growing ever feebler, against a sea of brick that every moment closed in closer round us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do {{whatsoever}} you say, so {{that you}} spare my life," [...] he whined, and <b>I</b> could have <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> for failing to show {{the spirit of a}} decent lad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold me, Goza," [...] I muttered, and he {{like a good}} fellow {{clutched}} me by the ankle, whereon <b>I</b> promptly <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> in the mouth, {{at least}} my foot <b>kicked</b> <b>him,</b> not my will. Now I was walking towards that Shape--shadow or woman--like {{a man in his}} sleep, and as I came she stretched out her arms and smiled oh! as sweetly as an angel, though I felt quite sure that she was nothing of the sort.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite a {{converted}} character, ain't he, Doctor?" [...] sarcastically remarked Quick, {{who had been}} watching this edifying scene. [...] "Nasty Eastern temper all gone; no Hebrew talk of eye for eye or tooth for tooth, but kisses the fist that smote him in the best Christian spirit. All the same, I wouldn't trust the swine further than <b>I</b> could <b>kick</b> <b>him,</b> especially in the dark, which," [...] he added meaningly, [...] "is {{what it will be}} to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} thing, but now I recall that {{about two years ago}} a great savage with a high nose, who talked a sort of Arabic which, like Inez, I understand, having lived on the coast, turned up one day and said he wanted to trade. I asked him what in, and he {{answered}} {{that he would like to}} buy some children. I told him that I was not a slave-dealer. Then he looked at Inez, who was moving about, and said that he would like to buy her to be a wife for his Chief, and offered some fabulous sum in ivory and in gold, which he said should be paid before she was taken away. I snatched his big spear from his hand, broke it over his head and gave him the best hiding with its shaft that he had ever heard of. Then <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> off the place. He limped away but when he was out of reach, turned and called out that one day he would come again with others and take her, meaning Inez, without leaving the price in ivory and gold. I ran for my gun, but when I got back he had gone and I never thought of the matter again from that day to this." ...|$|E
6000|$|Time passed, {{and we saw}} no more of him. The {{season of}} the full moon came round, when a man thinks shame to lie sleeping; and I {{continued}} until late--perhaps till twelve or one in the morning--to walk on the bright sand and in the tossing shadow of the palms. I played, as I wandered, on a flageolet, which occupied much of my attention; the fans overhead rattled in the wind with a metallic chatter; and a bare foot falls at any rate almost noiseless on that shifting soil. Yet when I got back to Equator Town, where all the lights were out, and my wife (who was still awake, and had been looking forth) asked me who it was that followed me, I thought she spoke in jest. [...] "Not at all," [...] she said. [...] "I saw him twice as you passed, walking close at your heels. He only left you {{at the corner of}} the maniap'; he must be still behind the cook-house." [...] Thither I ran--like a fool, without any weapon--and came face to face with the cook. He was within my tapu-line, which was death in itself; he could have no business there at such an hour but either to steal or to kill; guilt made him timorous; and he turned and fled before me in the night in silence. As he went <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> in that place where honour lies, and he gave tongue faintly like an injured mouse. At the moment I dare say he supposed it was a deadly instrument that touched him.|$|E

60|$|I {{found his}} {{attitude}} trying. That he, {{the cause of}} all the trouble, should be so obviously regarding it as a sporting contest got up for his entertainment, was hard to bear. And the fact that, whatever might happen to myself, {{he was in no}} danger, comforted me not at all. If I could have felt that we were in any way companions in peril, I might have looked on the bulbous boy with quite a friendly eye. As it was, <b>I</b> nearly <b>kicked</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} I hadn't got any," [...] was the injured reply. [...] "He went cut like {{a streak of}} damp lightning. <b>I</b> heard <b>him</b> <b>kicking</b> up an awful hullaballoo in the next office." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that {{to complete the}} story I introduced several other leopards, a mother and two three-part-grown cubs, also a wounded buffalo, and told how Mr. Scroope finished them off {{one after the other}} with a hunting knife. The thing was to watch his face as the history proceeded. Luckily he was sitting next to me and <b>I</b> could <b>kick</b> <b>him</b> under the table. It was all very amusing, and very happy also, for these two really loved each other. Thank God that I, or rather Brother John, was able to bring them together again.|$|R
60|$|Clutching {{the letter}} tightly, I slipped between the narrowed ranks, and gained {{the middle of}} the street, not without a quickened beat of my heart. Thence I sped, dodging this group and that, until I came to the long log house that was called the garrison. Here our men were stationed, where {{formerly}} a squad from an English regiment was quartered. I found Captain Bowman, delivered the letter, and started back again through the brown, dusty street, which lay {{in the shade of the}} great forest trees that still lined it, doubling now and again to avoid an idling brave that looked bent upon mischief. For a single mischance might set the tide running to massacre. I was nearing the gate again, the dust flying from my moccasined feet, the sight of the stalwart Tom giving me courage again. Suddenly, with the deftness of a panther, an Indian shot forward and lifted me high in his arms. To this day I recall my terror as I dangled in mid-air, staring into a hideous face. By intuition <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> in the stomach with all my might, and with a howl of surprise and rage his fingers gripped into my flesh. The next thing I remember was being in the dust, suffocated by that odor which he who has known it can never forget. A medley of discordant cries was in my ears. Then I was snatched up, bumped against heads and shoulders, and deposited somewhere. Now it was Tom's face that was close to mine, and the light of a fierce anger was in his blue eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "My money," [...] he continued, [...] "was no large sum, but I eked it {{out with}} gambling. The luck was always on my side. It's quite true that I ruined {{the father of the}} young lady who paid me a visit to-day. After a {{somewhat}} chequered career he was settling down in a merchant's office in Montreal when I met him. His luck at cards was as bad as mine was good. I won all he had, and more. I believe that he committed suicide. A man there was kind to me, asked me to his house--I persuaded his wife to run away with me. These are amongst the slightest of my delinquencies. I steeped myself in sin. I revelled in it. I seemed to myself in some way to be showing my defiance for the hidden powers of life which I had cursed. I played a match with evil by day and by night until I was glutted. And then I stole away from the city, leaving behind a hideous reputation and not a single friend. Then a new mood came to me. I wanted to get to a place where I should see no human beings at all, and escape in that way from the memories which were still like a clot upon my brain. So I set my face westwards. I travelled till at last civilization lay behind. Still I pushed onward. I had stores in plenty, an Indian servant who chanced to be faithful, and whom I saw but twice a day. At last I reached Lake Ono. Here between us we built a hut. I sent my Indian away then, and when he fawned at my feet to stay <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him.</b> This was my third phase of living, and it was true that some measure of sanity came back to me. Oh, the blessed relief of seeing the face of neither man nor woman. It was the unpeopled world of Nature--uncorrupted, fresh, magnificent, alive by day and by night with everlasting music of Nature. The solitudes of those great forests were like a wonderful balm. So the fevers were purged out of me, and I became once more an ordinary human being. I was content, I think, to die there, for I had plenty to eat and drink, and the animals and birds who came to me morning and evening kept me from even the thought of loneliness. The rest is obvious. I lost two cousins in South Africa, an uncle in the hunting-field. A man in Montreal had recognized me. I was discovered. But before I returned I killed Brooks, the police-court missionary. This girl has forced me to bring him to life again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hitherto, I {{had enjoyed}} myself amazingly; but to-day {{has been the}} crown. In the morning I met Bough on board, with whom I am both {{surprised}} and delighted. He and I have read the same books, and discuss Chaucer, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Fletcher, Webster, and all the old authors. He can quote verses by the page, and has really a very pretty literary taste. Altogether, with all his roughness and buffoonery, a more pleasant, clever fellow you may seldom see. I was very much surprised with him; and he with me. [...] "Where the devil did you read all these books?" [...] says he; and in my heart, I echo the question. One amusing thing I must say. We were both talking about travelling; and I said I was so fond of travelling alone, from the people one met and grew friendly with. [...] "Ah," [...] says he, [...] "but you've such a pleasant manner, you know--quite captivated my old woman, you did--she couldn't talk of anything else." [...] Here was a compliment, even in Sam Bough's sneering tones, that rather tickled my vanity; and really, my social successes {{of the last few}} days, the best of which is yet to come, are enough to turn anybody's head. To continue, after a little go in with Samuel, he going up on the bridge, I looked about me to see who there was; and mine eye lighted on two girls, one of whom was sweet and pretty, talking to an old gentleman. [...] "Eh bien," [...] says I to myself, [...] "that seems the best investment on board." [...] So I sidled up to the old gentleman, got into conversation with him and so with the damsel; and thereupon, having used the patriarch as a ladder, <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> down behind me. Who should my damsel prove, but Amy Sinclair, daughter of Sir Tollemache. She certainly was the simplest, most naïve specimen of girlhood ever I saw. By getting brandy and biscuit and generally coaching up her cousin, who was sick, I ingratiated myself; and so kept her the whole way to Iona, taking her into the cave at Staffa and generally making myself as gallant as possible. I was never so much pleased with anything in my life, as her amusing absence of mauvaise honte: she was so sorry I wasn't going on to Oban again: didn't know how she could have enjoyed herself if I hadn't been there; and was so sorry we hadn't met on the Crinan. When we came back from Staffa, she and her aunt went down to have lunch; and a minute after up comes Miss Amy to ask me if I wouldn't think better of it, and take some lunch with them. I couldn't resist that, of course; so down I went; and there she displayed the full extent of her innocence. I must be sure to come to Thurso Castle the next time I was in Caithness, and Upper Norwood (whence she would take me all over the Crystal Palace) when I was near London; and (most complete of all) she offered to call on us in Edinburgh! Wasn't it delicious?--she is a girl of sixteen or seventeen, too, and the latter I think. I never yet saw a girl so innocent and fresh, so perfectly modest without the least trace of prudery.|$|E

"You see," [...] said Drummond, as if {{answering}} his unspoken thought, [...] "that 'ar gal--for it is a gal in course--hez {{read all}} {{about it in the}} papers, and hez sort o' took a shine to ye. It don't make a bit o' difference who in thunder Cass IS or WAZ, for <b>I</b> reckon she's <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> over by this time--" ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 9, 2007, it was {{reported}} that Jacky has been dropped from 183 Club and its management company due to Jacky's image being battered by his heavy late night partying and crazy love life. 183 Club group manager De-Rung Sun (孫德榮) confirms the dismissal saying, [...] "183 Club is a group; it does not belong to a single person. I know there has not been previous cases dropping members from musical groups before in the entertainment industry Taiwan, but for everyone's good, merely limiting his workload is not enough. Hence <b>I</b> directly <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> out of 183 Club." [...] ("183 Club是團隊，不是哪一個人的，我知道在演藝圈沒這個先例，但為了大家好，光是冷凍他也不行，我直接踢他出183 Club。") ...|$|R

5000|$|I got {{pissed off}} with fashion {{designer}} {{at a party}} always going on about fashion.

5000|$|After Polly died on October 28, 1840, Butterfield married Margaret Lawrence, {{a mother}} of two daughters. Shortly after this marriage, a {{conflict}} arose between Butterfield and Joseph Smith, Jr. over the Lawrence estate, from which Butterfield was set to benefit. Smith represented the two daughters' position. Smith wrote on March 28, 1843, that Butterfield [...] "came to my house and insulted me so outrageously that <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>him</b> out of the house, across the yard, and into the street." [...] Butterfield became disaffected and was excommunicated on October 7, 1844. Jedediah M. Grant took his place in the Presidency.|$|E
