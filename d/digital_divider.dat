Key features of RSFQ technology are high speed, low power and high integration density. In the current international semiconductor roadmap, RSFQ technology is listed as the least risky emerging digital technology. Over two years, the integration density of the RSFQ circuits has been increased more than twice reaching the limit of 12000 active elements per chip. The highest demonstrated clock frequency for large circuits is 60 ~GHz. The conventional benchmark of a static <b>digital</b> <b>divider</b> is on the limit of 360 ~GHz frequency. RSFQ design allows full use of commercial CAD tools and supports normal design flows with digital time/delay optimization and complete verification. RSFQ technology also gains a lot from Multi-Chip-Module (MCM) packaging. The lossless superconducting passive interconnects allow implementation of a high speed System-in-Chip (SiP). Record figures with up to 100 ~Gbit/s transmission for chip-to-chip communication have recently been demonstrated in the USA and Japan. The goal of the research presented in this thesis is to simulate, optimize and design of the superconducting passive interconnects for high integration density RSFQ circuits and superconducting MCM SiP.

40|$|Design of a <b>digital</b> dynamic <b>divider</b> in SiGe bipolar {{technology}} {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed <b>digital</b> dynamic frequency <b>divider</b> is based on two latches connected with negative feedback. However, {{in contrast to the}} conventional static frequency divider the latching differential pair has been completely omitted to reduce the load for the sensing differential pair to extend the maximum operating frequency.

40|$|In modern RF {{system on}} chips (SoCs), the digital content consumes up to 85 % of the IC chip area. The recent push to {{integrate}} multiple RF-SoC cores is met with heavy resistance by the remaining RF/analog circuitry, which creates numerous strong aggressors and weak victims leading to RF performance degradation. A key such mechanism is injection pulling through parasitic coupling between various $LC$-tank oscillators {{as well as}} between them and strong transmitter (TX) outputs. Any static or dynamic frequency proximity between aggressors (i. e., oscillators and TX outputs) and victims (i. e., oscillators) that share the same die causes injection pulling, which produces unwanted spurs and/or modulation distortion. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a new frequency planning technique of a multicore TX where each $LC$-tank oscillator is separated from other aggressors beyond its pulling range. This is done by breaking the integer harmonic frequency relationship of victims/aggressors within and between the RF transmission channels using <b>digital</b> fractional <b>divider</b> based on a phase rotation. Each oscillator's center frequency can be fractionally separated by ~ 28 % but, at the same time, both producing closely spaced frequencies at the phase rotator outputs. The injection-pulling spurs are so far away that they are insignificantly small (- 80 dBc) and coincide with the second harmonic of the carrier.

The first is concerned with the modelling, design and implementation of an extremely high quality factor Bragg resonator. This resonator utilises an aperiodic arrangement of non λ/ 4 low loss alumina plates mounted in a cylindrical waveguide. An ABCD parameter waveguide model is developed to simulate and optimise the cavity. The dielectric plates and air waveguide dimensions are optimised using a genetic algorithm to achieve maximum quality factor by redistributing the energy loss within the cavity. An unloaded quality factor (Q_ 0) of 196, 000 was demonstrated at 9. 93 GHz. In the second part the design, implementation and measurement results for an ultra-low noise floor cross correlation residual phase noise measurement system are shown. A measurement noise floor of - 200 dBc/Hz is achieved for 100, 000 correlations. Residual phase noise measurements are also performed on low noise L-Band microwave amplifiers.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnRF {{frequency}} synthesizer systems are prevalent in today’s electronics. In a synthesizer {{there is a}} sensitive analog oscillator that may be affected by {{two different types of}} noise. The first is random noise injection from active devices. This results in phase noise in the synthesizer’s spectrum. The second noise source is deterministic. A <b>digital</b> frequency <b>divider</b> with high-amplitude switching is an example of such a deterministic source. This noise enters the system through various forms of electric or magnetic field coupling and manifests itself as spurs or pulling. Both forms of noise can adversely affect system performance. We will first summarize methods for reducing noise. These already known steps have to do with layout techniques, device geometry, and general synthesizer topologies. Then we will show ways to isolate noisy interfering circuits from the sensitive analog systems. Finally, we present some considerations for reducing the effects of random noise. A power supply filter can improve the effects of deterministic noise such as undesired signals on the supply line. We show several ways to improve the rejection of high frequency supply noise (characterized by the power supply rejection ratio or PSRR) through the design of a voltage regulator. The emphasis is on new techniques for obtaining good PSRR at S-band frequencies and above. To validate the techniques, we designed a regulator in Peregrine Semiconductor’s. 25 µm ULTRA CMOS Silicon on Sapphire process. It produces a 2. 5 V output with an input ranging from 2. 6 V to 5 V and has a maximum current sourcing of 70 mA. The regulator’s low drop out performance is 60 mV with no load and it achieves a power supply ripple reduction of 29. 8 dB at 500 MHz. To address random noise in synthesizers, the thesis provides preliminary investigation of an oscillator topology change that has been proposed in the literature. This proposed change reduces the phase noise of the oscillator within the overall system. A differential cross-coupled design is the usual topology of choice, but it is not optimal for noise performance. We investigate current noise injection in the traditional design and present an updated design that uses a differential Colpitts oscillator as an alternative to classic cross-coupled designs...|$|R

New electronic devices must support a growing number of wireless standards and their various frequency bands, as the new standards do not replace the older ones.

In receive mode, a frequency synthesizer comprising a high frequency oscillator and programmable <b>digital</b> output <b>divider</b> generates the required wide tuning range. Highly linear switching mixers perform the frequency translation, thereby generating the baseband signals for the embedded processor. However, owing to the pulse-like nature of the synthesizer output and the switching action of the mixer, additional frequency bands are mixed down to baseband together with the desired signal, causing interference. These additional frequency bands, termed harmonic images, are related to the harmonics of the desired frequency. In regular receive applications, harmonic image interference corrupts the desired signal causing bit errors to occur. Harmonic images are also problematic in spectral sensing applications; they cause signal energy to be detected when there actually is none. This thesis presents a method, based on interference cancelling, to significantly reduce the interference caused by the dominating harmonic image. A harmonic rejection radio front-end, which offers up to 40 dB of rejection, is used to generate two complex baseband signals. An interference estimate is generated based on these baseband signals. After equalization to remove amplitude and phase differences, the interference estimate is subtracted from the contaminated received signal, thereby producing a received signal containing less interference. This method was successfully tested using two different front-ends, one built using off-the-shelf components and one fully integrated 65 nm CMOS front-end. Using the latter front-end more than 80 dB of harmonic rejection was observed for the dominating harmonic image. A method for dealing with harmonic image interference was proposed for spectrum sensing applications. The method consists of an analog front-end that uses two quadrature down-converters to generate two complex baseband signals and a digital subband cross-correlator. The second down-converter is tuned Δf Hz higher than the first, resulting in the desired signal band experiencing a shift of Δf, while the harmonic images shift by nΔf, where 'n' is the harmonic image number. This second baseband signal is shifted by -Δf Hz in the digital domain, thereby spectrally re-aligning the desired signal band with the first baseband signal.

Therefore, all harmonic images in the second baseband signal are not spectrally aligned with respect to the first baseband signal.

40|$|Abstract There is {{a growing}} demand for {{wireless}} communications at increased data rates. This has necessitated {{the development of new}} communication standards. New electronic devices must support a growing number of wireless standards and their various frequency bands, as the new standards do not replace the older ones. Together with the desire for small portable devices, this means that a single-chip solution supporting all existing wireless standards and featuring a wide tuning range, is highly desirable. The software-defined radio (SDR) concept, where almost all radio functions are implemented in software running on an embedded processor, is purportedly the most promising way to achieve a single-chip design, mainly because software is seen as flexible and extensible. Such a radio would consists of an analog front-end, primarily performing the frequency translation and the relatively large digital embedded processor with associated memory and peripherals. In receive mode, a frequency synthesizer comprising a high frequency oscillator and programmable <b>digital</b> output <b>divider</b> generates the required wide tuning range. Highly linear switching mixers perform the frequency translation, thereby generating the baseband signals for the embedded processor. However, owing to the pulse-like nature of the synthesizer output and the switching action of the mixer, additional frequency bands are mixed down to baseband together with the desired signal, causing interference. These additional frequency bands, termed harmonic images are related to the harmonics of the desired frequency. In regular receive applications, harmonic image interference corrupts the desired signal causing bit errors to occur. Harmonic images are also problematic in spectral sensing applications; they cause signal energy to be detected when there actually is none. In narrow-band receivers, harmonic images are avoided by using an external RF filter at the antenna. However, in the wideband systems targeted by this thesis, many such external filters would be needed, making this infeasible for cost sensitive consumer products. A different approach is needed. This thesis presents a method, based on interference cancelling, to significantly reduce the interference caused by the dominating harmonic image. A harmonicrejection radio front-end, which offers up to 40 dB of rejection, is used to generate two complex baseband signals. An interference estimate is generated based on these baseband signals. After equalization to remove amplitude and phase differences, the interference estimate is subtracted from the contaminated received signal, thereby i ii producing a received signal containing less interference. This method was successfully tested using two different front-ends, one built using off-the-shelf components and one fully integrated 65 nm CMOS front-end. Using the latter front-end more than 80 dB of harmonic rejection was observed for the dominating harmonic image. A method for dealing with harmonic image interference was proposed for spectrum sensing applications. The method consists of an analog front-end that uses two quadrature down-converters to generate two complex baseband signals and a digital subband cross-correlator. The second down-converter is tuned !f Hz higher than the first, resulting in the desired signal band experiencing a shift of !f, while the harmonic images shift by n · !f, where n is the harmonic image number. This second baseband signal is shifted by −!f Hz in the digital domain, thereby spectrally re-aligning the desired signal band with the first baseband signal. The harmonic images, however, experience the same −!f Hz shift, irrespective of their harmonic number. Therefore, all harmonic images in the second baseband signal are not spectrally aligned with respect to the first baseband signal. The end result is that only energy found in the desired signal band will produce an output at the cross-correlator, while the harmonic images are rejected.
