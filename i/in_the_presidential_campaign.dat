Harrison was {{defeated}} soundly in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine returned to Washington {{at the close of}} 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine’s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.|$|E

Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E

500|$|After the 2012 New Hampshire primary, a poll for the {{subsequent}} South Carolina primary taken by Public Policy Polling (of 1,112 likely GOP voters, Jan 5–7, 2012) {{was reported to}} place Colbert at 5%, one point ahead of Jon Huntsman polling at 4%, {{in spite of the}} fact that Colbert was not on the ballot. This poll showed Colbert to be closely behind Rick Perry's 7% and Ron Paul's 8% (with Romney at 27%, Gingrich 23% and Santorum at 18%). On the January 11 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert asked his audience if he should run for President in South Carolina, to which he received strong applause. He then stated that he would be making a [...] "Major Announcement" [...] during the next day's show. On January 12, Colbert started his show by discussing his role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> then addressed the law preventing him from being a Presidential candidate while running his Super PAC. With the help of his lawyer Trevor Potter, he then signed over control of his Super PAC to Jon Stewart, with the organization title then being referred to as [...] "The Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC". Immediately after this legal block was out of the way, Colbert announced, [...] "I am forming an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for my possible candidacy for the President of the United States of South Carolina.

He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an [...] "honorable and easy" [...] role. Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for forty years, making him unusually well qualified to serve as presiding officer.

[...] The Times further stated, [...] "At this point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> cycle, Clinton has raised more money than any candidate in history. Those dishwashers, waiters and street stall hawkers are part of the reason. And Clinton's success in gathering money from Chinatown's least-affluent residents stems from a two-pronged strategy: mutually beneficial alliances with powerful groups, and appeals to the hopes and dreams of people now consigned to the margins." [...] The New York Post reported similar findings.

2500|$|When John F. Kennedy, a Catholic, ran for President in 1960, Rev. Lowman {{questioned}} whether a Catholic in the White House might {{be subject to}} undue influence from the Vatican in secular matters. He wrote [...] "Should a Roman Catholic Be President?" [...] as a chapter {{in one of his}} Prophecies for the Times books, published in the summer of 1960, saying: [...] "Each person has the right to their own religious belief. This is one of our precious freedoms and every denomination should have the right in every country to operate and not be hindered. A Roman Catholic is a member of an ecclesiastical system ... that demands the first allegiance of every true member ... and says in a conflict between church and state, the church must prevail." [...] A Roman Catholic President, he said, would be subject to the absolute authority of the Pope according to church teachings. As archived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>Campaign</b> Papers at the John F.

2500|$|Since 2004, Vermont {{has been}} one of the Democrats' most loyal states. It gave John Kerry his fourth-largest margin of victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> against George W. Bush; he won the state's popular vote by 20 {{percentage}} points, taking almost 59% of the vote. (Kerry, from neighboring Massachusetts, also became the first Northern Democrat ever to carry Vermont; Johnson was from Texas, Clinton from Arkansas and Al Gore, triumphant in the Green Mountain State in 2000, from Tennessee.) Essex County in the state's northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont is the only state that did not receive a visit from George W. Bush during his tenure as President of the United States. [...] Indeed, George W. Bush and Donald Trump are the only Republicans to win the White House without carrying Vermont. In 2008, Vermont gave Barack Obama his third-largest margin of victory (37 percentage points) and third-largest vote share in the nation by his winning the state 68% to 31%. Only Obama's birth state of Hawaii and Washington, D.C. were stronger Democratic victories. The same held true in 2012, when Obama carried Vermont 67% of the vote vs 31% for Romney, and in 2016, when Clinton won with 55.7% of the vote vs 29.8% for Trump.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Democratic {{primaries}} began, {{the dichotomy}} of change versus experience had already become {{a common theme}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> with Senator Hillary Clinton positioning herself as the candidate with experience and Obama embracing the characterization as the candidate most able to bring change to Washington. Before the official launch of her campaign, aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the 'change' candidate, as strategist Mark Penn made clear in an October 2006 memo titled [...] "The Plan." [...] In his presidential run announcement, Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that [...] "Washington must change." [...] In response to this, Clinton adopted her experience as a major campaign theme. By early and mid-2007, polls regularly found voters identifying Clinton as the more experienced candidate and Obama as the [...] "fresh" [...] or [...] "new" [...] candidate. Exit polls on Super Tuesday found that Obama won voters who thought {{that the ability to}} bring change was the most important quality in a candidate, who made up a majority of the Democratic electorate. By a margin of about 2-1, Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality. These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3.|$|E

[...] The vast majority of Romanians are Christian Orthodox like Ponta, while Iohannis is Protestant. Commenting on a poll, according to which 58.22% of the respondents said for them the religion of the President mattered, while 39.81% said they were indifferent to the issue, Ponta said he did not believe that a candidate for President [...] "has a problem if he is Orthodox or is not of Romanian ethnicity". Iohannis has reacted strongly to the statement by his rival, saying that bringing the issue of religion is a [...] "painful attempt" [...] to poison the campaign. Iohannis' slogan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> was [...] "less talk, more things done", alluding to frequent television appearances of his rival, Victor Ponta. In his presidential program are mentioned, among others: deepening of the strategic partnership with the United States, allocation of 2% of GDP for defense, 6% for health and 6% for education, restructuring of the management system of EU funds, development of the capital market, keeping the flat tax, return of VAT to 19%, etc. Iohannis proposes a liberal economy based on competitiveness and prosperity, encouragement of a highly developed agriculture, connection of Romania to the Western world through infrastructure or decentralization, as [...] "vector of modernization".

60|$|When {{appointed}} brigadier-general I at {{once thought}} it proper {{that one of}} my aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding, and so selected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow.

Difference in views between the members of the firm on the questions of the day, and general hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm. Hillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very brilliant. I asked him to accept a place on my staff. I also wanted to take one man from my new home, Galena. The canvass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> the fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A.
