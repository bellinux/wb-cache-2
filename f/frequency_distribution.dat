5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The gene {{composition}} of bacteria {{of the same}} species can differ significantly between isolates. Variability in gene composition can be summarized in terms of gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions,</b> in which individual genes are ranked according to the frequency of genomes in which they appear. Empirical gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions</b> possess a U-shape, such that there are many rare genes, some genes of intermediate occurrence, and many common genes. It would seem that U-shaped gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions</b> can be used to infer the essentiality and/or importance of a gene to a species. Here, we ask: can U-shaped gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions,</b> instead, arise generically via neutral processes of genome evolution? Results We introduce a neutral model of genome evolution which combines birth-death processes at the organismal level with gene uptake and loss at the genomic level. This model predicts that gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions</b> possess a characteristic U-shape {{even in the absence of}} selective forces driving genome and population structure. We compare the model predictions to empirical gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions</b> from 6 multiply sequenced species of bacterial pathogens. We fit the model with constant population size to data, matching U-shape distributions albeit without matching all quantitative features of the distribution. We find stronger model fits in the case where we consider exponentially growing populations. We also show that two alternative models which contain a "rigid" and "flexible" core component of genomes provide strong fits to gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions.</b> Conclusions The analysis of neutral models of genome evolution suggests that U-shaped gene <b>frequency</b> <b>distributions</b> provide less information than previously suggested regarding gene essentiality. We discuss the need for additional theory and genomic level information to disentangle the roles of evolutionary mechanisms operating within and amongst individuals in driving the dynamics of gene distributions. </p...|$|R

In a very general sense, the lunar history of impact cratering follows a trend of decreasing crater size with time. In particular, the largest impact basins were formed during the early periods, and these were successively overlaid by smaller craters. The size <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> (SFD) of crater diameters on a given surface (that is, the number of craters as a function of diameter) approximately follows a power law with increasing number of craters with decreasing crater size.
