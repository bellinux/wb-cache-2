5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the <b>dusts</b> from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the soil <b>dust</b> aerosol cycle to radiative forcing by the soil <b>dust</b> aerosol particles themselves is studied. Four experiments with the NASA GISS atmospheric general circulation model, which includes a soil <b>dust</b> aerosol model, are compared, all using a prescribed climatological sea surface temperature as a lower boundary condition. In one experiment, <b>dust</b> is included as a dynamic tracer with no radiative effect, whereas <b>dust</b> interacts with radiation in the other simulations. The single-scattering albedo of <b>dust</b> particles is prescribed to be globally uniform in the experiments with radiatively active <b>dust,</b> although this albedo is varied from experiment to experiment.

Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable <b>dusts.</b> Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3.

The goal of this talk is to give an overview of the observations and to discuss the successes and challenges associated with modeling the <b>dust</b> cycle. <b>Dust</b> raising events on Mars range in size from meters to hundreds of kilometers. During some years, regional storms merge to produce hemispheric or planet encircling <b>dust</b> clouds that obscure the surface and raise atmospheric temperatures by tens of kelvin. The interannual variability of planet encircling <b>dust</b> storms is poorly understood. Although the occurrence and season of large regional and global <b>dust</b> storms are highly variable from one year to the next, there are many features of the <b>dust</b> cycle that occur year after year. A low-level <b>dust</b> haze is maintained during northern spring and summer, while elevated levels of atmospheric <b>dust</b> occur during northern autumn and winter. During years without global-scale <b>dust</b> storms, two peaks in total <b>dust</b> loading are generally observed: one peak occurs before northern winter solstice and one peak occurs after northern winter solstice. Numerical modeling studies attempting to interactively simulate the Martian <b>dust</b> cycle with general circulation models (GCMs) include the lifting, transport, and sedimentation of radiatively active <b>dust.</b> Two <b>dust</b> lifting processes are commonly represented in these models: wind-stress lifting (i. e., saltation) and <b>dust</b> devil lifting. Although the predicted patterns of <b>dust</b> lifting and atmospheric <b>dust</b> loading from these simulations capture some aspects of the observed <b>dust</b> cycle, there are many notable differences between the simulated and observed <b>dust</b> cycles. For example, it is common for models to predict one peak in global <b>dust</b> loading near northern winter solstice due to excessive <b>dust</b> lifting in the Hellas basin at this season. Additionally, it is difficult for models to realistically capture the observed interannual variability in global <b>dust</b> storms.
