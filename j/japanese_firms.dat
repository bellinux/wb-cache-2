25|$|The {{first of}} these {{explanations}} was put forward when, in 1975, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was commissioned by the UK government to write a report explaining why and how the British motorcycle industry had been out-competed by its Japanese competitors. The report concluded that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>firms,</b> including Honda, had sought a very high scale of production (they had made {{a large number of}} motorbikes) in order to benefit from economies of scale and learning curve effects.

25|$|Japan and South Korea tend {{to favor}} large {{infrastructure}} projects, so this project {{might seem to be}} fairly obvious politically, but this project has been the target of far right/nationalist political groups in both countries. Many South Koreans have advised caution in proceeding with the project due to worries of firms in the much larger Japanese economy becoming more dominant in South Korea due to the lower logistical expenses the tunnel would provide; this increased economic power would further expand the political power of Japan in the region. Similarly, many <b>Japanese</b> <b>firms</b> worry it may expand the increasing dominance of Korean firms in sectors such as consumer electronics. China’s increasing dominance in the region may, eventually, minimize these concerns making the project politically viable, but this is not yet the case.|$|E

In 2003, Olympus made a piecemeal acquisition of an information technology group, ITX. Akinobu Yokoo, Yokoo's older brother, was chief financial officer for ITX.

Nobumasa Yokoo also introduced three small, unprofitable companies {{in which he was}} shareholder and executive that Olympus acquired for ¥73.4billion – News Chef, a maker of microwave cookware, Altis and Humalabo.

Part of the transaction took place on 25 April 2008, when Olympus paid the equivalent of 7million to funds named Dynamic Dragons II and Global Targets. Seventeen Cayman and BVI special purpose vehicles were used to make payments; funds flowed through Commerzbank AG, Societe Generale SA and LGT Bank.
