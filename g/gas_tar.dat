50|$|The {{quality of}} the gas from {{different}} gasifiers varies a great deal. Staged gasifiers, where pyrolysis and gasification occur separately, instead of in the same reaction zone {{as was the case}} in, e.g., the World War II gasifiers, can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas (less than 1 mg/m³), while single-reactor fluid-bed gasifiers may exceed 50,000 mg/m³ tar. The fluid bed reactors have the advantage of being much more compact, with more capacity per unit volume and price.

The advent of automobiles reduced the availability of naphtha for carburetion oil, as that fraction was desirable as motor fuel. MGPs that shifted to heavier grades of oil often experienced problems with the production of tar-water emulsions, which were difficult, time consuming, and costly to break. (The cause of tar changewater emulsions is complex and was related to several factors, including free carbon in the carburetion oil and the substitution of bituminous coal as a feedstock instead of coke.) The production of large volumes of tar-water emulsions quickly filled up available storage capacity at MGPs and plant management often dumped the emulsions in pits, from which {{they may or may not}} have been later reclaimed. Even if the emulsions were reclaimed, the environmental damage from placing tars in unlined pits remained. The dumping of emulsions (and other tarry residues such as tar sludges, tank bottoms, and off-spec tars) into the soil and waters around MGPs is a significant factor in the pollution found at FMGPs today.|$|E

40|$|Pulverized fuel {{combustor}} holds a {{great importance}} {{when compared with}} fluidised bed combustor due to it’s high combustion intensities and high heat transfer rates. The science behind pulverized furnace coal combustion is fairly well understood but the crucial interfaces between devolatilisation, secondary gas phase reactions and char combustion {{makes it difficult to}} construct a mathematical model. The modelling of coal combustion with some simplifying assumptions, which can be coupled with furnace module and capable of predicting the exit fuel gas concentrations from a pulverized coal furnace is developed as part of this work. Coal combustion and gasification are complex processes, where devolatilization is always the first step and plays a fundamental role. The key to understanding the phenomena occurring inside the process units thus lies in describing the primary devolatilization and its associated products. It is known that coal devolatilization is a process in which <b>gases,</b> <b>tar,</b> and char are released form coal at elevated temperatures and pressures. Devolatilization is guided by many factors out of which bond strengths of different aromatic and aliphatic molecules {{plays an important role in}} formation of <b>tar,</b> <b>gas</b> and char while the stabilization of radicals formed during devolatilization depends the upon amount of hydrogen molecules available, which in turn effects the degradation of coal...|$|R

40|$|Hydro{{pyrolysis}} (Hypy) of a Spanish low rank coal in a preparative {{fixed bed}} reactor yields much more tar than pyrolysis (Py). The external hydrogen incorporated in the <b>gas,</b> <b>tar</b> and water yields {{is less than the}} total hydrogen incorporated in the products, as a result of more efficient extraction of hydrogen from char in a H 2 atmosphere. The higher devolatilization rate in He and H 2 occur at the same temperature, which coincides with an exothermic peak. These results show that the Hypy rate of low rank coals is controlled by the initiation steps of thermal decomposition, with the hydrogen in the role of stabilizing the primary radicals and allowing them to escape as volatile matter. © 1987.

Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were performed on RDF and on some materials which have been considered ''key components'' of the thermal degradation of RDF. The product fractions obtained by RDF pyrolysis runs in a laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor, at temperatures between 500 and 900 degrees C, were identified and characterized by different experimental techniques, including gas chromatographic analysis of gaseous products, ultimate analysis, scanning electron microscopy and internal surface area measurements of char. <b>Gas,</b> <b>tar,</b> and char global yields were determined {{as a function of}} reactor temperature.

TGA experiments showed that pine sawdust decomposition took place at lower temperatures compared to lignite. With increasing the pine sawdust content in the blend, the DTG peaks shifted towards lower temperatures due to synergetic effect. In fixed-bed experiments, the synergetic effect increased the yield of volatile matter compared to the calculated values. The major gases released at low temperatures were CO₂ and CO. However, hydrogen was the primary gaseous product at higher temperatures. During co-pyrolysis, concentrations of benzene, naphthalene, and hydrocarbons in the tar decreased, accompanied {{by an increase in}} phenols and guaiacol concentrations.

40|$|Energy {{production}} from ligno-cellulosic biomass via gasification technology appears as an attractive {{option in the}} current energy context. The combination of decentralized fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce bio-oil, followed by transportation and gasification of bio-oil in bio-refinery has appeared {{as one of the}} most economically viable methods for syngas (H 2 +CO) production. The objective of this work is to bridge the lack of knowledge concerning the physicochemical transformation of bio-oil into syngas using non catalytic steam gasification in entrained flow reactors. This complex process involves vaporization, thermal cracking reactions with formation of <b>gas,</b> <b>tars</b> and two solid residues - char and soot - that are considered as undesirable products. This is followed by steam reforming of <b>gas</b> and <b>tars,</b> together with char and soot conversion. To better understand the process, the first step of gasification (pyrolysis) and thereafter the whole process (pyrolysis + gasification) were studied. The pyrolysis study focused on the influence of the heating rate, the final pyrolysis temperature and the ash content of bio-oil on char, <b>tars</b> and <b>gas</b> yields. At the higher heating rate char yield is smaller than 1 %. In addition, ash seems to promote polymerization reactions and causes a decrease of gas yield. Concerning gasification, the effect of temperature on syngas yield and composition was studied. An increase in the reaction temperature implies higher hydrogen yield and higher solid carbon conversion. A thermodynamic equilibrium calculation showed that equilibrium was reached at 1400 °C. Finally, the soot formation and oxidation mechanisms were investigated through experiments in three different atmospheres: inert (pyrolysis), rich in steam (gasification) and in the presence of oxygen (partial oxidation). A semi-empirical model was proposed and validated. It is based on detailed chemistry to describe gas phase reactions, a single reaction using C 2 H 2 concentration to describe soot formation and one main heterogeneous reaction to describe soot oxidation...|$|R

The undesirable components need {{to be removed from}} product gas. There are number of techniques used to remove undesirable compounds, some of which are discussed here: Limestone can be fed into the fluidized bed gasifiers along with coal to capture most of the H 2 S. An external desulfurization system is used to remove any residual H 2 S. Chemical and physical methods are used to remove the tar from the product <b>gas.</b> <b>Tar</b> is destroyed and converted into smaller molecules in chemical method and tar yielding is removed by physical method.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study on}} the behaviour of heating coal macerals has been undertaken using two novel thermal analysis techniques. The apparent specific heat was determined during heating using an inverse calorimetric method (computer aided thermal analysis, CATA) and combined with pressure and displacement measurements to correlate endothermic and exothermic behaviour with measurement of swelling. The second technique used a post-oxidation stage to combust the <b>tars</b> and <b>gases</b> into products which were analysed. This method was used to study the elemental character of volatiles release from coal maceral concentrates in terms of carbon and hydrogen.

For the highest vitrinite fraction (of 86. 4 % vitrinite) swelling was initiated at the same temperature range for exothermic reactions, and maximum swelling coincided with the peak release of light <b>gases.</b> <b>Tar</b> evolution was found to change in chemical character (as defined by H/C ratio) during progressive heating, initially rising {{in the early stages of}} tar formation (< 430 °C) to a maximum of 1. 24, then gradually decreasing to a minimum of 0. 64 at 550 °C...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis of {{a single}} biomass {{particle}} is numerically studied using a one-dimensional model which assumes virgin material decomposes through three parallel reactions to light <b>gases,</b> <b>tar</b> and char.

Planar SOFC membranes were operated at two gasification sites: (a) autothermal fixed-bed downdraft gasifier and (b) allothermal bubbling fluidized bed gasifier. In all cases the gas was hot-cleaned from particulates, HCl and H 2 S. SOFC membranes were tested up to one day on different product <b>gas</b> <b>tar</b> loads (0 - 3000 mg N m(- 3)) with stable performance. SEM/EDS examination of the SOFCs revealed intact anodes; no carbon deposition or other impurities were detected. During testing on high fuel utilization conditions and high steam content, the SOFC lost performance due to anode nickel oxidation. In another extreme case where producer gas particulates reached the SOFC, SEM examination identified secondary tubular shaped carbon structures formed inside the functional layer of the anode.
