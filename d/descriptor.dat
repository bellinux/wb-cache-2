These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a <b>descriptor</b> of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E

Contour-based <b>descriptors</b> compute the <b>descriptors</b> only from the shape boundary and include <b>descriptors</b> like curvature scale space[5] or Fourier descriptors[6]. Which approach is better depends on the application, especially whether the internal content of the shape or the boundary is more important.|$|R

After detailed comparisons it was found that keywords provided by authors have an important presence in the database <b>descriptors</b> studied, since nearly 25 % of all the keywords appeared in exactly the same form as <b>descriptors,</b> with another 21 % while normalized, are still detected in the <b>descriptors.</b> This means that almost 46 % of keywords appear in the <b>descriptors,</b> either as such or after normalization. Elsewhere, three distinct indexing policies appear, one represented by INSPEC and LISA (indexers seem to have freedom to assign the <b>descriptors</b> they deem necessary); another is represented by CAB (no record has fewer than four <b>descriptors</b> and, in general, a large number of <b>descriptors</b> is employed; in contrast, in ISTA, a certain institutional code towards economy in indexing, since 84 % of records contain only four <b>descriptors...</b>|$|R

30|$|Although CEFR-related <b>descriptors</b> in {{our study}} have {{undergone}} significant shifts in their assigned levels, they have, generally speaking, proved to be feasible in profiling TEM candidates’ writing proficiency. For example, those <b>descriptors</b> in our scale with logits between 0 and 1 are mostly CEFR <b>descriptors</b> from B 1 to C 1; none of the level A <b>descriptors</b> have appeared in that range. Similarly, those CEFR-related <b>descriptors</b> with logit values below 0 on our constructed scale mainly come between levels A 2 and B 1; no CEFR-related <b>descriptors</b> with B 2 and above have been included. That is, higher-level CEFR-related <b>descriptors</b> are located in a higher range on our scale; the same also applies to low-level CEFR-related <b>descriptors</b> which are grouped in the range below 0 on our scale. This answers our first research question: that is, some of the CEFR-related <b>descriptors</b> are, to some extent, adaptable in describing TEM test takers’ writing proficiency.|$|R
