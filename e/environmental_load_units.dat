40|$|The {{expanding}} world {{human population}} will require greater food production within {{the constraints of}} increasing societal pressure to minimize the resulting impact on the environment. Breeding goals {{in the past have}} achieved substantial gains in <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> per <b>unit</b> product produced, despite no explicit inclusion of <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> (and in most instances, even feed efficiency) in these goals. Heritability of feed intake-related traits in cattle is moderate to high, implying that relatively high accuracy of selection can be achieved with relatively low information content per animal; however, the genetic variation in feed intake independent of animal performance is expectedly less than other performance traits. Nonetheless, exploitable genetic variation does exist and, if properly utilized, could augment further gains in feed efficiency. Genetic parameters for enteric methane (CH 4) emissions in cattle are rare. No estimate of the genetic variation in enteric CH 4 emissions independent of animal performance exists; it is the parameters for this trait that depict the scope for genetic improvement. The approach to the inclusion of feed intake or CH 4 emissions in cattle breeding goals is not clear, nor is the cost benefit of such an endeavour, especially given the cost of procuring the necessary phenotypic data...|$|R

40|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> from {{consumption}} can {{be reduced}} by changing consumption patterns. For an effective consumer policy to reduce the <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> from society, we need insight into the <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> from consumption patterns. This requires detailed accurate quantitative environmental information about many consumer products. Current methods for establishing this information about many consumer products do not combine process data with multiregional data. This paper aims to give more insight into the added value of using multiregional data and process data. It also proposes to combine both kinds of data into one application. The use of multiregional input-output data appears to be important to establish the total <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> from consumption. Using multiregional data and process data both result in substantial changes in the estimated <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> of consumption products on a more detailed level. The results indicate that using both multiregional and process data will improve the estimates of {{the environmental impacts of}} consumption patterns. Therefore, we propose a hybrid multi-region (HMR) method, which is successfully applied for the Netherlands. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> of the ‘energy depletion’ impact {{category}} in the Chinese {{case study is}} lowest in scenario 2, mainly due to the avoided coal and oil for mineral fertilizer production. The ‘global warming’ {{impact category}} is also lowest in scenario 2, {{mainly because of the}} avoided CO 2 emission from the production of the replaced mineral fertilizer. The lowest <b>environmental</b> <b>load</b> in the ‘acid rain’ impact category is in scenario 3 because of the avoided NOx and SOx emission from the replaced mineral fertilizer production.
