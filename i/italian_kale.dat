Kales are also potential sources of healthy bioactive phytochemical components. The present study compared the bioactive compound content of kale populations from Italy, Portugal, and Turkey, either from local sources or grown in an experimental field. RESULTS: Total phenolics, glucosinolates (GLS), carotenoids, and chlorophylls were in the ranges 8310 – 38 110, 755 – 8580, 135 – 2354, and 1740 – 16 924 mg kg− 1 dry matter, respectively. On average, locally harvested samples showed a total GLS content about twice as high as populations from the experiment. Conversely, pigments were significantly more abundant in experimental than in local kales, owing to the higher soil fertility. Portuguese samples showed higher phenolic and GLS amounts than <b>Italian</b> and Turkish <b>kales,</b> whereas some of the Italian samples were the richest in carotenoids. CONCLUSION: This paper represented the first cross-country comparison of local kale accessions with respect to bioactive compound amounts. Both geographic origin and growing environment appeared to be remarkable and discriminating factors in determining bioactive levels in leafy kales, with possible effects on their health-promoting and sensorial attributes. The research leading to these results received funding from the European Community’s Seven Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement n. º 227118...|$|R

ISBN: 978 - 88 - 902152 - 6 - 1 Introduction. Kales {{represent}} leafy {{forms and}} primitive types of Brassica oleracea L. They are traditional crops of several European areas (Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Turkey), rooted in local farming and food systems, and {{employed in the}} preparation of traditional dishes. Owing to similar aspects in their utilisation, kales appear a proper subject for a cross-country comparison. Furthermore, kales have gained increased attention due to their high content of healthy phytochemicals such as carotenoids, glucosinolates (GLS) and phenolics. The present investigation is aimed to compare different kale populations, either from local sources or cultivated in a common environment, for their bioactive amounts. Materials and methods. 25 kale samples were sampled from Italian, Portuguese, and Turkish local crops or markets. For the experimental trial, 15 kale seed samples were obtained from local seed companies or farmers, and planted in nursery. The plants were transplanted in a field located in Cesena (Italy). After freeze-drying, bioactives were extracted by proper solvent systems, quantified by HPLC, and identified by HPLC-mass spectrometry or standard compounds. Results. Total phenolics, GLS, carotenoids (lutein and beta-carotene), and chlorophylls were in the range 8310 - 38110, 755 - 8580, 135 - 2354, and 1740 - 16924 mg kg- 1 d. m., respectively. Growing environment did not consistently influence phenolic content. Both local and experimental Portuguese samples showed higher phenolic levels in comparison to those determined in <b>Italian</b> and Turkish <b>kales.</b> A high variability was noticed within local populations. Even in case of GLS, a remarkable variability was assessed in local populations and higher amounts of these bioactives were determined in Portuguese kales in comparison to Italian and Turkish samples. Aliphatic GLS accounted for 60 and 40 % of total GLS in experimental and local Portuguese kales, respectively, whereas indolic GLS were mainly quantified in Italian and Turkish populations. Local samples showed a total GLS amount about twice higher in comparison to experimental populations having the same geographical origin. On the contrary, pigments were significantly more abundant in experimental samples in comparison to local kales, owing to the higher soil fertility level. Conclusions. The first cross-country comparison of local kale types has been carried out as regards phytochemical amounts. Geographical origin and growing environment appeared as significant factors in determining bioactive levels in leafy kales and then nutritional and sensorial attributes of plants.
