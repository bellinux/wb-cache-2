5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was felt he had been far too <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with {{suspicion}} by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E

5|$|Nazi {{support for}} General Franco was {{motivated}} by several factors, including as a distraction from Hitler's central European strategy, {{and the creation of}} a Fascist Spain <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> Germany to threaten France. It further provided an opportunity to train men and test equipment and tactics.|$|E

5|$|On 8 November 1918, {{three days}} before the Armistice, Piłsudski and his colleague, Colonel Kazimierz Sosnkowski, were {{released}} by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon—like Vladimir Lenin before them—placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Piłsudski would create a force <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E
5|$|The club played Warrington {{over the}} 2008 Christmas holidays, as a {{pre-season}} <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> Wigan's 2009 season. Tomkins claimed a hat-trick {{as the team}} swept aside a young and inexperienced Warrington side 44–4. Tomkins also featured in the club's two other fixtures during the pre-season, firstly against Huddersfield and then against Leigh. For 2009, Tomkins was given the number 25 jersey.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{males and}} females move widely. Orangutans usually travel alone, but they may travel in small groups in their subadult years. However, this {{behaviour}} ends at adulthood. The social structure of the orangutan can be best described as solitary but social. Interactions between adult females range from <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> avoidance to antagonistic. Resident males may have overlapping ranges and interactions between them tend to be hostile.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in his {{previous}} congressional term, when Weaver entered the 49th United States Congress, {{he was the only}} Greenback member. The new president, Democrat Grover Cleveland, was <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> Weaver, and asked his advice on Iowa patronage. As it had been for years, Weaver's chief concern was with the nation's money and finance, and the relationship between labor and capital.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} and extensive trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' actions alienated those Native Americans <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. in the region. Ninian Edwards, {{having lost}} the {{confidence}} of the Madison administration, waited out the war in Kentucky. However, he was reappointed to a second and then a third term as territorial governor in 1812 and 1815, and he was also named one of the three U.S. negotiators of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815.|$|E

5|$|Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess {{was shipped}} to Britain. The Irish Mercantile Marine ensured that Irish agricultural, and other, exports reached Britain, and that British coal arrived in Ireland. Some {{foods such as}} wheat, citric fruits and tea were imported. Ireland {{depended}} on, mainly, British tankers for petroleum. Initially Irish ships sailed in British convoys. In the light of experience they chose to sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> tragic.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives form their own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
5|$|While the African wildcat is {{the ancestral}} {{subspecies}} from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies {{of the same}} species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats {{on one hand and}} entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> people and may be fed by several households. Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.|$|E

50|$|Bera {{announced}} a rematch against Lungren in 2012. The district had been renumbered as the 7th District, and made somewhat more compact. It lost {{all of its}} territory outside of Sacramento County, making it slightly <b>friendlier</b> <b>to</b> Democrats.|$|R
5|$|Women's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public {{meetings}} in Philadelphia beginning in 1846. A wide circle of abolitionists <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> women's rights began in 1847 {{to discuss the}} possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women's rights. In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public speech {{on the subject of}} women's rights, entitled The Province of Women, at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|Chintanda's {{affidavit}} {{caused the}} BSAC to become concerned about Clark's continued authority in North-Eastern Rhodesia {{and to begin}} investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the Company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no jurisdiction outside Southern Rhodesia and therefore could not hear any case brought against Clark. On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the Company's administrator in Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the Zambezi {{under the supervision of}} one of three chiefs <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> the Company. Milner replied on 17 August that he could not legally sanction this, and that Lawley should pursue the matter further only when authority extended over Clark's area.|$|E

50|$|In November 2011, Wilson filed {{a rematch}} {{in the newly}} redrawn 6th District, which had been made {{slightly}} <b>friendlier</b> <b>to</b> Republicans in redistricting. Johnson defeated Wilson again in a heavily contested race 53% to 47%, and began his second term in January 2013.|$|R
50|$|Re{{district}}ing {{made his}} district slightly <b>friendlier</b> <b>to</b> Democrats, and he narrowly lost his 1992 re-election bid to New York City City Councilwoman Carolyn B. Maloney.

5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian {{international}} Zoltán Szélesi {{joined the}} squad in training {{ahead of their}} next match against Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. They came from behind to record a 2–1 win in a feisty encounter, with Steve MacLean scoring the decisive goal. Argyle returned to England to play against Morecambe on 25 July 2009, and included a triallist called Réda Johnson in their defence, who appeared in the match under a pseudonym. Two second half goals ensured that they left Christie Park with a win. The club's only pre-season <b>friendly</b> <b>to</b> take place at Home Park was against Scottish club Heart of Midlothian on 29 July 2009. Neither side could break the deadlock in a dour 0–0 draw. Swindon Town were the opposition for Argyle's penultimate friendly. A goal from Marcel Seip after 57 minutes set the visitors {{on their way to}} a 2–0 victory at manager Paul Sturrock's old club. Argyle's final pre-season match took place on 3 August 2009 against Tiverton Town. A young team containing only two senior professionals, Yoann Folly and Simon Walton, secured a 1–0 win at Ladysmead.|$|E
