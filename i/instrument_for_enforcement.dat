30|$|The {{enforcement}} {{approach in}} Almeida and Carneiro (2008) {{was motivated by}} a study for Brazil initiated earlier (Almeida and Carneiro, 2009), which was facilitated by rich administrative information on the allocation of inspectors by municipality. Their focus on Brazil and on enforcement was motivated in part by that country’s combination (akin to MENA) of very rigid labor (and other) regulations but overall very limited (but varying) enforcement and, as a result, a very large informal sector. The Brazilian study showed that greater enforcement led to lesser reliance on informal workers within a given firm but also to lower levels of productivity, especially when suitable <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> and a 2 SLS estimating procedure were used. That study, however, did not deal with training.|$|R

In addition, it is argued that while the current regulation of ADR may further the individual enforcement of EU consumer rights, it may also hinder the development of EU consumer law. To counteract this, it is suggested that a preliminary reference procedure is introduced for ADR entities at either the European or the national level...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} explore the {{possibility}} of using tort law based <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of environmental standards. Not by using these instruments vis-`a-vis those who are violating environmental standards (which could be regarded as a rather innovative approach to the subject), but vis-`a-vis public authorities not taking sufficient enforcement action with respect to persons and undertakings who are primarily responsible for the environmental harm. Our main question therefore is, whether a non- or unsatisfactory enforcement of environmental law by public authorities can result in liability to pay damages based on general civil law. The approach that will be introduced is one of the “hottest” and most discussed subjects in legal practice and academia alike, in the Netherlands today. ...|$|R

In the 1989-90 season, two of Sullivan’s telefilms, both of which dealt with social issues, aired on NBC and CBS. Most notably, A Cry For Help: The Tracey Thurman Story dramatized the landmark federal lawsuit that resulted in legislation to strengthen police responsibility toward battered wives. It earned both critical acclaim and the highest movie rating of the season. In addition, it received a special commendation from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for its use as a training <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> law <b>enforcement</b> officers.

40|$|The {{protection}} of the global environment is impeded by multilateral externalities which the international community attempts to bring under control by entering into international agreements. International agreements, however, can suffer from non-compliance and free-riding behaviour by sovereign states and must therefore be enforced and stabilised internationally. This paper describes <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> and stabilisation of an international CO 2 agreement and evaluates them {{in the light of}} economic and legal theory. Economic instruments build on repetition and use utility transfers, economic sanctions and flexible treaty adjustments. Important legal instruments are reciprocal obligations and cooperation duties, international funding and transfer rules, treaty suspension, retorsions and reprisals, treaty revision, and monitoring. The paper shows that economic and legal instruments are compatible to a considerable extent. It develops proposals <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> and stabilisation of a global CO 2 agreement and other multilateral treaties.

The unfinished process of economic transformation, division of land use and land ownership, disintegrated social networks, under-developed institutions – these are the problems hindering the knowledge economy enforcement.

Lacking a central exchange bank, London-based finance involved bankers and merchants monitoring overseas agents and enforcing international claims. Using archival sources, we show how London bankers employed merchants to channel funds around Europe. As merchants became stakeholders in the payments system, they developed incentives to monitor foreign agents and spread information of defaults. The resulting web of information flows encouraged market integration by facilitating arbitrage. Finally, the availability of <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> formal legal <b>enforcement</b> assisted informal enforcement. ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{some time}} fishing gear {{scientists}} express their concern over an observed {{tendency of the}} commercial fishery to proceed from codend netting yarns of 3 to 4 mm to higher values or to switch {{to the use of}} double instead of single yarn. A recent large EU-financed project collected statistical evidence on the detrimental effect of such behaviour on the selectivity of the codends. In this context data on cod are very scarce. German-Polish experiments in the Baltic from 1999 to 2001 aimed at filling this gap. The investigations prove a clear evidence of a negativ ecorrelation between netting yarn diameter and selectivity factor and/or L 50. In addition they demonstrate a clear negative effect on selectivity when switching from single to double yarn The effects are of an order of magnitude that counteracting effects as catch size are masked and support the decision of the IBSFC to define maximum yarn diameters both for single and double yarn netting.

40|$|An {{inability}} to reconcile society 2 ̆ 7 s need {{for protection from}} juvenile crime {{with the use of}} nonpunitive measures has troubled the juvenile justice system since its inception. Society long ago adopted a paternalistic attitude toward juvenile crime, treating such behavior not as a question of law enforcement, but as a social and psychological problem requiring therapeutic interventions and state assumption of parental rights and duties. The juvenile court was conceived as a kind of social welfare agency rather than as an <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of the criminal laws. With the mantle of benevolence bestowed and in the name of 2 ̆ 2 individualized treatment, 2 ̆ 2 the juvenile courts were given broad jurisdiction over both criminal and non-criminal misbehavior and were vested with virtually unlimited discretion to impose limitations and sanctions on a child 2 ̆ 7 s conduct.

40|$|Fatma's Dilemma: Sexual Crime and Legal Culture in an Early Modern Ottoman Court. L. Peirce. In 1541, {{the judge}} of the court of Aintab heard the {{testimony}} of a peasant girl, Fatma, who had accused two young men of making her pregnant, {{and one of the}} two of raping her. The scenario that unfolded revealed that the rape accusation was made at the urging of the mother of the young man who was actually the father. Fatma's case is examined here, not with the goal of resolving it, but rather as a complex site of conflicting legal principles and interests. By situating this case in the context of other cases of sexual crime in mid- 16 th-century Aintab, this essay contemplates the ways in which a local society interpreted and used the law to resolve moral and social problems. It argues that the local court, while functioning as an <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of normative law, acted {{at the same time as}} an arena for negotiation of the very law it was mandated to enforce.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{seeks to}} chronicle the {{political}} history and intellectual antecedence of disability {{policy and practice}} in the past 30  years, which culminated in the successful negotiation of the United Nations (UN) Convention {{on the rights of}} persons with disabilities, that came into force in May  2008. It therefore analyses the raison d’etre that underpins the UN Convention, as well as providing {{a brief description of the}} substantive issues that the Convention addresses. The article also analyses some of the perceived challenges with regard to the implementation of the UN Convention, by drawing upon the substantive findings of two Disability Scoping Studies in Zimbabwe and Nigeria, funded by the UK's Department for International Development. Reference is also made to contemporary debates within mainstream development studies discourse, particularly the efficacy of “rights-based approaches” to development, which have a direct bearing on the extent to which the UN Convention will be successfully implemented. The article concludes by arguing that the UN Convention is a necessary but not sufficient <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of disability rights and should not be perceived as a panacea that will end disability discrimination. Such legislation can and should make such discrimination illegal. However, it is very difficult indeed to implement, for it is extremely difficult to enforce. Notwithstanding the UN Convention's acknowledged seminal importance, other deep-seated, endemic policy-orientated challenges will need to be addressed in order for this ideal to become an objective reality...|$|R

The factors of influence on the choice of the strategy of credit and investment activity of commercial banks have been investigated. The features of display of different kinds of risks in the credit activity of national commercial banks have been revealed. The main economic-mathematical methods and models of credit and investment activity of commercial banks have been considered. The methodical approach to the valuation of efficiency of the credit activity of banks in the context of reducing risks and improvement of the investment activity has been proposed. The methodical approach {{to the development of the}} new strategy of formation and development of Ukrainian commercial banks in the context of globalization of credit and financial relations and global financial crisis has been offered. The modeling tools for the analysis of business activity of the bank from the position of competitive advantages in the context of instability of external environment have been designed.

40|$|Why {{does the}} American Constitution lack contain social and {{economic}} guarantees, which appear in most contemporary constitutions? This essay explores four possible answers: chronological, cultural, institutional, and realist. The chronological explanation emphasizes {{the fact that in}} the late eighteenth century, {{social and economic}} rights simply were not on the viewscreen for constitution-makers. The point is correct, but as a complete account, the chronological explanation fails for the simple reason that constitutional meaning changes over time. The institutional explanation emphasizes that Americans typically see constitutional rights not as mere goals or aspirations, but as pragmatic <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> judicial <b>enforcement.</b> The difficulty with the institutional explanation is that social and economic rights can, in fact, be enforced judicially. The cultural explanation sees the absence of social and economic rights as part of the general failure of socialist movements in the United States (“American exceptionalism”). The problem with this explanation is that social and economic rights can in fact coexist with a market economy. The realist explanation places a spotlight on the underappreciated fact that the United States Supreme Court came very close, in the 1960 s and 1970 s, to recognizing social and economic rights under the Constitution. The Court’s refusal to recognize such rights was largely a result of the presidential election of 1968 and in particular of four critical appointments by President Nixon. This is an important source of “American exceptionalism” in the domain of social and economic rights. Here as elsewhere, there is a possibility of multiple equilibria, and with a small difference or two, the United States might well have had an equilibrium that included social and economic rights...|$|R
40|$|The Mexico-U. S. {{wage gap}} alone cannot explain the large {{increases}} in migration from Mexico to the U. S. {{in the last}} three decades. This paper explores three alternative migration determinants: family migrant networks, the Mexican migrant-smuggling (coyote) industry and the rural economy. The premise of this paper is that successive cohorts of migrants and an expanding coyote industry have led to declines in the costs of migration partly through the formation of networks, while the long-term decline of the rural economy has led to increases in the gains to U. S. migration. Using unique, source-country data collected by the Mexican Migration Project from both migrant and non-migrant households in western Mexico, this paper estimates how the probability of migrating is influenced by the above determinants in two ways. First, the effect of coyote prices and economic output are estimated using an instrumental variables strategy in which coyote prices are <b>instrumented</b> <b>for</b> using border <b>enforcement</b> hours. Second, family network effects are estimated controlling for individual fixed effects. My findings suggest that sibling networks are by far the most significant determinant of initial migration, although falling coyote prices and worsened economic conditions have also been significant push/pull factors in out migration from western Mexico over this time period...|$|R
40|$|Background Recently it was {{reported}} that a Swedish professor in environmental health has fordecadesworked as a consultant for PhilipMorris without reporting his employment to his academic employerordeclaring conflicts of interest in his research. The potential for distorting the epidemiological assessments of hazard and risk through paid consultants, pretending to be independent, is not exclusive to the tobacco industry. Methods Documentation is drawn from peer reviewed publications, websites, documents from the Environmental Protection Agency, University reports, Wellcome Library Special Collections and the Washington Post. Results Some consulting firms employ university researchers for industry work thereby disguising industry links in the income of large departments. If the industry affiliation is concealed by the scientist, biases from conflicting interests in risk assessments cannot be evaluated and dealt with properly. Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that editors and journal staff may suppress publication of scientific results that are adverse to industry owing to internal conflict of interest between editorial integrity and business needs. Conclusions Examples of these problems from Sweden, UK, and USA are presented.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The class action is an important <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of consumers' rights, particularly in personal actions for low sums known as Negative Expected Value (NEV) suits. Collective redress actions transform NEV suits into Positive Expected Value suits using economies of scale by the aggregation of smaller actions into a single legal action which is economically worthwhile pursuing. Collective redress promotes adherence to the law, deters illegal actions and furthers public interests. Collective redress also helps {{in the management of}} multiple cases in court. The introduction of a new class action model in Israel has proven to be very workable {{in the sense that it}} has improved access to justice, albeit that this system currently suffers from over-use, referred to in this work as the "flood problem". The purpose of this research is to introduce a class action model which brings with it the advantages of the Israeli model, as well as improvements upon it so as to promote consumer confidence in low figure transactions by individuals with large, powerful companies. The new model suggested in this work relies on the opt-out mechanism, monitored by regulatory bodies through public regulation or by private regulators. The reliance on the supremacy of public enforcement and follow-on actions over private stand-alone actions should make the system of collective redress more efficient than the current Israeli model, reducing the risk of a flood of actions whilst at the same time improving access to justice for large groups of claimants. Thus far, no unified European class action mechanism has been developed, and only some member states have developed their own systems. The model discussed in this work may be implemented as a unified set of rules in Europe, with some additional adjustments, such as those covering cross-border trade, to promote confidence in trade within the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} {{in international trade}} creates {{a growing number of}} disputes between parties from different countries. International arbitration is the most preferred mechanism to solve disputes in international trade. If the failing party does not voluntarily comply with the award, the successful party must apply <b>for</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> of the award in order to obtain the remedies. Since China {{is one of the major}} business markets in the world, several of the companies committed to arbitral procedures are likely to have assets in China. This means that, if a party fails to honour an award, an enforcement procedure may begin within a Chinese court. The enforcement procedures in China are said to be insufficient and not to comply with international standards. International conventions and treaties provide for a high level of security in the recognition and enforcement procedure of the arbitral award. The most used and important <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> is the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958, to which China as well as Sweden are Contracting States. According to the Convention, an international arbitral award may only be refused under certain grounds laid down in the Convention. An analysis of the legal situation in China confirms that there are problems associated with the enforcement of arbitral awards. These problems are not, however, connected with the concept of international arbitral awards, but rather with the entire judicial system in China. Even though an enforcing party can do little to overcome these problems, certain measures can be taken in order to ease the enforcement procedure...|$|R
40|$|The first essay of this {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} role of congressional politics in environmental law enforcements in the United States. It examines if {{and to what extent}} the political affiliation of a representative politician matters <b>for</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of the Clean Air Act (CAA); in particular whether the affiliation of a representative politician to a particular party results in a higher/lower level of enforcement in his/her constituency. The period of 1989 to 2005 is considered. The analysis shows that political processes at the local, state and federal level did matter <b>for</b> facility level <b>enforcements.</b> By and large, the Republican politicians tended to reduce facility level inspections compared to their Democrat counterparts and the magnitude of such reduction marginally increased with the seniority of the Republican politicians [...] a finding that has important policy implications. As a result the political affiliation of a politician emerges as a key <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> environmental <b>enforcement</b> in the emissions equation. The second essay studies the potential issue of contagion in individual honesty (or, dishonesty). When an individual believes that peers are predominantly untruthful (or, truthful) in a given situation, is he/she more likely to be untruthful (or, truthful) in that situation in absence of monitoring, social sanction and reputation formation? The analysis employs an asymmetric information deception game patterned after Gneezy (2005) and reaches at the conclusion that individuals are heavily (partly) contagious when they believe that peers are predominantly dishonest (honest). The conclusion sheds some light on one of the many individual level root causes as to why the world is bipolar in the distribution of corruption (with most countries are either highly corrupt or highly honest). The third essay discusses the complementarity that existed between the diffusion of motor vehicles usage and the construction of the network of roads in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. With the expansion of roads, communication between two destinations became smoother, faster and more convenient and in turn attracted more and more people to use motor vehicles as a medium of communication. We empirically investigate how the expansion of the network of roads resulted in the diffusion of motor vehicles. We plan to empirically explore the impact of the diffusion of motor vehicles usage on the expansion of the road network in our future work. The complementarity that existed between the diffusion of motor vehicles and the expansion of roads in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century has important policy implications for today's developing countries that do not have a well constructed network of roads...|$|R
