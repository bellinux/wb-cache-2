5|$|In early November, about 50 players renewed {{talks of}} union <b>decertification</b> if the union went lower than 52.5% of BRI or agreed to {{additional}} restrictions on contracts, salary-cap exceptions, or free agency. Decertifying {{would require that}} 30% of the union—about 130 players—sign a petition, allowing an election {{under the auspices of}} the NLRB by all NBPA members to decertify with a simple majority. The NLRB traditionally does not consider a <b>decertification</b> petition while a charge is pending, such as the NBPA's unfair labor practice charges filed in August.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of <b>decertification,</b> which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
25|$|The tenured/tenure-track faculty union proved controversial, however. A <b>decertification</b> petition, {{supported}} {{by a number of}} faculty, began circulating in 2012 as the union prepared for a second round of contract negotiations. The petition was successful, and in the <b>decertification</b> election which followed the tenured and tenure-track faculty voted 190 to 185 to dissolve the union. No <b>decertification</b> election was held for the adjunct union. Another union, the Graduate Employees Organization, formed to represent graduate students. The university agreed to recognize the graduate student union. Negotiations on their contract began in summer 2013.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 50 s, {{the percent of}} the {{workforce}} organized by unions has declined considerably. In the most recent decade that rate of decline has accelerated sharply. In an attempt to discover what factors can account for the overall decline and the further deterioration during the 70 s, we decompose the sources of growth and decline to determine {{the relative importance of}} changes in organizing activity, success in certification elections, <b>decertifications,</b> and net growth due to economic causes. We find that all factors except <b>decertifications</b> account for a substantial part of the change. In addition, interactions between the factors are very important. A significant finding is that while organizing activity and success rates have been declining over time, the net growth (or loss) of membership due to economic causes has remained stable controlling for the aggregate level of economic activity. We argue that this finding is inconsistent with the prevailing view that the decline in the percent of the workforce organized is primarily due to the decline of the heavily unionized core industries. ...|$|R
50|$|The company became {{notorious for}} its anti-union tactics, {{primarily}} for the 1917 Bisbee Deportation. The company worked with a local group of private citizens and the county sheriff to deputize about 2,000 members of a posse. Given names of Industrial Workers of the World members and other miners, they arrested nearly 1,300 striking miners at gunpoint in Bisbee, Arizona at the Copper Queen Mine. Portraying the Wobblie miners as bent on war-related sabotage, the company ordered them expelled from the jurisdiction, deporting them to Hermanas, New Mexico. Company officials and the Sheriff seized telegraph and telephone lines to keep news of this from getting out. The Phelps Dodge copper mine at Morenci, Arizona {{was the site of}} a violent strike from 1983 to 1986, culminating in one of the largest union <b>decertifications</b> in American labor history.|$|R
40|$|New York State {{has long}} been hailed by the labor {{movement}} for its high union density and strong and active local labor unions. Yet, like their counterparts in other states, unions in New York State have watched their numbers and their power shrink precipitously {{in the last few}} decades under the onslaught of corporate 2 ̆ 2 downsizing, 2 ̆ 2 plant closings, <b>decertifications,</b> broken strikes, and concession bargaining. At the same time, an increasingly hostile political climate, combined with rabidly anti-union employers and weak and poorly enforced labor laws, have made it more and more difficult for New York State unions to expand their membership through new organizing. In 1995, the New York State AFL-CIO began working with me, in my capacity as the Director of Labor Education Research at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations, to design an education program for affiliated unions to turn around the membership trend...|$|R
25|$|Two years later, Congress {{passed the}} Taft-Hartley Act, which {{significantly}} affected {{the use of}} strikebreakers. One of the innovations of the Taft-Hartley Act provided a mechanism for workers to vote out ("decertify") a union. Section 9(e)(2) of the Taft-Hartley Act created <b>decertification</b> elections, which would permit workers to take a vote on whether they wished to retain existing union representation. Section 9(e)(2) had the intended side-effect of disenfranchising striking workers. Employers quickly exploited this loophole by hiring permanent replacement workers and then petitioning for a <b>decertification</b> election. The practice became so common that President Dwight Eisenhower denounced it several times.|$|E
25|$|Yuengling {{employees}} {{filed for}} union <b>decertification</b> in 2006. As a result, Yuengling did not renew {{a contract with}} Teamsters Local 830 of Philadelphia in March 2006. In response, the trade union began boycotting Yuengling products.|$|E
25|$|The term “union buster” is a pejorative term to {{describe}} persons and organizations {{other than the}} workers themselves that seek to prevent the formation of trade unions or seek derecognition (UK) or <b>decertification</b> (US) of a labor union. This include outside firms hired by Management that provide services known as union avoidance or preventive labor relations for remuneration.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} January 1976, the ALRB had {{received}} 604 election petitions, conducted 423 elections involving over 50,000 workers (80 percent of elections had objections filed), received 988 ULP charges, issued 254 citations for violations of the Act, and issued 27 decisions. Between 1975 and 1984, unions won 88 percent of all elections, but between 1984 and 2003 won less than 50 percent of elections. By 1994, however, two-thirds of all elections had been held in the Act's first three years, and since 1978 {{about half of all}} elections had been <b>decertification</b> elections.|$|E
25|$|These attacks, and {{the dozens}} {{of members of the}} Colombian {{security}} forces taken prisoner by the FARC, contributed to increasingly shaming the government of president Ernesto Samper Pizano (1994–1998) in the eyes of sectors of public and political opinion. He was already the target of numerous critics due to revelations of a drug-money scandal surrounding his presidential campaign. Perceptions of corruption due to similar scandals led to Colombia's <b>decertification</b> as a country cooperating with the United States in the war on drugs in 1995 (when the effects of the measure were temporarily waived), 1996 and 1997.|$|E
25|$|Many labor {{lawyers and}} {{consultants}} find clients by monitoring government offices {{such as the}} NLRB regional offices, where US trade unions are required to file RC (Representation Certification) or RD (Representation <b>Decertification)</b> petitions which are public record. These petitions reveal the names of organizations undergoing concerted activity {{and the name of}} the union seeking recognition or an election. These petitions are also used by organizations to conduct demographic studies of concerted activity regionally in order to prepare supervisory training in anticipation of organizing. Some companies maintain libraries and offer petition logs online as a courtesy for companies which cannot conduct the research themselves.|$|E
25|$|As {{the state}} laid off public workers, PEF's {{membership}} dropped from 59,000 to 55,000 members, depriving {{the union of}} $1 million in dues revenue. Vacant positions on PEF's staff were eliminated or went unfilled (angering members, who felt {{the brunt of the}} grievance and service cuts), and officers took salary cuts. PEF members accused Shafer of playing politics with the staff cuts by jettisoning staff positions filled by his political opponents, and the PEF executive board retaliated by dismissing Roger Benson (one of Shafer's closest aides). The internal dissent became so bad that alleged assaults, racially inflammatory fliers, and accusations of financial fraud occurred at the SEIU Convention which PEF delegates attended in May 1992. Some PEF members began circulating <b>decertification</b> petitions, and Shafer's political opponents formed a new caucus (Members United for a Responsible Union) to run a slate of candidates against him in 1994.|$|E
500|$|The {{union and}} owners met again on September 13 but the {{negotiation}} soon collapsed. The salary cap structure remained {{the main source}} of disagreement. Owners wanted to create a hard cap for team payroll. The union wanted to keep the current structure intact, referring to it as a [...] "blood issue". Players were willing to cut salary only if owners agree to compromise on the salary cap. But owners were unwilling to concede, saying that there must be a system in place that allows all teams to compete. Five of the sports agents—Arn Tellem, Bill Duffy, Mark Bartelstein, Jeff Schwartz and Dan Fegan—who represent one-third of NBA players spoke with each other about decertifying the union. They believed owners have most of the leverage in negotiation and viewed <b>decertification</b> as a way for players to take control. Hunter said however that players had not considered <b>decertification</b> at this point.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think this}} whole thing has been {{manufactured}} by David Falk", Gattison told The Charlotte Observer Friday night. [...] "The guys he used to initiate the <b>decertification</b> drive aren't concerned with the union and the everyday little guy. These guys {{have been in the}} league 10 or 11 years and have yet to voice an opinion about what's going on. Then all of a sudden David Falk doesn't like what's going on." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of its routing through Arizona, I-40 follows the historic alignment of U.S. Route 66. [...] The lone exception is a stretch between Kingman and Ash Fork where US 66 took a more northerly, less direct route that is now State Route 66. [...] Construction of I-40 was ongoing in the 1960s and 1970s and reached completion in 1984. [...] With the completion of I-40 in 1984, the entire routing of US 66 had been bypassed by Interstate Highways which led to its <b>decertification</b> a year later in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{considerable}} support, <b>decertification</b> {{was defeated}} {{by a vote of}} the Players' Union, 226–134. [...] But even though Falk did not manage to decertify the NBPA, his influence helped to lead to the abandonment of a luxury tax on salaries, and ultimately led to a deal that increased the players' portion of NBA revenues from 52% to 57%, as well as the salary structure that saw Michael Jordan make $33 million for the 1998 season alone. [...] Some argued that the concessions Falk gained from the owners through his role in the 1995 lockout were the primary cause of another lockout that occurred just three seasons later.|$|E
500|$|Falk {{was one of}} the {{key figures}} in the 1995 NBA lockout. [...] The lockout {{originally}} occurred when the players wanted a soft salary cap, while the owners wanted a hard salary cap. [...] Falk led a rebellion on the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) by establishing a dissident faction of 16 players and a number of agents (including players Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Reggie Miller, and fellow agents Marc Fleisher and Arn Tellem) that began advocating for NBPA <b>decertification.</b> [...] The goal was to strip NBA management of antitrust protection, making the salary cap and other forms of collective bargaining violations of antitrust laws, win a settlement in court, and then immediately re-form the Players' Union. NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Falk's involvement in the negotiations, saying that he was [...] "trashing his own clients." [...] Kenny Gattison, the Charlotte Hornets' player representative, {{went so far as to}} blame the entire lockout on Falk.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, {{immediately}} after class <b>decertification</b> {{of the previous}} case, {{a new group of}} plaintiffs led by Robert Pepper won the race to the courthouse by filing a complaint in the Northern District, which was combined with some slightly later filers and titled [...] "In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation", case 11-cv-06714-YGR. [...] The new case is essentially the same but is filed only against Apple, not AT Mobility. [...] In late 2013, the various parts of the case were dismissed by the district court. [...] The parts relating to SIM locking were rejected because AT was not a party and the plaintiffs were not willing to add AT [...] The remaining claim, in its final version, was that Apple monopolised the market for iPhone applications and that the plaintiffs were damaged by paying Apple's 30% commission for paid applications in the App Store, which the court rejected saying that the commission was [...] "a cost passed-on to consumers by independent software developers", not paid by the consumers directly, and so the plaintiffs did not have standing under the Illinois Brick doctrine.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{ten years}} 2005 through 2014, the National Labor Relations Board {{recorded}} 18,577 labor union representation elections; in 11,086 of these elections (60 percent), the majority of workers voted for union representation. Most of the elections (15,517) were triggered by employee petitions [...] for representation, of which unions won 9,933. Less common were elections caused by employee petitions for <b>decertification</b> (2792, of which unions won 1070), and employer-filed petitions for either representation or <b>decertification</b> (268, of which unions won 85).|$|E

The CFS has accused anti-CFS students of being right-wing union busters, with Fred Hahn stating that: [...] "Workers know that the push for <b>decertification</b> votes, whether for labour or students’ unions, are not driven by an interest in democracy, but by a commitment to weaken the collective voice of union members." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though legal, {{derecognition}} (UK) or <b>decertification</b> (US) of a {{trade union}} may {{be referred to as}} union busting by trade unions, even when it is initiated by members of the union.

[...] Workers in the UK may derecognize a union which no longer has support from members or if union membership falls below 50%. [...] Employers may derecognize a union if they no longer employ 21 or more workers. [...] Generally in the UK an application for derecognition must be made to the CAC or Central Arbitration Committee which declares that a derecognition/decertification ballot election will be held. [...] However a company may decide to unilaterally derecognize, as long as it has a non-CAC recognition agreement in force.|$|E
2500|$|PEF {{reached a}} new {{contract}} with the state in March 1993.

Shafer quickly agreed to the pact, which included a 9.5 percent salary increase over four years that was retroactive to April 1, 1991; moved PEF members into the state's health insurance pool; and ended PEF's lawsuit over the state's decision to defer a week's pay until each member retired. Although the PEF executive board voted to recommend the contract to PEF's members, those who voted [...] "no" [...] on the pact argued that PEF had achieved less than other unions, that the deal traded concessions for pay increases, and that the money spent on Kheel's consulting contract had gotten the union nothing better than what had been offered months before. [...] The board meeting was a raucous one, with alleged physical confrontations, a [...] "Dump Shafer" [...] movement hanging banners near the entrance, rumors of <b>decertification,</b> and proposals for PEF to abandon its independence and join either SEIU or AFT.
