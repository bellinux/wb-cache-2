2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, {{the money that we}} found in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus surely it stands to reason, [...] "How much more then <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?" [...] (8) [...] reasoned, [...] "Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth," [...] and does it not follow, [...] "How much more the wicked and the sinner?" [...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E

60|$|This was a {{difficult}} point <b>to</b> decide. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see them, <b>we</b> might as well break up our camp, for we could not tell when {{we should be able}} to come back to it.|$|R
6000|$|But Fulk's answer, was--"Better so! <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{a strange}} place, {{and tried to}} conceal it, it would always be oozing out, and be {{supposed}} disgraceful. If my sisters can bear it, I had rather confront it straightforwardly--" ...|$|R

5000|$|In the Brazilian dub, El Chavo {{repeatedly}} says: [...] "Teria sido melhor ir ver o Pelé" [...] (English: [...] "It {{would be}} better <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see the Pelé movie"). The line has become very popular in Brazil, {{and has become a}} part of popular culture in there.

5000|$|In June 1914, {{following}} the publishing of the 1914-1915 Naval Estimates, Scott had a letter {{published in the}} London Times criticising the lack of provision for submarines and aircraft. He argued that submarines represented a potent threat to the fleet and that no fleet could hide from {{the eye of the}} aeroplane: [...] "probably <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> war, <b>we</b> should at once lock our battleships up in a safe" [...] For this he received an avalanche of critical denials.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} offer you my thanks, Miss Stirling, but they're very sincere," [...] he said. [...] "Don't {{you think it}} would be better <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> camp?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would expect}} to marry a millionaire if she did. What astonishes one over here is to see how contentedly people prosper along on their own level. And the women do twice {{the work of the}} men without expecting to equal them in any other way. At Pupp's, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> one end of the out-door restaurant, it takes three men to wait on us: one to bring our coffee or tea, another to bring our bread and meat, and another to make out our bill, and I have to tip all three of them. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the other end, one girl serves us, and I have to give only one fee; I make it less than the least I give any three of the men waiters." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Idiot!' replied Michael, who {{was hungry}} too, and, {{like many people}} when they are hungry, very cross also. 'We set out to travel through the world, {{and what does it}} matter <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the right or to the left?' And, without another word, took the path to the castle, closely {{followed}} by Jack, and after a moment by Martin likewise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{tell her}} {{exactly what you}} say," [...] Tavernake {{answered}} apparently unmoved. [...] "Perhaps {{it would be as}} well now <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> view the sleeping apartments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] Marina said, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> up <b>to</b> {{the flat}} roof, {{we may see}} {{something}} {{of what is going}} on. This house is more lofty than most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you're {{not sure}} about the way, wouldn't it be better <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> Jake?" [...] he suggested. [...] "It seems a pity we didn't think of it earlier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Teyma promptly; [...] "that {{would let}} the men of Poloe know that we talk of going to attack them. I do not love war. I wish to let our enemies alone, but if my chief decides for war, it is my duty to help, not to {{frustrate}} him. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with Poloeland, we must take the men of Poloe by surprise. That could not be if a young man went with your message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, comrades," [...] he said, {{turning to}} them abruptly, [...] "if {{we go to}} the right and {{traverse}} this fine country we may very likely fall in with villages, but the villagers may be savages, like those we met on the coast. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the left, we shall have to traverse the somewhat dark and difficult forests, but then we shall be making for the mountains and table-lands of the interior; and as the capital, Ant--Ant--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should think}} we do quite that, Dick. We walk from {{daylight}} to sunset, and often {{two or three hours}} by moonlight; and though we don't go very fast, we ought to get over a lot of ground. Listen! There is music!" [...] Both held their breath. [...] "Yes, there are the regular beats of a big drum. It is on the highroad, I should say, nearly abreast of us. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> that knoll we shall have a view of them; and there cannot be the least danger, as they must be fully a mile away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well!' said Solomon, rising, {{to divert}} the {{attention}} of his two friends, who tittered at this retort: 'believed or disbelieved, it's true; and true or not, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London, <b>we</b> must be going at once. So shake hands, Johnny, and good night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said I. [...] "They're sure to stay {{all night}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> up <b>to</b> the house, and then I {{should have to}} have the tent and things hauled away, for I couldn't leave them here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{never want}} no {{soldiers}} here if the masters would {{speak with the}} men; but {{the sight of a}} pitman is pison to a gentleman, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> up <b>to</b> speak with 'em, they always run away." ...|$|R
