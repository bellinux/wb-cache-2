5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left with nothing to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop {{if it was not}} either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E

If true, it shows that Brus' motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland {{in the wake of the}} invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion.

500|$|Grainger {{first met}} Grieg {{at the home}} of the London {{financier}} Sir Edgar Speyer, in May 1906. As a student Grainger [...] had learned to appreciate the Norwegian's harmonic originality, and by 1906 [...] had [...] several Grieg pieces in his concert repertoire, including the piano concerto. Grieg was greatly impressed with Grainger's playing, and wrote that the Australian was [...] "a genius that we Scandinavians cannot <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> love." [...] During 1906–07 the two maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence, which culminated in Grainger's ten-day visit in July 1907 to the composer's Norwegian home, [...] "Troldhaugen" [...] near Bergen. Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing the piano concerto in preparation for that year's Leeds Festival. Their plans for a long-term working relationship were thwarted by Grieg's sudden death in September 1907; nevertheless, this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on Grainger, and he championed Grieg's music {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, actors Hiroyuki Sanada, Hal Yamanouchi, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima {{had been}} cast as Shingen, Ichirō, Mariko and Yukio, respectively. Additionally, Will Yun Lee was cast as Harada, and Brian Tee as Noburo Mori. By July 2012, Deadline.com said Jessica Biel would play Viper. However, at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Biel said {{her role in}} the film was [...] "not a done deal", explaining, [...] "People keep talking about this. I don't know {{anything}} about it. It's a little bit too soon for that kind of an announcement". A few days later, negotiations between Biel and 20th Century Fox had broken down. Later in July, Fox had begun talks with Svetlana Khodchenkova to take over the role. Somewhat unusually for action movies, The Wolverine features four female lead roles and [...] "passes the Bechdel Test early and often", according to Vulture. Mangold noted that he wrote his heroines so that [...] "they all have missions. They all have jobs to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> be the object of affection", intent of avoiding the [...] "worn out" [...] trope of the woman in jeopardy.|$|E
500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least she knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....seemed to us {{necessary}} {{to ensure that the}} pattern of local government was such as to make the planning of development and the organisation of services fully effective, and to make certain that new development, such as houses, main roads, bridges and shops would match the growth and location of industry instead of perpetuating the patterns of the past. We were impressed by the need on Tees-side for more housing to relieve overcrowding, to replace outworn properties, and to meet the increase in population due to industrial expansion. Yet unless Teesside could be planned as a whole, it seemed to us impossible to ensure that new houses would be built in places most convenient for the people who would live in them, as it was difficult for the present ten separate housing authorities, each with their own housing list, to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> build within or near their own boundaries...|$|E
2500|$|A theme {{related to}} this {{concerns}} creative energy (both generative and imaginative). Or, rather, the lack of creative energy that is depicted in the poem - both visually and aurally. Bloom, referring to Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, says that [...] "the Human, standing still, becomes the wholly natural", and is, quoting Blake, [...] "unable to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to repeat the same dull round over again" [...] (just like the Sunflower). Only when the [...] "contraries" [...] (including [...] "Reason and Energy") in the human condition are married together in [...] "creative strife", will {{a way out of}} repeating the same dull round over again (towards [...] "Eden") be found. (Keith points to the repetition of the word 'sunflower' in the first and last lines. He says that this [...] "helps {{to draw attention to the}} fact that no progression is made in the course of the poem at all.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The jobs {{available}} to the prisoners were few; between 1930 and 1960, about 200 inmates out of a population averaging 550 had something to do. [...] In the 1940s and '50s, most prisoners spent twenty-two {{hours a day in}} their cells. [...] The industries that were available were managed not by civilians or guards, but, due to the shortage of staff at the prison, by a system of inmate overseers. [...] Called [...] "con-bosses," [...] these privileged inmates had complete control over their areas, reserving the right to choose which inmates worked under them, how much work they received, and {{what they had to do}} to receive work at all. [...] Since work meant not only something to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> sit in a cell but also time earned off a sentence, this system led to rampant corruption, favoritism, and ill-feelings among the prisoners, since the con-bosses often sold positions or used them as leverage for any number of illicit favors.|$|E

2500|$|Series b however, {{completely}} refutes {{the basic}} concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that [...] "Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover." [...] As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; [...] "Reason or {{the ratio of}} all we have already known. {{is not the same}} as it shall be when we know more." [...] Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; [...] "The bounded is loathed by its possessor." [...] As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because [...] "Less than all cannot satisfy Man." [...] However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because [...] "if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot." [...] However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus [...] "the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite." [...] That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, not to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; [...] "If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things & stand still, unable to <b>do</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> repeat the same dull round over again"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate ("the Ratio"); [...] "He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only." [...] Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, [...] "God becomes as we are that we may be as he is." ...|$|E
