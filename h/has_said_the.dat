5|$|In April 2010, Malcolm Reid {{proposed}} the station's site {{as a possible}} location for a £80 million Siemens wind turbine factory. The factory would create 700 jobs and up to 1,500 further jobs in the supply chain if built. He <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> site would be perfect for the factory because of its close proximity to NaREC and the site's existing deep dock facilities. The factory {{is likely to be}} built either in Blyth or on Humberside.|$|E
5|$|Brown <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> rescue {{efforts of}} Army National Guard during the Northeastern United States {{blizzard}} of 1978 impressed him. He joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard {{when he was}} 19, receiving his basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and attending Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) classes at the campus of Northeastern University. He was trained in infantry, quartermaster, and airborne duties, and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). He {{was active in the}} Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel. As the Army National Guard's head defense attorney in New England, Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive drug tests, and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to war zones. He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in Kazakhstan and a week in Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|Mancera {{has been}} married twice. His first {{marriage}} was to a woman named Martha in the early 1990s, with whom lived in civil union for a year. They divorced two years later, and after six years Mancera married Magnolia, {{with whom he had}} two children, Miguel and Leonardo. After a decade, he divorced Magnolia. Mancera has a daughter out of wedlock, but he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> child's mother does not want Mancera to see her. In September 2007, two assailants on a motorcycle intercepted and attempted to rob him while he drove his BMW in Periférico Sur. His bodyguard intervened and shot one of the robbers, killing him. From 2008 to 2009, Mancera dated Alejandra Barrales, who was the president of the PRD party at that time, and also she intended to become the PRD candidate for Mayor of Mexico City in 2012. In his spare time, he practices multiple sports, including Krav Maga, indoor cycling and weight lifting, hunting and aviation. On October 31, 2014, Mancera had a cardiac surgery because three months before a cardiac arrhythmia was detected. During the surgery, he had a cardiac perforation. He recovered two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1997 the Taliban {{launched}} {{an attack on}} Sheberghan, the main military base of Abdul Rashid Dostum.

Further, Bentley's counsel argued {{that even if he}} <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> words, it could not be proven that Bentley had intended the words to mean the informal meaning of [...] "shoot him, Chris" [...] instead of the literal meaning of [...] "give him the gun, Chris".|$|R
