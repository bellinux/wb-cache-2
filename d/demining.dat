5|$|The Government of Croatia {{established}} several {{bodies to}} address the problem of land mines in Croatia; foremost among them are the Office for Mine Action and the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Office for Mine Action is a government agency tasked with providing expert analysis and advice on <b>demining.</b> The Croatian Mine Action Centre is a public-sector body tasked with planning and conducting <b>demining</b> surveys, accepting cleared areas, marking mine-suspected areas, quality assurance, <b>demining</b> research and development, and victim assistance. The work of the Croatian Mine Action Centre is supervised by the Office for Mine Action.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for <b>demining.</b> Other safety-related areas receiving <b>demining</b> priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|While {{a direct}} route by sea {{has not been}} {{available}} since {{the sinking of the}} Joola, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and the river), the former running through Nioro du Rip to Farafenni, and the latter crossing the river to Banjul. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7p.m. and 10a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant <b>demining</b> operations. Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring, or to travel by boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.|$|E

25|$|Currently, Afghanistan and Iraq is {{consuming}} {{the largest}} amount of <b>demining</b> funds, with 24.8% and 15.1% respectively {{of the global}} spending on humanitarian <b>demining.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modified long-armed <b>demining</b> bulldozers {{are being}} used {{in a number of}} countries. They have the {{capability}} to remove vegetation before <b>demining</b> and can withstand antipersonnel and antitank landmines. Their long arms provide the benefit of reducing damage to the main body, especially to the operator's cab. Three inch (7.62cm) thick bulletproof glass protects the operator from directional mines.|$|E
25|$|In {{times of}} {{relative}} peace, {{the process of}} mine removal {{is referred to as}} <b>demining.</b> This is a thorough, time-intensive process that seeks to locate all mines so that the land or sea area may be safely returned to normal use. It is vital that this process be exhaustive. Even if only a small handful of mines remain undiscovered, incomplete <b>demining</b> can actually lead to an increase in civilian mine casualties as local people re-occupy an area they previously avoided in the belief that it has been made safe. In this context <b>demining</b> is one of the tools of mine action. Coordinated by Mine Action Coordination Centers run by the United Nations or a host government, civilian mine clearance agencies are tasked with the <b>demining.</b> In post-conflict areas, minefields are often contaminated with a mixture of explosive remnants of war (ERW) that includes unexploded ordnance as well as landmines. In that context, the humanitarian clearance effort {{is often referred to as}} battle area clearance.|$|E
50|$|Parts of the Krka river {{were heavily}} mined during the Yugoslav Wars. As of 2016, many fields {{bordering}} the canyon between Visovačko lake and Prokljansko lake {{on the right}} bank, and between Nečven and Visovačko lake on the left bank, {{have yet to be}} <b>demined.</b> Tourist areas and paved roads are no longer affected.|$|R
50|$|At {{the stage}} theatre of {{exterior}} operations, the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment has both a military and humanitarian approach on callings. The regiment <b>demined</b> {{the roads and}} rice fields in Cambodia, ameliorated and constructed schools and gave French lessons. The regiment also evacuated those exiting French citizens from the Ivory Coast, Gabon, Nouméa, Tchad, Mauritania and ex-Yougoslavia.|$|R
50|$|The {{hill was}} {{extensively}} mined by the Viet Cong. As the hill was the dominant terrain {{feature in the}} area, the 7th Marines, supported by mine-clearing LVTE-1s of the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion and engineers from the 3rd Engineer Battalion {{took control of the}} hill, <b>demined</b> it and established a base there in late January/early February 1966.|$|R
25|$|The main {{methods used}} for {{humanitarian}} <b>demining</b> on land are: manual detection using metal detectors and prodders, detection by specially trained mine detection dogs, and mechanical clearance using armored vehicles fitted with flails, tiller or similar devices. There is an organization, APOPO, that is training African rats to detect landmines much as dogs do, offering a local solution to countries in Africa. In many circumstances, the only method {{that meets the}} United Nations' requirements for effective humanitarian <b>demining,</b> the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS), is manual detection and disarmament. The process is typically slow, expensive and dangerous, although <b>demining</b> can be safer than construction work if procedures are followed rigorously. New technologies may provide effective alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Special {{machines}} effectively combine mine {{detection and}} removal into one operation. In the past, these machines were applied in both mine clearance and <b>demining</b> but are now generally {{used only for}} <b>demining.</b> They {{can be used to}} verify land that is not expected to be contaminated or as an extra layer of security after an area has been cleared by another method, such as dogs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Demining</b> {{operations}} {{were carried out}} {{with the aid of}} foreign governments and Non-governmental organizations, and are currently in their final phases.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of this intense Allied bombardment, Cézembre's {{landscape}} is barren and pitted, although natural vegetation is returning. The island has not yet been completely <b>demined,</b> and for this reason most of the island other than the beach constitutes a zone interdite (prohibited zone), with a barbed-wire fence and warning notices.The micronation of Talossa claims Cézembre as part of its territory.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to detect land mines by directing sound waves at the area to be <b>demined,</b> which causes the land mines to vibrate, and then using a laser to search for vibrations on the surface {{by means of the}} Doppler shift - this technique is termed scanning laser doppler vibrometry. Such devices have been constructed, e.g., at the University of Mississippi, at MIT and by the Kayser-Threde Company.|$|R
50|$|As of 2005, {{the main}} grape {{varieties}} planted in Vietnam are the Cardinal and Chambourcin grapes. A large form of wine production is from fruit wines {{made from the}} country's abundance of local fruits. The British firm Allied Domecq and Australian winemakers {{have been working on}} introducing more international grape varieties into the region as well as experimenting with sparkling wine production. Many new vineyards sites are being planted in areas recently <b>demined.</b>|$|R

25|$|Recently, armies have {{developed}} armored <b>demining</b> vehicles, and specially armored bulldozers, that are remote controlled. This eliminates {{risk to the}} operator. Notable examples are the Caterpillar D7 MCAP (United States) and Raam HaShachar Caterpillar D9N (Israel).|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} Nagorno-Karabakh is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most heavily mined regions of the former Soviet Union. Mines were laid from 1991 to 1994 by both conflicting parties in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The United Nations and the U.S. have estimated the number of mines in Nagorno-Karabakh at 100,000. There have been many civilian casualties resulting from the land mines. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) claims that 123 people have been killed and over 300 injured by landmines near the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh since a 1994 truce ended a six-year conflict between ethnic Armenian and Azerbaijani forces. The HALO Trust – UK based <b>demining</b> NGO, is the only other organisation conducting <b>demining</b> in Nagorno Karabakh.|$|E
25|$|In these mine {{clearance}} operations, the methods that are applied for detection and removal are quicker, but less exacting. These methods include those that detect and remove {{in a single}} action, such as mechanical <b>demining,</b> carpet bombing, burning of the land {{or the use of}} Bangalore torpedoes or mine-clearing line charges.|$|E

In honor of his work and his music, he was given an escopetarra (a decommissioned AK-47 converted into a guitar) by peace activist César López; he later sold it at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills for US$17,000. Juanes held a benefit concert on May 24, 2006 in conjunction with KLVE and Univision which raised roughly US$350,000 to care for injured children and provide prosthetics, wheelchairs, and land rehabilitation.|$|R
5000|$|More specifically, in 1950 Minister of Finance J. R. Jayewardene {{requested}} that the government recognise Samarakoon's Namo Namo Matha as the official national anthem. The government appointed a committee headed by Edwin Wijeyeratne, Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development, to pick a new national anthem. The committee heard several songs but, after much deliberation, picked Namo Namo Matha. The committee made a minor change to Samarakoon's song, with his approval, changing the tenth line from [...] "Nawajeewana Damine" [...] to [...] "Nawa Jeewana <b>Demine</b> Nithina Apapupudu Karan Matha". The committee's decision was endorsed by the government on 22 November 1951. The anthem was translated into the Tamil language by M. Nallathamby. Namo Namo Matha was first sung as Ceylon's official national anthem at the independence day ceremony in 1952.|$|R
