5|$|The {{song thrush}} is {{the emblem of}} West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Albion's early nickname, The Throstles.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrestrial}} globe is significant in conjecturing that North America {{is separated from}} Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus.

5|$|Alphonso Boone, the {{grandson}} of Daniel Boone, settled in what would later become Wilsonville in 1846 and established the Boones Ferry across the Willamette River in 1847. The ferry <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the community of Boones Landing, which eventually grew into Wilsonville. Originally, the area {{was part of what}} became Yamhill County, but was transferred to the current Clackamas County in 1855.

5|$|As the freeholders {{shared the}} mineral royalties, the mines brought {{prosperity}} which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the remodelling and redevelopment {{of much of}} the village. Green Terrace, which includes the old post office, was built in the 1870s, and Main Street was transformed from a back lane into the high street. The village school, with working clock and bell tower, was built by the community in 1874, and the stone-built Ibbotson Institute, now the community hall, was completed in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E
50|$|Two {{alternative}} CDFs can be used: the logistic {{and normal}} CDFs. The logistic CDF <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the logit {{model and the}} normal CDF <b>give</b> <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> the probit model.|$|R

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, when Cibber first rose to be Rich's right-hand man at Drury Lane, his perceived opportunism and brash, thick-skinned personality <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> many barbs in print, especially against his patchwork plays. The early attacks were mostly anonymous, but Daniel Defoe and Tom Brown are suggested as potential authors. Later, Jonathan Swift, John Dennis and Henry Fielding all lambasted Cibber in print. The most famous conflict Cibber had was with Alexander Pope.|$|E

5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} {{understanding}} with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed {{to cooperate and}} mutually provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions.

5|$|In another study, {{methylation}} of the EFS CpG {{island was}} observed in 69% of cases of uveal melanoma (UM) and only UM with EFS methylation <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> metastases. RT-PCR expression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between EFS mRNA expression with EFS methylation in UM. EFS methylation was tissue-specific with full methylation in peripheral blood cells, but no methylation in other tissues such as fetal muscle, kidney and brain.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. What <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
