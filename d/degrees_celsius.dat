5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> when idle, and at 60 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> at full load.|$|E
5|$|At 7:45am local time, the ladle in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation to pour out its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E

Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association {{to care for the}} poor), helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius.</b> Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Central African Republic is {{situated}} {{just north of}} the Equator with daily temperatures normally reaching at least 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius.</b> Bangui, close to the Equator in the south of the country is slightly hotter and wetter than the northern regions. It has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw) with dry winters. While the warm season is from 23 January to 18 March, the cold season lasts from 20 June to 27 August, when rainfall is frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. The city is bordered by thick tropical rainforests along the river banks. Several of its neighbourhoods are in low-lying areas prone to recurrent flooding. Severe rains in June and July 2009 left 11,000 people homeless.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> above the ambient temperature.|$|E

40|$|Thermally induced aging {{processes}} in Ni/C-multilayers {{with a double}} layer thickness {{on the scale of}} nanometers were investigated. The samples were prepared by pulsed laser deposition and annealed for 20 minutes at temperatures in the range of 50 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> to 400 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius.</b> The characterization of the multilayers before and after thermal treatment was carried out by X-ray reflectometry under grazing incidence of Cu-K radiation. From the reflectivity depending on the angle of incidence layer thicknesses and the nickel density were determined by fitting of model calculations to the measured curves. The density of the amorphous carbon layers was derived from the fluorescence yield of a single carbon layer. To observe the changes of crystal structure, X-ray diffraction was used. Ni/C multilayers remain nearly unchanged up to 200 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius.</b> Between 200 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> and 300 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> nickel carbide crystallizes. Above 350 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> the decomposition of the carbide a nd the crystallization of fcc nickel lead to a rapid increase of the double layer thickness and to deterioration of the reflectivity...|$|R
5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius.</b> In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|Siberia is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} polar region, owing to the dryness of the winter climate and has glaciers only in the high Altai Mountains, Verkhoyansk Range, Cherskiy Range and Suntar-Khayata Range, plus possibly a few very small glaciers in the ranges near Lake Baikal, which have never been monitored and may have completely disappeared since 1989. Between the years 1952 and 2006, the glaciers found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2percent. This shrinkage has been primarily in the ablation zone of the glaciers, with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers. The Altai region has also experienced an overall temperature increase of 1.2 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> in the last 120years {{according to a report}} from 2006, with most of that increase occurring since the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Europe {{the tree}} of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius</b> to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found {{the tree of}} heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe {{this is not the case}} as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park.|$|E
5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius.</b> The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E

Hausser, the commander of II SS Panzer Corps, requested aid from the III Panzer Corps to his right, but the panzer corps had no units to spare. By the end of the day, the 3rd SS Division had made very limited progress due in part to a tributary of the Donets river. The lack of progress undermined the advance made by its sister divisions and exposed the right flank of the corps to Soviet forces. The temperatures, reaching over 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>Celsius,</b> and frequent thunderstorms made fighting conditions difficult.|$|E

40|$|Gun {{propellants}} ana double base rocket propellant {{were tested}} {{to find out}} stabilizer consumption and molar mass degradation between 60 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> and 90 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius,</b> in part between 40 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> and 110 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius.</b> The stabilizer content was measured by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-detection, and the molar mass degradation by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with refractive index detection. For {{the evaluation of the}} experimental data, different kinetic models were used. Molar mass decrease is described by a model based on statistical chain scission by the decomposition of chain elements. Stabilizer decrease is described with two models, one based on a first order reaction, the other is a combination of first and zero order reactions. Two temperature regions with different activation energies were found for the two investigated properties, stabilizer consumption and molar mass decrease, in the single base gun propellant A 5020. T he transition is about at 60 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius</b> to 70 <b>degree</b> <b>Celsius.</b> This influences clearly the prediction of lifetimes. The Arrhenius parameters of the two reaction regions of both properties have been determined. The resulting lifetimes are discussed...|$|R
