40|$|Earned value {{management}} (EVM) has prepared some methods to forecast final costs of projects. These methods were not developed {{since the start}} of formation and were gradually completed, of course with one exception that is its authenticity, they are still remained unchanged. At the present time EVM guide does not apply from schedule indices to <b>forecast</b> <b>schedule</b> for completion of project and lacks such ability. The goal of the present study is to improve abilities of project managers for making logical and intelligent decisions through trustable forecasting methods and final cost of project. Regardless the type of work, time, and range, this method is recommended for project managers. This method is based on technique of EVM which is able to <b>forecast</b> <b>schedule</b> for completion of project by using statistical methods.

40|$|Abstract—To {{maintain}} stability {{within the}} UCTE-grid, European TSOs {{are responsible for}} maintaining a balance between generation, import, consumption and export in their control zones. This responsibility is partly transferred to BRPs which are market participants responsible for the balance between injections and off-takes in their perimeter. With imbalance fees working as incentive to avoid imbalances, BRPs will <b>forecast,</b> <b>schedule</b> and nominate their positions to the TSO before gate closure. With rising interest in electricity from Renewable Energy Sources (RES-e), often characterized by variability, lower predictability and limited controllability, BRPs are facing difficulties meeting their nominated positions in real-time. This gives them a competitive disadvantage. As in most countries RES-e are in fact supported to attain certain penetration levels, system operators and BRPs {{have to find ways}} to manage this unpredictability and variability.

40|$|When the {{air traffic}} demand is {{expected}} to exceed the available airport's capacity {{for a short period}} of time, Ground Stop (GS) operations are implemented by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Traffic Flow Management (TFM). The GS requires departing aircraft meeting specific criteria to remain on the ground to achieve reduced demands at the constrained destination airport until the end of the GS. This paper provides a high-level overview of the statistical distributions as well as causal factors for the GSs at the major airports in the United States. The GS's character, the weather impact on GSs, GS variations with delays, and the interaction between GSs and Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) are investigated. The machine learning methods are used to generate classification models that map the historical airport weather <b>forecast,</b> <b>schedule</b> traffic, and other airport conditions to implemented GS/GDP operations and the models are evaluated using the cross-validations. This modeling approach produced promising results as it yielded an 85 % overall classification accuracy to distinguish the implemented GS days from the normal days without GS and GDP operations and a 71 % accuracy to differentiate the GS and GDP implemented days from the GDP only days...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} jointly {{scheduling}} both hard deadline periodic tasks and soft aperiodic tasks {{has been the}} subject of considerable research in real-time systems. One of the most widely accepted solutions for this problem are slack stealing algorithms. However, these algorithms are rather impractical, since they all imply a considerable scheduler overhead. This paper faces the overhead problem by introducing a complete hardware architecture that implements slack stealing in hardware using an optimal algorithm redesigned to be implemented efficiently in hardware. The proposed solution is a circuit that behaves as a kind of sophisticated interrupt controller taking the task workload and the interrupts as inputs, and providing the highest priority task to be executed in the CPU. From the point of view of hardware design, the algorithm involves two main problems: first, to select the highest priority task at every moment and, second, to locate a set of slack gaps in a real-time computation. Locating slack gaps in a real-time computation is a problem that requires to “look forward in time” into the <b>forecast</b> <b>schedule</b> of a given workload. This paper analyses the different approaches for solving this problem and presents a novel architecture to solve it efficiently using a technique based on an event-driven simulation of the future of a real-time computation.

40|$|Abstract—Several {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} in the literature to forecast electricity market prices and improve forecast accuracy. However, no studies have been reported examining {{the economic impact of}} price forecast inaccuracies on forecast users. Therefore, in this paper, the application of electricity market price forecasts to short-term operation scheduling of two typical and inherently different industrial loads is examined and the associated economic impact is analyzed. Using electricity market price forecasts as the expected next-day electricity prices, optimal operating schedules and the associated costs are determined for each load. These costs are compared with those of a “perfect ” price forecast scenario in which actual prices are used to determine the operating schedules. Numerical results and discussions are provided based on price forecasts with different error characteristics.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assessment}} of {{soil moisture content}} and surface roughness from remotely sensed data is of primary importance for improving agricultural techniques of conservation farming such as yield <b>forecasts,</b> <b>scheduling</b> irrigations, fertilization.

However, up to now, few works analyze the performance of these filters on the retrieval of spatially and physically accurate information useful for the estimates of these soil properties. In this context, this paper outlines the sensitivity of several speckle filtering methods on the {{assessment of}} these two agricultural surface parameters.

DOD Program Management Office test personnel develop test schedules manually using time estimates and heuristic subject matter expert advice for each test to forecast the overall time and costs associated with a developed course of action. These manually constructed schedules take weeks to develop via many planning iterations to construct an acceptable, but not necessarily feasible or optimal solution. Ultimately, these <b>forecast</b> <b>schedules</b> and duration estimates can be inaccurate, and may result in schedule delays and/or cost overruns.
