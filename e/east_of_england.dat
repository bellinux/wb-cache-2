5|$|According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles {{experience}} a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Lincolnshire's {{position on the}} east of the Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and {{it is one of the}} driest counties in the United Kingdom. Although it may vary depending on altitude and proximity to the coast, the mean average temperature for the <b>East</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> is approximately 9°C to 10.5°C; the highest temperature recorded in the region was 37.3°C at Cavendish on 10 August 2003. On average, the region experiences 30 days of rainfall in winter and 25 in summer, with 15 days of thunder and 6–8 days of hail per year; on 25 August 2001, hail the size of golf balls were reported in Sleaford and other parts of central Lincolnshire. Wind tends to affect the north and west of the country more than the East, and Lincolnshire tends to receive no more than 2 days of gale per year (where gale is a gust of wind at >34knots, sustained for at least 10 minutes). Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the <b>East</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> than elsewhere in the country; Sleaford experienced tornadoes in 2006 and 2012, both of which caused damage to property.|$|E

5|$|The British {{demand for}} {{electricity}} increased after the Second World War.

This new generating capacity quickly met the demand for power. The British Electricity Authority were granted permission to construct the Stella North and Stella South power stations in 1951. The two stations were originally projected to cost around £15,000,000.|$|E
