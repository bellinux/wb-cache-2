5000|$|<b>Inter-Korean</b> <b>Summits</b> (In North Korea: 북남수뇌상봉 [...] "North-South Leader Meeting"; in South Korea: 남북정상회담 [...] "South-North Summit Talks") are {{meetings}} between {{the leaders of}} North Korea and South Korea. There have been two major meetings, the first in 2000 and the second in 2007. The importance of these summits lies in the lack of formal communication between North and South Korea, which makes discussing political and economic issues difficult. The summits' agendas have included topics such as {{the ending of the}} 1953 war (currently there is an armistice in force), the massive deployment of troops at the DMZ (approximately two million in total), the development of nuclear weapons by North Korea and human rights issues.|$|R

She was branded a traitor by North Korea, after seeing South Korea, and becoming a critic of North Korea. Kim now resides in exile, and under constant tight security, fearing that the North Korean government wants to kill her.

After a twelve-year hiatus, the prime ministers of the two Koreas met in Seoul in September 1990 {{to engage in the}} <b>Inter-Korean</b> <b>summits</b> or High-Level Talks. In December, the two countries reached an agreement on issues of reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation, and exchange between North and South in [...] "The Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, Cooperation, and Exchange Between North and South", but these talks collapsed over inspection of nuclear facilities.

Many in the South criticized the Seoul government for failing to secure the return of South Korean prisoners of war or any civilian abductees in return. The repatriations were a good will gesture and no conditions officially were attached. The South Korea government did expect its gesture to lead to more cooperation and eventual reconciliation between the two sides.|$|E

Hyundai Asan is building an industrial park, cross-border roads and railway lines in North Korea. The delay of the projects, due to political difficulties, put severe financial strains on the company. The head of Hyundai Asan, Chung Mong-hun, faced corruption and embezzlement charges. Chung was tried on charges of manipulating company accounting records to hide the secret transfers and embezzling more than twelve million dollars of company funds to pay bribes.

Stratfor analysed Kim's choice to nominate Yang, along with the naming of four-decade career diplomat and trade expert Hong Soong-young as ambassador to Beijing, {{as part of an effort}} to push forward the Sunshine Policy: the posting to Washington of Yang, an expert on North Korean affairs, symbolised the autonomy of Seoul's policies towards Pyongyang, while Hong's role was to improve relations with Beijing and ensure its support for inter-Korean reconciliation.

The establishment of the West Sea Special Zone for Peace and Cooperation focuses on security and economic issues.

40|$|Being {{one of the}} few {{remaining}} communist States in the world, North Korea offers a good example of a constrained economy facing dramatic internal and external pressures. Although land transport dominates in North Korea due to border trade with China and Russia, maritime transport better reflects its position in the global economy. Based on worldwide vessel movements at all ports connected to North Korea between 1985 and 2006, indicators of maritime connectivity closely match the country's evolution according to its political and economical changes. Alongside with a spatial contraction of forelands stemming from diplomatic isolation, industrial decline, trade embargo, and infrastructure dereliction after the collapse of the USSR (1991) and the nuclear crisis (1993 - 1994), results also show a process of regionalization and port concentration in Northeast Asia at a time of increased openness, cooperation projects, and foreign investments following the <b>inter-Korean</b> <b>summit</b> (2000) and the economic reforms (2002). Finally, comment are given about internal factors such as inter-regional disconnection, transport system dereliction, logistics costs, and accessibility that result in a growing divide between East and West coast...|$|E
40|$|Korean {{unification}} {{seemed a}} conceivable prospect {{at the turn}} of centuries, especially after the <b>Inter-Korean</b> <b>summit</b> in 2000. It’s not the case nowadays, having in mind provocative behavior of North Korean regime in 2010, as well as 2012 and 2013 (especially March 2013 declarations). Even though such an option seems likely in the future, therefore U. S. foreign policy thinkers should and do analyze possible scenarios for Korean integration and its influence on the regional system. Costs of such an endeavor are hard to estimate, although having in comparison German unification, we may expect that such a process could ruin economies of both Koreas, followed by socio-political systems of both countries. There are even bigger doubts, whether is there any actor of the regional scene that could support Korean unification, as for main regional players: China, Japan or the United States such a change would be a serious challenge. That’s why, it’s important to focus on German example again and increase regional trust and alliance system. The main goal of this paper is analyzing crucial Northeast Asian challenge of American foreign policy, presenting possibilities of Korean unification, assessing it’s costs, having German unification in comparative perspective, as well as assessing possible influence of Korean unification on the regional system and approaches of regional powers towards the process and the New Korea...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a theoretically grounded empirical study {{aimed at}} shedding {{light on the}} multiple dimensions of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's Sunshine Policy of engaging North Korea. It questions the ontological viability of conventional strategies and theories of engagement and produces a framework of comprehensive engagement based on realist, liberal and, most importantly, constructivist approaches. The study focuses on identifying the new tools of engagement employed by South Korea's policy elites, who created a social environment for South Koreans' shift of identities vis-a-vis North Korea {{in the course of}} implementing this engagement policy. To support the thesis of a momentous shift in identities {{as a result of the}} Sunshine Policy, this study uses a wide range of interviews with policy elites and sets of opinion polls published by news organizations and government agencies, while at the same time analyzing the policy from a theoretical and historical perspective. In order to provide concrete evidence of the identity shift, this dissertation analyzes three major policy issues during the Kim administration: North Korea's improvement of diplomatic relations with Western powers; the Hyundai Business Group's Mt. Kumgang tourism project and its link to the <b>inter-Korean</b> <b>summit</b> in June 2000; and North Korea's revelation of a nuclear weapons programme in October 2002. The key research findings of this study are as follows: first, the Sunshine Policy, implemented by South Korea's policy elites, who projected North Korea as a 'partner' or a 'brother', enabled a majority of South Koreans to develop positive identification with the South's enemy, as defined by the National Security Law; second, the policy played a significant role in preventing crises and maintaining the political status quo on the Korean Peninsula; and third, the policy laid the groundwork for a new era of inter Korean economic cooperation and integration...|$|E
