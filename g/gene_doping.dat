5000|$|The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) {{determined}} that non therapeutic form of genetic manipulation for enhancement of athletic performance {{is not allowed}} in sport. The WADA code implemented guidelines to determine if said technology should be prohibited in sport. If {{two of the three}} conditions are met, then the technology is prohibited in sport; harmful to one's health, performance enhancing, and/or against the [...] "spirit of sport". The high risks associated with gene therapy can be outweighed by the potential save the lives of individuals with diseases. According to Alain Fischer, who was involved in clinical trials of gene therapy in children with severe combined immunodeficiency, [...] "Only people who are dying would have reasonable grounds for using it. Using <b>gene</b> therapy for <b>doping</b> is ethically unacceptable and scientifically stupid." [...] As seen with past cases, including the steroid tetrahydrogestrinone THG, athletes may choose to incorporate risky genetic technologies into their training regimes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>doping</b> is the {{hypothetical}} non-therapeutic use of gene therapy by athletes {{in order to}} improve their performance in those sporting events which prohibit such applications of genetic modification technology. , {{there is no evidence that}} <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> has been used for athletic performance-enhancement in any sporting events. <b>Gene</b> <b>doping</b> would involve the use of gene transfer to increase or decrease gene expression and protein biosynthesis of a specific human protein; this could be done by directly injecting the gene carrier into the person, or by taking cells from the person, transfecting the cells, and administering the cells back to the person.|$|E

50|$|In 2006 {{interest}} from athletes in <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> received widespread media coverage due its mention {{during the trial}} of a German coach who was accused and found guilty of giving his athletes performance enhancing drugs without their knowledge; an email in which the coach attempted to obtain Repoxygen was read in open court by a prosecutor. This was the first public disclosure that athletes were interested in <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{the field}} of gene therapy has developed, the risk of <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> {{becoming}} a reality has increased with it.|$|E
5000|$|Research was {{published}} in 2002 about a preclinical gene therapy called Repoxygen, which delivered the gene encoding erythropoietin (EPO) as a potential treatment for anemia. [...] The scientists from that company also received calls from athletes and coaches. [...] In that same year the World Anti-Doping Agency held its first meeting to discuss the risk of <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> and the US The President's Council on Bioethics discussed <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> {{in the context of}} human enhancement at several sessions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mainstream}} {{perspective is}} that <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> is dangerous and unethical, as is any {{application of a}} therapeutic intervention for non-therapeutic or enhancing purposes, and that it compromises the ethical foundation of medicine {{and the spirit of}} sport. [...] Others, who support human enhancement on broader grounds, or who see a false dichotomy between [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "artificial" [...] or a denial of the role of technology in improving athletic performance, do not oppose or support <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Olympic Talent" [...] and [...] "Excellence" [...] involve {{athletes who}} improve {{performance}} through <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> a technology in which gene therapy methods {{are used to}} enhance strength and endurance, ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>doping</b> {{agents are}} a {{relatively}} recently described class of athletic performance-enhancing substances. [...] These drug therapies, which involve viral vector-mediated gene transfer, {{are not known}} to currently be in use [...]|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} genes of interest as agents for <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b> They include erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor 1, human growth hormone, myostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, endorphin, enkephalin and alpha-actinin-3.|$|E
50|$|The {{risks of}} <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> {{would be similar}} to those of gene therapy: immune {{reaction}} to the native protein leading to the equivalent of an genetic disease, massive inflammatory response, cancer, and death, and in all cases, these risks would be undertaken for short-term gain as opposed to treating a serious disease.|$|E
5000|$|GW501516 {{has been}} {{promoted}} on bodybuilding and athletics websites [...] and by 2011 had already been available for some time on the black market. In 2011 it was reported to cost $1000 for 10 g. [...] In 2012, WADA recategorised GW501516 from a <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> compound to a [...] "hormone and metabolic modulator".|$|E
50|$|The use of {{gene therapy}} in athletes for {{reasons other than}} the {{treatment}} of disease. Genetic enhancement includes manipulation of genes or gene transfer by healthy athletes for the purpose of physically improving their performance. Genetic enhancement includes <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> and has potential for abuse among athletes, all while opening the door to political and ethical controversy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{historical}} development {{of interest in}} <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> by athletes and concern {{about the risks of}} <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> and how to detect it moved in parallel with the development of the field of gene therapy, especially with the publication in 1998 of work on a transgenic mouse overexpressing insulin-like growth factor 1 that was much stronger than normal mice, even in old age, preclinical studies published in 2002 of a way to deliver erythropoietin (EPO) via gene therapy, and publication in 2004 of the creation of a [...] "marathon mouse" [...] with much greater endurance than normal mice, created by delivering the gene expressing PPAR gamma to the mice. The scientists generating these publications were all contacted directly by athletes and coaches seeking access to the technology. The public became aware of that activity in 2006 when such efforts were part of the evidence presented in the trial of a German coach.|$|E
5000|$|Research {{published}} in 2004 showing that mice given gene therapy coding for a protein called PPAR gamma had about double the endurance of untreated mice and were dubbed [...] "marathon mice"; those scientists received calls from athletes and coaches. [...] Also in 2004 the World Anti-Doping Agency began to fund research to detect <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> {{and formed a}} permanent expert panel to advise it on risks and to guide the funding.|$|E
5000|$|The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is {{the main}} {{regulatory}} organization looking into {{the issue of the}} detection of <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b> [...] Both direct and indirect testing methods are being researched by the organization. Directly detecting the use of gene therapy usually requires the discovery of recombinant proteins or gene insertion vectors, while most indirect methods involve examining the athlete in an attempt to detect bodily changes or structural differences between endogenous and recombinant proteins.|$|E
50|$|Basic {{processing}} can {{be achieved}} through replacement of a mutated gene, inactivation of a mutated gene, or introduction of a new gene to help fight a disease caused by mutation. Secondly, <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> is a procedure of gene therapy modulates gene expression of a particular gene. This procedure is mainly used to improve athletic ability for sporting events. This is a genetic form of human enhancement that is able to treat muscle-wasting disorders. It is a highly controversial procedure because the results do nothing unusual to the bloodstream, so athletic officials {{would be unable to}} detect chemicals in a blood or urine test. An example of <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> would be proving athlete with erythropoietin (EPO) with is a hormone that increases the red blood cell count. Lastly, viral vectors are able to mimic the methods of a normal virus in the human body to introduce ‘good’ genes into a human cell. For instance, scientists are able to positively change the host’s genome by removing the genes that cause disease from a virus and replacing it with genes of the desired trait (“Types of Gene Therapy”).|$|E
5000|$|Indirect {{methods are}} by nature more subjective, {{as it becomes}} very {{difficult}} to determine which anomalies are proof of <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> and which are simply natural, though unusual, biological properties. [...] For example, Eero Mäntyranta, an Olympic cross country skier, had a mutation which made his body produce abnormally high amounts of red blood cells. It {{would be very difficult}} to determine whether or not Mäntyranta's red blood cell levels were due to an innate genetic advantage, or an artificial one.|$|E
5000|$|Alpha-actinin-3 {{is found}} only in {{skeletal}} muscle in humans, and has been identified in several genetic studies as having a different polymorphism in world-class athletes compared with normal people. One form that causes the gene to make more protein is found in sprinters and is related to increased power; another form that causes the gene to make less protein is found in endurance athletes. [...] <b>Gene</b> <b>doping</b> agents could be designed with either polymorphism, or for endurance athletes, some DNA construct that interfered with expression like a small interfering RNA.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2001, Theodore Friedmann, one of {{the pioneers}} of gene therapy, and Johann Olav Koss an Olympic gold medallist in speed skating, {{published}} a paper that was the first public warning about <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b> Also in June 2001, a Gene Therapy Working Group, convened by the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee noted that [...] "we are aware that there is the potential for abuse of gene therapy medicines and we shall begin to establish procedures and state-of-the-art testing methods for identifying athletes who might misuse such technology".|$|E
5000|$|VEGF {{has been}} tested in {{clinical}} trials to increase blood flow and has been considered as a potential <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> agent; however long term follow up of the clinical trial subjects showed poor results. [...] The {{same is true of}} fibroblast growth factor. Glucagon-like peptide-1 increases the amount of glucose in the liver and has been administered via gene therapy to the livers of mouse models of diabetes and was shown to increase gluconeogenesis' for athletes this would make more energy available and reduce the buildup of lactic acid.|$|E
5000|$|Kinesiogenomics {{refers to}} the study of {{genetics}} in the various disciplines of the field of kinesiology, the study of human movement. The field has also been referred to as [...] "exercise genomics" [...] or [...] "exercisenomics." [...] Areas of study within kinesiogenomics include the role of gene sequence variation (i.e., alleles) in sport performance, identification of genes (and their different alleles) that contribute to the response and adaptation of the body's tissue systems (e.g., muscles, heart, metabolism, etc.) to various exercise-related stimuli, the use of genetic testing to predict sport performance or individualize exercise prescription, and <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> the potential for genetic therapy to be used to enhance sport performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{techniques}} used in gene therapy, {{which is also}} referred to as vectors, have a method of using a healthy gene to attack and replace an infected gene. The amount of techniques or vectors that have been used to conduct these clinical trials vary. A few of the techniques are basic processing, <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> and viral vectors. Viral infections can be life-threatening in patients who are immune-compromised because they cannot mount an effective immune response. Approaches to protection from infection using gene therapy include T cell-based immunotherapy, stem-cell based therapy, genetic vaccines, and other approaches to genetic blockade of infection. There are also other approaches known as, T Cell-Based Approaches, Cell Therapy, Stem-Cell-Based Approaches, and Genetic Vaccines.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, {{the field}} of gene therapy {{took a step forward}} and a step back; first gene therapy drug was {{approved}}, Gendicine, which was approved in China for the treatment of certain cancers, but children in France who had seemingly been effective treated with gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (non-human) began developing leukemia. [...] In 2003 the BALCO scandal became public, in which chemists, trainers and athletes conspired to evade doping controls with new and undetectable doping substances. [...] In 2003 the World Doping Agency proactively added <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> to the list of banned doping practices. Also in 2003, a symposium convened by the American Association for the Advancement of Science focused on the issue.|$|E
50|$|Many {{believe that}} the athlete {{passport}} provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports. While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug, the main advantage of the athlete passport {{is that it is}} based on the stability of the physiology of the human being. New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method. In contrast, the physiology of the human being remains the same through several generations and all biomarkers developed today in the athlete passport will remain valid for at least several decades. For example, the blood module of the passport is already sensitive today to any new future form of recombinant erythropoietin, as well as to any form of <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> that will enhance oxygen transfer to the muscles. Also, while a negative drug test does not necessarily mean that the athlete did not dope, the athlete can present his/her passport at the beginning of a competition to attest that he/she will compete in his/her natural, unaltered condition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} concern about the {{potential}} for <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> follows the history of gene therapy, the medical use of genes to treat diseases, which was first clinically tested in the 1990s. [...] Interest by the athletic community was especially spurred by the creation in a university lab of a [...] "mighty mouse", created by administering a virus carrying the gene expressing insulin-like growth factor 1 to mice; the mice were stronger and remained strong even as they aged, without exercise. The lab had been seeking treatments for muscle wasting diseases, but when their work was made public, the lab was inundated with calls from athletes seeking the treatment, with one coach offering his whole team. The scientist told The New York Times in 2007: [...] "I was quite surprised, I must admit. People would try to entice me, saying things like, 'It'll help advance your research.' Some offered to pay me." [...] He also told the Times that every time similar research is published he gets calls and that he explains that, even should the treatment became ready for use in people, which would take years, there would be serious risks, including death; he also said that even after he explains this, the athletes still want it.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{subject of}} this paper is <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> which should be {{understood}} as "he non-therapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or of the modulation of gene expression, having the capacity to improve athletic performance". The authors of this work, based on the review of literature and previous research, make an attempt at wider characterization of <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> and the discussion of related potential threats. Methods: This is a comprehensive survey of literature on the latest applications of molecular biology in medicine. The analysis involves a dozen scientific databases examined in order to find genes used in gene therapy and potentially useful in <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b> Results: The obtained results enable better recognition of <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> and indicate genes used in medicine {{that could be used in}} <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b> This paper describes potential effects of their use and associated risk, and predicts the possible developments of <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> in the future. Conclusion: <b>Gene</b> <b>doping</b> is undoubtedly a part of modern sport. Although WADA included <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> on the list of banned methods as early as 2004, as previously stated above, it has not managed to develop efficient methods of detection...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>doping</b> is simply gene therapy in {{people who}} don’t need it. The aim of gene therapy is to {{permanently}} cure sick individuals of their conditions by altering their genetic makeup. The aim of <b>gene</b> <b>doping,</b> meanwhile, is to artificially enhance an individual – {{to make them}} better than themselves, perhaps even everyone – by altering their genetic makeup. In many respects, <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> is similar to conventional performance enhancing drugs – they too are often misused medical treatments. However, <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> could potentially have permanent effects, good and bad, and be much harder to detect. Access this article on The Conversation website: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in the field of}} genetic engineering applied to the sport have created a new form of doping: “gene doping”. It’s very difficult to identify athletes who have resorted to <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> because many of treatment based on gene technologies are unlikely to be detected by urine or blood tests and the new technologies are often too invasive and not easily achievable. To fight <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> in 2009 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had published “the Athlete Biological Passport” (ABP), the new standard in testing, based on the personalized monitoring of biomarkers of doping. It is an individual electronic document, in which are enclosed biological data of the athlete.

40|$|From time to {{time the}} public is {{informed}} about {{the start of the}} sporting struggles.

This subject was completed in recent years on discussions related to the application of <b>gene</b> <b>doping.</b> There is currently no verified information indicating that any of the countries apply similar techniques to assist athletes. Whether similar action would be unethical? Does <b>gene</b> <b>doping</b> violate the principles of fair play? Did the law define the term of <b>gene</b> <b>doping?</b> In the proposed speech there will be taken reflection on these topics. It will be carried out by the use of appearing during a sports event media materials relating to the abovementioned issues.
