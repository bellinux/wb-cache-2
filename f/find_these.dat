Twilight is surprised to <b>find</b> <b>these</b> to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia, and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain her color. Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others <b>find</b> <b>these</b> poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Coggins {{obtained}} more work producing war pictures for other magazines, including {{a series of}} double-page spreads for the controversial newspaper PM, and illustrations for The Saturday Evening Post. Throughout the war years, most of the output of many large corporations was reserved for materiel production; however, management were keen to promote their connection {{to the war effort}} and keep their name before the buying public until they could resume peacetime sales. Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco, Koppers, US Steel, and Westinghouse. He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts, and he was intrigued to later <b>find</b> <b>these</b> charts used during his army basic training.|$|E

5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish <b>find</b> <b>these</b> new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen <b>find</b> <b>these</b> tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The most clues for {{a minimal}} Sudoku is {{believed}} to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). These two Sudokus were discovered in 2014, more than four years after at least one programmer expressed doubts that a 40-clue minimal Sudoku would exist. In the work to <b>find</b> <b>these</b> Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36-clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39-clues were also found.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to <b>find</b> <b>these</b> articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often <b>find</b> <b>these</b> owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
