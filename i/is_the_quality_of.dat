5|$|Ameer is {{title of}} {{leadership}} in the Tabligh Jamaat and the attribute largely sought <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> faith, rather than the worldly rank. The ameer of Tabligh Jamaat is appointed for life by a central consultative council (shura) and elders of the Tabligh Jamaat. The first ameer was Maulana (cleric) Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalawi, later succeeded by his son Maulana (cleric) Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi and then by Maulana (cleric) Inaam ul Hasan. After the demise of Moulana (cleric) Inaamul Hasan, a Shura (committee) was formed, who would consult and make decisions. This was to continue with {{senior members of the}} group so as to safeguard the effort of tabligh for the future.|$|E

25|$|In Western music, dissonance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> {{sounds that}} seems {{unstable}} {{and has an}} aural need to resolve to a stable consonance. Both consonance and dissonance are words applied to harmony, chords, and intervals and, by extension, to melody, tonality, and even rhythm and metre. Although there are physical and neurological facts important to understanding the idea of dissonance, the precise definition of dissonance is culturally conditioned—definitions of and conventions of usage related to dissonance vary greatly among different musical styles, traditions, and cultures. Nevertheless, the basic ideas of dissonance, consonance, and resolution exist in some form in all musical traditions that have a concept of melody, harmony, or tonality. Dissonance being the complement of consonance it may be defined, as above, as non-coincidence of partials, lack of fusion or pattern matching, or as complexity.|$|E
25|$|First of which, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> {{education}}. In {{the year}} 2014, the National Achievement Test (NAT) and the National Career Assessment Examination (NCAE) {{results show that}} there had been a decline in the quality of Philippine education at the elementary and secondary levels. The students’ performance in both the 2014 NAT and NCAE were excessively below the target mean score. Having said this, the poor quality of the Philippine educational system is manifested in the comparison of completion rates between highly urbanized cities of Metro Manila, which is also happens to be not only the country's capital region but the largest metropolitan area in the Philippines and other places in the country such as Mindanao and Eastern Visayas. Although Manila is able to boast a primary school completion rate of approximately 100 percent, other areas of the nation, such as Eastern Visayas and Mindanao, hold primary school completion rate of only 30 percent or even less. This kind of statistic is no surprise to the education system in the Philippine context, students who hail from Philippine urban areas have the financial capacity to complete at the very least their primary school education.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> their resonators. [...] Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called Q factor, or just Q. [...] The Q of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators. [...] The resistance of conductors, especially in wound inductors, limits the Q of TEM resonators. [...] This improved Q leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater stop band rejection. [...] The limitation to Q in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double Q.|$|E

He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. [...] "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that [...] "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate." [...] However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, [...] "I think what matters <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." [...] A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would have to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such proposals.|$|E

500|$|In post-canonical and vernacular Pāli literature, {{such as the}} Jātaka {{stories of}} the Buddha's {{previous}} lives, the Avadānas and Anisaṃsa texts, {{as well as in}} many Mahāyāna texts, merit is the main concept. It is regarded as something which can be accumulated throughout different lifetimes in the process of attaining Buddhahood, and is also instrumental in attaining it. The Bodhisatta intent on accomplishing Buddhahood and bringing other beings across the ocean of suffering, must do so by accumulating all sorts of merits, in this context also called perfections ( [...] ; [...] ). This form of merit-making is always led by a vow for enlightenment ( [...] ; [...] ), and an intention to enlighten others as well, as well as the transferring of merits to all living beings to that effect. Another aspect of meritorious acts, emphasized more in later literature, is the idea that a single meritorious act done will reap many fruits, as, for example, expressed in the Vimānavatthu. Not only <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> people's next rebirth affected by their merits, but also the circumstances in which they are reborn; not only in the next life, but also in adjacent lives after that. Wealth, lifespan, and position are all contingent on merit.|$|E

2500|$|Humility <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> being humble. Dictionary {{definitions}} accentuate humility as a low self-regard {{and sense}} of unworthiness.

Outside of a religious context, humility is defined as being [...] "unselved" [...] a liberation from consciousness of self, a form of temperance that is neither having pride (or haughtiness) nor indulging in self-deprecation. The materialistic view characterizes humility as self-restraint that frees oneself from vanity.|$|E
2500|$|According to Buddhist theory, {{through the}} meditative {{development}} of serenity, one {{is able to}} weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state (samadhi). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> mind that can [...] "clearly see" [...] (vi-passana) the nature of phenomena. According to the Buddhist tradition, all phenomena are {{to be seen as}} impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (viraga) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.|$|E
