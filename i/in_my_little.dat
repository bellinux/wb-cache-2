500|$|Wodehouse's {{other new}} venture in 1904 was {{writing for the}} stage. Towards {{the end of the}} year the {{librettist}} Owen Hall invited him to contribute an additional lyric for a musical comedy Sergeant Brue. Wodehouse had loved theatre since his first visit, aged thirteen, when Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience had made him [...] "drunk with ecstasy". His lyric for Hall, [...] "Put Me <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Cell", was a Gilbertian number for a trio of comic crooks, with music by Frederick Rosse; it was well received and launched Wodehouse on a career as a theatre writer that spanned three decades.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} European leg of Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2009, the {{performance}} of [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was removed from the}} setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen". This performance was included on the show's fourth and final Rave segment, where it was set between the performances of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrops used for this performance featured outtakes from the song's original music video directed by Chris Cunningham. Madonna sampled DJ Calvin Harris' 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone" [...] into the performance. Harris praised the version saying, [...] "I never imagined when I made it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> purple room in Glasgow in my flat that it would reach far and wide as it has– it's always a privilege." [...] Six years later, on October 1, 2015, Madonna performed an acoustic version of [...] "Frozen" [...] on the Detroit stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. Four days later, she repeated the performance on the San Jose stop.|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the bridge}} players, Frederic Seward and William Sloper, {{accompanied}} Gibson and her mother to the lifeboats. The group boarded lifeboat no. 7, {{the first to be}} launched. Around 27 other people were on board the boat when it was lowered at 12:40am, just over an hour after the collision. The lifeboat's plug could not be found, causing water to gush in until, as Gibson later put it, [...] "this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men." [...] Around 1,500 people were still aboard Titanic when she sank, throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia. As they struggled in the water, Gibson heard what she described as a [...] "terrible cry that rang out from people who were thrown into the sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones." [...] The sinking deeply affected her; according to Sloper, she became [...] "quite hysterical and kept repeating over and over so that people near us could hear her, 'I'll never ride <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> grey car again.'" [...] The occupants of the lifeboat were finally rescued at 6:15am by the RMS Carpathia and taken to New York.|$|E

500|$|Cartwright is {{best known}} for her role as Bart Simpson on the long-running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. On March 13, 1987, she auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show, a sketch comedy program. Cartwright originally intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the elder daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as [...] "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [...] clever". Creator Matt Groening let her try out for Bart and gave her the job on the spot. Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared with other characters. The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright, the only cast member to have been professionally trained in voice acting, described the sessions as [...] "great fun". However, she wanted to appear in the live-action sketches and occasionally showed up for recording sessions early, hoping to be noticed by a producer.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{praised the}} series' pop culture {{reference}}s. Carina Belles applauded the series for making subtle pop culture references, citing Pinkie Pie's mention of [...] "Chocolate Rain", {{a reference to}} a popular Internet meme. Many reviews and critics positively commented on the episode's ending, which featured a parody of the closing scenes to the original Star Wars. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 wrote positively of the scene, writing, [...] "Honestly, modern My Little Pony fandom {{is one of those things}} I'm live-and-let-live about, even though it baffles me entirely [...] this morning's episode of the show did a little homage to A New Hope." [...] i09 later named the scene one of [...] "The Best Television Moments of 2011". John Farrier from Neatorama wrote, [...] "It’s hard for Bronies to get respect from some quarters, but [...] scene alone says much in favor of the show." [...] The entertainment site Dorkly, an affiliate of CollegeHumor, featured a video comparing the two scenes and wrote, [...] "May the adorable be with you." [...] Topless Robot writer Anne Mathews named the Star Wars parody the [...] "Nerdiest Easter Egg" [...] <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Pony: Friendship Is Magic, writing, [...] "This scene is a direct shoutout to the fans and completely cements the creator Lauren Faust's geek cred. The only thing missing is a Wookiee yell at the end!" ...|$|E
500|$|From a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents {{stressed}} the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay [...] "out of trouble". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Girl (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a [...] "famous movie star". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a [...] "really stupid" [...] idea and that [...] "no Latinos did that". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was {{the only member of the}} chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color. She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E

2500|$|After this, the Drifters {{moved to}} England and {{continued}} with several different vocalists. Although early lineups included golden era singers Moore, and later Ben E.

Butch Leake and former Ink Spot Grant Kitchings replaced Sheppard and Thomas. Fredricks was replaced by Clyde Brown the next year, and Kitchings by Billy Lewis the year after. Leake was replaced by Joe Blunt in 1976, making the lineup Johnny Moore, Clyde Brown, Joe Blunt, and Billy Lewis. This year, Faye Treadwell renamed the group's management company Treadwell Drifters Inc.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant {{released}} several albums on the Carlton and Columbia labels. Her first album, eponymously titled {{and released}} in 1959, contained [...] "Till There Was You" [...] and other songs from other Broadway shows. Her second album, Hear Anita Bryant in Your Home Tonight (1961), contains [...] "Paper Roses" [...] and [...] "Wonderland by Night", {{as well as}} several songs that first appeared in her singles. Her third album, <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Corner of the World, also in 1961, contains the title song and other songs {{that have to do with}} places around the world, including [...] "Canadian Sunset" [...] and [...] "I Love Paris". Bryant's compilation album, Greatest Hits (1963), contains both her original Carlton hits (because Columbia purchased all the masters from Carlton) plus sides from her Columbia recordings, including [...] "Paper Roses" [...] and [...] "Step by Step, Little by Little." [...] In 1964 she released The World of Lonely People, containing, in addition to the title song, [...] "Welcome, Welcome Home" [...] and a new rendition of [...] "Little Things Mean a Lot", arranged by Frank Hunter.

2500|$|The {{author of}} the Life of St Cuthbert has not been identified. Heinrich Hahn in 1883 put a case for Herefrith, the abbot of Lindisfarne {{mentioned}} as a source by Bede in his own Vita of the saint. Bertram Colgrave, the Anonymous Life's most recent editor, has roundly rejected Hahn's argument. While offering Baldhelm and Cynemund (two other sources of Bede) as better candidates, Colgrave did not endorse either and declared that [...] "it must always {{be a matter of}} conjecture". [...] From the text itself, and from the writings of Bede, it can be deduced that it was written by a monk of Lindisfarne. Bede, in his introduction to his Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, is almost certainly referring to this work when he wrote that What I have written concerning the most holy father and bishop Cuthbert, whether in this volume or <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> book concerning his acts, I took in part from what I have previously found written about him by the brethren of Lindisfarne. Throughout the Anonymous Life the author refers to Lindisfarne and its monastery with possessive pronouns. Though possibly written by many authors, the first person singular is used often enough to suggest only one major author.|$|E

She auditioned and was cast <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming {{her role in the}} film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a [...] "famous movie star". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a [...] "really stupid" [...] idea and that [...] "no Latinos did that". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan.
