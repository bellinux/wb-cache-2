50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to 77 known species of mammals. Currently, the mammal {{population}} is threatened due to many reasons such as wildfires and poaching.The reserve {{is famous for its}} golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia), which represent most part of the few remaining wild golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> in the world. There is estimated to be 1000 tamarins in the reserve and surrounding areas. Currently the Golden <b>Lion</b> <b>Tamarin</b> Conservation Project (GLTCP) is attempting to save the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|R
50|$|Public {{concerns}} of the tamarin species occurred in the 1960s when Adelmar Coimbra-Filho {{brought to the attention}} the rapid declines of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> due to exportation and habitat destruction. His input helped with the establishment of the biological reserves to protect <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins.</b> He founded the Rio de Janeiro Primate Center and he {{was the first person to}} breed the golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin.</b> From 1983-1994 large numbers of golden headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> were exported to Japan and Belgium as part of the exotic pet trade. IBAMA asked Jeremy Mallinson to form and become chair of an IRMC for the golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin.</b> The initial objective of the committee was to have all of the tamarins returned to Brazil, and some of them were returned. The committees promotes <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> as a flagship species with the ultimate intent being the preservation of the unique Atlantic Forest, ecosystem and its many endemic plants and animal.|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we present}} {{a review of the}} dataset {{resulting}} from the 11 -years follow-up of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in free-ranging populations of Leontopithecus rosalia (golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin)</b> and Leontopithecus chrysomelas (golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin)</b> from distinct forest fragments in Atlantic Coastal Rainforest. Additionally, we present new data regarding T. cruzi infection of small mammals (rodents and marsupials) that live in the same areas as golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> and characterisation at discrete typing unit (DTU) level of 77 of these isolates. DTU TcII was found to exclusively infect primates, while TcI infected Didelphis aurita and <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins.</b> The majority of T. cruzi isolates derived from L. rosalia were shown to be TcII (33 out 42) Nine T. cruzi isolates displayed a TcI profile. Golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> demonstrated to be excellent reservoirs of TcII, as 24 of 26 T. cruzi isolates exhibited the TcII profile. We concluded the following: (i) the transmission cycle of T. cruzi in a same host species and forest fragment is modified over time, (ii) the infectivity competence of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> population fluctuates in waves that peak every other year and (iii) both golden and golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are able to maintain long-lasting infections by TcII and TcI...|$|R

40|$|Marmosets (Callithrix spp.) {{have been}} {{introduced}} widely in areas within Rio de Janeiro state assigned for the reintroduction of the endangered golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia). The objetives {{of this study were}} to estimate the marmoset (CM) population in two fragments with reintroduced golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> to quantify the association and characterize the interactions between species. The CM population density (0, 09 ind/ha) was higher than that of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (0, 06 ind/ha). The mean association index between tamarins and marmosets varied among groups and seasons (winter= 62 % and summer= 35 %). During the winter, competition resulted in increases in territorial and foraging behavior when associated with marmosets. Evidence of benefits during the summer was reduced adult vigilance while associated to marmosets. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> were also observed feeding on gums obtained from tree gouges made by the marmosets.

40|$|An adaptive, {{evolutionary}} {{approach to}} animal intelligence predicts variation among species in cognitive abilities favored by different environments. Different foods present diverse {{spatial and temporal}} tracking problems for foragers, possibly favoring disparate learning and memory abilities in different species. <b>Lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia) and marmosets (Callithrix kuhli) differ markedly in feeding ecology. Marmosets specialize on gum, a plentiful and renewable resource, whereas <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> focus on ripe fruit, a spatially patchy and temporally ephemeral resource. <b>Lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> apparently need to remember the location and status of food sources for longer time periods than marmosets. I tested individuals of both species on two spatial memory tasks, a radial maze analog and a win-stay task. On both tasks, <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> remembered information about the location of food for longer temporal intervals than did marmosets, but marmosets performed better than <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> after very short retention intervals. A third spatial task showed that increasing memory loads did not differentially affect memory-based performance. On a color delayed match-to-sample task, both species required extensive training and performed poorly compared to the spatial tasks. As in the spatial tasks, <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> remembered information about the color of food sources for longer temporal intervals than did marmosets. The results of these four studies suggest that, relative to marmosets, <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> possess an adaptively specialized system for remembering the location, and perhaps color, of food sources. Differences in brain regions involved in spatial and object memory may underlie these species differences in memory. These studies suggest that diet has been a potent selective force {{in the evolution of}} memory in <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> and marmosets, and perhaps in other primates, including humans, as well. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{study has}} shown that {{increased}} predation has caused significant decreases in the population numbers. A survey conducted in 1992 found the number of wild population of golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. Currently, the average group size includes 3.6 to 5.7 individuals and densities from 0.39 groups/km to 2.35 groups/km. [...] These predatory attacks occur at the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> sleeping sites. The predators make those sleeping sites, which are mainly tree holes (about 63.6%), larger in order to attack the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> sometimes wiping out the entire family. The preferred sleeping sites of most golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are tree holes in living trees next to other larger trees with {{a small percentage of}} canopy cover. These sleeping sites not only provide a place for sleep, but also offer protection and easy access to foraging sites. Most of the tree holes are lower to the ground, so they are easier to enter. Tree holes that are located in living trees are drier, warmer, and have a lower number of insects and therefore a decreased percentage of transmitted diseases. A smaller percentage of canopy coverage allows the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to detect the predators faster, and being surrounded by other large trees allows them access to escape routes. Due to degradation of their habitats, there are fewer trees that can support entire social groups and some have to resort to using bamboo (17.5%), vine tangles (9.6%), and bromeliads (4.7%) as a sleeping site, making them more susceptible to predators. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are known to use different den sites, but do not change sites often. They are more likely to reuse secure sites that will offer protection. However, the disadvantage of doing so is that predators are able to learn where these sites are located. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> also scent mark their den holes, so they can quickly return to them in the afternoon time when predators are most active. While excessive scent makes it easier for golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to find their sleeping sites, it also helps predators locate their prey. Moreover, increased deforestation has decreased habitat space, providing predators easy access to their prey, causing a decline in the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> population.|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} {{of the black}} <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> was debated, as one group of taxonomists classified the <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> by their geography, while other taxonomists placed them all into one species and then divided them into subspecies. More recently, taxonomists have agreed to base classification predominantly on their geography, though sometimes characteristics such as long calls are used to classify different species, similar {{to the use of}} bird songs in taxonomy. For differentiating within Leontopithecus, the black <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is categorized as starting its call at the lowest note and going through the greatest range of pitch.|$|R
