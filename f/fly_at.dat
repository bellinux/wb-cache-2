5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide for extended periods with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The flag of Ireland is <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast on {{the death}} of a {{national}} or international figure, that is, former and current Presidents or Taoiseach, on all prominent government buildings equipped with a flag pole. The death of a prominent local figure can also be marked locally by the flag being <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast. When the national flag is <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast, no other flag should be half-masted. When a balcony in Berkeley, California, collapsed, killing six Irish people, flags were <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half mast above all state buildings.|$|R
50|$|The {{flag of the}} United Arab Emirates is <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> {{half mast}} on 30 November (Martyrs' Day) of every year from 08:00 to 11:30. The flag is also <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half mast by decree of the President of the United Arab Emirates usually for three days. Each of the seven Emirs {{has the right to}} order flags to be <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half mast in his Emirate.|$|R
50|$|The flag of South Africa is <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast {{as a sign}} of {{mourning}} when ordered by the President of South Africa. Upon the official announcement of the death of the current or former President, the flag should be <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast for ten days. The flag should be <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast for seven days following the death of the Deputy President, the Chairperson of NCOP, the Speaker of the National Assembly or the Chief Justice. For example, the flag was <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast from 6-15 December 2013 during the national mourning period for Nelson Mandela.|$|R
5|$|The {{base model}} Su-25 {{incorporates}} {{a number of}} key avionics systems. It has no TV guidance but includes a distinctive nose-mounted laser rangefinder, that is thought to provide for laser-based target finding. A DISS-7 doppler radar is used for navigation; the Su-25 can <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> night, in visual and instrument meteorological conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} pilot's course initially lasted six months, {{split into}} two months each of elementary, intermediate and advanced instruction. Ground subjects were also taught and each trainee had to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> least 150 hours to qualify. By {{the end of the}} war each period had been shortened by a week to speed up the output of trained pilots.|$|E
5|$|Although most flies {{live and}} fly {{close to the}} ground, a few are known to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> heights and a few like Oscinella (Chloropidae) {{are known to be}} {{dispersed}} by winds at altitudes of up to 2000ft and over long distances. Some hover flies like Metasyrphus corollae have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurts.|$|E

5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Phillips {{received}} {{permission from}} his superiors {{to fly the}} F-4B with an inoperative transponder. As the fighter proceeded to NAS Fallon in Nevada, the oxygen leak worsened until the system was disabled completely, and the pilot was instructed to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> low altitude. The Phantom II departed NAS Fallon at 5:16p.m. following a flight plan routing across the Fresno, Bakersfield, and Los Angeles air corridors.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{to shore}} duty in Washington, he was {{assigned}} to Joint Task Force 2, which was charged by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with investigating whether it was necessary to have aircraft that could <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> low altitude at supersonic speeds. This was the subject of considerable debate between the Navy and the Air Force at the time. Tests were carried out at Sandia Base with the OV-1 Mohawk, A-1 Skyraider, A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-4 Phantom, F-105 Thunderchief, B-52 and B-58 Hustler aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} {{a significant improvement}} to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, as they could <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an inertial navigation system, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would {{also be able to}} perform.|$|E
5|$|The antlions are a {{group of}} about 2,000 species of insect in the family Myrmeleontidae, known for the {{fiercely}} predatory habits of their larvae, which in many species dig pits to trap passing ants or other prey. The adult insects are less well known, as they mostly <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> dusk or after dark, and may be mistakenly identified as dragonflies or damselflies; they are sometimes known as antlion lacewings, and in North America, the larvae are sometimes referred to as doodlebugs because of the strange marks they leave in the sand.|$|E
50|$|The code {{specifies}} {{that the}} flag {{is to be}} <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> City Hall and at the Common. It is also <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> private locations throughout the city, as most cities fly their flags more frequently than, say, a smaller town.|$|R
50|$|If {{more than}} one flag is flown on a half-mast day, they must all be <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast, or not at all. The flag of a foreign nation must never be <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> half-mast on UK soil unless that country has {{declared}} mourning.|$|R
50|$|The British Civil Air Ensign is {{the flag}} {{that may be}} <b>flown</b> <b>at</b> civil {{aviation}} establishments in the United Kingdom and be displayed on UK-registered civil aircraft.

5|$|Williams {{came from}} a working-class {{background}} in South Australia. He was a lieutenant in the Army when he learned to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> Point Cook, Victoria, in 1914. As a pilot with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in World WarI, Williams rose to command No.1 Squadron AFC, and later 40th Wing RAF. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and finished the war a lieutenant colonel. Afterwards he campaigned for an Australian Air Force run separately to the Army and Navy, which came into being on 31March 1921.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944 it {{was also}} {{apparent}} that Germany had abandoned the development of its own bomb and Rotblat asked to leave the project. Chadwick was then shown a security dossier in which Rotblat was {{accused of being a}} Soviet spy and that, having learned to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> Los Alamos, he was suspected of wanting to join the Royal Air Force so that he could fly to Poland and defect to the Soviet Union. In addition, he was accused of visiting someone in Santa Fe and leaving them a blank cheque to finance the formation of a communist cell.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|George {{attended}} the ASSC School of Military Aeronautics (an eight-week ground school) {{set up on}} the campus of Princeton University and learned to <b>fly</b> <b>at</b> Love Field, Texas, receiving his rating of Reserve Military Aviator and a new commission on March 28, 1918. George went to France that September with an initial assignment to the 7th Aviation Instruction Center (bombardment) at Clermont-Ferrand. Two months later he was posted to Ourches-sur-Meuse with the 163d Aero Squadron, one of two DH-4B day bomber squadrons of the new 2nd Day Bombardment Group, Second Army Air Service. In the week in which it saw action in November 1918, just prior to the armistice, the 163d flew 69 sorties in support of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. George observed that massed bombers, flying in formation, swamped enemy defenses and so reduced the attacker's casualties.|$|E
