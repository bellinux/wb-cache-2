5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{was time for me to}} have my own.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL {{turned out to}} be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
60|$|I do, Alec--with all my soul. But {{have mercy}} on me. I'm not so strong as <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>It's</b> {{easy for you to}} stand alone. You're iron, but I'm a weak woman.|$|R

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{looked very}} teeny-bopperish. But {{we were on}} top of a deadline, so of course {{there was no way to}} make any radical changes to it. There were some silly bits—little chunks of corn and {{nonsense}} like that.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{embassies}} in the area.

25|$|Based on {{something}} a (now ex) girlfriend said to me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a negative picture, but then I realised it was positive because it’s a reconciliation after self-knowledge.

25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was an {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics {{in the press and}} Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
