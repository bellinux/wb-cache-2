40|$|The aims of {{the present}} thesis were: * To {{investigate}} how women patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) perceive their suffering, {{quality of life and}} encounter with psychiatric care (paper 11 and III). * To describe BPD patients' and psychiatric professionals' perceptions of receiving and giving dialectical behavioural therapy, DBT (paper I). * To investigate how starting treatment of BPD patients with DBT affected the psychiatric professionals' experience of occupational stress and professional burnout (paper IV) Due to the different types of research questions the thesis deal with, it uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In two of the studies (11 and 111) the main methods were qualitative. Data from <b>free</b> <b>format</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> individual- as well as group interviews and biographical texts, were analysed with content analysis or a hermeneutic approach. In study Ill the methods were quantitative. A summated rating scale measuring healthrelated quality-of-life (HRQOL) was analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. In study IV quantitative and qualitative methods were combined. Two burnout inventories were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics, and data from <b>free</b> <b>format</b> <b>questionnaires</b> and group interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. The main findings were that BPD patients suffer to an extent that is often unendurable, leading to deliberate self-harm (DSH) and suicide attempts to relieve suffering or just try {{to get away from it}} all (paper 11). In study Ill the BPD patients showed significantly poorer quality-of-life (even physical) than normal population controls of comparable age. The suffering, suicide attempts, DSH and poor quality-of-life (paper 11 and 111) put the patients in a position of voluntarily or involuntarily getting involved with psychiatric care. Study II revealed a double role of the psychiatric care in relation to BPD patients. On one hand, psychiatric professionals can add to the suffering by not being understanding and being disrespectful, on the other hand they can be helpful and relieve suffering by being respectful, understanding and validating. There was a clear relationship between the patients' experience of validation and the experience of being helped. DBT seems (both from the patients' and psychiatric professionals' perspective) to be a treatment with a philosophy, content and structure being able to relieve BPD patients suffering and helping them to independence and a bearable life-situation (paper I). Study IV confirms previous findings that psychiatric professionals experience treatment of self-harming patients as profoundly stressful. DBT was seen as stressful in terms of learning demands, but decreased the experience of stress in the actual treatment of the patients due to its high degree of structure and specific techniques. The DBT team-work and supervision were felt to be supportive, as was one particular facet of DBT, namely mindfulness training which some professionals felt also improved their handling of other work stressors not related to DBT. This finding also corresponds to BPD patients' perceptions of the mindfulness component in DBT, which they reported as particularly helpful (paper 1). It should be noted that the patient samples in the thesis may be considered as a "worse off" subgroup among BPD patients, as they usually entered special treatment programs after a period of escalating symptoms, which standard psychiatric services had had difficulties handling. The rather small number of participants and the lack of equivalent andlor concurrent control groups in the quantitative studies limit the generalization of the results...|$|E
40|$|Social {{knowledge}} about food was investigated {{from a social}} contingency perspective (Guerin, 1994, 1998, 2004), a functional linguistic approach that considers language use having functions both to establish 'facts' {{in order to control}} listeners, and to maintain social relationships with words. 	In Study 1, whether people shared {{knowledge about}} food or not was examined. One hundred and fourteen New Zealand and 23 Japanese participants were asked to answer <b>free</b> <b>format</b> <b>questionnaires</b> asking the reasons they and others eat or do not eat particular food items. Those answers were categorised into 8 categories and 30 sub-categories of the knowledge about foods by qualitative content analysis. The results of a cluster analysis of those categories showed that participants used the categories homogeneously although there were some differences between New Zealand and Japanese participants, and that the participants selectively used different types of knowledge according to food items especially when explaining why people do or do not eat some foods. 	In Study 2, rhetorical features about foods were investigated: (1) numerical quantification rhetoric; (2) narrative use rhetoric; and (3) enumeration rhetoric. Factual statements from a corpus of 118 New Zealand TV commercials and 249 Japanese TV commercials were coded by the categories generated in Study 1. The results showed that the categories of factual statements were selectively used on TV commercials depending on the food types, and related closely to the results of Study 1. The rhetorical strategies appeared in commercials according to the categories of factual statements. When more than one factual statement was presented in a commercial, the relations of the factual statements were usually of a conjunctive form such as quotfact A however fact Bquot or quotfact A moreover fact Bquot, or else the factual statements were presented independently rather than the one statement logically warranting the other. These results suggest that those rhetoric uses and the arrangements of the factual statements were selectively used according to the effectiveness against counter arguments using shared knowledge. 	Study 3 and Study 4 analysed the functions of shared knowledge about food for maintaining social relationships through investigating the cases in which knowledge about foods presented as the form of 'collaborative talk', which occurs when one speaker completes the preceding saying by another speaker. 	In Study 3, the collaborative talk as sentence completions of knowledge about food was qualitatively analysed from conversations of 30 to 45 minutes produced by four groups consisting of four or five Japanese participants who were friends. From a social contingency view, the analysis focused on the following conversational properties: (1) who the listener was; (2) the degree of sharing of the information between the speakers; (3) the degree of sharing of the information between the 2 nd speaker and the listener; and (4) the disagreement between the 2 nd speaker and the listener. The results of Study 3 suggested some possible functions of sentence completions of knowledge about food: (1) the function when the first speaker is the listener may be enhancement {{of the relationship between the}} first and the second speakers through showing the second speaker's attention and understanding to the first speaker's utterance, because those sentence completions were often followed by the affirmation or negation by the first speaker; (2) when a third person is the listener, and the first and the second speaker refuted the third person using sentence completion, the function seems to be just establishing 'facts'; and (3) in the cases of 'assisted explaining' (Lerner Takagi, 1999), the function may be not only establishing 'facts' but also enhancement the relationship between the listener and the speakers, because the constructed 'facts' may work as a kind of conversational 'gift'. 	In Study 4, five Japanese groups consisting of four participants who were friends were asked to talk about four topics about foods that all participants either agreed or disagreed ('All agree' condition) and four food topics for which there was disagreement about it between participants ('Some agree' condition). When the listeners could not be identified, and the second speakers did not used the utterance-final element such as 'yo ne' that is regarded as having a function of showing agreement between the speakers, the participants used sentence completions more frequently in 'All agree' conditions. The results suggested that the function of this type of sentence completion is not merely establishing 'facts' but also enhancing the relationship between the speakers through showing agreement about the relevant things to the topic. 	In conclusion, the results of the present studies suggest some possible social contingencies involved both when people get knowledge about food and when they use it...|$|E

40|$|Background: In large {{cohort studies}} of older children, self-report {{is the only}} {{practical}} way to assess physical activity. Assessing usual activity over the entire year is desirable, but children and adolescents may overestimate activities with high seasonal variability. Use of questionnaires in which individuals report each activity by season may improve accuracy. Methods: A total of 6782 girls and 5110 boys, aged 9 – 14 years in 1996, completed self-administered activity questionnaires in 1996 and in 1997. In 1996, participants reported the average time spent in each of 17 activities during the previous 12 months; in 1997, we also asked for the average {{time spent in the}} previous year, but within each of the four seasons. Results: Girls reported a median of 12. 8 hours/week total activity in 1996 and 10. 4 hours/week in 1997. For boys, the estimates were 15. 5 hours/week and 13. 4 hours/week, respectively. Girls and boys within 1 -year age strata (e. g., comparison of 10 -year olds in 1996 with 10 -year olds in 1997) reported an average of 3. 7 and 3. 1 fewer hours per week, respectively, on the 1997 seasonal format versus the 1996 annual <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> In longitudinal analyses, the difference between the annual and the seasonal estimates was greater if participants did the activity in fewer seasons in 1997. Conclusions: In comparison to an annual <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> a seasonal <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire</b> may improve accuracy of self-report of physical activity by reducing over-reporting of activities in which pre-adolescents and adolescents engage in fewer seasons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Opinion mining {{received}} well {{attention in}} finding personal opinions from user generated content. These opinions contain valuable information for improving and/or comparing the products or services. On the other hand, given a customer review that the opinion has been already classified into a certain sentiment polarity, for instance positive or negative, the opposite sentiments {{are more and}} more interesting for the decision makers. In this paper, we propose an unexpected sequence mining based approach to extract opposite sentiments from classified <b>free</b> <b>format</b> text reviews. We first adapt the notions in sequence mining to the opinion mining, then we represent the sentence-level sentiments as the sequential implication rules and from which we generate the belief system for formalizing opposite sentiments. We further propose the algorithm MOSUS (Mining Opposite Sentiments as Unexpected Sentences) that extracts opposite sentiments with respect to the belief system. We conclude by detailing our experimental results on <b>free</b> <b>format</b> text movie review data. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—By {{combining}} {{statistical analyses}} and informa-tion retrieval techniques, an efficient way for knowledge dis-covery from questionnaires is discussed. Since usual ques-tionnaires include questions answered by a fixed format and those by a <b>free</b> <b>format,</b> {{it is important}} to introduce the viewpoints of both data mining and text mining, where the answers by the fixed format is called ”items”, and those by the <b>free</b> <b>format,</b> simply “texts”. In this paper, an algorithm for simultaneously processing answers with both the items and the texts is developed. An algorithm for extracting important sentences from documents is also developed. Us-ing these algorithms combined with statistical techniques, a method for analyzing the questionnaires is presented. The method is applied to a case of improvements for the quality of education for which the student questionnaire is executed to a class, and we obtain useful knowledge which leads to faculty developments.
