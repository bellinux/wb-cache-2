The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music.

Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside Luke Bryan, Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley, the concert raised $2.1 million. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> realized that maybe we missed the playing... and five or six years had gone by and we were like, 'Maybe that wasn't as bad as we remember it being,'" [...] said Gentry. In celebration of the group's 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians. They also undertook a short cruise, The Alabama & Friends Festival at Sea, which left for the Bahamas on Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Pearl ship. In addition, the band released Alabama & Friends, a tribute album encompassing covers from newer artists such as Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line, in addition to two new tracks by Alabama.|$|E

In {{the first three months}} following the album's release, the band continued to tour heavily: they travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the UK. The band began to receive radio airplay {{for the first time in}} their career, and released a music video for the single [...] "Her Words Destroyed My Planet". They embarked on a large tour with Say Anything between October and November 2010, and premiered a self-shot video for [...] "A Lifeless Ordinary" [...] during that time. Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> didn't do as well as they hoped or expected us to," [...] said Pierre that year.

500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979.

[...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors.

500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best [...] "to blow up the scale of the film" [...] and transform it into a [...] "big event", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that [...] "Rapunzel needed to get out ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going." [...] In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed [...] "a subtle yet startling twist for Disney" [...] by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too [...] "safe", opting for a funnier and [...] "edgier" [...] antihero instead. Greno elaborated, [...] "When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... {{a lot of them are}} kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool," [...] continuing, [...] "They're good guys, so I <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> sort of took that to the other extreme." [...] However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that [...] "There were people ... who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief.

500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too."

500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler.
