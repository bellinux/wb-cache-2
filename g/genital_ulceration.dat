40|$|Chancroid is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} disease (STD) caused by the Gram negative bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi and is characterised by necrotising <b>genital</b> <b>ulceration</b> which may be accompanied by inguinal lymphadenitis or bubo formation. H ducreyi is a fastidious organism which is difficult to culture from genital ulcer material. DNA amplification techniques have shown improved diagnostic sensitivity but are only performed in a few laboratories. The management of chancroid in the tropics tends to be undertaken {{in the context of}} syndromic management of genital ulcer disease and treatment is usually with erythromycin. A number of single dose regimens are also available to treat H ducreyi infection. <b>Genital</b> <b>ulceration</b> as a syndrome has been associated with increased transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in several cross sectional and longitudinal studies.

40|$|Behçet's {{disease is}} a {{multisystemic}} inflammatory disease of unknown etiology which usually occurs as a trait of symptoms: aphthous stomatitis, <b>genital</b> <b>ulcerations,</b> and ocular disease.

Since neither the laboratory data nor the histopathological signs are truly pathognomonic in Behçet's disease, the differential diagnosis depends on a careful evaluation of the medical history and meticulous physical examination to detect concomitant systemic manifestations. Sometimes, some laboratory test may help establish the diagnosis. Subspecialty referral to ophthalmology, rheumatology, neurology, and gastroenterology should be considered when indicated...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} mouth and <b>genital</b> <b>ulceration</b> {{in the community and}} its relationship to rheumatic diseases. Methods: A house to house survey was carried out over a period of 18 months extending from September 1993 to February 1995, on 5, 894 individuals utilizing detailed questionnaires on symptoms of musculoskeletal diseases and associated symptoms including history of mouth, genital ulcers, eye symptoms, and skin changes. After the initial phase, a 2 nd phase was completed by trained nurses and paramedical staff, the purpose of which was to explore in detail, the history of those responding positively to any of the questions in phase one. The 3 rd stage was conducted by general practitioners and rheumatologist to interview and examine those identified in phase 2 at King Fahad Hospital, Buraidah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Results: We identified 7 (0. 1 %) cases of <b>genital</b> <b>ulceration,</b> 43 (0. 7 %) cases of mouth ulceration, 263 (4. 5 %) cases of reddish eye or blurred vision, and 124 (2. 1 %) cases of skin rashes.

There was significant correlation between mouth ulcers and skin rash, eye symptoms, genital ulcerations, male sex, single status, weight loss and backpain.
