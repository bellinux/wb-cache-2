40|$|Abstract — Adjusting {{operating}} {{temperature of the}} engine in the steady state and during warm-up improves fuel consumption and reduces engine emission through higher {{operating temperature}}s. Also it can improve thermal comfort by faster cabin heater performance. Thermal fluid analysis by 1 -D simulation is an effective tool for studying {{the control of the}} entire cooling system and optimization of engine performance by using active control thermal management systems which allow high tolerance for coolant temperature across speed-load map of the engine. In this work a 1 -D simulation model (GT-SUITE) was used to evaluate the effect of warm-up improvement on powertrain performance by using electric coolant pumps and fans, <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> and an electronic control system with PID feedback. Firstly, the cooling system model was validated with experimental data, and then replaced with an advanced thermal management system. The effect of fan speed and pump speed on engine coolant temperature with different thermal management strategy during warm up was studied. Depending on the operating conditions, the results showed an improvement in brake specific fuel consumption (3 - 9 %) and stability improvement in outlet coolant temperature due to controller tuning during steady state operation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the technical approach for converting a Caterpillar 3406 natural gas spark ignited engine into HCCI mode. The paper describes {{all stages of}} the process, starting with a preliminary analysis that determined that the engine can be operated by preheating the intake air with a heat exchanger that recovers energy from the exhaust gases. This heat exchanger plays a dual role, since it is also used for starting the engine. For start-up, the heat exchanger is preheated with a natural gas burner. The engine is therefore started in HCCI mode, avoiding the need to handle the potentially difficult transition from SI or diesel mode to HCCI. The fueling system was modified by replacing the natural gas carburetor with a liquid petroleum gas (LPG) carburetor. This modification sets an upper limit for the equivalence ratio at {phi} {approx} 0. 4, which is ideal for HCCI operation and guarantees that the engine will not fail due to knock. Equivalence ratio can be reduced below 0. 4 for low load operation with an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> Intake boosting has been a challenge, as commercially available turbochargers are not a good match for the engine, due to the low HCCI exhaust temperature. Commercial introduction of HCCI engines for stationary power will therefore require the development of turbochargers designed specifically for this mode of operation. Considering that no appropriate off-the-shelf turbocharger for HCCI engines exists at this time, we are investigating mechanical supercharging options, which will deliver the required boost pressure (3 bar absolute intake) {{at the expense of}} some reduction in the output power and efficiency. An appropriate turbocharger can later be installed for improved performance when it becomes available or when a custom turbocharger is developed. The engine is now running in HCCI mode and producing power in an essentially naturally aspirated mode. Current work focuses on developing an automatic controller for obtaining consistent combustion in the 6 cylinders. The engine will then be tested for 1000 hours to demonstrate durability. This paper presents intermediate progress towards development of an HCCI engine for stationary power generation and next steps towards achieving the project goals...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Electrohydraulic Power Steering system for road vehicles, using <b>electronic</b> {{pressure}} <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> With an ever increasing demand for safer vehicles and fewer traffic accidents, steering-related active safety functions are becoming more common in modern vehicles. Future road vehicles will also evolve towards autonomous vehicles, with several safety, environmental and financial benefits. A key component in realising such solutions is active steering. The power steering system was initially developed to ease the driver's workload by assisting in turning the wheels. This is traditionally done through a passive open-centre hydraulic system and heavy trucks must still rely on fluid power, due to the heavy work forces. Since {{the purpose of the}} original system is to control the assistive pressure, one way would be to use proportional pressure <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Since these are electronically controlled, active steering is possible and with closed-centre, energy efficiency can be significantly improved on. In this work, such a system is analysed in detail with the purpose of investigating the possible use of the system for Boost curve control and position control for autonomous driving. Commercially available valves are investigated since they provide an attractive solution. A model-based approach is adopted, where simulation of the system is an important tool. Another important tool is hardware-in-the-loop simulation. A test rig of an electrohydraulic power steering system, is developed. This work has shown how proportional pressure <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> can be used for Boost curve control and position control and what implications this has on a system level. As it turns out, the valves add {{a great deal of time}} lag and with the high gain from the Boost curve, this creates a control challenge. The problem can be handled by tuning the Boost gain, pressure response and damping and has been effectively shown through simulation and experiments. For position control, there is greater freedom to design the controller to fit the system. The pressure response can be made fast enough for this case and the time lag is much less critical...|$|R

The objective of this bachelor’s thesis is to present general ergonomic guidelines for a redesign of a loader crane high seat and to provide a conceptual design for a joystick console that makes it possible to use electronic joysticks on the high seat. The background for this project is that Hiab AB in Hudiksvall intend to improve cost-efficiency in the manufacturing and assembly of loader cranes that are delivered with a high seat. Hiab intends to facilitate the assembly by switching from mechanical control levers on the hydraulic <b>valves</b> to <b>electronic</b> <b>controlling</b> of <b>valves,</b> using <b>electronic</b> joysticks and a wiring harness to be able to move the valves down to the base of the crane.

The final concept utilizes aspects of the shape of Hiab’s new remote control hand unit that has mini joysticks.

Based on a single-cylinder test engine system equipped with an <b>electronic</b> <b>controlled</b> hydraulic variable <b>valve</b> train system, the effects of valve phases in this strategy were studied. The results show that at engine speed 1000 r/min, equivalent air-fuel ratio λ = 1, when the IVO phase is put off, EGR ratio increases gradually, CA 10 and CA 50 are postponed and combustion duration becomes longer. At the same time, peak pressure and maximum pressure rise rate {{have a tendency to}} descend. When the SEVO phase is postponed, the parameters of the test engine will also be affected. However, when the phase is postponed above the critical point, the parameters have a backward trend. The property of HCCI combustion is not sensitive to SEVO phase.
