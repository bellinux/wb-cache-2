40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} {{has been}} described as unique, in the opportunities it creates for economic growth and its potential to revolutionise the way business is done. Although initial expectations and predictions have proven rather optimistic, it must nevertheless be accepted that electronic commerce has firmly established its place in the economies of the United Kingdom and European Union. Although considerable work and discussion has surrounded the creation of a regulatory framework for electronic commerce, insufficient attention has been given to the most fundamental element - the legal regime applicable to <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> form the basis of electronic commerce. Parties have been contracting electronically for some time. However, <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> have unique qualities and attributes making them sufficiently `different' to contracts entered by more `traditional' means to raise questions of the applicability and appropriateness of existing legal principles. This work is an examination of the legal environment within which <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> are made. If electronic commerce is to reach its economic potential there must be a stable and predictable legal environment for <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b> In this thesis the existing common law and regulatory principles are analysed, in the context of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts,</b> to examine whether their application has the potential to create a stable legal environment. It is argued that a combination of, uncertainty in the common law; dated concepts in regulatory measures; and the introduction of new regulation without sufficient consideration {{of the nature of the}} electronic environment, has resulted in a lack of clarity in the law applicable to <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b> EThOS - <b>Electronic</b> Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of electronic commerce, a massive development and a considerable increase of business has occurred {{in every aspect of}} business life. In particular, the adoption of the World Wide Web (the Internet) in conducting commercial activities has {{played a significant role in}} the development of commercial and economic sectors in many parts of the world. The notable expansion of electronic market activities has given rise to many legal issues; one of which is the explosion of online contracting or the ?<b>electronic</b> <b>contract?.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>contract</b> forms the basis of electronic commerce. The ability to enter into contracts with remote parties via electronic forms of communication or through computerised electronic systems, within very short time frames, has transformed the way business is transacted today. Due to the nature of <b>electronic</b> <b>contract,</b> with its unique features and qualities, questions arise regarding the capability and appropriateness of existing commercial rules. In Saudi Arabia, Islamic law is applicable to every aspect of life including business. Since the early phase of Islam, comprehensive efforts have been made to regulate the Islamic commercial sector. However, with regards to electronic commerce insufficient attention has been given to examine the application of Islamic law in <b>electronic</b> <b>contract.</b> There is a dire need for legal clarification and the development of an appropriate legal environment in order for electronic commerce to fully develop and encourage business confidence in the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>contract.</b> This work studies the validity of forming electronic contracts in light of existing Islamic laws of contract. This study argues that although the general principles of Islamic contract are flexible enough to accommodate <b>electronic</b> <b>contract,</b> there are some existing approaches in the law that effectively close the door to its application. In turn, this presents legal uncertainty to the law applicable to <b>electronic</b> <b>contract.</b> This thesis focuses on the main conditions of valid contracts, the Islamic concept of ?meeting place?, the time and the place of the contract, and the validity of <b>electronic</b> <b>contract</b> data as evidence in court.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} {{issues related to}} the {{formation}} and validity of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> on a comparative basis between the English, American and UNCITRAL approaches.   When examining the English approach, reference will be made to relevant EC Directives in relation to the subject matter. This thesis has four main objectives.   First, {{to assess the impact of}} using electronic communication tools to reach agreement.   Second, to identify some key points that should be considered when examining the formal validity of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b> Third, to establish a foundation for having a valid contract in which rights and obligations could arise accordingly.   Finally, this thesis aims to identify whether the traditional contract law rules are able to meet the challenges that are brought by the use of electronic communication tools, or whether they require reform. It will be noticed throughout that <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> come in different types.   This leads to difficulty with introducing one rule to cover all types of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b> Furthermore, some concerns arise when electronic communication tools are used to form contracts as to the exact time of contracting. Other concerns arise when trying to fulfil some legal formalities such as writing and signature.   This is because of the special and dual nature of electronic data and the possibility of using different types of signature methods in cyberspace. Finally, it is important to consider taking steps to update some of the current contract law rules to work alongside the electronic technology revolution.   Some aspects of the traditional contract law rules become challenging when applied to <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b>   For example, the issues of contract formation and the use of electronic and intelligent software require direct attention when considering the issue of e-contracts.   The reference to such challenging well-established contract law rules is necessary throughout this thesis, however, since the current rules which deal with electronic commerce in general and <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> in particular do not cover all the issues that are related to <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b>   Lastly, this thesis will sound the alarm on the need to raise the legal awareness of both online users and website developers when contracting online. Chapter Two will assess the use of electronic communication tools to form such contracts, and the sorts of problems that could arise as a consequence. Chapter Three will highlight whether or not <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> can be considered written and signed when the law imposes such requirement.   This chapter will also seek to determine whether there is a need for such formalities in cyberspace. Chapter Four is designed to deal with selected issues of material validity of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b>   This chapter is essential when considering all types of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts,</b> including formal ones.   It will consider issues that are related to mutual assent in cyberspace, and the problems that could arise with web-based contracts in relation to these.

Traditionally, contracts are physical paper documents. In the development of electronic means for communication and collaboration between organizations, <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> have emerged as a digital alternative for physical documents. <b>Electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> are, however, often used as a direct replacement for traditional paper contracts. Consequently, business processes in general and con-tracting processes in particular do not change much {{as a consequence of the}} use of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts.</b> As this form of e-contracting does not penetrate the way of doing business, we call his shallow e-contracting. New business settings have emerged in recent years, e. g., as a consequence of the fast development of electronic commerce. The new business settings do require new con-tracting paradigms in which the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>contracts</b> becomes an essential ele-ment to obtain a radical paradigm shift in contractual business relations. We call this deep e-contracting.

From the point of <b>electronic</b> <b>contract</b> management, the aim of negotiation process is to automatically form contractual agreements between different parties, coordinating their behavior and facilitating contract execution. The contracts specify the commitments that the involved parties make {{to each other and}} that play the important role in their interactions. Therefore in the contract representation language the commitments must be explicitly represented and specify what should be done, if the legal norms defined by policies are violated, and inform the parties about the behavior they could expect from the others.
