He also featured in every match at Euro 2004, <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet in his nation's opening 0–0 draw against Denmark, although Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters following a three-way, five-point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs are diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. The cheetah is an alert animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they take turns at <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> lookout.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August 2013, Juventus {{began the}} 2013–14 season by {{defending}} their Supercoppa Italiana title, at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Juventus defeated Lazio 4–0, with Buffon <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet {{in the competition}} for the first time; Buffon was praised for making several saves. On 24 November, Buffon made his 500th appearance in Serie A, <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet in a 2–0 away win against Livorno. On 6 December, Buffon recorded his seventh consecutive clean sheet, and his ninth of the season; as a result, he bettered his previous personal record of 568 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, going 640 minutes without being beaten in the Italian League. Buffon was finally beaten by Maximiliano Moralez in a 4–1 win over Atalanta, after going 745 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, and equalling Luca Marchegiani's sixth-best unbeaten streak in Serie A history. Buffon was nominated for the 2013 FIFPro XI and the 2013 Ballon d'Or for his performances throughout the calendar year.|$|E

5|$|The hit is {{regarded}} as the defining moment of Martinez's 18-year Major League Baseball career. Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus' call of the play—which is equally memorable to Seattle fans as the play itself—is also regarded as the highlight of his career. The play is also credited with <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> Major League Baseball team in the city of Seattle, as it helped garner support for a new taxpayer-funded stadium for the Mariners. That stadium, known today as Safeco Field, opened in 1999, with the Double depicted in a mural as part of the stadium's art collection.|$|E

5|$|After {{an initial}} call-up to train {{with the first}} team {{during the summer of}} 1994, Buffon was {{promoted}} to the senior squad in 1995, and at the age of , he made his Serie A debut for Parma under Nevio Scala, <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet in a 0–0 home draw against eventual Serie A Champions Milan on 19 November 1995. Buffon made notable saves against Ballon d'Or winners Roberto Baggio and George Weah, as well as Marco Simone, throughout the match. Buffon went on to make seven more first team appearances that season as well as one appearance in the Coppa Italia, making his debut in the competition, as Parma were eliminated in the second round. Parma finished in sixth place in Serie A that season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. During his time at Parma, he trained under goalkeeping coach Villiam Vecchi, a person to whom Buffon attributes much of his confidence, development, and success.|$|E
5|$|After over a {{year without}} playing in a match, during which time he studied Italian at Bocconi University, Robinson made his {{comeback}} in an under-21 match against Middlesbrough on 16 December 2013. On 4 January 2014, Robinson returned to the senior Blackburn team, playing in the 1–1 FA Cup draw with Manchester City. On 11 January 2014, Robinson started his first league match for Blackburn in 13 months, starting against Doncaster Rovers at Ewood Park and <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet in a 1–0 win, lifting Rovers up to eighth in the Championship table. He remained as first choice goalkeeper {{for the next few}} matches, and took back-to-back clean sheets against Blackpool, Middlesbrough and Reading in February.|$|E

He was in goal again for United's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November. It also seemed that he had moved above last season's second choice Tomasz Kuszczak in the pecking order, but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea.

5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E

City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks <b>keeping</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a finger in a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E
