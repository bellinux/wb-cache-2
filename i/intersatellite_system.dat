40|$|Intersatellite {{communication}} {{is the process}} of transmitting information between satellites. Optical communication in <b>intersatellite</b> <b>system</b> involves the process of transmitting information with light as carrier wave. While transmitting information due to some noises or any other external factors some losses may occur. In this study the reduction in nose by the use of preamplifier at the receiver end may be analyzed. Preamplifier is said to have the capability of detecting and correcting errors. Hence in the output graph we may obtain the increase in signal strength with the reduction in noise. Bit Error Rate calculation may also be done. Telescope used in the block may act as terminating equipment which may reduce the reduction in cost of the entire system...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{formation}} flight {{has long been}} studied {{as a means to}} provide high resolution sensing from multiple satellites equipped with lower resolution sensors. The Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) is developing enabling technologies in collaboration with the University of Calgary for future precise formation flying missions. These technologies will be validated on two nanosatellites under development as part of SFL’s Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperiment (CanX) program. These nanosatellites, named CanX- 4 and CanX- 5, will be launched together to be among the first to demonstrate autonomous {{formation flight}} in orbit. With a mass of only 7 kg and size of 20 x 20 x 20 cm, these identical satellites will achieve position determination to within a few centimeters, while controlling their relative position to an accuracy of less than one meter. The short development cycle and low cost of nanosatellites make them an ideal platform for demonstrating formation flight provided certain enabling technologies are made available. This paper describes the enabling nanosatellite technologies that have been developed at UTIAS/SFL for this mission, including formation flying control algorithms, a low power <b>intersatellite</b> communication <b>system,</b> a liquid-fuel cold-gas propulsion system, a three-axis attitude control <b>system,</b> and an <b>intersatellite</b> separation <b>system.</b> CanX- 4 & 5 will fly four individual formations during the mission at separation distances ranging from 50 m to 1000 m.

40|$|Viewgraphs are {{presented}} which outline the overall system and component concepts for a 60 GHz <b>intersatellite</b> communications link <b>system</b> (ICLS). The ICLS {{was designed to}} augment {{the capabilities of the}} current Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), providing a data rate capacity large enough to accommodate the expected rates for user satellites (USAT's) in the post- 1995 timeframe. Two methods of data relay on-board the planned TDAS (Tracking and Data Acquisition) satellites are described.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{definition}} study for a 60 GHz <b>intersatellite</b> communications link <b>system</b> (ICLS), baseline design concepts for a channelized crosslink were identified. The crosslink would allow communications between geostationary satellites of the planned Tracking and Data Acquisition System (TDAS) and would accommodate a mixture of frequency translation coherent links (bent pipe links) and baseband-in/baseband-out links (mod/demod links). A 60 GHz communication system was developed for sizing and analyzing the crosslink. For the coherent links this system translates incoming signals directly up to the 60 GHz band; trunks the signals across from one satellite to a second satellite at 60 GHz then down converts to the proper frequency for re-transmission from the second satellite without converting to any intermediate frequencies. For the baseband-in/baseband-out links the baseband data is modulated on to the 60 GHz carrier at the transmitting satellite and demodulated at the receiving satellite. The frequency plan, equipment diagrams, and link calculations are presented along with results from sizing and reliability analyses...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. High-performance {{detection}} of ultraviolet (UV) radiation {{is of great}} importance {{for a wide range}} of applications including flame sensing, environmental (ozone layer) monitoring, detection of biological/chemical agents, missile early warning <b>systems,</b> and secure <b>intersatellite</b> communication <b>systems.</b> These applications require high-performance UV photodetectors with low dark current, high responsivity, high detectivity, and fast time response. The widebandgap AlxGa 1 −xN ternary alloy is well-suited as a photodetector material for operation in the wavelength range of 200 nm to 365 nm. Its outstanding material properties (direct bandgap, tunable cut-off, allows heterostructures, intrinsically solar-blind) make AlxGa 1 −xN suitable for a variety of harsh environments. If properly constructed, AlxGa 1 −xN-based photodetectors could offer significant advantages over the older photomultiplier tube (PMT) technology in terms of size, cost, robustness, complexity, dark current, bandwidth, and solar-blind operation. The motivation behind this work is the need for high-performance, solid-state UV photodetectors that can be cost-effectively manufactured into high-density arrays. We have designed, fabricated, and characterized several visible/solar-blind AlxGa 1 −xN photodiode samples. With solar-blind AlxGa 1 −xN photodiode samples, we achieved excellent device performance in almost all aspects. Very low dark currents were measured with heterostructure AlxGa 1 −xN Schottky and p-i-n samples. The extremely low leakage characteristics resulted in record detectivity and noise performance. Detectivity performance comparable to PMT detectivity was achieved. True solar-blind operation (sub- 280 nm cut-off) with high visible rejection was demonstrated. In addition, we improved the bandwidth performance of AlxGa 1 −xN-based solar-blind photodetectors by over an order of magnitude. Solar-blind Schottky, p-i-n, and metal-semiconductor-metal photodiode samples exhibited very fast pulse response with multi-GHz bandwidths. Bıyıklı, NecmiPh. D...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of various kinds}} of aerospace application systems requires the appropriate high-accuracy time and frequency standard. This problem can be effectively solved by establishing suitable time and frequency standard in aerospace. Based on the establishment of aerospace satellite visual model, the simulation of satellite visual time on 3 -layer satellite networks, including GEO satellite(Geostationary Earth Orbit), IGSO (Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit) satellites and MEO(Medium Earth Orbit) satellites, has been conducted. The visual features of this satellite network have been gained. Combining with the major influencing factors of satellite clock correction error, an aerospace time synchronization architecture {{on the basis of}} layering has been proposed. Furthermore, intersatellite links performance analysis is the basis for establishing aerospace layering time synchronization architecture. The 3 -layer satellite networks is used as an example to simulate the variation range of distance interlayer satellites of the 3 -layer satellite networks and to analyze the performance of GEO-IGSO, GEO-MEO, and IGSO-MEO links in S-band and Ka-band under the preset <b>intersatellite</b> transmission <b>system,</b> link parameters, transmission loss and without regard to the error of the intersatellite pointing accuracy. The results show that at the maximum intersatellite distance, if the S-band transmission rate is in excess of 2 Mbps,when the antenna is 1 m in diameter, the transmitting power needed is about 50 W. In the Ka-band, 1 m antennas only need 1 W transmitting power to provide an intersatellite data transmission rate higher than 2 Mbps. The Ka-band is more favorable for improving the performance of intersatellite links of 3 -layer satellite networks. Research results serves as reference for the establishment of aerospace layering time synchronization architecture based on 3 -layer satellite networks...|$|R
