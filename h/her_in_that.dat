5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction and {{she ended up}} getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
25|$|Sometime after {{starting}} {{work in the}} story department, Wray became involved in RKO's Young Writers' Project, {{a program designed to}} identify and cultivate writing talent at the studio. A treatment found in her estate papers puts <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> program in 1941, but her screenwriting career really began in 1942 when she was given an opportunity to work with Val Lewton who was just beginning what would become a legendary short career as a producer of low-budget horror movies.|$|E

25|$|Sailor Chibi Moon is Chibiusa's {{identity}} as a Sailor Soldier. Her uniforms resemble Sailor Moon's, colored primarily in cherry blossom pink and red, with a prominent motif of small hearts, joined later by crescent moons and stars. Due to her small stature, certain details of her uniforms are slightly abbreviated. She is given various titles throughout the series, including Princess Soldier, Apprentice Soldier, and Soldier in Training. As the daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, she exhibits traits of both parents in battle. Her personality {{is no different from}} when she is a civilian, although certain powers are unavailable to <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> form.|$|E
25|$|Still in {{the junior}} ranks in the 1987 season, she {{established}} herself at senior level. She won her first national title in the 800m at the Czechoslovak Indoor Athletics Championships. This gained her selection for the 1987 European Athletics Indoor Championships and she made her first senior final, coming fourth and being beaten to a medal by Soviet runner Lyubov Kiryukhina. She also made the 800m final at the World Indoor Championships held shortly after and a new indoor personal best of 2:01.85 minutes was a European junior record. It was also enough for a silver medal behind Christine Wachtel of East Germany. She was the first Czechoslovak woman to win a medal at the competition – only Ivana Kubešová joined <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> feat before the country's dissolution. Sedláková's European junior record lasted almost twenty-seven years before being improved by Iceland's Aníta Hinriksdóttir in 2014.|$|E

[...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> dress. It was one of those moments like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E
500|$|She {{attended}} North High School in Phoenix, {{where she}} was active in school plays. She stated that her biggest influence as a teenager was her teacher Bud Brown, whose lectures about the Civil Rights Movement, poverty, the free press, and anti-semitism in Europe [...] "absolutely inflamed" [...] her and changed her life. Brown was later investigated as a Communist. She went to Dominican College, an all-girls Catholic institution in San Rafael, California for a year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1948. She stopped acting in college because her father refused to support <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> career. She chose Education, {{even though she was}} not interested in becoming a teacher, on the recommendation of her mother and because as she later stated, [...] "It was something that girls of my generation did because teaching was acceptable".|$|E
500|$|In {{her third}} autobiography, Angelou {{is placed in}} {{circumstances}} that force her to change her opinions about whites, not an easy change for her. Louise Cox, the co-owner of the record store she frequents on Fillmore Street, generously offers Angelou employment and friendship. Angelou marries a white man, whose appreciation of Black music breaks her stereotype of whites. This is a difficult decision for Angelou, and she must justify it by rationalizing that Tosh is Greek, and not an American white. She was not marrying [...] "one of the enemy", {{but she could not}} escape the embarrassment and shame when they encountered other Blacks. Later, she has a friendship among equals with her white co-workers, Jorie, Don, and Barrie, who assist her job quest at The Purple Onion. Cudjoe insists, [...] "This free and equal relationship is significant to <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it represents an important stage of her evolution toward adulthood".|$|E

500|$|As an heir to {{the wealth}} of the Tunt family—who were trailblazers in the {{railroad}} industry—Cheryl is often subjected to numerous threats and kidnappings. As a result of her parents' death, she and her brother, Cecil Tunt, inherit an estimated US$1 billion in trust funds; it is split evenly amongst each party, which culminated with Cheryl's net worth increasing tenfold. This prompts a group of robbers to cultivate a plan to abduct her, which ultimately fails as they mistake Pam for <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> same episode, it is also revealed that she owns an ocelot named Babou, for which Archer develops a fondness (similar to Salvador Dalí, who had a pet ocelot by that name with whom he frequently traveled.) Cecil later tricks ISIS into a mission with the intent to videotape members talking of Cheryl's insanity so he can get control of her half of the fortune. It turns out Cecil has spent all of his half of the fortune on various charities, including an undersea base whose insane leader used the funds to buy nerve gas missiles.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Carmella's relationship with Oliver, Blair commented that Oliver would [...] "always have {{a special place in}} Carmella's heart". Although Carmella began dating Marco, Blair felt that Chloe's premature birth strengthened the connection between Carmella and Oliver. She explained that Carmella [...] "feels desolate and suddenly the connection Carmella's always had with Oliver is heightened. Together they name their baby Chloe and it's Marco who feels shut out." [...] Following Chloe's birth, Carmella decided to put her love life to one side, and put her baby daughter first. She told Marco she did not want him in her life; he planned to leave town without a word to her, except a love note and a present to Chloe. Discussing the state of her relationship with Oliver and Marco at this point, Blair assessed: [...] "I don't think it's so much of a love triangle anymore. Oliver made his feelings for Carmella very clear - he doesn't love <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> way. But he still doesn't want another man looking after his child. So there'll be more tension between the [...] of them. And things get even more complicated over the next few months." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on Morse and Hunter's storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it’s just who Hunter is." [...] Blood noted that Hunter is [...] "willing to ignore {{the rules and regulations}} to get the right thing done. Sometimes, Bobbi needs that kick up the backside to send <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. By the same token, Hunter needs Bobbi's rationale sometimes to make sure he doesn't get in trouble again." [...] Bell added that for Hunter, [...] "laws are kind of suggestions, and if he’s with them he’ll follow them, and he’s always been much more a loyalist to the guy in the trenches than to any ideology". Palicki remarked that the differences in the character's views and beliefs would be [...] "a big through line throughout the entire show", and that having Morse and Hunter work for Fortune would test both of their morals, with Hunter having [...] "a bit more experience with that, where the line to cross is a bit fluid. It might take Bobbi a bit more to adapt to that." ...|$|E

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E
