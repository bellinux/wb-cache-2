40|$|Agave tequilana Weber var. 'Azul' {{is grown}} for the {{production}} of tequila, inulin and syrup. Diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. In this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy Agave tequilana plants. In plant tissue bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million CFU/g of fresh plant tissue. Three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16 s rDNA sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. Bacterial endophytes were identified as Acinectobacter sp., A. baumanii, A. bereziniae, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter hormaechei, Bacillus sp. Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus casseliflavus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Gluconobacter oxydans. Isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum AC 132. E. casseliflavus JM 47 and K. oxytoca JM 26 secreted the highest concentrations of IAA. The endophyte Acinectobacter sp.

Our improvements include, amongst others, a non-uniform sampling strategy which is more suited for higher-dimensional inputs, and rounding steps which transform axis-parallel boxes, on which the discrepancy is to be tested, into critical test boxes. These critical test boxes provably yield higher discrepancy values, and contain <b>the</b> box that <b>exhibits</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> local discrepancy.

On the other hand, the molecular size of hemicellulosic polysaccharides was small at temperatures where the cell wall extensibility was high (30 - 40 degrees C). The autolytic activities of cell walls obtained from coleoptiles grown at 30 and 40 degrees C were substantially higher than those grown at 10, 20 and 50 degrees C. Furthermore, the activities of (1 [...] > 3),(1 [...] > 4) -beta-glucanases extracted from coleoptile cell walls showed a similar tendency. When oat (1 [...] > 3),(1 [...] > 4) -beta-glucans with high molecular mass were incubated with the cell wall enzyme preparations from coleoptiles grown at various temperature conditions, the extensive molecular mass downshifts were brought about only by the cell wall enzymes obtained from coleoptiles grown at 30 - 40 degrees C. There were close correlations between the cell wall extensibility and the molecular mass of hemicellulosic polysaccharides or the activity of beta -glucanases. These results suggest that the environmental temperature regulates the cell wall extensibility of rice coleoptiles by modifying mainly the molecular mass of hemicellulosic polysaccharides. Modulation of the activity of beta-glucanases under various temperature conditions may be involved in the alteration of the molecular size of hemicellulosic polysaccharides...|$|R

Higher productivity in the best orientation nests might be related to warmer conditions. High productivity in the study area could offset the main problem for Bonelli’s eagle conservation in Europe, that is, the high preadult and adult mortality.

40|$|The work {{documented}} herein {{concerns the}} research activity undertaken by CNR INSEAN {{in the framework}} of a round robin test campaign around the "Princess Royal" research vessel of the Newcastle University (i. e. Project Task 1. 3). The survey was carried out in the Large Cavitation Channel of CNR INSEAN. Main results and conclusions of the experimental work are summarized as follows: ? Cavitation observations and acoustic measurements. A comprehensive analysis of the radiated underwater noise and cavitation characteristics was performed for five different propeller power conditions, relative to 2. 23 %, 3. 45 %, 6. 9 %, 16. 1 % and 31. 98 % MCR. Acoustic measurements were performed by three hydrophones located downstream of the hull model. Cavitation phenomena appear more intense when the blade is run over the hull perturbation and in the region where the hydrodynamic loads are largest (propeller rotation outward region). Acoustic tests highlighted an evident effect of the cavitation noise at the highest the power conditions. Depending on both cavitation characteristics, the corresponding distributions of the SPL are characterized by the increase of the broadband contribution in the mid and high frequency range as well as by a significant increase of the tonal contribution at the BPF. ? Pressure fluctuation measurements on the hull plate. Pressure fluctuation measurements were undertaken by 7 pressure transducers positioned on the hull plate at the same conditions of the acoustic tests. The strongest pressure pulses are found above the propeller location and on the plane immediately downstream. In particular, the highest peak-to-peak intensity is measured on the transducer positioned on the internal side of the demi-hull, in correspondence of the region where propeller blades experience the strongest loading fluctuations. The intensity of the pressure fluctuations keeps about constant at the low MCR rates and, then, undertakes a substantial increase when the rate of propeller power is further increased. ? Velocity measurements on the hull plate. Phase locked velocity measurements were performed by LDV along a transversal plane just downstream of the propeller trailing edge. The survey was undertaken for three advance ratios, corresponding to low-, design and high- propeller loading conditions. At the design and at the low loading conditions <b>the</b> velocity <b>exhibits</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> in correspondence of the propeller rotation port side region where the azimuthal inflow component is adverse to the propeller rotation.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Materials Science and Engineering, İzmir, 2004 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 56) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiii, 59 leavesThe traditional ceramic processing {{techniques of}} CMCs such as hot pressing are high-temperature, high-cost processes, and unsuitable for manufacturing complex and near-net shapes. Fabrication of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) from pyrolytic conversion of preceramic polymers has gained considerable attention {{in recent years}} due to their unique combination of low temperature processing, applicability of versatile plastic shaping technologies and microstructural control capabilities. In the present work, phenyl (PPS) and methyl (PMS) containing polysiloxanes were pyrolyzed at elevated temperatures (900 - 1500 oC) without filler addition under argon atmosphere to investigate the thermal conversions and phase formations in thepolymer matrix. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques were used for this purpose. It was found that pyrolysis of the polymers under inert atmosphere up to 1300 oC lead to amorphous silicon oxycarbide (SiOxCy) ceramics. Conversions at higher temperatures caused the transformation into the crystalline b-SiC phases. % Weight changes of the samples without filler addition were also followed by measuring the masses before and after pyrolyzation of the samples. CMC monoliths were fabricated {{with the addition of}} 60 - 80 wt% active and inert fillers by hot pressing under 15 MPa pressure and pyrolysis at elevated temperatures between 900 - 1500 C under inert argon and reactive nitrogen atmosphere. Effects of the filler type and ratio, pyrolysis temperature and atmosphere on the phase formations were investigated by using XRD, SEM-EDX and TGA techniques. The results showed that with the incorporation of active Ti fillers, formation of TiC, TiSi, and TiO within the amorphous matrix occurred due to the reactions between the Ti and the polymer decomposition products. However, no new phase development was observed in the case of inert SiC particulate addition. SEM-EDX analysis was also performed to monitor the new phase formations. Mass loss and densification values of the CMCs were measured to investigate the effect of active filler controlled polymer pyrolysis process (AFCOP). Weight changes were considerably affected in the case of addition of the fillers into the ceramic structure due to the reduction of the polymer ratio in the composite systems and the reactions between polymer and filler particles. As an example weight loss of 27 % was measured for PPS samples without filler addition, while 17 % weight reduction was measured for PMS without filler addition after pyrolysis at 1500 oC. On the other hand, it was found that for the composite systems the weight loss values were reduced to 2 %. Mechanical property characterization of samples with and without filler addition was done by Vickers Indentation tests.

Heritability, estimates for plant height, culm length, peduncle length, internode 1, 2 and 3 were highly suggestive of the variation observed being primarily of genetic origin and could be largely transmitted from parent to progeny moreover the cross combination DM- 2 x DM- 15 - 4 was observed as most appropriate fro selection of plant height as it exhibited maximum heritability. Cross combination DM- 38 x DM 107 - 4 proved useful for the transmission of culm length, internode No. 2 (I 2) and internode No. 3 (I 3); DM- 24 x DM 107 - 4 for peduncle length; DM- 24 x DM 16 - 15 - 1 for internode No. 1 (I 1) and internode No. 4 (I 4), and DM 15 - 11 x DM- 2 for internode 5 (I 5). The result with respect o amylase activity showed no noteable difference between the semidwrf nutants and the tall variety Basmati 370. However a clearcut difference was observed between the genotypes with respect to alpha and beta amylase activity. Alpha amylase activity was higher than beta amylase in Basmati 370, Ir- 6, DM 16 - 5 - 1, DM- 15 - 4, DM 15 - 11, DM- 24 DM- 38 and DM- 179 - 1 whereas beta amylase activity was slightly higher in DM- 2 and DM 107 - 4. Nitrate reductase activity decreased from seedling stage with the progression of growth. Maximum activity of nitrate reductase was observed in DM- 24 and minimum in DM- 179 - 1. Semidwarf mutants DM- 24, DM- 2, DM- 16 - 5 - 1 and DM- 38 by virtue of their showing consistently high activity at all stages seem to be promising and could be used in the hybridization programme for breeding for nitrate reductase activity to desired level. Results of the chlorophyll contents at different growth stages showed that maximum chlorophyll contents were observed at tillering stage whereas minimum chlorophyll was found in the leaf sample at maturity. At seedling stage maximum chlorophyll was found in semidwarf mutant DM- 15 - 4 followed by than in variety IR- 6. at tillering stage, <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> chlorophyll contents were found in the mutant DM 15 - 11 followed by DM- 15 - 4. No consistent atturen of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, concentrations at different stages of all the genotypes was observed. The chlorophyll contents in all the genotypes showed decreasing trend beyond the tillering stages. Results with respect to the frequency of stomata showed a higher number of stomata on the adaxial than on the abaxial surface of the leaf in all the genotypes. Variety IR- 6 had the highest number of stomata on both the surfaces of leaf, and semidward mutant DM- 107 - 4 showed the lowest number of stomata on adaxial surface whereas the lowest number of stomata on abaxial surface was found in the mutant DM- 38. It was also observed that duration of stomata opening started with the sunrise and started closing with the fading sunlight. Also {{it was found that the}} stomata and abaxial surface closed one hour earlier in the morning and evening. Study of the leaf architecture showed that all the semidwarf mutants possessed narrower leaf angle than the parent variety. Basmati 370. Maximum leaf area and leaf area index was <b>exhibited</b> by <b>the</b> mutant DM 15 - 4. crop growth rate study at different growth stage indicated that semidward mutants DM- 38, DM- 16 - 5 - 1, DM- 15 - 4, DM- 15 - 11 exhibited a high crop growth rate (CGR) at tillering and flowering stages whereas DM 16 - 5 - 1 exhibited highest CGR at maturity stage. The results of the study with respect to harvest index showed a significant variation among the genotypes with semidwarf mutants DM- 24 <b>exhibiting</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of harvest index followed by DM- 24, DM- 2 and DM- 38. It was also noticed that high harvest index is not related with high biological yield and grain yield. A significant difference among all the rice mutants/varieties was observed at all growth stages with respect to nitrogen contents. The nitrogen contents at maturity stage were higher in grain than in straw in all the genotype suggesting the efficient translocation of photsynthates from leaves to the grains. Semidwarf mutants DM- 15 - 4, DM- 15 - 11 DM- 24 and DM- 38 were found better converter of photosynthats to grains. Potassium contents showed significant difference in all the rice mutants/varieties at all <b>the</b> growth stages. <b>Maximum</b> <b>values</b> of potassium contents were observed in the mutant DM- 107 - 4 at seedling stage. Generally the potassium contents showed a decreasing trend from seedling to maturity stage. The zinc contents in various rice genotypes differed significantly at all <b>the</b> growth stages. <b>Maximum</b> zinc contents were observed in the straw of mutant DM 16 - 5 - 1 at maturity stage. The variation in the concentration of zic in rice genotypes provide a clue for selection extracting nutrients from soil. The copper contents at all the growth stages in <b>the</b> ten rice <b>maximum</b> copper contents were found in DM- 107 - 4 and DM- 15 - 11 at seedling stage. Generally, the copper contents showed a decreasing trend from seedling stage to maturity. The copper contents in IR- 6, DM- 2, DM- 107 - 4, DM- 15 - 4 and DM- 38 were higher in straw as compared to grain where as in DM- 16 - 5 - 1, DM- 15 - 11 and DM- 179 - 1, the contents were higher in grain than in straw. Of the ten genotypes, DM- 107 - 4, DM- 15 - 11 and DM- 24 seems to be very efficient in extracting copper from the soil. Studies on the trace elements and mineral contents in rice plant in the ten rice genotypes revealed varietal difference. The concentration of zinc, manganese, iron and calcium was higher in straw as compared to grain in all the genotypes whereas the concentration of copper and phosphorus did not show any particular trend. Differences in the mineral contents in the straw and grain of fine grain tall variety Basmati 370 and its semidwarf mutants indicate the differential nature of fine grain types in absorbing nutrients from the soil as well as their translocation to the grain during the growth period. Results of the study with respect to protein, carbohydrate, fat and ash contents in the rice genotypes showed significant differences among the rice genotypes. Protein contents ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 1...|$|R
