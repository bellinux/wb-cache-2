5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one <b>etiological</b> passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous <b>etiological</b> model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E

In one study, E. dermatitidis could be isolated from 6.2% of cystic fibrosis patients using erythritol-chloramphenicol agar culture dishes. Exophiala dermatitidis has also been reported as the <b>etiological</b> agent of lung infections causing pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Villemin's {{experiments}} had {{confirmed the}} contagious {{nature of the}} disease and had forced the medical community to accept that tuberculosis was indeed an infectious disease, transmitted by some <b>etiological</b> agent of unknown origin. In 1882, Prussian physician Robert Koch utilized a new staining method and applied it to the sputum of tuberculosis patients, revealing {{for the first time the}} causal agent of the disease: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Koch's bacillus.|$|E
25|$|Wu Youke (1582–1652) {{developed}} {{the concept that}} some diseases were caused by transmissible agents, which he called liqi (pestilential factors). His book Wenyi Lun (Treatise on Acute Epidemic Febrile Diseases) {{can be regarded as}} the main <b>etiological</b> work that brought forward the concept, ultimately attributed to Westerners, of germs as a cause of epidemic diseases (source: http://baike.baidu.com/view/143117.htm). His concepts are still considered in current scientific research in relation to Traditional Chinese Medicine studies (see: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js6170e/4.html).|$|E
25|$|According to the Torah, {{the tribe}} {{consisted}} of descendants of Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and of Leah. Some Biblical scholars {{view this as}} an <b>etiological</b> myth created in hindsight to explain the tribe's name and connect {{it to the other}} tribes in the Israelite confederation. With Leah as a matriarch, Biblical scholars regard the tribe as having been believed by the text's authors to {{have been part of the}} original Israelite confederation.|$|E
25|$|The Latin American populations {{exhibit a}} high {{prevalence}} of abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, similar or even higher than developed countries. It {{is attributed to}} changes in their lifestyle, migration from rural to urban areas and a higher susceptibility to accumulate abdominal fat and develop more insulin resistance compared to other ethnically different populations. Some genetic factors and metabolic adaptations during fetal life can be claimed as <b>etiological</b> factors of this condition.|$|E
25|$|Upset, Midas {{strove to}} divest himself {{of his power}} (the Midas Touch); he hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be {{delivered}} from starvation. Dionysus heard and consented; he told Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. He did so, and when he touched the waters the power passed into them, and the river sands changed into gold. This was an <b>etiological</b> myth that explained why the sands of the Pactolus were rich in gold.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. One <b>etiological</b> theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think {{the way they do}} because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} several decades {{it became clear that}} the <b>etiological</b> agent of the disease that was at first called Coccidioides {{infection}} and later coccidioidomycosis was a fungal pathogen, and coccidioidomycosis was also distinguished from Histoplasmosis and Blastomycosis. Further, C. immitis was identified as the culprit of respiratory disorders previously called San Joaquin Valley fever, desert fever, and Valley fever, and a serum precipitin test was developed by Charles E. Smith that was able to detect an acute form of the infection. In retrospect, Smith played a major role in both medical research and raising awareness about coccidioidomycosis, especially when he became dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley in 1951.|$|E
25|$|An <b>etiological</b> myth {{explaining}} how Athens has acquired its name {{was well known}} among ancient Athenians and even became {{the theme of the}} sculpture on the West pediment of the Parthenon. The goddess of wisdom, Athena, and the god of the seas, Poseidon had many disagreements and battles between themselves, and one of these was a race to be the Patron God of the city. In an attempt to compel the people, Poseidon created a salt water spring by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing naval power. However, when Athena created the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity, the Athenians, under their ruler Cecrops, accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena.|$|E
25|$|Diet: as {{the colon}} {{is exposed to}} many dietary {{substances}} which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the prevalence of ulcerative colitis. High intake of unsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Other identified dietary factors that may influence the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis, but this is controversial. Sulfur restricted diets have been investigated in patients with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an <b>etiological</b> factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{earliest}} literary sources are Homer's two epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Other poets completed the [...] "epic cycle", but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely. Despite their traditional name, the [...] "Homeric Hymns" [...] have no direct connection with Homer. They are choral hymns {{from the earlier}} part of the so-called Lyric age. Hesiod, a possible contemporary with Homer, offers in his [...] Theogony [...] (Origin of the Gods) the fullest account of {{the earliest}} Greek myths, dealing {{with the creation of}} the world; the origin of the gods, Titans, and Giants; as well as elaborate genealogies, folktales, and <b>etiological</b> myths. Hesiod's Works and Days, a didactic poem about farming life, also includes the myths of Prometheus, Pandora, and the Five Ages. The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world, rendered yet more dangerous by its gods.|$|E
500|$|Orion {{also has}} <b>etiological</b> {{connection}} {{to the city of}} Messina in Sicily. Diodorus of Sicily wrote a history of the world up to his own time (the beginning of the reign of Augustus). He starts with the gods and the heroes. At the end of this part of the work, he tells the story of Orion and two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in Sicily. One tells how he aided Zanclus, the founder of Zancle (the former name for Messina), by building the promontory which forms the harbor. The other, which Diodorus ascribes to Hesiod, relates that there was once a broad sea between Sicily and the mainland. Orion built the whole Peloris, the Punta del Faro, and the temple to Poseidon at the tip, after which he settled in Euboea. He was then [...] "numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance". The Renaissance historian and mathematician Francesco Maurolico, who came from Messina, identified the remains of a temple of Orion near the present Messina Cathedral. Maurolico also designed an ornate fountain, built by the sculptor Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli in 1547, in which Orion is a central figure, symbolizing the Emperor Charles V, also a master of the sea and restorer of Messina; [...] Orion is still a popular symbol of the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{cohesive}} {{account by}} Plutarch, which deals mainly with {{this portion of}} the myth, differs in many respects from the known Egyptian sources. Set—whom Plutarch, using Greek names for many of the Egyptian deities, refers to as [...] "Typhon"—conspires against Osiris with seventy-two unspecified accomplices, as well as a queen from ancient Aethiopia (Nubia). Set has an elaborate chest made to fit Osiris's exact measurements and then, at a banquet, declares that he will give the chest as a gift to whoever fits inside it. The guests, in turn, lie inside the coffin, but none fit inside except Osiris. When he lies down in the chest, Set and his accomplices slam the cover shut, seal it, and throw it into the Nile. With Osiris's corpse inside, the chest floats out into the sea, arriving at the city of Byblos, where a tree grows around it. The king of Byblos has the tree cut down and made into a pillar for his palace, still with the chest inside. Isis must remove the chest from within the tree in order to retrieve her husband's body. Having taken the chest, she leaves the tree in Byblos, where it becomes an object of worship for the locals. This episode, which is not known from Egyptian sources, gives an <b>etiological</b> explanation for a cult of Isis and Osiris that existed in Byblos in Plutarch's time and possibly as early as the New Kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|Form critics {{regard this}} part of the manna {{narrative}} to be spliced together from the Yahwist and Priestly traditions, with the Yahwist tradition emphasizing rest during Shabbat, while the Priestly tradition merely states that Shabbat exists, implying that the meaning of [...] "Shabbat" [...] was already known. These critics regard {{this part of}} the manna narrative as an <b>etiological</b> supernature story designed to explain the origin of Shabbat observance, which in reality was probably pre-Mosaic.|$|E
2500|$|Among Classical Greeks, amazon {{was given}} a folk {{etymology}} as originating from [...] (...) and [...] (...) , [...] "without breast", connected with an <b>etiological</b> tradition once claimed by Marcus Justinus who alleged that Amazons had their right breast cut off or burnt out. There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered. Adrienne Mayor suggests {{the origin of this}} myth was due to the word's etymology.|$|E
2500|$|In basic research, if {{freed from}} its simplistic {{reduction}} to constipation, the autointoxication principle {{has now been}} substantially supported as an independent mechanism whereby gastrointestinal microorganisms contain or produce toxins exhibiting systemic effects—as by transmigration into circulation and driving systemic inflammation—effects that include the psychological. [...] Apparent instances of autointoxication associate not merely with constipation, however, but principally with alternating constipation and diarrhea, as Lane had noted in his 1908 paper that described constipation as but the earlier, underlying <b>etiological</b> factor whereby autointoxication may incite diarrhea, too.|$|E
2500|$|The Temple of Ares in the agora of Athens, which Pausanias saw in {{the second}} century AD, had been moved and rededicated there during the time of Augustus. Essentially it was a Roman temple to the Augustan Mars Ultor. From archaic times, the Areopagus, the [...] "mount of Ares" [...] at some {{distance}} from the Acropolis, was a site of trials. Paul the Apostle later preached about Christianity there. Its connection with Ares, perhaps based on a false etymology, is <b>etiological</b> myth. A second temple to Ares has been located at the archaeological site of Metropolis in what is now Western Turkey.|$|E
2500|$|The term stećak is {{uncommon}} in regional dialects and without <b>etiological</b> value, and semantically incorrect and contradicting as it {{derives from the}} verb [...] "to stand", while the chest-type to which it refers predominantly is laid down, while another sub-type of pillars and crosses is the one predominantly upright; this upright or standing sub-type does not amount even 5% of {{the overall number of}} stećci; in the original stećci inscriptions they are most often called as kami (meaning [...] "stone" [...] regardless of the form), thus some scholars proposed the term kamik (pl. kamici) for all forms of headstones, while stećak would mean only the upright sub-type. The term kamik is more close to the original meaning and sometime is used instead of stećak in professional literature.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{cultures}} show {{traces of}} prehistoric human sacrifice in their mythologies and religious texts, but ceased the practice before {{the onset of}} historical records. Some see the story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22) as an example of an <b>etiological</b> myth explaining the abolition of human sacrifice. The Vedic Purushamedha (literally [...] "human sacrifice") is already a purely symbolic act in its earliest attestation. According to Pliny the Elder, human sacrifice in Ancient Rome was abolished by a senatorial decree in 97 BCE, although by this time the practice had already become so rare that the decree was mostly a symbolic act. Human sacrifice once abolished is typically replaced by either animal sacrifice, or by the [...] "mock-sacrifice" [...] of effigies, such as the Argei in ancient Rome.|$|E
2500|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} active role in {{regulating}} the immune system. When it is functional, it can cause immune unresponsiveness to self-antigens via both central and peripheral tolerance. In the case of defective apoptosis, it may contribute to <b>etiological</b> aspects of autoimmune diseases. The autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes can be caused by defective apoptosis, which leads to aberrant T cell AICD and defective peripheral tolerance. Due to the fact that dendritic cells are the immune system's most important antigen-presenting cells, their activity must be tightly regulated by mechanisms such as apoptosis. Researchers have found that mice containing dendritic cells that are Bim -/-, thus unable to induce effective apoptosis, suffer autoimmune diseases more so than those that have normal dendritic cells. Other studies have shown that [...] dendritic cell lifespan may be partly controlled by a timer dependent on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2.|$|E
2500|$|Psychiatrist Joel Paris {{argues that}} {{psychiatry}} is sometimes susceptible to diagnostic fads. Some {{have been based}} on theory (overdiagnosis of schizophrenia), some based on <b>etiological</b> (causation) concepts (overdiagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder), and some based on the development of treatments. Paris points out that psychiatrists like to diagnose conditions they can treat, and gives examples of what he sees as prescribing patterns paralleling diagnostic trends, for example an increase in bipolar diagnosis once lithium came into use, and similar scenarios with the use of electroconvulsive therapy, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs. He notes that {{there was a time when}} every patient seemed to have [...] "latent schizophrenia" [...] and another time when everything in psychiatry seemed to be [...] "masked depression", and he fears that the boundaries of the bipolar spectrum concept, including in application to children, are similarly expanding. Allen Frances has suggested fad diagnostic trends regarding autism and Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Professor James Kugel of Bar-Ilan University {{wrote that}} Gunkel’s {{concept of the}} <b>etiological</b> tale led 20th century {{scholars}} to understand {{the stories of the}} rivalry of Jacob and Esau in [...] and [...] to explain something about the national character (or national stereotype) of Israel and Edom {{at the time of the}} stories’ composition, a kind of projection of later reality back to the [...] "time of the founders." [...] In this <b>etiological</b> reading, that Esau and Jacob were twins explained the close connection between Edom and Israel, their similar dialects, and cultural and kinship ties, while the competition between Esau and Jacob explained the off-and-on enmity between Edom and Israel in the Biblical period. Kugel reported that some biblical scholars saw an analogue in Israelite history: Esau’s descendants, the Edomites, had been a sovereign nation while the future Israel was still in formation (see [...] ), making Edom the [...] "older brother" [...] of Israel. But then, in the 10th century BCE, David unified Israel and conquered Edom (see [...] and [...] ), and that is why the oracle [...] gave Rebekah during her pregnancy said that [...] "the older will end up serving the younger." [...] Kugel reported that scholars thus view the stories of the young Jacob and Esau as created to reflect a political reality that came about in the time of David, indicating that these narratives were first composed in the early 10th century BCE, before the Edomites succeeded in throwing off their Israelite overlords, at that time when Israel might feel [...] "like a little kid who had ended up with a prize that was not legitimately his." [...] When Edom regained its independence, the stolen blessing story underwent a change (or perhaps was created out of whole cloth to reflect Edom’s resurgence). [...] For while Israel still dominated Edom, the story ought to have ended with Isaac’s blessing of Jacob in [...] But Isaac’s blessing of Esau in [...] "By your sword you will live, and you will indeed serve your brother; but then it will happen that you will break loose and throw his yoke from off your neck," [...] reflects a reformulation (or perhaps new creation) of the story in the light of the new reality that developed half a century later.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century {{introduced}} a new psychiatry into the world. Different perspectives of looking at mental disorders began to be introduced. The career of Emil Kraepelin reflects the convergence of different disciplines in psychiatry. Kraepelin initially was very attracted to psychology and ignored the ideas of anatomical psychiatry. Following his appointment to a professorship of psychiatry and his work in a university psychiatric clinic, Kraepelin's interest in pure psychology began to fade and he {{introduced a}} plan for a more comprehensive psychiatry. Kraepelin began to study and promote the ideas of disease classification for mental disorders, an idea introduced by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum. The initial ideas behind biological psychiatry, stating that the different mental disorders were all biological in nature, evolved into a new concept of [...] "nerves" [...] and psychiatry became a rough approximation of neurology and neuropsychiatry. However, Kraepelin was criticized for considering schizophrenia as a biological illness {{in the absence of any}} detectable histologic or anatomic abnormalities. While Kraepelin tried to find organic causes of mental illness, he adopted many theses of positivist medicine, but he favoured the precision of nosological classification over the indefiniteness of <b>etiological</b> causation as his basic mode of psychiatric explanation.|$|E
2500|$|Enki {{and later}} Ea were {{apparently}} depicted, sometimes, {{as a man}} covered with {{the skin of a}} fish, and this representation, as likewise the name of his temple E-apsu, [...] "house of the watery deep", points decidedly to his original character as a god of the waters (see Oannes). Around the excavation of the 18 shrines found on the spot, thousands of carp bones were found, consumed possibly in feasts to the god. Of his cult at Eridu, which goes back to the oldest period of Mesopotamian history, nothing definite is known except that his temple was also associated with Ninhursag's temple which was called Esaggila, [...] "the lofty head house" [...] (E, house, sag, head, ila, high; or Akkadian goddess = Ila), a name shared with Marduk's temple in Babylon, pointing to a staged tower or ziggurat (as with the temple of Enlil at Nippur, which was known as E-kur (kur, hill)), and that incantations, involving ceremonial rites in which water as a sacred element played a prominent part, formed a feature of his worship. This seems also implicated in the epic of the hieros gamos or sacred marriage of Enki and Ninhursag (above), which seems an <b>etiological</b> myth of the fertilisation of the dry ground by the coming of irrigation water (from Sumerian a, ab, water or semen). The early inscriptions of Urukagina in fact {{go so far as to}} suggest that the divine pair, Enki and Ninki, were the progenitors of seven pairs of gods, including Enki as god of Eridu, Enlil of Nippur, and Su'en (or Sin) of Ur, and were themselves the children of An (sky, heaven) and Ki (earth). The pool of the Abzu at the front of his temple was adopted also at the temple to Nanna (Akkadian Sin) the Moon, at Ur, and spread from there throughout the Middle East. It is believed to remain today as the sacred pool at Mosques, or as the holy water font in Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches.|$|E
50|$|Here Hyman argues {{against the}} <b>etiological</b> {{interpretation}} of myth, {{which says that}} myths originated from attempts to explain the origins (etiologies) of natural phenomena. If true, the <b>etiological</b> interpretation would make myth older than, or at least independent of, ritual—as E.B. Tylor believes it is. But Hyman argues that people use myth for <b>etiological</b> purposes only after myth is already in place: in short, myths didn't originate as explanations of natural phenomena. Further, Hyman argues, myth originated from ritual performance. Thus, ritual came before myth, and myth depends on ritual for its existence until it gains an independent status as an <b>etiological</b> story.|$|E
