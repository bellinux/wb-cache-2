50|$|The {{development}} of a 700 °C steam power plant to operate on coal in combination with biomass will enable a reduction of CO2 emission of around 40% compared with the most advanced USC power plants operating today. This will bring the emissions from a combined coal-biomass fired 700 °C power plant close to the figures of gas-fired combined cycle plants. The 700 °C steam power plant offers a flexible technology with minimized CO2-emission based on coal - the most reliable energy source in the world. Further, it gives the demanded production flexibility in order to stabilize a grid with a high amount of unpredictable renewable energy input. The technical realization of a 700 °C steam power plant depends on a successful development and qualification of advanced ferritic, austenitic and Ni- based alloys. With respect to austenitic and Ni-based alloys, promising results have been achieved. The economic criterion for the realization of a 700 °C steam power plant is a realistic budget price. The consumption of large quantities of expensive Ni -based alloys has significant influence in this respect, and a successful {{development of}} an improved <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> to be used at temperatures up to 650 °C would improve the situation.|$|E

For assuring long-term stack operation a diffusion barrier layer with high electronic conductivity may be needed to impede interdiffusion between the various components.

A nearly uniform distribution of Ne concentration and atomic displacement damage was produced through {{the thickness of}} 60 mu m of the specimens by using an energy degrader. Mechanical properties of the specimens were tested with the small-ball punch technique. The test at room temperature shows a less significant ductility loss in the ODS <b>ferritic</b> <b>steel</b> MA 956 than in the T 122 irradiated to the same dose of 350 appm Ne/ 0. 7 dpa.
