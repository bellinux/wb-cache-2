The primary <b>gatekeeping</b> {{mechanism}} is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest, and otherwise {{give a sense of}} how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission. A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.|$|E

2500|$|Gerhards and Schäfer {{say they}} have found [...] "only minimal {{evidence}} to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media". [...] "In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur". [...] The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. [...] "Their <b>gatekeeping,</b> in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites". [...] For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines' algorithms. [...] "Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions". Another tactic that supports this view is astroturfing. The Guardian columnist George Manbiot said that Astroturfing software, [...] "has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy".|$|E

50|$|<b>Gatekeeping</b> is {{the process}} through which {{information}} is filtered for dissemination, whether for publication, broadcasting, the Internet, or some other mode of communication. The academic theory of <b>gatekeeping</b> is founded in multiple fields of study, including communication studies, journalism, political science, and sociology. It was originally focused on the mass media with its few-to-many dynamic but now <b>gatekeeping</b> theory also addresses face-to-face communication and the many-to-many dynamic inherent in the Internet. The theory was first instituted by social psychologist Kurt Lewin in 1943. <b>Gatekeeping</b> occurs {{at all levels of}} the media structure—from a reporter deciding which sources are chosen to include in a story to editors deciding which stories are printed or covered, and includes media outlet owners and even advertisers. Individuals can also act as gatekeepers, deciding what information to include in an email or in a blog.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gatekeeping</b> is {{a process}} by which {{information}} is filtered to the public by the media. According to Pamela Shoemaker and Tim Vos, <b>gatekeeping</b> is the [...] "process of culling and crafting countless bits of information into {{the limited number of}} messages that reach people every day, and it is the center of the media's role in modern public life. ... This process determines not only which information is selected, but also what the content and nature of the messages, such as news, will be." ...|$|E
50|$|Some people however are {{concerned}} that <b>gatekeeping</b> can damage the doctor-patient relationship, since the doctor cannot act solely {{in the interests of}} the individual patient (17). Others have questioned whether this is ever possible, even without <b>gatekeeping.</b> Much depends on the system within which <b>gatekeeping</b> operates, and how great the pressures are on the primary care doctor not to refer, and how strong the incentives, personal, professional and financial are for or against referral. All are agreed that “positive gatekeeping” in which doctors are rewarded for encouraging patients to have unnecessary or dubious procedures, as exists in many private systems, is unethical, and that avoiding unnecessary treatment (therapeutic parsimony) is desirable. Heath has pointed out that the primary care doctor has influence over two other “gates” between illness and health, and between self care and professional care (18).|$|E

5000|$|Along with Web 2.0 environment, {{users have}} begun playing {{a greater role}} in {{producing}} and (re)distributing online news items via online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Shoemaker and Vos (2011) theorized such practice as [...] "audience gatekeeping". According to them (2011), audience <b>gatekeeping</b> is the process in which users [...] "pass along already available news items and comment on them" [...] based on the user's own set of criteria about the newsworthiness" [...] (p. 113). Kwon et al. (2013) adapted the theory of audience <b>gatekeeping</b> to explore what channels are mainly adopted for Twitter audiences to filter and share news contents. The notion of audience <b>gatekeeping</b> consists with Goode's (2009) discussion on metajournalism, whereby users' role in reprocessing and rebroadcasting the existing online contents are as equally emphasized as users' original creation in nurturing citizen journalism as reshaping the existing hierarchy of journalism system. Kwon et al. (2013) also found that re-processed news items by user-generated content websites, or social media, are more frequently adopted by Twitter users than the direct news times from traditional mass media organizations, confirming the empowering role of ordinary online users in retelling and redistributing news agendas to networked publics.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is yet to}} be {{determined}} or even studied {{as to whether or not}} parental <b>gatekeeping</b> is a different syndrome from parental interference and parental alienation or if the latter two are simply a more severe form of <b>gatekeeping</b> exacerbated by a high-conflict breakdown of the relationship between the two parents. It is important to note that parental <b>gatekeeping,</b> along with parental interference and parental alienation are not recognized by the American Psychological Association as diagnosable [...] "syndromes". Many mental health professionals have agreed that such terms are merely an attempt to explain a child's resistance to visitation with the paternal parent. High-conflict circumstances already visible in the marriage can lead to accusations of incompetence, neglect, or abuse of the children - usually by the maternal parent against the father - once the relationship is being adjudicated in a divorce preceding. No current studies have been published to link the three syndromes and the American Psychological Association has not ruled or identified any of the three as recognized syndromes in any of its publications. Independent individual studies of all three are still in progress with findings to be published later.|$|E

50|$|Gatekeepers {{serve in}} various roles {{including}} academic admissions, financial advising, and news editing.

50|$|<b>Gatekeeping</b> bias (also {{known as}} {{selectivity}} or selection bias), when stories are selected or deselected, sometimes on ideological grounds (see spike).

50|$|In 1972, Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw {{published}} a groundbreaking article that offered an agenda-setting theory that paved a new conception of short-term {{effects of the}} media.

50|$|The {{routines}} {{level has}} three sources of routines, which constrain and enable communicators {{in their work}} process: audiences, organizations, and suppliers of content.

50|$|Media outlets {{contend that}} <b>gatekeeping,</b> or news {{filtering}} {{that may result}} in agenda-setting and specifically framing, is inevitable. With a never-ending, near-limitless amount of information, filtering will occur by default.

50|$|<b>Gatekeeping</b> is {{the process}} of {{controlling}} the rate at which students progress to more advanced levels of study in the academic setting.
