40|$|In this work, we analyze {{modulated}} sampling schemes, {{such as the}} Nyquist Folding Receiver, {{which are}} highly efficient, readily implementable, non-uniform sampling schemes that allows for the blind estimation of a narrow-band signal's spectral content and location in a wide-band environment. This non-uniform sampling, achieved by narrow-band modulation of the RF <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sample</b> rate, results in a frequency domain point spread function that is between the extremes obtained by uniform sampling and totally random sampling. As a result, while still preserving structured aliasing, the modulated sampling scheme is also useful in a compressive sensing (CS) setting. We estimate restricted isometry property (RIP) constants for CS matrices induced by such modulated sampling schemes and use those estimates to {{determine the amount of}} sparsity needed for signal recovery. This is followed by a demonstration and analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit's ability to reconstruct signals from noisy non-uniform samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{validation}} of a magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) system {{used to study}} the linear and nonlinear behavior of magnetic nanoparticle suspensions is presented. The MPS characterizes the suspension dynamic response, both due to relaxation and saturation effects, which depends on the magnetic particles and their environment. The system applies sinusoidal excitation magnetic fields varying in amplitude and frequency and can be configured for linear measurements (1 mT at up to 120 kHz) and nonlinear measurements (50 mT at up to 24 kHz). Time-resolved data acquisition at up to 4 MS/s combined with hardware and software-based signal processing allows for wide-band measurements up to 50 harmonics in nonlinear mode. By cross-calibrating the instrument with a known sample, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sample</b> magnetization can be quantitatively reconstructed. Validation of the two MPS modes are performed for iron oxide and cobalt ferrite suspensions, exhibiting Néel and Brownian relaxation, respectively...|$|E

In this Shock-Freeze Cryo-TEM (SFCT) approach, a small volume of solution {{was removed from the}} stream directly into liquid ethane by means of a gravitational guillotine. Using different pipe lengths to measure various residence times, it was possible to determine the particle size, morphology, numbers of primary particles and thus nucleation rate. The nucleation rates were found to be a strong function of Reynolds number, up to Re= 3 × 104 (Re being inversely related to the micromixing time). The measured nucleation rates ranged between 2. 79 × 1014 and 3. 81 × 1017 # m− 3 s− 1 at supersaturations between 4 × 106 and 1 × 108. The measured particle sizes in this work (ranging from 62 to 320 nm for supersaturation values between 4 × 106 and 1 × 108) were smaller than those measured by previous researchers, possibly because previous work did not quench the reaction sufficiently fast and thus allowed the particles a longer time to increase in size. In summary, this work successfully achieved a fast, accurate and reproducible nucleation rate measurement that could also give information about particle morphology...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Corn stover, a major crop‐based {{lignocellulosic}} biomass feedstock, {{is required}} to be at an optimum moisture content for efficient bioconversion processes. Environmental conditions surrounding corn stover, as in storage facilities, affect its moisture due to hygroscopic sorption or desorption. The measurement and modeling of sorption characteristics of corn stover and its leaf, husk, and stalk fractions are useful from utilization and storage standpoints, hence investigated in this article. A benchtop low‐temperature humidity chamber provided the test environments of 20 C, 30 C, and 40 C at a constant 95 % relative humidity. Measured sorption characteristics with three replications for each fraction were obtained from <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sample</b> masses and initial moisture contents. Observed sorption characteristics were fitted using exponential, Page, and Peleg models. Corn stover fractions displayed a rapid initial moisture uptake followed by a slower sorption rates and eventually becoming almost asymptotic after 25 h. Sorption characteristics of all corn stover fractions were significantly different (P 0. 05) on these fractions. The initial 30 min of sorption {{was found to be}} critical due to peak rates of sorption from storage, handling, and processing standpoints. The Page and Peleg models had comparable performance fitting the sorption curves (R 2 0. 995), however the exponential model (R 2 0. 91) was not found suitable because of patterned residuals. The Arrhenius type relationship (P < 0. 05; R 2 0. 80) explained the temperature variation of the fitted sorption model parameters.

These tests were performed in a SDT-Q 600 from TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA) and compared with the data from a 409 PG/PC NETZSCH (NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH, Selb, Germany) simultaneous thermal analysis machine which provides measurements of weight change (TGA) and differential heat flow (DSC) on the same sample. For the SDT-Q 600 measurements, the DSC heat flow data were normalized using the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sample</b> weight at any given temperature. The SDT system was calibrated by following these four steps: (1) TGA weight calibration, (2) differential thermal analysis baseline calibration for the ΔT signal, (3) temperature calibration, and (4) DSC heat flow calibration. In order to remove humidity, these samples were purged in argon for 15 min before thermal scanning. All DSC/TGA experiments were conducted in argon (alpha 2) with a heating rate of 10 K/min, purge flow of 50 ml/min, and temperature range between 35 °C and 1, 300 °C. The obtained mass and heat flow signals were analyzed by the TA analysis software through which the onset {{temperatures and}} reaction enthalpies were derived. To determine the compositions of reaction products and their microstructures, the Al/NiO pellets with Φ = 3.5 were heated in argon to 150 °C, 450 °C, and 800 °C on a hot plate. These experiments were performed in a glove box, and the processed pellets were then examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). For SEM imaging, the samples were 10 nm gold coated. The XRD patterns were captured using a Rigaku SA-HF 3 (1.54 Å CuKα) X-ray source (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an 800 -μm collimator, operating at an excitation of 50 -kV voltage, 40 -mA current, and 2 -kW power.|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Many animals are organized into social groups {{and have to}} synchronize their activities to maintain group cohesion.

Game theory predicts that pair partners should synchronize their activities when there is an advantage of foraging together. As a result of this synchronization, differences in the energetic reserves of the two players develop spontaneously and the individual with lower reserves emerges as a pacemaker of the synchrony. Here, we studied the behavioral synchrony of pairliving, nocturnal, red-tailed sportive lemurs (Lepilemur ruficaudatus).

For this aim, Chabagou Catchment in the Hilly and Gully Region was chosen to study interactions between the two by integrating hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and hydrochemistry. In Chabagou Catchment, precipitation, surface water and groundwater were observed and sampled systematically; two trips of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sampling,</b> including surface water and groundwater, were performed in June and August of 2005, with electrical conductivity (EC) and pH values tested in situ. The isotopic compositions and EC of surface water varied greatly and had different trends along the stream. The isotopic compositions of surface runoff concentrated along the mainstream. EC increased in June, but in August, it decreased from upper to middle reaches and then increased at the lower reaches. Variation of isotopic compositions in groundwater was small while it was large for EC. According to the isotopic and hydrochemical information of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sampling,</b> relationships between surface water and groundwater has been identified. In dry season, low flow surface water is recharged by contact spring in fractured bedrock, and evaporates severely during flow. In rainy season, peak runoff recedes quickly and only groundwater adjacent to the mainstream or gullies can get recharge during flood; when pea runoff recedes, surface runoff mainly gets recharge from spring water and surface water held up by silt arresters at the upper reaches; increasing recharge of contact springs and runoff in branches reduces EC of surface water at the middle reaches; while at the lower reaches, recharge from spring and branches decreases and surface water gets severe evaporation along the mainstream. No matter in dry season or in rainy season when peak runoff recedes, surface water experiences serious evaporation, and only phreatic aquifers near mainstream can get recharge from surface runoff and experiences severe groundwater evaporation. Silt arresters can obviously hold up surface runoff and increase the adjacent groundwater and baseflow. The enhanced evaporation caused by silt arresters may concentrate the total dissolved solid of surface water at upper layers, while its influence on groundwater quality of groundwater is not apparent yet and calls for further study...|$|R

Both in captivity and in the wild capuchin monkeys have been seen to use tools such as stones and sticks to get food and are therefore seen as a natural and important behaviour for them. This study was carried out to evaluate a specific sort of environmental enrichment where a group of three capuchins had to use sticks to get different kinds of food out of bottles. The aim {{of the study was to}} see if the capuchins’ behaviour changed over time and what influence the food enrichment had on their behaviour. The study was performed during a total of 11 days, three hours per day. Two parallel observation methods were used; <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sampling</b> for behaviour and position versus one-zero sampling for interaction with enrichment and social behaviour. The results showed that the capuchins resided more in the part of the cage where the enrichment was available (58...|$|R

Environmental toluene exposure was measured by both continuous and <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sampling.</b> <b>Instantaneous</b> environmental toluene concentrations correlated better with alveolar toluene concentrations (r = 0. 94; n = 155) than with blood toluene concentrations (r = 0. 71; n = 52). Continuous environmental toluene concentrations correlated better with blood toluene concentrations (r = 0. 84; n = 65) than with alveolar toluene concentrations (r = 0. 52; n = 46). During the workshift and the morning after, blood and alveolar toluene concentrations correlated significantly with each other (r = 0. 75; n = 66 and r = 0. 67; n = 52). In a group of workers {{who were exposed to}} a mean environmental toluene concentration of 146 micromilligrams the concentrations of toluene in the alveolar air and blood the morning after were 3. 2 micromilligrams (SD = 1. 7) and 27. 5 micromilligrams (SD = 12. 7) respectively. With regard to the morning after toluene determinations, blood concentrations correlated (r = 0. 52; n = 52; p less than 0. 001) better than the alveolar concentrations with the corresponding afternoon values (r = 0. 36; n = 52; p less than 0. 01). The decline of the toluene concentrations from the end of one workshift {{to the start of the}} next exposure indicated a mean toluene half life of 3. 8 hours in the alveolar air and of 4. 5 hours in blood and therefore the 17 hour interval between two consecutive workshifts was insufficient for the complete elimination of absorbed toluene...|$|R
