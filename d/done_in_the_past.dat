It was more commonly <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> as part of strategic diplomacy for national interest. Although sometimes enforced by legal requirement on persons of royal birth, more often {{it has been a}} matter of political policy and/or tradition in monarchies.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we have <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past...</b> I wanted to try and take everything we have <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and put it to the side.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek's {{watershed}} covers 36.4 {{square miles}} (94km2) {{in the southern}} part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps and summer retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> there are patches of grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats.|$|E

5|$|Under Evans' leadership, the Klan became {{active in}} Indiana and Illinois, rather than {{focusing}} on the Southeastern U.S. as it had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> It also grew in Michigan, where 40,000 members, more than half its total, lived in Detroit. It became characterized as an organization prominent in urban areas of the Midwest, where it attracted native-born Americans competing for industrial jobs with recent immigrants. It also attracted members in Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had been <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks {{to the use of}} Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day, Morris fell at 1/73 and Bradman {{came in to}} join Barnes. Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. He packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Alec Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. While Jim Laker stopped the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it {{from the middle of}} his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, pulling Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting. At the adjournment, the tourists were 104/1.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Maratha Empire in 1818, the Chitpavans lost their {{political}} dominance to the British.

Poorer Chitpavan students adapted and started learning English because of better opportunities in the British administration.|$|E

25|$|While Via is an {{independent}} federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered {{by the fact that}} it was created by an Order in Council of the Privy Council, and not from legislation passed by Parliament. If Via were enabled by legislation, the company could be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN have <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> It is largely for this reason that critics say Via is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.|$|E

However, two months later it was officially reported that both their contracts had been renewed for two more years. When the thirteenth season was about to air, initial reports indicated that Hargitay would appear in only the first 13 episodes. However, NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt later clarified that she would be in every episode of the season.|$|E

25|$|Although Ahmadi Muslims {{believe that}} the Quran is the final message of God for mankind, they also believe that God {{continues}} to communicate with his chosen individuals {{in the same way}} he is believed to have <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> All of God's attributes are eternal. In particular, Ahmadi Muslims believes that Muhammad brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet and the apex of humankind's spiritual evolution. New prophets can come, but they must be completely subordinate to Muhammad and {{will not be able to}} exceed him in excellence nor alter his teaching or bring any new law or religion. They are also thought of as reflections of Muhammad rather than independently made into Prophets, like the Prophets of antiquity.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{led to the}} end of {{the civil}} war. First, Guinean {{cross-border}} bombing raids against villages believed to be bases used by the RUF working in conjunction with Guinean dissidents were very effective in routing the rebels. Another factor encouraging a less combative RUF was a new UN resolution that demanded that the government of Liberia expel all RUF members, end their financial support of the RUF, and halt the illicit diamond trade. Finally, the Kamajors, feeling less threatened now that the RUF was disintegrating in the face of a robust opponent, failed to incite violence like they had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> With their backs against the wall and without any international support, the RUF forces signed a new peace treaty within a matter of weeks.|$|E
25|$|The revolt {{reportedly}} {{began as}} an argument with Owain GlyndÅµr's English neighbour. Successive holders of the title Baron Grey de Ruthyn of Dyffryn Clwyd were English landowners in Wales. GlyndÅµr had been engaged in a long-running land dispute with them. He seems to have appealed to Parliament {{to resolve the issue}} and under King Richard the court found for him, he won. Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn â€” loyal to the new king â€” used his influence to have that decision overturned. Owain GlyndÅµr appealed, but it was rejected. Another story is that de Grey deliberately withheld a Royal Summons for GlyndÅµr to join the new kingâ€™s Scottish campaign of August 1400. Technically, as a tenant-in-chief to the English King, GlyndÅµr was obliged to provide troops, as he had <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> By not responding to the hidden summons he seems, perhaps unwittingly, to have incurred Henry's wrath.|$|E
