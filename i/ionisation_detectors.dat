40|$|The {{collimation}} {{based on}} bent crystals represents {{an opportunity to}} increase the cleaning efficiency and reduce the beam impedance in high energy accelerators, starting from LHC, whose luminosity is now limited (at the 40 % of the nominal value) by the collimation system. The basic idea of the crystal based collimation is to replace the amorphous primary collimator with a silicon bent crystal able to deflect the beam halo outside the beam towards an absorber. The UA 9 experiment is testing this scheme on the CERN SPS circulating beam. The 120 GeV/c proton beam is stimulated to create a halo that impinges on the selected crystal; the particles deflected by the crystal are directed on to a tungsten absorber located ~ 70 m after. The experiment combines the standard beam diagnostic system (beam loss monitors and <b>ionisation</b> <b>detectors)</b> with a silicon microstrip tracking system that will be placed in two roman pots located between the crystal and the absorber. The tracking system {{presented in this paper}} represents one of the UA 9 novelties with respect to the past similar experiment: it will measure the position and angle of the deflected particles allowing one to clearly recognise the crystal behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{the rates}} of {{pressure}} rise and a photo&raphic study of the flames emerging from the maximum experimental safe gap apparatus have shown that although relief venting may reduce the maximum explosion pressure it may increase the rate of pressure rise within the time interval when the reaction zone and following hot combustion products are flowing through the flange gap. In some explosions {{the presence of the}} relief caused acoustic standing waves, and the resultant movement of gas interfered with the combustion wave. Schlieren and direct photographs of the transmitterr explosions have shown that, in vented explosions, transmission through a flange gap need not necessarily occur nearest to the igniting source, and in some cases ignition took place in two locations simultaneously. With ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures the transmissions occurred during the initial stages of the explosion. With hydrogen/ air mixtures the transmission of the explosion occurred when the explosion pressure reached 25 per cent of the peak value. As the location of the explosion transmission through a flange gap is largely unpredictable, the timing of the newly formed flame front outside the vessel with <b>ionisation</b> <b>detectors</b> opposite the igniting source may be inaccurate.

40|$|The direct {{in-flight}} mass {{determination of}} nuclides produced in heavy-ion induced reactions {{is an important}} task, requested in various fields of heavy-ion physics. It is in many cases mandatory for a unique identification of rare isotopes and an unambiguous interpretation of experimental data. The experimental technique often {{used for this purpose}} is a combined energy and time-of-flight (E-ToF) measurement. However, for low energetic heavy ions, ionization based energy detectors suffer from incomplete energy detection due to charge recombination, resulting in pulse-height defect and a relatively poor energy resolution. Therefore, for low energy heavy ions the mass resolution of an E-ToF spectrometer is usually limited by the performance of the energy detector. This problem can be overcome by using calorimetric low temperature detectors (CLTD’s) for the energy measurement. CLTD’s provide, as compared to conventional <b>ionisation</b> <b>detectors,</b> due to their detection principle, substantial advantages in detector performance, such as energy resolution and energy linearity, etc. CLTD’s have been frequently demonstrated to achieve an excellent relative energy resolution of ∆E/E = 1 - 2 × 10 − 3, and a good energy linearity with a complete absence of pulse-heigt defect, {{in a wide range of}} ions and energies [1, 2]. Thus a combination of CLTD’s as high-resolution energy detectors with ToF detectors provides a detector system for high-resolution mass identification of low energetic heavy ions. Recently a prototype of a E-ToF detector system was setup at GSI and tested with 238 U beams from the UNI-LAC. The ToF detector consists of two MCP-Chevron detectors, mounted in a relative distance of 1 m, and equipped with 10 and 4 µg/cm 2 carbon converter foils, respectively. The energy was measured by an array of 8 CLTD pixels (Fig. 1) with a total active area of 12 × 6 mm 2, operated at 1. 5 K. The performance of the E-ToF system was tested wit...|$|E
