Chad Billingsley rebounded to turn in his <b>first</b> <b>quality</b> {{start of the season}} on April 25, {{allowing}} just one earned run in six innings, but the Dodger offense was shut down by Nationals pitching and the team lost 1–0. The Dodgers next traveled to New York to take on the Mets. The scheduled first game of the series was rained out, forcing the Dodgers and Mets to play a doubleheader on April 27. In the first game, Johan Santana and two relievers shut out the Dodgers 4–0, the Dodgers second consecutive shut out defeat. The Dodgers also lost Game 2, by a score of 10–5 as Haeger and the bullpen were beaten up. In the series finale, the Dodgers lost 7–3 as AAA pitcher John Ely made his Major League debut. The sweep finished off a disappointing 2–7 road trip for the Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{already in}} the 7th century BC painted pottery was being {{produced}} in Sparta for local consumption {{as well as for}} export. The <b>first</b> <b>quality</b> pieces were produced around 580 BC. The zenith in black-figure pottery was reached between about 575 and 525 BC. Besides Sparta, the main discovery sites are the islands of Rhodes and Samos, as well as Taranto, Etruscan necropolises, and Cyrene, which was at first considered to be the original source of the pottery. The quality of the vessels is very high. The clay was well slurried and was given a cream-colored coating. Amphoras, hydriai, column kraters (called krater lakonikos in antiquity), volute kraters, Chalcidic kraters, lebes, aryballoi and the Spartan drinking cup, the lakaina, were painted. But the index form and most frequent find is the cup. In Lakonia the deep bowl was usually put on a high foot; cups on low feet are rare. The exterior is typically decorated with ornaments, usually festoons of pomegranates, and the interior scene is quite large and contains figures. In Laconia earlier than in the rest of Greece the tondo became the main framework for cup scenes. The main image was likewise divided into two segments at an early date, a main scene and a smaller, lower one. Frequently the vessel was only coated with a glossy slip or decorated with just a few ornaments. Inscriptions are uncommon but can appear as name annotations. Signatures are unknown for potters as well as painters. It is probable that the Laconian craftsmen were perioeci pottery painters. Characteristic features of the pottery often match the fashion of known painters. It is also possible that they were migrant potters from eastern Greece, which would explain the strong eastern Greek influence especially on the Boreads Painter.|$|E
500|$|Romney held {{a series}} of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public {{services}} professionals and community activists who attended. [...] He opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol. [...] He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath. [...] His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom [...] "bull in a china shop" [...] to describe him. [...] He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that willful was too weak a word to describe him, and chose messianic instead. [...] Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer Theodore H.

500|$|In 1813 the United States was at {{war with}} Great Britain, and Baltimore was {{preparing}} for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. [...] Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the Infantry and Artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. [...] In {{a letter to the}} head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, [...] "We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. [...] That is to say, we are ready except that we have no suitable ensign to display over the Star Fort and it is my desire to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance." [...] A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill's brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. [...] They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, [...] "one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, <b>first</b> <b>quality</b> bunting" [...] and another flag 17 by 25 feet." [...] A task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help, but also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. In early summer 1813, she began the job with the assistance of her daughter, Caroline, her two nieces, Eliza Young and Margaret Young, a free African American apprentice, Grace Wisher, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young. [...] An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill's team was able to complete the job in six weeks. [...] Pickersgill's daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag: ...|$|E
