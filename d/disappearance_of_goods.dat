40|$|We {{show that}} world trade network {{datasets}} contain empirical {{evidence that the}} dynamics of innovation {{in the world economy}} follows indeed the concept of creative destruction, as proposed by J. A. Schumpeter {{more than half a century}} ago. National economies can be viewed as complex, evolving systems, driven by a stream of appearance and <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services. Products appear in bursts of creative cascades. We find that products systematically tend to co-appear, and that product appearances lead to massive disappearance events of existing products in the following years. The opposite - disappearances followed by periods of appearances - is not observed. This is an empirical validation of the dominance of cascading competitive replacement events on the scale of national economies, i. e. creative destruction. We find a tendency that more complex products drive out less complex ones, i. e. progress has a direction. Finally we show that the growth trajectory of a country's product output diversity can be understood by a recently proposed evolutionary model of Schumpeterian economic dynamics. ...|$|E
40|$|In England, {{across the}} whole period of the Great Debasement, the mint issued six {{different}} kinds of silver coins and three kinds of gold coins. According to Gresham’s Law, coins with the same face value but different intrinsic values can not circulate side by side for too long: only those coins with lower intrinsic values stay in circulation; those with relatively high intrinsic values would be hoarded, exported, or melted down. Neither contemporary sources nor modern research about the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> money over this period has provided any solid quantitative assessment {{of the effectiveness of}} Gresham’s Law. This paper intends to produce such an assessment. For this purpose, two types of evidence are examined: the composition of the re-coinage of 1560, and the trend of the exchange rate. The result shows that contrary to popular belief, Gresham’s Law was rather ineffective in mid-sixteenth-century England...|$|R
40|$|After {{employing}} {{a number of}} qualitative methodologies in investigating and analyzing the devastating hardships and sufferings inflicted on ordinary Zimbabweans by the hyperinflationary environment bedeviling the country, the study found some interesting things. Some of the hardships and sufferings currently common and being experienced by most Zimbabweans on daily basis include non affordability of essential products and services, non availability of local currency in banks, not allowed to withdraw enough cash from banks, endurance of long and winding bank queues, the inability to make any projected financial planning, inability to make credit purchases and stressful life. The research also found that most people ended up engaging themselves in barter trading, dollarization, buying and selling, foreign currency dealing and money ‘burning’ as strategies to survive in this hyperinflationary environment. Lastly, increased criminal activities, erosion <b>of</b> generally held <b>good</b> morals as well as <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> business ethics {{have been found to}} be some of the consequences of hyperinflation on the human behaviour of most Zimbabweans. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the absence of}} the venerable doctrine <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith interpretation, as well as its companion “liberal interpretation canon,” from modern Supreme Court treaty jurisprudence. Although scholarly accounts suggest that the spirit is still alive, the article demonstrates that the doctrine was silently interred by the Supreme Court early in the last century. From all appearances, the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith from treaty jurisprudence was not by design. Nonetheless, the article demonstrates that even such an unintended drift can have serious negative consequences. In the context of treaty jurisprudence, the consequence of the departure <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith interpretation has been broad confusion in the lower federal courts over the very nature of treaties and the judicial role in their application as a matter of federal law. After charting the demise of the doctrine, the article examines the significant benefits from an express revival <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith for the practical application of treaty law by the federal courts. Included among these are a restoration of clarity to the nature of treaties, a revival of the fundamental distinction with purely domestic statutes, and a return of the powerful admonishment to the courts of the significance of their task in treaty interpretation...|$|R

50|$|The {{story begins}} with Prince Dolph lying in his sister, Ivy's, bed {{watching}} her magical tapestry which shows {{images from the}} past and present of Xanth. Dolph is the son of King Dor and Queen Irene, and he has the powerful talent of being able to shapeshift, giving him the power to change into any animal he chooses. While watching the images of the magical tapestry Dolph begins to think about the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Good</b> Magician Humphrey. Dolph gets so enraptured with the thought of finding the Magician that he eventually asks his father and mother permission to set out on a quest to find the answers. Queen Irene decides that Dolph is at a fine age to set out for a quest, but as long as he takes with him an adult companion. After some debate and arguing over who should accompany Dolph, Dolph suggests that Marrow Bones accompany him. Marrow is a walking, talking skeleton who has the ability to transform his skeletal body into many shapes as long as Dolph gives him a good kick in the tail bone first.|$|R
40|$|The Consumer Price Index (CPI) {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question of how much more (or less) income does a consumer require to be as well off in period 1 as in period 0 given changes in prices, changes in the quality <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> and the introduction <b>of</b> new <b>goods</b> (or the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>goods).</b> In this paper I explain the theory of cost-of-living indices and demonstrate how new goods should be included using the classical theory of Hicks and Rothbarth. The correct price to use for the good in the pre-intro- duction period is a `virtual' price which sets demand to zero. Estimation of this virtual price requires estimation of a demand function which in turn provides the expenditure function which allows exact calucation of the cost of living index. The data requirements and need to specify and estimate a demand function for a new brand among many existing brands requires extensive data and some new econometric methods which may have proven obstacles to the inclusion <b>of</b> new <b>goods</b> in the CPI up to this point. As an example I use the introduction of a new cereal brand by General Mills in 1989 -Apple Cinnamon Cheerios. I find the virtual price is about 2 times the actual price of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios and that increase in consumer surplus is substantial. Based on some simplifying approximations, I find that CPI may be overstated for cereal by about 25 % because of its neglect of the effect of new brands. When I take imperfect competition into account I find that the increase in consumer welfare is only 85 % as high with perfect competition so CPI for cereal would still be 20 % too high...|$|R
