Metabolite signal {{identification}} in accurate mass {{metabolomics data}} with MZedDB, an interactive m/z annotation tool utilising predicted <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> rules. BMC Bioinformatics, 10, paper 227. IMPF: 03. 43 Sponsorship: BBSRC BB/D 006953 / 1 Background Metabolomics experiments using Mass Spectrometry (MS) technology measure the mass to charge ratio (m/z) {{and intensity of}} ionised molecules in crude extracts of complex biological samples to generate high dimensional metabolite 'fingerprint' or metabolite 'profile' data. High resolution MS instruments perform routinely with a mass accuracy of 50 %) of molecular isotopes, salt adducts and neutral loss fragments.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{comparison of}} the electronic excitation and <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> of molecular hydrogen oriented either parallel or perpendicular to a linear polarised laser pulse is performed. The investigation {{is based on a}} non-perturbative treatment that solves the full time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation of both correlated electrons within the fixed-nuclei approximation and the dipole approximation. Results are shown for two different laser pulse lengths and intensities as well as for a large variety of photon frequencies starting in the 1 - and reaching into the 6 -photon regime. In order to investigate the influence of the intrinsic diatomic two-center problem even further, two values of the internuclear separation and a newly developed atomic model are considered...|$|E

Lanthanum hexaboride ceramic sample and thin nanolayer proved their suitability for photo electron emission in the desired photon energy range of 3. 1 eV to 3. 9 eV which correspond to industrially available UV LED. This ionisation source alternative to a Photoionisationdetector (PID) is inspected of its gas <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> using gases with an ionisation potential over and under an energy of 10, 6 eV. To enable the ionisation of the gases the emitted electrons were accelerated to a well-defined energy. The results of these investigations are comparable to the UV discharge lamp results. Gases can also be ionised by using accelerated electrons of energy as far as 300 eV, which cannot raised by a UV discharge lamp...|$|E

A time variable soil resistivity {{is used in}} order to simulate the soil breakdown; step by step the resistivity value {{is controlled by the}} local instantaneous value of the electric field compared with the electrical strength, fixed for the soil. No a priori hypothesis about the geometrical shape of the ionised zone around the electrodes has to be enforced. Simulation results related to complex earth electrodes of limited extension are reported. The model has been validated by comparing the computed results with data available in technical literature. A discussion about dangerous earth voltages is reported, by underlining the role of soil ionisation.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the role of band edge discontinuities on ionisation rates in Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs multilayer structures has been undertaken. This was investigated initially by measuring the electron and hole multiplication characteristics, M_e, and M_h, in a series of Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs single heterojunction pin diode structures with x= 0. 3, 0. 45 and 0. 6, and with the i-type Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs and GaAs layers equally 500 A thick. The microscopic aspects of hot carrier transport in these devices were studied numerically using a simple Monte Carlo model. The simulations suggest that the advantage obtained from the conduction band edge step down from Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs to GaAs is offset by the energy loss via the higher phonon scattering rate in the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs layer. The investigations were then extended to multilayer structures. The <b>ionisation</b> and multiplication <b>behaviour</b> in the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs periodic structures were predictable after the effects of a single heterojunction on the carrier ionisation process had been understood. The measured and modelled results were found to be in good agreement. It was found that for multiplication lengths exceeding 0. 3 #mu#m the effects of dead space become insignificant and M_e in the multilayer structures samples the ionisation properties of both the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs barrier and the GaAs well. As a result only 'equivalent alloy' behaviour is observed. No electron ionisation enhancement is observed for any of the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs structures studied because the effects of the band edge discontinuities at the heterojunction interface on M_e are compensated by the different energy loss rates in Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs and GaAs. The different carrier dynamics in Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs and GaAs are important aspects in considering carrier multiplication in devices incorporating Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs heterostructures. Photomultiplication in the Al_ 0 _. _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 7 As/GaAs single heterojunction was also examined at lower temperatures. The effect of energy gain from the band edge discontinuity is found always to be offset by the higher energy loss rate in Al_ 0 _. _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 7 As compared to that in GaAs, for lattice temperatures ranging from 20 K to 300 K.

40|$|Ionisation equilibria in {{proteins}} {{are influenced}} by conformational flexibility, which can in principle {{be accounted for by}} molecular dynamics simulation. One problem in this method is the bias arising from the fixed protonation state during the simulation. Its effect is mostly exhibited when the <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the titratable groups is extrapolated to pH regions where the predetermined protonation state of the protein may not be statistically relevant, leading to conformational sampling that is not representative of the true state. In this work we consider a simple approach which can essentially reduce this problem. Three molecular dynamics structure sets are generated, each with a different protonation state of the protein molecule expected to be relevant at three pH regions, and pK calculations from the three sets are combined to predict pK over the entire pH range of interest. This multiple pH molecular dynamics approach was tested on the GCN 4 leucine zipper, a protein for which a full data set of experimental data is available. The pK values were predicted with a mean deviation from the experimental data of 0. 29 pH units, and with a precision of 0. 13 pH units, evaluated on the basis o...|$|E
40|$|Plasma targets {{required}} for wakefield acceleration rely on establishing specific electron density distributions in longitudinal and sometimes transverse direction {{to allow for}} control over the quality of accelerated electron bunches. The complex fragmentation dynamics of molecular gases in strong electric fields can have a crucial impact on target as well as injection properties in plasma wakefield acceleration. The importance of dissociative fragmentation during ionisation {{will be discussed in}} this contribution on the example of hydrogen. Especially in complex scenarios, in which multiple gas-species can be involved, the strength of the plasma generating source may be adjusted to accommodate for the species-specific ionisation thresholds to e. g. generate strong gradient down ramps. To predict the theoretical electron density distribution across the target, we compute the <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> based on rate equations and ADK theory in strong electric fields. Here, the fragmentation dynamics governed by various dissociation and ionisation pathways {{play a crucial role in}} generating specific profiles. Results from these methods are benchmarked experimentally employing a multi-TW short-pulse laser. The developed understanding of the underlying processes of plasma generation allows for tailoring the electron density distribution by manipulating the focusing geometry and thus spatial laser-intensity evolution...|$|E

High resolution MS instruments perform routinely with a mass accuracy of Results Metabolite 'structures' harvested from publicly accessible databases were converted into a common format to generate a comprehensive archive in MZedDB. 'Rules' were derived from chemical information that allowed MZedDB to generate a list of adducts and neutral loss fragments putatively able to form for each structure and calculate, on the fly, the exact molecular weight of every potential ionisation product to provide targets for annotation searches based on accurate mass. We demonstrate that data matrices representing populations of ionisation products generated from different biological matrices contain a large proportion (sometimes > 50 %) of molecular isotopes, salt adducts and neutral loss fragments. Correlation analysis of ESI-MS data features confirmed the predicted relationships of m/z signals.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade or so, a range of polypyrrole-based {{particles}} have been designed and evaluated for space science applications. This electrically conductive polymer enables such particles to efficiently acquire surface charge, which in turn allows their acceleration up to the hypervelocity regime (> 1 km s- 1) using a Van de Graaff accelerator. Either organic latex (e. g. polystyrene or poly(methyl methacrylate)) or various inorganic materials (such as silica, olivine or pyrrhotite) can be coated with polypyrrole; these core-shell particles are useful mimics for understanding the hypervelocity impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> of micro-meteorites (a. k. a. cosmic dust). Impacts on metal targets at relatively low hypervelocities ( 10 km s- 1) generate predominately atomic species, since many more chemical bonds are cleaved if the particles impinge with higher kinetic energy. Such fundamental studies are relevant to the calibration of the cosmic dust analyser (CDA) onboard the Cassini spacecraft, which was designed to determine the chemical composition of Saturn's dust rings. Inspired by volcanism observed for one of the Jupiter's moons (Io), polypyrrole-coated sulfur-rich latexes have also been designed to help space scientists understand ionisation spectra originating from sulfur-rich dust particles. Finally, relatively large (20 √é¬ºm diameter) polypyrrole-coated polystyrene latexes have proven to be useful for understanding the extent of thermal ablation of organic projectiles when fired at ultralow density aerogel targets at up to 6. 1 km s- 1 using a Light Gas Gun. In this case, the sacrificial polypyrrole overlayer simply provides a sensitive spectroscopic signature (rather than a conductive overlayer), and the scientific findings have important implications for the detection of organic dust grains during the Stardust space mission. √Ç¬© The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{for many years}} been interested {{in the formation of}} salts as a means of controlling the chemical/physical properties of API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) molecules. While current interest in cocrystals has led to study of their formation and phase behaviour, comparatively little data is available for salts. This work aims to come some way to redress that balance. Initial studies focussed on a single base manually ground with a number of acids (leading on from previous solution work). Salt formation was noted in a significant number of cases. The work was followed by two more detailed and contrasting case studies. These case studies are ephedrine with pimelic acid and benzoic acid. Both mono- and di-basic salts of ephedrine and pimelic acid were formed both by grinding and solution methods. Binary and aqueous ternary phase diagrams were measured to allow assessment of pure phase regions. The ideality of the systems was assessed and, while the binary phase diagram showed some relatively ideal regions, the ternary system appeared highly non-ideal. Effects on the shape and size of phase regions have been considered, especially the role ionisation plays in the ternary non-ideality. Using fundamental equations solubility has been determined as a function of pH and compared to experimental data. The pH value has also been calculated using concentrations of acid and base along the experimental liquidus of the ternary phase diagram and comparisons made with measured pH values. From these comparisons it was determined that the non-ideality and shape of the liquidus in the ephedrine/pimelic acid/water ternary phase diagram is not solely due to ionisation of the components. Some major issues that may arise in attempted salt formation studies are discussed in relation to the ephedrine and benzoic acid system. Aqueous salt formation was not successful; therefore reasons for this failure are discussed. It is concluded that while the ternary phase behaviour of a salt should be considered, it does not mean the <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> (and hence the speciation diagram) should be ignored. These two sources of information should be assessed in conjunction with one another in order to gain the most accurate insight into a system.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between high- n Rydberg states of molecular hydrogen and metal surfaces {{has been investigated}} for the first time. Rydberg states of hydrogen possessing either 0 or 2 units of rotational angular momentum, defined by the quantum number N +, and principal quantum numbers in the range n = 17 22 (for the N + = 2 states) and n = 41 - 45 (for the N + = 0 states) are directed at a grazing angle onto a metal surface (gold or aluminium). At a sufficiently close distance ionisation may occur via tunnelling of the Rydberg electron into the vacant metal conduction band. Any ions formed {{in the vicinity of}} the metal are extracted by the application of an electric field and information about the distance at which the ions are formed can be inferred from the magnitude of the applied field required for detection. Two novel effects are observed. Firstly, it appears that the rotation of the H 2 + core has a significant effect on the ionisation properties of the Rydberg states in a manner akin to rotational autoionisation, such that the rotational energy of the core is given up to the Rydberg electron. Secondly, the surface ionisation profiles do not vary smoothly with applied field suggesting that at certain fields the feasibility of ionisation is either enhanced or reduced. A preliminary discussion of the origin of the structure is presented in terms of the crossings in the Stark map between the N + = 0 and N + = 2 Stark manifolds. The development of a theoretical model, and an associated Fortran program, involving the technique of complex scaling is also reported. The hydrogen molecules are modeled using an atomic hydrogen system which provides a good first approximation to the behaviour of the Rydberg electron for states with n > 5. Energies and linewidths, for states with principal quantum number n = 6 9 interacting with a model surface, are explicitly calculated at a range of surface separations. From this information, predictions of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> expected for states of higher principal quantum number are presented. </p...|$|E

The effects of dead space, enhanced speed to ionisation of early ionising carriers and carrier diffusion on multiplication-limited bandwidth are studied in this work via modelling. The degradation of bandwidth due to the presence of dead space, predicted by other was investigated using the Random Path Length model. It was found that dead space increases the order of carrier groups involved in multiplication, and hence the length of the multiplication chains, as impact ionisation events initiated by feedback carriers become more important. This degrades the improvement in bandwidth expected from reducing the multiplication layer thickness. To study the effects of enhanced speed to ionisation of early ionising carriers and of carrier diffusion on the avalanche time response, a technique has been developed for calculating the probability of fusion (pdf) of avalanche duration using general models for pdfs of ionisation in space and time and also for carrier transport. While diffusion plays only a minor role, the speed enhancement of carriers to ionisation events early in their trajectories is found to speed up the avalanche process significantly in short devices...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{waters are}} {{essential}} for human life, to supply of drinking water and as an important resource for agricultural, industrial and recreational activities. However, tonnes of pollutants enter these surface waters every year. Amongst the substances discharged into the environment, a large number {{are known to be}} mutagenic. Effect-directed analysis (EDA) is a tool to identify chemicals responsible for the observed toxic effects. It is based on a combination of chemical and biological analysis. The chemical analysis enable the separation and isolation of toxicants from complex samples, while the biological analysis enables the ‚Äútracking‚Äù of the toxicants during the separation of the chemicals, which allows decreasing the complexity of the sample in focusing only on chemicals causing the biological effects. Among planar aromatic compounds such as azaarenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), keto-, nitro-keto-, hydroxyl-, amino- and nitro-PAHs, as well as quinones and hydroxy-quinones there are many known environmental mutagens often present in surface waters in complex mixtures and at low concentrations. Planar aromatic compounds may be sampled by selective adsorption to blue rayon (BR). The first part of the thesis work aimed to provide a specific fractionation method for these compounds applicable in effect-directed analysis. This procedure relies on three fractionation steps: (i) solid phase extraction using mixed-mode cation- and anion-exchange sorbents, (ii) reversed-phase HPLC polymeric C 18 column and (iii) reversed-phase HPLC phenyl-hexyl column. Based on 47 analytical standards and a BR extract tested with the Ames fluctuation test, the ability of the method to recover and isolate mutagenicity is shown. Standard group recoveries ranked from 37 % (quinones) to 85 % (keto-polyaromatic hydrocarbons and amides) and these chemicals were separated satisfactorily, with little overlap between neighbouring fractions. The recovery of the BR mutagenicity was over 75 %. As the sample mutagenicity was mainly present in only 7 of 50 fractions, this three step fractionation method {{has been shown to be}} a reliable method to decrease sample complexity. The aim of the second part of the EDA study was to develop and apply an identification strategy to handle the data produced by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and to identify chemicals that are responsible for the mutagenic effects in selected fractions. This was done in two steps: (i) Reference standards were analysed in order to understand their <b>ionisation</b> <b>behaviour</b> by electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) and their MS/MS fragmentation behaviour with the aim of deriving rules that can be used for the unknown identification, and (ii) the method was then applied in the frame of a target-, suspect compounds- and non-target-screening for two mutagenic environmental fractions, N- 2 - 8 and N- 7 - 12 (target-and suspect-compounds-screening for this latter). The target screening based on the exact mass and retention time of the reference standards did not provide any hit and hence, no compounds were identified in the two fractions. The suspect-screening strategy based on the exact mass of the compounds enabled the identification of pigment yellow 1 in fraction N- 7 - 12. Finally non-target screening was applied, which relied on (i) the determination of the empirical formula based on the exact mass of the parent ion, its isotopic pattern and its MS 2 fragmentation, (ii) the selection of the candidates based on the comparison of MSn fragments of the unknown and compounds present in chemical database such as ChemSpider or PubChem, and (iii) the match of the physico-chemical properties of the unknown compound with candidates. This strategy enabled to identify and confirm the presence of benzyl(diphenyl) phosphine oxide in the fraction N- 2 - 8 and to propose a list of 92 candidates, including 46 aromatic amines. The aim of the third part of this study was to apply two different approaches to further decrease the candidates list, containing 92 candidates for fraction N- 2 - 8. This was done by applying (i) retention prediction in reversed phase liquid chromatography calculating the Chromatographic Hydrophobicity Index (CHI) using Linear Solvation-Energy Relationship (LSER), which is based on the Abraham equation and (ii) the mutagenicity prediction of aromatic amines on the basis of the stability of corresponding nitrenium ions as the ultimate electrophiles attacking the DNA. Applying the LSER model, the list of candidates was decreased to 22. The mutagenicity prediction method identified nine amino-candidates as mutagens, 24 amino-candidates for which the mutagenicity could not be predicted and thirteen as non-mutagens. In combining the results of these two methods, 22 compounds remained on the list. Hence, these two methods allowed to drastically decrease the number of candidates...|$|E
