5|$|Mrs. Mangel {{offers to}} help Daphne paint the nursery {{and she is}} knocked off a ladder by Mike's pet Labrador, Bouncer, and suffers amnesia. Mrs. Mangel threatens to sue and Des decides to settle out of court, so that Daphne does not become stressed. But when Daphne learns what Des has done, she is angry with him for keeping it from her. During a picnic, Daphne goes into labour and Beverly Marshall (Lisa Armytage) {{delivers}} her son, Jamie. Daphne briefly suffers from postnatal depression following Jamie's birth. During Jamie's christening, Daphne's mother, Tina, turns up. She and Daphne sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> through their problems and part on speaking terms. Shortly after, Daphne learns that her father is dying. Des persuades her {{to make things right}} with Allen. Daphne then decides to nurse her father and she takes Jamie to stay with him. Months later, Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke) offers to drive Daphne and Jamie back to Ramsay Street after Allen's funeral. During the journey, they are involved in a car crash, which leaves Daphne in a coma. Des stays by her side and is holding her hand when she briefly wakes up to tell him that she loves him. Daphne then suffers a cardiac arrest and dies.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the losses}} in battles for gay rights {{across the country}} that year, he {{remained}} optimistic, saying [...] "Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality {{to a greater extent than}} ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about it." ...|$|E

500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent albums, such as 1977's When You Hear Lou, You've Heard It All yielded such hit singles as [...] "Lady Love". Other {{releases}} in the 1970s {{included the}} classic album Sit <b>Down</b> <b>And</b> <b>Talk</b> To Me.|$|E

2500|$|One of Bob Log III's more {{controversial}} antics is 'Boob Scotch', that is, scotch {{which has been}} stirred by a female (or male) breast.

2500|$|... "We {{wrote to}} the club just over a week ago and their solicitors {{acknowledged}} that letter. We have so far had no response though about when we can all have a face-to-face meeting. We propose a meeting to discuss all the issues, because it just seems the sensible thing to do. To be honest I am not surprised by anything they do anymore. They can say all the threats and deadlines they want but we won’t {{come to an end}} of the matter until they sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to us." ...|$|E

The Federation of Students demanded the government explain the previous night's events and said they would continue their occupation of streets. Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok denied accusations against the police, and explained that tear gas had been used in Admiralty but not in Mong Kok because of the difference in geography.

2500|$|Dish has {{reportedly}} {{been criticized for}} treating analysts and major shareholders poorly. Craig Moffett, senior analyst of U.S. telecommunications, U.S. cable, and satellite broadcasting at Sanford C. Bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how Dish does business. Ergen told him, “We’re too busy creating value around here to sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about it. Thanks but no thanks.” Chris Marangi, a money manager for Gamco Investors, which held about 4 millions shares in Dish, said {{that the company is}} very uncooperative. He says that despite traveling to Denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with Ergen or any other Dish senior manager. “They’re probably the least transparent company of any I’ve ever dealt with." [...] Dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors whom are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E

Three days after, during a testimonial dinner in San Juan, Duterte asked former President Fidel Ramos to lead the Philippine envoy to Beijing for bilateral negotiations with China over the disputes. Ramos accepted the offer on July 23, but resigned on October 31. During his first State of the Nation Address on July 25, Duterte said that his administration [...] "strongly affirms and respects" [...] the ruling and would use it as a guide to negotiate for a resolution on the territorial disputes. Duterte prefers to discuss the issue quietly and directly with China and has vowed not to raise the issue before the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. [...] Duterte said [...] "he would not want to antagonize China" [...] and would want to [...] "maintain good relations with China" [...] to [...] "create an environment where we sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> directly." ...|$|E

2500|$|BBC {{reported}} on 13 January 2009 that Manchester City made {{a bid for}} Kaká for over £100million.

Milan supporters had protested outside the club headquarters earlier that evening, and later chanted outside Kaká's home, where he saluted them by flashing his jersey outside a window. Kaká finished his final season with Milan by scoring 16 goals, helping Milan finish third in Serie A, and once again being elected as a finalist for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award, finishing fourth in voting for the second-straight year.
