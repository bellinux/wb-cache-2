The famous rapper, Jay Z also echoed the same words O’Neal talks about. In a Black Book Magazine interview Jay Z made, he once defended the upper-class tastes of fashion in the hip hop culture as ‘living <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> terms, {{instead of trying to}} emulate an elite lifestyle’ with the wearing of high-net-worth fashion house brands. It is not necessarily because of conspicuous consumption that the hip hop lifestyle brought in these high end fashion products.|$|E

While discussing the decision to create an independent record label, Rodríguez explained [...] "I can't deny we spoke with different labels, but we didn't find anything favorable. Labels are going through tough times {{and we decided to}} brave <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own." [...] Many of the songs on the album were written and performed during the band's extensive touring beginning in 2007, and the songs went through numerous transformations during this time. Before the album's official release, the band posted songs on the internet, including [...] "La Complicidad", which became a radio hit in Puerto Rico. La Dulzura debuted at number five on Billboards Top Latin Albums Chart.|$|E

They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E

We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A friend of ours at the label called me one day and politely {{let me know that}} we were making a lot of mistakes with our career. We decided to fire our manager and try to get off of Victory Music.|$|E

It was the pairs first title since coming back together after the 2012 Olympics. The win was commended by the Indian media as the duo were the only women's doubles pair from the country to win a Grand Prix title. Jwala expressed her concerns for lack of support for doubles in the country and prompted the association and the government to promote doubles. Jwala told NDTV in an interview, [...] "We though big wins would wake up concerned people but it hasn't happened yet.

2500|$|In 2004, Crosby {{recorded}} {{bundles of}} tracks that were titled Turquoise 3.x and Crimson 3.x; {{they were released}} through an online electronic delivery outlet. Crosby solidified his band's line-up during this time, and from then on, VAST became a four-person band. With the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label, many record companies were outraged with the releases. As a result from pressure from his former label, Elektra, Crosby was forced to sign a short-term deal with Carson Daly-owned independent label 456 Entertainment to release {{the best of both}} bundles as one album, titled Nude. This release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs, as the online releases were only available via mp3. In later years, Crosby said the idea of releasing Nude on an indie label was a [...] "nightmare" [...] because [...] "There were so many problems dealing with them (456 Entertainment) on every level. I feel we made a big mistake not believing in ourselves enough and doing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own." ...|$|E

The band feel that the concept {{is very similar to}} the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where a couple [...] one another from their memories. Chad Gilbert revealed that since the band last wrote new material in 2008, one member suffered a [...] "severe" [...] divorce. [...] "It's for them to talk about, not me. Someone pretty much lost their mind [...] did {{a lot of things that}} were pretty scary for all of us. We've all been through that. I wrote about <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> website, certain things sort of haunt you in your life. That's where the title [...] comes from, it's like a brain surgery." ...|$|E

2500|$|Antichrist {{started with}} the idea of making a horror film. Trier {{thought it was a good}} idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because [...] "the genre [...] that you can put a lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had {{recently}} seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as Ring and Dark Water, from which he drew inspiration. Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: [...] "At the same time that we hang <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell." [...] In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether Antichrist really could be classified as a horror film, because [...] "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [...] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it." ...|$|E
