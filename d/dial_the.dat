5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E

25|$|Laurel {{was always}} gracious to fans and {{spent much time}} {{answering}} fan mail. His phone number (OXford-0614) was listed in the telephone directory, and fans were amazed that they could <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> number and speak to him directly.|$|E
5000|$|When a user {{picks up}} their phone, the {{concentrator}} produces <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> tone. When <b>the</b> user <b>dials,</b> it reads <b>the</b> tones. Once the user has completed <b>dialing,</b> <b>the</b> concentrator's microcomputer sends <b>the</b> <b>dialing</b> data to <b>the</b> central switch, which allocates a time slot for <b>the</b> <b>dialing</b> phone on <b>the</b> wire pairs that {{pass through the}} concentrator and through the switch.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dial</b> of <b>the</b> Grillo phone employs an {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} design challenge of condensing <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. <b>The</b> Grillo phone's <b>dial</b> couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on conventional dial phones, but instead has a button within each of <b>the</b> <b>dial's</b> number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin {{through the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> which stops <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> once it's turned to <b>the</b> <b>dial's</b> end position.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dialing</b> {{pattern for}} Hot-Choice {{subscribers}} is different. After <b>dialing</b> [...] "8", <b>the</b> subscriber {{waits for a}} tone and then <b>dials</b> <b>the</b> operator code (OC) either for a long distance call or an international call.|$|R
25|$|Alma White College (which {{operated}} from 1921 to 1978) was {{a private}} college located in Zarephath. Beginning in 1931 the college operated WAWZ 1380 on the AM radio <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> station continued to 1984 after the school closed. The building is now occupied by Somerset Christian College.|$|E
25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had to <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> operator or {{look up the}} telephone number. An example of this was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the local exchange would require having to search through the city's 500-page telephone directory.|$|E
25|$|Universal's {{popularity}} with the chronographs {{caught the attention}} of high-ranking government officials throughout Europe, including the Dutch Royal Family, who granted the Swiss brand a Royal Warrant in 1939 to issue a military watch for the nation's army, with then-Queen Wilhelmina's initials embossed on the <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> Dutch army utilized this watch up until Nazi Germany sacked Rotterdam in May of the same year and occupied the Netherlands until 1944.|$|E

50|$|The 5/A2/A2e has two dials {{to control}} exposure, {{one over the}} shutter button {{and one on the}} back of <b>the</b> camera. <b>The</b> <b>dial</b> above <b>the</b> shutter button will adjust the shutter speed in shutter {{priority}} Tv/Time value mode, but in aperture priority Av/Aperture value mode this same <b>dial</b> will adjust <b>the</b> lens aperture. In full manual mode, <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> above <b>the</b> shutter reverts to adjusting the shutter speed, and <b>the</b> back <b>dial</b> controls <b>the</b> aperture.|$|R
50|$|The Centenary clock has {{one large}} <b>dial</b> in <b>the</b> centre (1.5 m diameter). This <b>dial</b> shows <b>the</b> exact time(UTC+1, during {{daylight}} saving time UTC+2 is used instead). <b>The</b> twelve <b>dials</b> around <b>the</b> centre <b>dial</b> show <b>the</b> following (starting from <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> in <b>the</b> 2 'o clock position and going clockwise): the equation of time, the zodiac, the solar cycle and the dominical letter, the week, the globe, the months, the calendar dates, the seasons, the tides, {{the age of the}} moon, the phases of the moon and the metonic cycle and the epact.|$|R
25|$|In 1840 Wheatstone had {{patented}} an alphabetical telegraph, or, 'Wheatstone A B C instrument,' which {{moved with}} a step-by-step motion, {{and showed the}} letters of the message upon a <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> same principle was used in his type-printing telegraph, patented in 1841. This was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type. It was worked by two circuits, and as the type revolved a hammer, actuated by the current, pressed the required letter on the paper.|$|E
25|$|Radio Caroline {{announced}} a wavelength of 199 metres, rhyming with the name, but was actually broadcasting on 197.3 metres (1520kHz). Stations in the UK announced the wavelength in metres, and radios {{at that time}} were tuned using an analogue <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> absence of precise digital readouts allowed for some leeway between the precise transmission frequency and the channel announced on the air. The Dutch offshore station Radio Veronica was on 192 metres (1562kHz) and Radio Atlanta broadcast on 201 (1493kHz).|$|E
25|$|To make a range measurement, the {{operator}} {{would turn the}} potentiometer dial {{in an effort to}} get the leading edge of the target blip to line up with a vertical line on the CRT. The range was not read off the CRT, but the <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> dial also turned a magslip, or selsyn as it is more commonly known today. The output of the magslip was used to directly turn the controls on the predictor, allowing the radar to continually update the range measurement.|$|E

25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> phone or pick it up, {{but these were}} generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other. For instance, the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|E
25|$|Hayes and the company's {{marketing}} manager Glenn Sirkis approached Heatherington with an outline {{for a new}} command-driven external modem. A few external modems already offered the ability to <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first started, but the real problem was somehow sending a command to hang up, while the modem was already connected. There needed to be some way {{to indicate that the}} characters flowing out from the computer to the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end, but commands to be acted on.|$|E
25|$|Carter is {{in command}} of the George Hammond when it ferries {{personnel}} from Earth to Icarus Base to witness the latest attempt to <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> ninth chevron. The Hammond attempts to fight off the assault on the base by fleet of Goa'uld ships that Carter presumes belong to the Lucian Alliance. Although they are unsuccessful in preventing the destruction of the base, they are able to rescue most of the survivors stranded outside, including Colonel David Telford, who was to command the expedition to Destiny. She also appears later in season 1 where she is the officer in charge of the assault on the Lucian Alliance base.|$|E

25|$|Although the CSBS {{and similar}} designs allowed the {{calculation}} of the proper flight angle needed to correct for windage, it was normally not visible to the pilot. In early bombers the bomb aimer was normally positioned {{in front of the}} pilot and could indicate corrections by hand signals, but as aircraft grew larger it became common for the pilot and bomb aimer to be separated. This led to the introduction of the pilot direction indicator, or PDI. These typically consisted of a pair of electrical pointers mounted in a conventional aircraft instrument panel mount (a small <b>dial).</b> <b>The</b> bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit, which was repeated in the cockpit in front of the pilot.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Atlantis, the Destiny has a {{built-in}} dialing computer which can automatically <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> gate and stores a list of addresses. It locks out certain addresses, presumably because they are either dangerous or inconsequential to the current problem. Two expedition members who {{went to one of}} the locked-out addresses could not be contacted upon redialing. The Destiny also has hand-held dialing computers for those that travel through the Gate to make use of, as there {{do not appear to be}} on-site DHDs thus far. Gates on planets are each equipped with a platform, which transmits information about planet through subspace to Destiny. Since DHDs are absent, it is presumed the platforms are used to power the Gates.|$|E
25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call.|$|E
50|$|Early dials {{worked by}} direct or forward action. The pulses were {{generated}} as <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> turned toward <b>the</b> finger stop position. When the user's hand motion was erratic, it produced wrong numbers. In the late 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> was refined to operate automatically by a recoil spring. The user selected the digit to be <b>dialed,</b> rotated <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> to <b>the</b> finger stop, then released it. The spring caused <b>the</b> <b>dial</b> to rotate {{back to its}} home position during which time constant speed was maintained with a centrifugal governor.|$|R

25|$|Milky Way DHDs {{have sparked}} {{numerous}} discussions as {{the design and}} operation of the device has resulted in contradiction. In the Milky Way, the Dial Home Device contains 38 of the 39 symbols on the Stargate, meaning {{there is always a}} missing glyph on each DHD. This missing glyph, however, is not the point of origin for the planet. This means that only certain addresses can be reached from specific positions in the galaxy safely. The only way to intervene and reach all destinations in the Milky Way from a specific stargate, is to manually <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> gate using an external power source. Another method for reaching any stargate is to use a Dialing computer like Stargate Command- however, this could lead to unforeseen side effects such as wormholes traveling through stars or solar flares. DHDs are designed to prevent these incidents from taking place by only allowing access to certain stargates from specific locations in the galaxy.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{immediate}} search and seizure {{as a result of}} the first program. Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured potential evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government-appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carbó. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a search and seizure was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security-camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by Lázaro Báez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had Báez on speed <b>dial.</b> <b>The</b> son of Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and file folders before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation.|$|E
500|$|Although Camulus leaves Earth, Ba'al {{does not}} send back SG-1. When all SG teams {{announce}} their trust {{and support for}} the general, SG-1 <b>dial</b> <b>the</b> Stargate from offworld, revealing that they were never captured by Ba'al but instead were trapped in a secret base. After their safe return, O'Neill attests new SG-1 leader Samantha Carter's positive leadership skills. It is revealed that the ZPM Camulus was given to supposedly kill Ba'al (which Ba'al would use to destroy Earth) was actually the dead one from Antarctica. Zero Hour makes up the last minutes of the episode. The President is about to arrive, and Gilmor announces that his special assignment, initiated by the President's order, will end the next day. Gilmor expresses his respect, and as they leave to greet the President, the camera zooms in on the resignation letter on O'Neill's desk, with the last words, [...] "Never mind".|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>DIAL</b> {{protocol}} has two components, DIAL Service Discovery and <b>the</b> <b>DIAL</b> REST Service. <b>The</b> <b>DIAL</b> Service Discovery {{enables a}} DIAL client device to discover DIAL servers on its local network segment and obtain access to <b>the</b> <b>DIAL</b> REST Service on those devices. <b>The</b> <b>DIAL</b> REST Service enables a DIAL client to query, launch and optionally stop applications on a DIAL Server device.|$|R

25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit office code. Callers <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. <b>The</b> caller <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual office, callers <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore <b>dialed</b> <b>the</b> office code and a five-digit line number.|$|R
