5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock,</b> six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 August the bomb vessels started bombarding Fort Washington. This caused the {{garrison}} to flee. However, suspecting trickery, Captain Gordon ordered the vessels to continue to fire, only ceasing when the powder magazine exploded at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1982, A {{acquired}} several chains {{that continued}} to be operated under their names, rather than being converted to A. While A regained profitability in the 1980s, in 2002 it operated at a record loss because of new competition, especially Walmart. A closed more stores, which included the sale of its large Canadian division. A also spun off <b>Eight</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Coffee, the last of its manufacturing units. In 2007, A purchased Pathmark, one of its biggest rivals; A again became the largest supermarket operator in the New York City area.|$|E

25|$|Nationwide, Walmart {{gained a}} {{dominant}} {{position in the}} grocery industry, forcing much of the competition to downsize, though in A's core Northeast region, Walmart still had not become a major grocery competitor. In 2003, after declaring its largest loss, A closed Kohl's Food Stores and A's remaining stores in Vermont and New Hampshire, reducing it to just over 500 stores. Also in 2003, A spun off the <b>Eight</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Coffee division (its last manufacturing operation) to Gryphon Investors for $107 million. (In 2006, Gryphon sold <b>Eight</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Coffee to Tata Global Beverages for $220 million). In 2005, A sold its 237-store Canadian division (consisting of A, Dominion, and Food Basics units) to Montreal-based Metro Inc. for C$1.7 billion in cash plus shares of Metro. By 2009, the A name disappeared from these stores. In 2007, A closed its New Orleans division, limiting A's footprint to the Northeast. Also in 2007, A acquired Pathmark, a long-time Northeastern rival, for $1.4 billion. This allowed A to regain its position as the largest grocery retailer in the New York City area, and the second-largest in the Philadelphia area. However, the Federal Trade Commission declared {{that as a result}} of the acquisition, A would be a monopoly in parts of Long Island and Staten Island. As part of its settlement with the FTC, the corporation was forced to divest of some Waldbaum's and Pathmarks.|$|E
25|$|Under the superintendence of the engineers, workmen {{were told}} off {{to cut through}} the {{carriage}} and foot roads, that being the only way of preventing the flames from spreading along the bridge. The men worked with good will and soon succeeded in cutting several holes through the asphalte and timber. How to play with the water on the underside was a difficulty soon got over. Four or five men, with a courage most commendable, volunteered to be lowered down, through the holes in the pathway, by means of ropes, enabling them to direct the water directly on to the burning woodwork. For a long time their efforts seemed to be without effect; no sooner was the fire put out {{in one part of the}} bridge than another beam burst into flames. For several hours streams of water were thrown against the bridge, ultimately with success. In order to put the spreading of the fire beyond doubt, the workmen on the bridge cut through the entire width of the carriage and footway, making a gap at both the Newcastle and Gateshead side... In no way, however, is the safety of the bridge endangered. The railway traffic was suspended from about half past <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, until two in the afternoon, not from any apprehensions that the upper level was insecure, but on account of the smoke and flames, and also because of the hose which was lying across the rails.|$|E

50|$|Creature Features usually {{aired on}} Friday or Saturday night, around <b>eight</b> or nine <b>o'clock.</b> In some cities it aired on Saturday afternoons {{alternating}} with Kung Fu Theater and/or Bikini Theater. Because it aired after the traditional Saturday morning cartoon time block, it introduced many teenagers to classic monster movies.|$|R
60|$|Between <b>eight</b> {{and nine}} <b>o'clock</b> a {{schooner}} was seen approaching.

Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could {{be the only one}} to serve him. [...] "The meal was required to be ready at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock...</b> He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00a.m." ...|$|E
500|$|The British fleet {{was soon}} heavily engaged, passing down the French line and {{engaging}} their ships one by one. Nelson on Vanguard personally engaged Spartiate, also coming {{under fire from}} Aquilon. At about <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock,</b> he was with Berry on the quarter-deck when a piece of French shot struck him in his forehead. He fell to the deck, a flap of torn skin obscuring his good eye. Blinded and half stunned, he felt sure he would die and cried out [...] "I am killed. Remember me to my wife." [...] He was taken below {{to be seen by}} the surgeon. After examining Nelson, the surgeon pronounced the wound non-threatening and applied a temporary bandage.|$|E
500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I {{need to have a}} little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, gave it to me at three o'clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
60|$|The only {{alternative}} was {{to wait for}} the regular packet, which sailed some hours later--between <b>eight</b> and nine <b>o'clock</b> in the forenoon. In this case, they might apply for their passports before the regular office hours, if they explained the circumstances, backed by the authority of the magistrate's letter.|$|R

500|$|Douglas was {{not well}} {{received}} by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in Dade County named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, {{she was the only}} opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. [...] "Can't you boo any louder than that?" [...] she chided, eventually making them laugh. [...] "Look. I'm an old lady. I've been here since <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock.</b> It's now eleven. I've got all night, and I'm used to the heat," [...] she told them. Later, she wrote, [...] "They're all good souls—they just shouldn't be out there." [...] Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.|$|E
500|$|Churchill {{described}} his life at Chartwell {{in the later}} 1930s in {{the first volume of}} his history of the Second World War, The Gathering Storm. [...] "I had much to amuse me. I built... two cottages,... and walls and made... a large swimming pool which... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I... dwelt at peace within my habitation". Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. [...] "He would start the day at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent,...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, then he would start work... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Klingon cosmetics, makeup {{supervisor}} Michael J. Mills {{was kept}} busy preparing {{the large number}} of other aliens called for in the script. Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a Star Trek film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such {{an important role in the}} film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, [...] " [...] we could prove to [...] that we needed something to get the shot done, then we'd have it." [...] The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> call.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of Thursday the rebels arrived at Dumfries with 50 horse and 150 foot. Neilson of Corsack, and Gray, who commanded, with a {{considerable}} troop, entered the town, and surrounded Sir James Turner's lodging.

500|$|The Speaker {{ordered that}} Bellingham be {{transferred}} to the Serjeant-at-Arms's quarters, where MPs [...] who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing [...] under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: [...] "I have been ill-treated... I have sought redress in vain. I am [...] a most unfortunate man and feel here"—placing hand on heart—"sufficient justification for what I have done." [...] He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the [...] authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been told to do his worst: [...] "I have obeyed them. [...] I have done my worst, and I rejoice in the deed." [...] At around <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock,</b> Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial.|$|E
500|$|While {{producing}} Why Don't You?, Davies {{branched out}} within the children's department at BBC Manchester: he attended directors' courses; wrote for older audiences with {{his contributions to}} DEF II and On the Waterfront; and accompanied Keith Chegwin to Norway {{to assist in the}} production of a children's documentary about politics. The head of the children's department, Ed Pugh, offered him the chance to produce Breakfast Serials, a new series scheduled for an 8:00am slot. Breakfast Serials incorporated elements of non-sequitur comedy and popular culture references aimed at older pupils, such as a parody of Land of the Giants. He decided to leave the children's department and the BBC during the production of Breakfast Serials: a friend called him after the first episode was transmitted and observed that he had [...] "broadcast a joke about the juvenilia of Emily Brontë at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning"; the conversation caused him to reflect that he was writing for the wrong audience. Davies produced three more children's series while he pursued an adult drama career: Dark Season, Century Falls, and Children's Ward.|$|E
500|$|From {{this point}} on, combat {{centered}} on the village of Unterhausen, [...] west-south-west of Neuburg center. A few French platoons drove the Austrians from the forest located between the village and the Danube with a bayonet charge by the grenadiers of the 109th. As French reserves arrived, the Austrians counterattacked and retook the woods, the heights at Oberhausen, and the village. [...] According to Lecourbe's account, the Austrians, [...] "embolden by this first success, soon covered all the surrounding heights, on which they planted about twenty-five or thirty pieces of cannon." [...] At <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> at night, after twelve hours of battle, companies of the 14th and 46th Regiments (French) moved along a small road {{on the right of}} the village, and another group proceeded on the left, enveloping the village. [...] The subsequent simultaneous French attack at both flanks and the center convinced the Austrians that, despite the defensive barrages laid by their artillery in Oberhausen, the French had been massively reinforced. The attack on the village, executed without firing a shot, involved fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the commander of the 46th Regiment and the First Grenadier of France, Latour D'Auvergne, were both killed.|$|E
50|$|Shooting of the American-led {{assault on}} the Bridge at Nijmegen was dubbed the “Million-Dollar Hour”. Because of the heavy traffic, the crew had {{permission}} to film on the bridge between <b>eight</b> and nine <b>o'clock</b> on October 3, 1976. Failure to complete the scene would have necessitated rescheduling at a cost — including Redford's overtime — {{of at least a}} million dollars. For this reason, Attenborough insisted that all actors playing corpses keep their eyes closed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, monsieur. There is a canteen in the courtyard. It is {{open from}} <b>eight</b> till nine <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, and {{from five to}} six in the evening. But you {{are not allowed to}} get things in from the town; but nevertheless--" [...] and he smiled, [...] "--as your comrades are on parole, doubtless, should you need {{anything}} beyond what is sold in the canteen, it may chance that they may bring you just the things you want." ...|$|R
60|$|The moon, that night, though {{past the}} full, was still large and oval, and having risen between <b>eight</b> and nine <b>o'clock,</b> now shone aslantwise over the river, {{throwing}} the high, opposite bank, with its woods, into deep shadow, but {{lighting up the}} hither shore pretty effectually. Not a ray appeared to fall on the river itself. It lapsed imperceptibly away, a broad, black, inscrutable depth, keeping its own secrets from the eye of man, as impenetrably as mid-ocean could.|$|R
500|$|On October 29 at <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, a {{shot was}} {{heard from the}} Dutch flagship. It was the signal to advance and smash the Swedish line. The Dutch fleet was divided into three {{squadron}}s. Vice Admiral Witte de With on the 54-gun ship Brederod and his 11-ship squadron led the charge, followed by Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam on the 72-gun Eendracht with 13 ships in the squadron. The last squadron, led by Pieter Floriszoon had 11 ships. In total, the Dutch fleet consisted of 45 ships with 1,838 cannons and 4,000 sailors. Following the warships, many transports with large quantities of food and supplies as well as 28 regiments of experienced soldiers followed, in total 2 300 men. [...] Standing against them was a Swedish navy force consisting of 43 ships, with 1,605 cannons and 4,055 sailors. The Swedes also had great hopes that the coastal artillery of Kronborg would inflict great damage. Charles personally fired the first hostile shot from Kronborg, but it fell short; the Dutch had wisely chosen to sail closer to the Swedish side, where there were fewer land-based guns to contend with. The Swedish force had more guns, but the Dutch {{had the advantage of}} the wind. In the narrow straits of Øresund, nearly a hundred warships now battled.|$|E
2500|$|The Queen's Park Football Club {{was founded}} on 9 July 1867 with the words: [...] "Tonight at half past <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> a number of gentlemen met at No. 3 Eglinton Terrace {{for the purpose of}} forming a {{football}} club." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{were again}} on the lawn between <b>eight</b> and nine <b>o'clock</b> when Harry Gilmore came up to them. He was gracious enough in his salutation to Mary Lowther, but no {{indifferent}} person {{would have thought that}} he was her lover. He talked chiefly to Fenwick, and when they went in to tea did not take a place on the sofa beside Mary. But after a while he said something which told them all of his love.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} some hours in this way, {{he returned home}} and drank a glass of sack, dining soon after, usually off roast meat with pickles or other relish. He drank more wine at dinner. Afterwards he saw patients at his own house, and paid more visits, returning home between <b>eight</b> and nine <b>o'clock.</b> He spent the evening at home, never smoking, but drinking old sack till he felt thoroughly cheerful. After this he generally slept well.|$|R
2500|$|In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, {{emerged as}} the leader of the Council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor. Although Somerset was {{released}} from the Tower and restored to the Council in early 1550, he was executed for felony in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime. Edward noted his uncle's death in his Chronicle: [...] "the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between <b>eight</b> and nine <b>o'clock</b> in the morning". Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset was interred at St. Peter ad Vincula, Tower of London.|$|R
