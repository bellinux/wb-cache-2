50|$|As {{the drain}} voltage increases, its {{control over the}} current extends further toward the source, so the uninverted region expands toward the source, {{shortening}} {{the length of the}} channel region, the effect called channel-length modulation. Because resistance is proportional to length, shortening the channel decreases its resistance, causing an increase in current with increase in drain bias for a MOSFET operating in saturation. The effect is more pronounced the shorter the source-to-drain separation, the deeper the <b>drain</b> <b>junction,</b> and the thicker the oxide insulator.|$|E
50|$|The {{accuracy}} of semiclassical models are compared {{based on the}} BTE by investigating how they treat the classical velocity overshoot problem, a key short channel effect (SCE) in transistor structures. Essentially, velocity overshoot is a nonlocal effects of scaled devices, which {{is related to the}} experimentally observed increase in current drive and transconductance. As the channel length becomes smaller, the velocity is no longer saturated in the high field region, but it overshoots the predicted saturation velocity. The cause of this phenomenon is that the carrier transit time becomes comparable to the energy relaxation time, and therefore the mobile carriers do not have enough time to reach equilibrium with the applied electric field by scattering in the short channel devices. The summary of simulation results (Illinois Tool: MOCA) with DD and HD model is shown in figure beside. In the figure (a), the case when the field is not high enough to cause the velocity overshoot effect in the whole channel region is shown. Note that at such limit, the data from the DD model fit well to the MC model in the non-overshoot region, but the HD model overestimate the velocity in that region. The velocity overshoot is observed only near the <b>drain</b> <b>junction</b> in the MC data and the HD model fits well in that region. From the MC data, it can be noticed that the velocity overshoot effect is abrupt in the high-field region, which is not properly included in the HD model. For high field conditions as shown in the figure (b) the velocity overshoot effect almost all over the channel and the HD results and the MC results are very close in the channel region.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{selected}} applications of both minority and majority carrier conductor - thin insulator - semiconductor (CIS) tunnel structures to microelectronic {{devices such as}} bipolar and field-effect transistors are studied. Minority carrier CIS structures have properties which approach those of an ideal p-n junction diode when the insulator is sufficiently thin to allow a large current to flow through it. The effective junction depth of such a CIS diode is {{of the order of}} the thickness of the electrostatically induced inversion layer at the semiconductor-insulator interface. On the other hand, majority carrier CIS tunnel diodes have shown interesting properties such as an internal current gain. First, by replacing the normally diffused emitters of silicon bipolar transistors with metallic conductor CIS heterojunction tunneling emitters, significant improvements in the current gain and in the breakdown voltage of super gain silicon bipolar transistors have been obtained. Current gains above 3 xl 04 have been achieved for devices with a breakdown voltage in excess of 30 V. Lateral bipolar transistors having such CIS emitters and collectors have been fabricated. These are shown to possess lower leakage and higher current gains than those previously reported. Then, the emitter of a newly proposed transistor structure, the bipolar inversionchannel field-effect transistor (BICFET), is replaced by a majority carrier CIS tunnel emitter. Experimental BICFETs of this type are fabricated more simply than originally proposed and are shown to possess characteristics of the general form predicted. Both Al and n + poly have been used as the conductor overlying the tunnel insulator. In the latter case, where a self-aligned scheme is implemented, a good quality interfacial oxide is shown to have an essential role in device operation. The shallow junction depth of the minority carrier CIS structures has been used to advantage by replacing the normally diffused source and drain regions of a MOSFET with such structures. This has enabled a novel metal gate NMOS transistor with near-zero depth source and <b>drain</b> <b>junctions</b> to be fabricated. Finally, a novel self-alignment scheme which is particularly suitable for very short channel MOSFETs with CIS source and <b>drain</b> <b>junctions</b> is incorporated by interposing a poly silicon gate between these regions. The characteristics of polysilicon source and drain MOSFETs with and without a deliberately grown oxide under the polysilicon regions are compared. The deliberately grown interfacial oxide is shown to suppress short-channel effects in the shortest channel devices studied...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{radiation}} response of 90 nm CMOS transistors to a high fluence (3 X 10 (12) p/cm(2)) of similar to 60 MeV protons. A pronounced dependence on the gate bias V-GS during the exposure has been noted for the n-channel devices: while no degradation of the input and output characteristics is found for V-GS = 0 V and a modest degradation for floating gate conditions, a catastrophic failure can be observed when a positive gate bias of 1. 2 V is applied. This behavior is found for devices with a physical gate oxide thickness of 1. 5 and 2 nm {{and appears to be}} more pronounced for larger area transistors. As will be shown, the breakdown site is connected with either the source-to-gate or drain-to-gate junction, whereby the latter leads to a complete loss of functionality of the transistors. However, some of the biased nMOS-FETs survive the high-energy proton exposure without degradation.

Identical gate stacks processed with a 1000 -degrees C spike anneal have a higher peak mobility at 275 cm(2) /V center dot s, but a 5 -A higher EOT and a reduced drive current at 610 mu A/mu m. The observed performance improvement for the low thermal-budget devices is shown to be mostly related to the lower EOT. The time-to-breakdown measurements indicate a maximum operating voltage of 1. 6 V (1. 2 V at 125 degrees C) for a ten-year lifetime, whereas positive-bias temperature-instability measurements indicate a sufficient lifetime for operating voltages below 0. 75 V. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In 1966 Dr. Bower {{realized}} that if the gate electrode was defined first, {{it would be possible}} not only to minimize the parasitic capacitances between gate and source and drain, but it would also make them insensitive to misalignment.

However, since aluminum could not withstand the high temperature required for the conventional doping of the source and <b>drain</b> <b>junctions,</b> Dr. Bower proposed to use ion implantation, a new doping technique still in development at Hughes Aircraft, his employer, and not yet available at other labs. While Bower’s idea was conceptually sound, in practice it did not work, because it was impossible to adequately passivate the transistors, and repair the radiation damage done to the silicon crystal structure by the ion implantation, since these two operations would have required temperatures in excess of the ones survivable by the aluminum gate. Thus his invention provided a proof of principle, but no commercial integrated circuit was ever produced with Bower’s method. A more refractory gate material was needed.|$|R

Silicon- or silicon-germanium- based TFETs can be easily integrated onto a silicon platform, and may be realized cost-effectively if their performance levels can exceed that of advanced CMOS devices. This motivates the study of performance enhancement for TFETs. In this paper, we discuss technologies aimed at performance enhancement for TFETs, including strain engineering (Fig. 1), source/drain junction profile engineering (Fig. 2), and use of heterojunction materials. Device and circuit simulation results will be discussed as well. Design optimization of multiple-gate TFET devices [7]-[8] will be briefly discussed, including source and <b>drain</b> <b>junction</b> design.
