5|$|<b>Daydream</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), <b>Daydream</b> differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With <b>Daydream,</b> Carey took {{more control over the}} musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered <b>Daydream</b> the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola.|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{previous}} studies on <b>daydreams</b> investigated the contents of <b>daydreams,</b> and discussed their functions. Those studies examined what desires appeared in <b>daydreams</b> or how the personalities were related with the contents of <b>daydreams.</b> However, they had not thoroughly researched the reasons why people with such desires or personalities experienced their own themes through the means of <b>daydreams.</b> To deal with this problem, {{it was necessary to}} pay attention to the styles of <b>daydreams</b> and not only the contents. In this study, the degrees of repetition and fantasy of <b>daydreams</b> were investigated. It was considered that the degrees ranged extensively and that the functions of <b>daydreams</b> vary depending on these degrees. This study mainly focused on repetitious and fantasized <b>daydreams.</b> It was found that only certain scenes appeared in the repetitious <b>daydreams,</b> and that some fantasized <b>daydreams</b> were oriented toward danger and difficulty while others were oriented toward harmony and stability. These results suggest that the therapeutic meaning of <b>daydreams</b> lies in the process where people repeatedly deal with their own themes in a safe world and return to a harmonized world...|$|R
40|$|In three experiments, we {{examined}} the memory-undermining effects of <b>daydreaming</b> for (un) related stimuli. In Experiments 1 and 2, we tested whether <b>daydreaming</b> fosters forgetting of semantically interrelated material and hence, catalyzes false memory production. In Experiment 3, {{we examined}} the memory effects of different <b>daydreaming</b> instructions. In Experiment 1, <b>daydreaming</b> did not undermine correct recall of semantically interrelated words, nor did it affect false memories. In Experiment 2, we again failed to find that <b>daydreaming</b> exerted memory-undermining effects a. In Experiment 3, no memory effects were obtained using different <b>daydreaming</b> instructions. Together, our studies fail to show appreciable memory-undermining effects of <b>daydreaming.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Psychologists {{have long}} {{hypothesized}} that <b>daydreaming</b> (i. e. engaging in stimulus-independent, task-unrelated thoughts and images) may facilitate creativity, but {{evidence for this}} hypothesis has been mixed. We propose that, to fully {{understand the relationship between}} <b>daydreaming</b> and creativity, it is essential to distinguish between different creative processes as well as between alternative styles of <b>daydreaming.</b> A prominent distinction in creativity research is that between analytic problem solving, which involves incremental and largely conscious processes, and insight, which is characterized by the spontaneity with which an idea springs to mind. In this aspect, insight resembles <b>daydreaming.</b> Indeed, recent evidence has linked <b>daydreaming</b> to creative performance. But like creativity, <b>daydreaming</b> is a multifaceted concept. <b>Daydreams</b> vary in style and content, a fact that is receiving little attention in contemporary research. Not all kinds of <b>daydreaming</b> are likely to have the same effects on creativity. We discuss different factors prevalent in people’s <b>daydreaming,</b> such as mood, attentional focus, and intentionality, and consider how these factors may be related to creative processes. We further discuss implications for ways to enhance creativity through deliberate <b>daydreaming</b> practice...|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{governmental}} tampering, <b>Daydream</b> {{became a major}} success in Japan, and was screened at the Venice Film Festival in September 1964. The film was released in the U.S. later the same year, and in 1966 Joseph Green, director of the cult film The Brain that Wouldn't Die (1962) re-released <b>Daydream</b> in the U.S. with new American footage.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, <b>Daydream</b> was {{certified}} five-times Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting {{shipments of}} 350,000 copies. The album finished ninth on the ARIA End of Year Charts in both 1995 and 1996. In Japan, the album debuted at {{number one on}} the Oricon charts. According to the Oricon, <b>Daydream</b> made the top five of the best-selling albums in Japan by a non-Asian artist, with 2.5 million copies sold. <b>Daydream</b> remains one of the best-selling albums of all time, with sales of more than 20 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, <b>Daydream</b> {{peaked at}} number {{two on the}} charts, and was {{certified}} seven-times Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). The album experienced success in Europe, where it reached number one in Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In France, <b>Daydream</b> peaked at number two and was certified double-Platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP). Sales in France are estimated at 800,000 copies. <b>Daydream</b> was certified triple-Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), denoting shipments of three million copies throughout Europe in 1996.|$|E
25|$|While <b>daydreaming</b> {{has long}} been derided as a lazy, {{non-productive}} pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that <b>daydreaming</b> can be constructive in some contexts. There are numerous examples of people in creative or artistic careers, such as composers, novelists and filmmakers, developing new ideas through <b>daydreaming.</b> Similarly, research scientists, mathematicians and physicists have developed new ideas by <b>daydreaming</b> about their subject areas.|$|R
50|$|Other recent {{research}} has also shown that <b>daydreaming,</b> much like nighttime dreaming, {{is a time when}} the brain consolidates learning. <b>Daydreaming</b> may also help people to sort through problems and achieve success. Research with fMRI shows that brain areas associated with complex problem-solving become activated during <b>daydreaming</b> episodes.|$|R
40|$|In {{examining}} {{data from}} Experience Sampling Method projects in which {{graduate students in}} Occupational Therapy explored their time use and experience, I observed an interesting trend, a naming and valuing of non-observable occupations. A seemingly universal experience was <b>daydreaming</b> and fantasizing, a doing in the mind. Students reported that <b>daydreaming</b> most often occurred while engaged in other occupations, or as a secondary occupation, but quite frequently identified <b>daydreaming</b> as a primary occupation. Interestingly, all students indicated that <b>daydreaming</b> was pleasurable and important. Intrigued by these findings, I have explored the phenomenon of <b>daydreaming</b> and argue here that <b>daydreaming</b> should be considered an occupation, an occupation of the mind. While <b>daydreaming</b> is generally considered trivial or maladaptive and thus is often neglected in intellectual discourse, literature from various disciplines supports the notion that <b>daydreaming</b> is a ubiquitous experience that is purposeful and meaningful in daily life. <b>Daydreaming</b> {{has been identified as}} an important means of: 1) preventing boredom and loneliness; 2) amusing oneself in idle moments; 3) reducing tension and stress; 3) learning more about oneself; 4) rehearsing for future actions; 5) developing new and alternate ways of dealing with situations; and 6) creating narratives. The content of <b>daydreams</b> can range from the mundane to the sublime. This paper explores how occupations of the mind develop across the life span and the current research regarding the neurobiological basis for <b>daydreaming.</b> Examples from illness narratives, autobiographical accounts of people with disabilities, and practitioner narratives support the notion that individuals at various stages of development and with various occupational challenges engage in occupations of the mind and that these occupations hold great personal meaning...|$|R
5|$|<b>Daydream</b> {{entered the}} Billboard 200 at number one, with 224,000 copies sold, {{staying at the}} top spot the {{following}} week with 216,000 copies sold, for a third consecutive week, it topped the charts with 170,000 copies sold. It gained power again in the upcoming weeks of holiday sales where it peaked in the year's last weeks with 486,000 and 760,000 units sold at the pinnacle. The album moved 760,000 copies during the Christmas week of 1995, the album's highest sales week. It also reached number one on Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. <b>Daydream</b> was the second best-selling album of 1996, and the eighteenth best-selling album on the 1990s decade in the US. In the United States, <b>Daydream</b> became Carey's best-selling album, being certified diamond by the RIAA (RIAA), denoting shipments of ten million copies.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the then}} 68-year-old Takechi {{decided to return}} to film with a series of {{theatrical}} hardcore films, beginning with a remake of his 1964 <b>Daydream,</b> also titled <b>Daydream.</b> Noticing actress Kyōko Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances, Takechi chose her to star in the film. Japan's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex, Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera. Though, as Japanese law required, sexual organs and pubic hair were fogged on screen, the Asahi Shimbun called it a breakthrough film, and Japan's first hardcore pornographic movie. Takechi took a novel, yet traditional approach to the fogging by covering the forbidden areas with floating images of topless female shamisen players. Unlike Takechi's earlier Dream of the Red Chamber, the full, uncensored version of <b>Daydream</b> 1981 did survive, and circulated underground in Japan. This uncensored version of the film was released on video at one time in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|<b>Daydream</b> became Carey's best-reviewed album up to {{that point}} and an {{international}} commercial success, debuting at number one in nine different countries, and in the top five in almost every major music market. It was Carey's second album to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of ten million copies in the United States. Aside from its success in the United States, the album made the top five of the best-selling albums in Japan by a non-Asian artist, with 2.1 million copies sold. <b>Daydream</b> remains one of the best-selling albums of all time, with more than 20 million copies sold worldwide.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an exploration}} of the nature of <b>daydreaming</b> and its relationship to literacy development in the lives of four children. The children were interviewed and the data is presented in four interpretive case studies. Of the four children, ages 11 - 13, two of the children are urban and two children live on a southwestern Indian reservation. Five themes emerged from the interviews with the children regarding their use and description of daydreaming: <b>daydreaming,</b> imagination, reading, writing, and school. The children consistently made distinctions between <b>daydreaming</b> and imagination, utilized <b>daydreaming</b> in their construction of their worlds, and discussed the negative attitude they experience in school toward <b>daydreaming.</b> The data in the individual case studies is contextualized within the broader life context of each of the four children represented. A component of this work is based in the researcher's self reflection. The universal practice of <b>daydreaming</b> must be valued in the growth and development of the individual. <b>Daydreams</b> show the uniqueness of individual invention. Through <b>daydreams</b> children explore places they have never been, become characters in the stories they read, and explore new knowledge in the safety of their own minds. <b>Daydreaming</b> is an invisible aspect of the creative and generative life of the mind which is critical to visible production. Currently research themes are increasingly addressing the question of individual consciousness and understanding how children transform information into their own terms. This dissertation seeks to contribute to this understanding. <b>Daydreaming</b> is not a negative practice but one which contributes to children's invisible and visible worlds. <b>Daydreaming</b> serves the interests of these children in their lives as thinkers, readers, writers and creators both at home and school...|$|R
5000|$|Eric Klinger's {{research}} in the 1980s showed that most <b>daydreams</b> are about ordinary, everyday events and help {{to remind us of}} mundane tasks. Klinger's research also showed that over 75% of workers in [...] "boring jobs", such as lifeguards and truck drivers, use vivid <b>daydreams</b> to [...] "ease the boredom" [...] of their routine tasks. Klinger found that fewer than 5% of the workers' <b>daydreams</b> involved explicitly sexual thoughts and that violent <b>daydreams</b> were also uncommon.|$|R
40|$|Mind {{wandering}} is a frequently occurring, natural phenomenon, yet it {{is largely}} seen as unproductive. The negative effects of <b>daydreaming</b> have been extensively researched but the function and benefits of <b>daydreaming</b> are less well known. In the literature there are some correlations between <b>daydreaming</b> and measures of creativity. It is possible that <b>daydreaming</b> is a beneficial state of mind that facilitates creative solutions. This study investigated the potential effect of mind wandering on creativity. Participants were 71 undergraduate students who were assigned to watching either an uninteresting film or an interesting film in order to induce more or less <b>daydreaming.</b> During the 20 -minute film, an alarm was sounded five times and participants recorded whether they were <b>daydreaming</b> at that particular moment. Participants then completed a creativity test known as the Remote Associates Test. It was hypothesized that those in the uninteresting film condition would display higher rates of <b>daydreaming</b> leading to better performance on the Remote Associates Test. It was also hypothesized that participants who <b>daydreamed</b> more across both groups would perform better on the measure of creativity. The main hypotheses were not supported and future {{research is needed to}} establish whether there is a causal link between mind wandering and creativity...|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, Takechi {{entered the}} film {{industry}} by producing controversial soft-core theatrical pornography. His 1964 film <b>Daydream</b> was the first big-budget, mainstream pink film released in Japan. After the release of his 1965 film Black Snow, the government arrested him on indecency charges. The trial became a public battle over censorship between Japan's intellectuals and the government. Takechi won the lawsuit, enabling the wave of softcore pink films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema during the 1960s and 1970s. In the later 1960s, Takechi produced three more pink films.|$|E
5|$|Takechi's <b>Daydream</b> {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E
5|$|The game {{centers on}} a boy who dreams of flying while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The concept was partially based on lead designer Jenova Chen's childhood; he was often hospitalized for asthma and would <b>daydream</b> while alone in his room. Assuming {{the role of the}} boy, the player flies through a dream world and manipulates clouds to solve puzzles. The game was intended to spark emotions in the player that the video game industry usually ignored.|$|E
40|$|Estimates {{suggest that}} {{up to half of}} waking life is spent daydreaming; that is, engaged in thought that is {{independent}} of, and unrelated to, one’s current task. Emerging research indicates that <b>daydreams</b> are predominately social suggesting that <b>daydreams</b> may serve socio-emotional functions. Here we explore the functional role of social <b>daydreaming</b> for socio-emotional adjustment during an important and stressful life transition (the transition to university) using experience-sampling with 103 participants over 28 days. Over time, social <b>daydreams</b> increased in their positive characteristics and positive emotional outcomes; specifically, participants reported that their <b>daydreams</b> made them feel more socially connected and less lonely, and that the content of their <b>daydreams</b> became less fanciful and involved higher quality relationships. These characteristics then predicted less loneliness {{at the end of the}} study, which, in turn was associated with greater social adaptation to university. Feelings of connection resulting from social <b>daydreams</b> were also associated with less emotional inertia in participants who reported being less socially adapted to university. Findings indicate that social <b>daydreaming</b> is functional for promoting socio-emotional adjustment to an important life event. We highlight the need to consider the social content of stimulus-independent cognitions, their characteristics, and patterns of change, to specify how social thoughts enable socio-emotional adaptation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} daydreaming: spontaneously recalling or imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The following important roles of <b>daydreaming</b> in human cognition are postulated: plan preparation and rehearsal, learning from failures and successes, support for processes of creativity, emotion regulation, and motivation. A computational theory of <b>daydreaming</b> and its implementation as the program DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which <b>daydreams</b> initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes, and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday occurrences. The role of emotions and control goals in <b>daydreaming</b> is discussed. Four control goals commonly used in guiding <b>daydreaming</b> are presented: rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role of episodic memory in <b>daydreaming</b> is considered, including how <b>daydreamed</b> information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of DAYDREAMER which produces several <b>daydreams</b> (in English) is currently running. Comment: 10 pages.

40|$|Human minds often {{engage in}} {{thoughts}} and feelings that are self-generated rather than stimulus-dependent, such as <b>daydreaming.</b> Recent research suggests that under certain circumstances, <b>daydreaming</b> is associated with adverse effects on cognition and affect. Based on recent literature {{about the influence of}} resting mind in relation to rumination and depression, this questionnaire study investigated mechanisms linking <b>daydreaming</b> to depressive symptoms. Specifically, an indirect effect model was tested in which <b>daydreaming</b> influences depressive symptoms through enhancing self-focus and ruminative thought. Results were in line with the hypothesis and several alternative pathways were ruled out. The results provide initial supportive evidence that <b>daydreaming</b> can influence depressive symptoms through influences on self-focus and rumination. Further research should use prospective or experimental designs to further validate and strengthen these conclusions...|$|R

5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way, either through cutting or fogging. Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily to Japanese tourist audiences for several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of <b>Daydream</b> in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. Though it was a low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, it became very popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E
5|$|Cloud was {{designed}} and released in 2005 {{by a team of}} seven students in the Interactive Media master's degree program at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. The game was not made for a specific class. Development began in January 2005 and the game was released in late October, receiving its final update in December. The group was headed by Jenova Chen and included Stephen Dinehart, Erik Nelson, Aaron Meyers, Glenn Song, composer Vincent Diamante, and producer Kellee Santiago. The game won the 2005 Game Innovation Grant of $20,000 from the USC, which is intended to support the production of experimental games. The idea for the game was partially based on Chen's childhood experience, as he was often hospitalized for asthma and would <b>daydream</b> while waiting for the doctors.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{in real time}} the role of sleep and <b>daydreaming</b> as potentiating states for subsequent dissociation in depersonalization/derealization disorder (DDD). Research and theory suggests that dissociation may be exacerbated and maintained by a labile sleep-wake cycle in which ‘dream-like’ mentation intrudes into waking life and fuels dissociative symptoms. We explore and extend this idea by examining the state of <b>daydreaming</b> in dissociation. <b>Daydreaming</b> {{is a state of}} consciousness between dreaming and waking cognition that involves stimulus-independent and task-unrelated mentation. We report the results of a unique intensive N= 1 study with an individual meeting diagnostic criteria for DDD. Using experience-sampling methodology, the participant rated (six times daily for 40 days) current <b>daydreaming,</b> mood, and dissociative symptoms. At the start of each day sleep quality and duration was also rated. <b>Daydreaming</b> was reported on 45 % of occasions and significantly predicted greater dissociation, in particular when <b>daydreams</b> were repetitive and negative (but not fanciful) in content. These relationships were mediated by feelings of depression and anxiety. Sleep quality but not duration was a negative predictor of daily dissociation and also negatively predicted depression but not anxiety. Findings offer initial evidence that the occurrence and content of <b>daydreams</b> may act as potentiating states for heightened, in the moment, dissociation. The treatment implications of targeting sleep and <b>daydreaming</b> for dissociative disorders are discussed...|$|R

Like Women... Oh, Women!, <b>Daydream</b> was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office.

Serving as an airplay only song in the US, and a limited release around the world, the song received a well amount of chart success specifically in the U.S.. In the United States, Billboard rules did not allow the charting of non-commercially released songs. For this reason, it did not chart on the Hot 100, however peaking at number two on the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside the US, the song peaked at number 11 in Canada, 40 in New Zealand and 44 in the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Often maladaptive <b>daydreams</b> are {{prompted}} by 'triggers' (stimuli which produce an emotional response) which may include conversational topics, sensory stimuli, or physical experiences.

40|$|Driver {{inattention}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of traffic crashes. In comparison to the extensive body of research examining the attention principles that govern distraction by external stimuli, the topic of attention and distraction by <b>daydreaming</b> has been relatively understudied. This work used a self-caught method to examine EEG and driving behavioral correlates of <b>daydreaming</b> during simulated driving tasks. Participants were asked to report any time they found themselves thinking something unrelated to the driving tasks. Measures of EEG and driving behaviors were compared prior to and after each <b>daydreaming.</b> Results showed that three EEG band ratios, beta/(alpha+theta), beta/alpha, and beta/theta were able to discriminate <b>daydreaming</b> from attentive driving, and the beta/alpha band ratio outperformed the other two indices. The power band activities of EEG observed from parietal lobe sites (Pz, P 3, and P 4) were more sensitive to reflect subtle changes in <b>daydreaming.</b> The current findings suggested that these EEG band ratios could be used for early detection of <b>daydreaming</b> in real driving.
