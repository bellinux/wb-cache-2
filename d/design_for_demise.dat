Special focus lies on the fragmentation behaviour of components like depleted stages, boosters, fairings or payload adapters. The goal is {{to better understand the}} behaviour via numeric simulations, the creation of material databases and plasma wind tunnel tests. The findings contribute to a reduced risk of debris impacting on the ground in compliance with ESA debris mitigation requirements.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{sustainable}} use of the space, a series of debris mitigation measures have recently been developed, including the de-orbiting of spacecraft {{at the end of their}} operational life. The consequent ground casualty risk growth associated with the increased frequency of re-entering objects can be limited by designing a spacecraft following a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>demise</b> philosophy. Still, a spacecraft designed to demise through the atmosphere has to survive the space environment for many years. This means that the spacecraft design has also to take into account the survivability issues associated with on-orbit debris and meteoroids impacts. The paper presents the definition and development of survivability and demisability criteria in order to analyse a simple spacecraft configuration against these two design drivers. Simple objects such as spheres, cylinders and boxes are analysed as representative of spacecraft components and structures. The survivability analysis relies on a panelised geometrical representation of the spacecraft and a debris flux model to evaluate the impacts over the mission lifetime. The penetration of a particle is assessed with ballistic limit equations. The model is then used to compute the penetration probability as the survivability criterion. The demise is examined following an object oriented approach where the aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics are analysed using motion and shape averaged coefficients; the trajectory follows a three degree-of-freedom dynamics, and the ablation is modelled through a lumped mass approach. The results of a demisability analysis are given in the form of residual mass fraction. The defined survivability and demisability models are used to study their sensitivity to various spacecraft design parameters such as the component's shape, material, and wall thickness, but also for different initial orbit conditions and re-entry trajectories from Low Earth Orbit. Results shows how spacecraft design parameters and orbit initial conditions affect the design choices when considering the effects on the demise and survivability of a spacecraft...|$|E

40|$|In {{a period}} where the {{evolution}} of the space environment is causing increasing concerns for the future of space exploitation and sustainability, the design-for-demise philosophy has gained an increased interest. However, satellites <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>demise</b> still have to survive the space environment, polluted by space debris, for many years. Within this context, we are developing a framework to evaluate the effect of preliminary design choices on the survivability and on the demisability of a spacecraft configuration. Two models are presented to analyze the spacecraft against the demisability and the survivability, and two corresponding evaluation criteria for the requirements are introduced. Considering common spacecraft components such as tanks and batteries, a set of maps are presented, which shows the variation of the survivability and the demisability as function of the component geometry and material. Furthermore, a preliminary multi-objective optimization is performed to evaluate a simple spacecraft configuration and define an optimal design according to the demise and the survivability criteria...|$|R
