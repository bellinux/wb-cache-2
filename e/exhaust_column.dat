30|$|In this study, fixed-bed column {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} investigate the biosorption potential of two agricultural wastes, Citrullus lanatus rind and Cyperus rotundus to remove Crystal violet (CV) from aqueous solution. The {{experiments were}} conducted to {{study the effects of}} important parameters such as bed depth (10 – 30  cm), flow rate (10 – 20  mL min− 1) and initial dye concentration (10 – 25  mg L− 1). Different models like Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model, Thomas model and Yoon-Nelson model were applied to the experimental sorption data. In the biosorption of Crystal violet by both the sorbents, the BDST model fitted well with the experimental data in the initial region of the breakthrough curve. Also, Yoon–Nelson model was found to show good agreement with the experimental kinetic results as compared to the Thomas model. The sorbents were found to be very potential, as it showed good sorption capacities of 46.68 and 54.24  mg g− 1 for CV biosorption by Citrullus lanatus rind and Cyperus rotundus.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{application}} of bottom ash, a power plant waste, and deoiled soya, an agricultural waste, for the adsorptive removal of carmoisine A dye from its aqueous solutions. This paper incorporates a comparative study of the adsorption characteristics of the dye on these effective adsorbents along with effects of time, temperature, concentration, and pH. Analytical techniques have been employed to find pore properties and characteristics of adsorbent materials. Batch adsorption studies, kinetic studies, and column operations have also been performed to understand the dye extraction ability of the adsorbents. The adsorption behavior of the dye has been studied using Freundlich, Langmuir, Tempkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich adsorption isotherm models. The monolayer adsorption capacity determined from the Langmuir adsorption equation has been found as 1. 78 � 10 � 5 and 5. 62 � 10 � 5 mol g� 1 at 323 K for bottom ash and deoiled soya, respectively. Kinetic measurements suggest the involvement of pseudo-second-order kinetics in both adsorptions and each case is controlled by a particle diffusion process. Column experiments demonstrated that both adsorbents could be practically utilized in elimination of hazardous dye from effluent and dye material can be recovered by eluting NaOH through the <b>exhausted</b> <b>columns...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} {{controlled}} by a cylindrical cell rotor driven by the engine crankshaft via a belt or chain. Individual cells alternately open and close the exhaust gas and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the exhaust gas side is reached, pressurized exhaust gas flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there. As the cell rotor continues to rotate and reaches the aperture on the inlet side, the compressed air flows to the engine. Before the exhaust gas can flow, the aperture is closed again and the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>column</b> is reflected before entering the engine. The exhaust gas exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{potential}} of using PEBA as a sorbent for removing phenolic compounds from wastewater. The sorption isotherms of phenol, 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP), 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP), 4 -methylphenol (4 -MP) and catechol from their respective single solute solutions were studied based on the Linear, Langmuir and Freundlich models. The Freundlich model was shown to be suitable to represent the equilibrium sorption of all the phenolic compounds in the PEBA sorbent, and the sorption capacity of these phenolic compounds in PEBA is in the order: catechol<phenol< 4 -MP< 4 -NP< 4 -CP. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that phenol sorption in PEBA was a spontaneous exothermic process. The sorption kinetics was studied using PEBA sorbent {{in the form of}} a flat membrane with well-defined dimensions to help identify the mechanism and rate controlling step of the sorption process. The kinetic data were fitted with the pseudo-first and -second order models as well as the diffusion model. The pseudo-second order model was shown to fit the experimental data better than the pseudo-first order model, and an oversight in the model fitting with regard to equilibrium sorption capacity in prior work was discussed and corrected. Sorption of phenol, 4 -CP, 4 -NP, 4 -MP and catechol in PEBA was represented by the pseudo-second order model, while mass diffusion inside the sorbent was not negligible for thick membranes. Multi-solute sorption isotherms and kinetics were determined for binary and quinary solute systems. The competitive Freundlich model and the IAST model were fitted to the equilibrium data. It was found that the competitive Freundlich model was adequate to represent isotherms for all binary solute systems studied; however, there was a considerable deviation between the model predictions and the experimental data in the quinary solute system. Strongly sorbed solutes tended to inhibit the sorption of weakly sorbed solutes. The sorption competition was shown to affect the sorption kinetics of individual solutes, and such effect was found to be related to the molecular size of the sorbate component and its affinity to the sorbent. Chemical elution, thermal regeneration and vacuum-assisted thermal regeneration were proposed and studied for regeneration of PEBA sorbent exhausted with the phenolic compounds. Ethanol, methanol and NaOH solution were all effective regenerants for the sorbent, and no significant change in the sorption characteristics was observed for a number of sorption-regeneration cycles. Thermal regeneration (90 °C for 2 h) was also effective for regenerating PEBA exhausted with phenol and 4 -MP. When exhausted with 4 -MP, the PEBA sorbent could be regenerated using vacuum-assisted thermal regeneration (80 °C for 3 h at a vacuum pressure of 5 kPa), and highly concentrated solutions (≈ 70, 000 ppm) of 4 -MP were collected. PEBA fibres were prepared and immobilized in a packed-bed for column sorption studies. The effects of inlet feed concentration, flow rate, fibre diameter and flow interruption on the breakthrough were evaluated. The BDST, Clark and Yoon-Nelson models were fitted to the experimental data. It was shown that the BDST model described the breakthrough curve adequately when the solute in the effluent was at lower concentrations (0 <C/C 0 < 0. 15); while over a broader range of effluent concentration (0 <C/C 0 < 0. 90), the Clark model fitted the breakthrough curve better than Yoon-Nelson model. The sorption capacities of phenolic compounds in the column were found to be comparable to those determined in batch sorption studies. Complete regeneration of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>column</b> was achieved using NaOH and there was no change in breakthrough characteristics after column regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The {{pollution}} of surface and ground waters by nitrogen (N) {{is a common}} problem. Anthropological sources of N in water are from animal farms, untreated municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewater, which has elevated the eutrophication of lakes, estuaries and rivers. N species in the environment can impact also on human, animal, and plants wellbeing. Ammonia (NH 3) is the initial indicator of N pollution and exists as ammonium (NH 4 +) and ammonia (NH 3 (aq.)) in water. This work studied the use of ion exchange (IE) to remove NH 3 from the wastewater (bioslurries) using natural adsorbent material (zeolite). IE experiments were conducted in two phases. In phase one, batch experiments were carried out to {{study the effects of}} NH 4 + load, pH, solids, contact time, and particle sizes (0. 2 - 0. 5 & 0. 6 - 2. 0 mm) on NH 3 removal capacity of zeolites. The exchange kinetics and isotherms of both zeolite particles were determined using data obtained from NH 4 + load studies. In phase two, column experiments were used to study the effect of flow rates, pH, and regeneration on NH 4 + removal capacity of zeolite to determine the feasibility of the process in natural environment. In both experimental methods (batch and column), NH 3 adsorption capacity (Q) was significantly high with 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm compared to 0. 6 - 2. 0 mm particle size zeolite, because 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm had greater specific surface area and shorter diffusion path. The batch studies showed that the initial NH 4 + Q increased with increased concentration of NH 4 + in solution. NH 4 + adsorption was rapid {{at the beginning of the}} experiment as all the adsorption sites were empty and maximum adsorption took place within the first 10 minutes of the experiment time. The pH effect was studied at pH range 6 to 8. 5 with 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm zeolite. At this pH range, the pH had minimal effect on the NH 4 + removal capacity of the zeolite. The kinetic analysis showed that the adsorption of NH 4 + on both zeolite types at different NH 4 + concentrations followed the pseudo second order model indicating sorption capacity is proportional to the number of activated sites occupied on the sorbent. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted to the linear Langmuir and Freundlich models. The batch experiments were also performed to study the effect of total solids (TS) on NH 3 removal capacity of the zeolite. NH 3 Q and removal efficiency (E%) of both zeolite types decreased with an increase in TS concentration in the solution due to interference of the solids with the IE process. The column studies showed that the lower flow (10 ml/min) rate had maximum NH 3 removal capacity compared with the higher flow rate (50 ml/min) as low flow rate provided more contact time between zeolite and the solution. The pH effect was studied at pH range 6. 5 to 9. 5. The NH 3 Q was more or less the same at the pH range of 6. 5 to 8. 0 and decreased sharply at pH 9. 5 due to N-species distribution and partial dissociation of zeolite. The column regeneration experiments showed that 0. 5 M NaCl was better than HCl regeneration. NaCl regeneration can efficiently regenerate exhausted zeolite and even after 6 th regeneration cycle, NH 4 + E% of zeolite was not affected. On the other hand, regeneration with HCl showed that HCl was not able to regenerate <b>exhausted</b> <b>column,</b> it was probably due to competition between NH 4 + and H+ ions at lower pH. In conclusion, this study showed that N in raw bio-slurries can be efficiently removed with IE and natural zeolite. However, bio-slurries are usually characterized with high solid contents, which can hinder the application of IE to such medium in large-scale application. Further studies are needed to determine the best approach for sustainable IE application for N removal from liquid bio-wastes, e. g., combined with pretreatments...|$|R
