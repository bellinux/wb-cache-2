500|$|On April 13, 1949, {{rheumatologist}} Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic {{announced the}} dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The cortisone {{was produced by}} Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett, starting with <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> from cattle bile acids. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement {{in the process of}} producing cortisone. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, which was a rare and expensive chemical. [...] By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol) of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; [...] and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately they were not.|$|E

40|$|Most {{patients}} with stable cirrhosis of the alcoholic have “target” red cells; however, a minority have “spur” cells and severe hemolytic anemia. These two syndromes were studied in 27 {{patients with}} target cells and 17 patients with spur cells, {{all of whom}} had advanced cirrhosis. The cholesterol and phospholipid content of red cell membranes effectively distinguished target cells from spur cells. Target cells alone were rich in lecithin, and both the cholesterol/phospholipid and cholesterol/lecithin mole ratios were greater in spur cells. The cholesterol/phospholipid mole ratio of both types of red cells correlated closely with the free cholesterol saturation of serum lipoproteins, as defined by the amount of free cholesterol relative to phospholipid and protein in these lipoproteins. Lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was decreased in most patients with target cells and spur cells; however, the relationship between this activity and the lipid abnormalities observed was weak. Serum bile acid levels also correlated poorly with serum and cell lipids. However, in patients with target cells the amount of cholic and <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> in serum was approximately equal to the amount of chenodeoxycholic acid, whereas in patients with spur cells chenodeoxycholic acid (the precursor of lithocholic acid) predominated...|$|R
40|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (BAS) {{represent a}} therapeutic approach {{for the management}} of hypercholesterolemia that relies on the cationic polymeric nature of BAS to selectively bind negatively charged bile acids. We hypothesized that the cross-linking of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and saccharides such as starch or dextrin with divinyl sulfone (DVS) yields homo- and hetero-polymeric materials with the ability to trap sterols. Our hypothesis was put to test by synthesizing a library of 22 polymers that were screened to evaluate their capability to sequester both cholesterol (CHOL) and cholic and <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> (CA and DCA). Three polymers synthesized in high yield were identified as promising. Two were neutral hetero-polymers of β-CD and starch or dextrin and the third was a weakly cationic homo-polymer of starch, highlighting the importance of the cavity effect. They were tested in hypercholesterolemic male Wistar rats and their ability to regulate hypercholesterolemia was similar to that for the reference BAS cholestyramine, but with two additional advantages: (i) they normalized the TG level and (ii) they did not increase the creatinine level. Neither hepatotoxicity nor kidney injury was detected, further supporting them as therapeutical candidates to manage hypercholesterolemia...|$|R

40|$|Summary High fat diets {{have been}} implicated in {{incidence}} of colon cancer both in epidemiological and animal studies. Present investigation deals with the incidence, location and numbers of large and small bowel tumours induced by 1, 2 -dimethyl hydrazine (DMH) in rats fed high fat diets and neomycin. Neomycin was used to modify the faecal sterol metabolism {{and the relationship of}} the high fat diet and faecal neutral and acid sterols to the large bowel tumorigenesis was evaluated. DMH administered rats were fed with (a) 20 % safflower oil; (b) 20 % safflower oil and neomycin; (c) 20 % safflower oil, cholesterol and cholic acid; and (d) 20 % safflower oil, cholesterol, cholic acid and neomycin. Neomycin was found to be associated with both increase and decrease of tumour numbers. The faecal sterols lithocholic and <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> were found to have no participation, while cholesterol and cholic acid were found to decrease with increase in tumour numbers. However, faecal coprostanol has been found to have a significant positive correlation with tumorigenesis in all dietary groups.

The characteristics of hepatic and extrahepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities toward these bile acids {{were compared with}} respect to kinetic parameters and other catalytic properties. Whereas no organ-specific differences in the affinities of individual bile acids to hepatic and extrahepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases were observed, the individual bile acids showed reaction rates in liver that were about twice the rates estimated in kidney and about twice to three times the rates observed in duodenal mucosa. In intestinal mucosa the rate of chenodeoxycholic acid glucuronidation exhibited a progressive decrease from duodenum to colon, where it was 30 % of the duodenal level. Comparison of the glucuronidation rates that were estimated with different bile acids in hepatic or extrahepatic tissues showed that for each organ a bile acid structure-activity relationship existed, with highest activity observed for lithocholic and ursodeoxycholic acids, which was about twofold higher compared with chenodeoxycholic or <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acids.</b> Lowest activity was estimated for glycolithocholic acid. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity toward chenodeoxycholic acid was studied in biopsy specimens of liver that were obtained from {{a large group of}} patients with the following liver diseases: liver cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, granulomatous hepatitis, fatty liver hepatitis, and fatty liver.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of 3 beta-aminoderivatives of cholic and <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> (steroid residues) with dimethyl ester of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (bridge) {{leads to the}} formation of dimers carrying four carboxylic organic function,, two of them located on the side chain of each steroid residue and the other two on the bridge. As tetrasodium stilts. these new compounds behave as surfactants and have been characterized by surface tension. fluorescence intensity of pyrene (as a probe), and static and dynamic light scattering measurements. Thermodynamic parameters for micellization were obtained from the dependence of the critical micelle concentration (cmc) with temperature. For both surfactants. the fraction of bound counterions is close to 0. 5. The aggregation behavior is similar to one of their bile salt residues [i. e., sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) ] and can be Summarized its follows: (i) molecular areas at the interface for the new surfactants are fairly close to twice the value for a single molecule in a monolayer of natural bile salts; (ii) the environment where pyrene is solubilized is very apolar, as in natural bile salt aggregates; (iii) Gibbs free energies (per steroid residue) for micellization are not far from published values for NaC and NaDC, and the differences can e understood on the basis of less hydrophobicity of the new surfactants due to the charges in the bridge: and (iv) as for NaC and NaDC. aggregates have rather low aggregation numbers (which depend oil the amount of added inert salt, NaCl).

40|$|Expansion of the {{bile salt}} pool size in rats {{increases}} maximum excretory capacity for taurocholate. We examined whether increased bile salt transport {{is due to}} recruitment of centrolobular transport units or rather to adaptive changes in the hepatocyte. Daily sodium cholate (100 mg/ 100 g body wt) was administered orally to rats. This treatment was well tolerated for at least 4 d and produced an 8. 2 -fold expansion of the bile salt pool. This expanded pool consisted predominently (99 %) of cholic and <b>deoxycholic</b> <b>acids.</b> Significantly increased bile salt transport was not observed until 16 h after bile acid loading, and maximum elevations of transport capacity to 2. 3 -fold of control required ∼ 2 d. In contrast, maximum sulfobromophthalein excretion rates increased 2. 2 -fold as early as 4 h and actually fell to 1. 5 -fold increase at 4 d. We studied the possibility that this adaptive increase in bile salt secretory transport was due to changes in canalicular surface membrane area, lipid composition, or increased number of putative carriers. Canalicular membrane protein recovery and the specific activities of leucine aminopeptidase, Mg++-ATPase and 5 ′-nucleotidase activities were unaltered by bile salt pool expansion. The content of free and esterified cholesterol and total phospholipids was unchanged in liver surface membrane fractions compared with control values. In contrast, sodium cholate administration selectively increased specific [14 C]cholic acid binding sites twofold in liver surface membrane fractions. Increased numbers of [14 C]cholic acid receptors (a) {{was associated with the}} time-dependent increase in bile salt transport, and (b) was selective for the taurine conjugate of cholate and (c) was reduced by chenodeoxycholate. Changes in bile acid binding sites 16 h following taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate and the lack of change with glycocholate was associated with comparable changes in bile salt transport. In conclusion, selective bile salts increase bile salt transport in the liver through an adaptive increase in the density of putative bile acid carriers in liver surface membrane...|$|R

We previously showed that milk mineral, an important source of calcium, decreases metabolic risk factors and colonic proliferation in rats, We non report the effects of the habitual intake of milk calcium on metabolic risk factors in healthy subjects. A double-blind, cross-over metabolic study was performed in 13 healthy males, Placebo milk products (calcium, 3 mM) were compared with regular milk products (calcium, 30 mM), In each 1 -week period, the habitual diet was recorded, and urine and feces were collected for 1 and 3 days, respectively. Milk calcium significantly increased fecal pH and fecal excretion of phosphate (132 %), total fat (139 %), free fatty acids (195 %), and bile acids (141 %), indicating intestinal complexation. In fecal water, the concentrations of long-chain fatty acids, secondary bile <b>acids</b> (<b>deoxycholic</b> and lithocholic <b>acid),</b> neutral sterols, and phospholipids were about halved (P < 0. 05), Consistent with these changes in soluble hydrophobic surfactants, calcium decreased the cytotoxicity of fecal crater from 68 +/- 9 to 28 +/- 12 % (P < 0. 005), Calcium in milk products precipitates luminal cytotoxic surfactants and thus inhibits colonic cytotoxicity.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Bile acid {{toxicity}} {{has been}} shown in the gastric, colonic, and hepatic tissues; the effect on oesophageal mucosa is less well known.  AIMS—To determine the spectrum of bile acids refluxing in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and its relation to oesophageal pH using a new technique of combined oesophageal aspiration and pH monitoring.  METHODS—Ten asymptomatic subjects and 30 patients with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (minimal mucosal injury, erosive oesophagitis (grade 2 or 3 Savary-Miller), Barrett's oesophagus/stricture; n= 10 in each group) underwent 15 hour continuous oesophageal aspiration with simultaneous pH monitoring. Bile acid assay of the oesophageal samples was performed using modified high performance liquid chromatography.  RESULTS—The peak bile acid concentration and DeMeester acid scores were significantly higher in the patients with oesophagitis (median bile acid concentration 124 µmol/l; acid score 20. 2) and Barrett's oesophagus/stricture (181 µmol/l; 43. 3) than patients with minimal injury (14 µmol/l; 12. 5) or controls (0 µmol/l; 11. 1). The predominant bile acids detected were cholic, taurocholic, and glycocholic acids but there was a significantly greater proportion of secondary bile <b>acids,</b> <b>deoxycholic</b> and taurodeoxycholic <b>acids,</b> in patients with erosive oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus/stricture. Although bile acid reflux episodes occurred at variable pH, a temporal relation existed between reflux of taurine conjugates and oesophageal acid exposure (r= 0. 58, p= 0. 009).  CONCLUSION—Toxic secondary bile acid fractions have been detected in patients with extensive mucosal damage. Mixed reflux is more harmful than acid reflux alone with possible toxic synergism existing between the taurine conjugates and acid. ...|$|R
