40|$|We {{report a}} case of a patient with the triad of retinoblastoma, <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> {{syndrome}} (DNS) and multiple cutaneous melanomas. The combination of retinoblastoma and DNS is a significant risk factor for the development of cutaneous melanoma. This risk extends to family members. We recommend that survivors of (inherited) retinoblastoma and their relatives are closely screened for the presence of dysplastic naevi. (C) 2002 Lippincott Williams Wilkins...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of dysplastic naevi based on histopathological grading is a contentious issue. Comprehensive management guidelines are lacking and the approach taken varies between clinicians. The authors sought {{to understand how}} Australian dermatologists approach the {{management of}} biopsy-proven dysplastic naevi, {{and the impact of}} grading of dysplasia upon this management. In total, 547 Fellows of the Australasian College of Dermatologists were surveyed and 218 responses were collected (40 % response rate). Although all dermatologists surveyed would re-excise an incompletely removed severely <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus,</b> opinion was divided over whether to treat such a lesion as an in situ melanoma or a <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus,</b> with 55 % of respondents using a 5 -mm margin and the remainder opting for narrow margin re-excision. When the same lesion was reported to be clear of margins by 1 mm after biopsy and the clinical suspicion for melanoma was high, 44 % would re-excise with a 5 -mm margin. The approach of Australian dermatologists to the management of dysplastic naevi varies between clinicians, reflecting the problems raised by the validity of histopathological grading...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a 49 -year-old man who {{presented}} with a solitary atypical pigmented lesion with a surrounding halo of dermatitis. Dermoscopy showed a pigment network at the periphery with areas of scar-like depigmentation, negative pigment network and erythema. The lesion was treated preoperatively with a potent topical corticosteroid resulting in a reduction of inflammation. Histology showed an early Clark level 1 melanoma arising within a severely <b>dysplastic</b> compound melanocytic <b>naevus.</b> There was an adjacent perivascular chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with occasional eosinophils. Minimal, though definite spongiosis with parakeratosis was also present. The scar was subsequently re-excised achieving appropriate excision margins for melanoma in situ. Six months later, there was recurrence of dermatitis at the scar with no evidence of recurrent melanoma. To our knowledge, melanoma with Meyerson phenomenon has not been reported in the literature. This case highlights that all lesions should be evaluated on clinical and dermoscopic grounds regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} eczema. Our case adds yet another entity that may display Meyerson phenomenon and consequently a halo of eczema cannot be considered a reassuring sign when evaluating melanocytic lesions...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{have carried}} out a multiparameter {{analysis}} using a panel of 28 immunohistochemical markers to identify markers of transformation from benign and <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> to primary melanoma in three separate cohorts totalling 279 lesions. We have identified a set of eight markers that distinguish naevi from melanoma. None of markers or parameters assessed differentiated benign from dysplastic naevi. Indeed, the naevi clustered tightly {{in terms of their}} immunostaining patterns whereas primary melanomas showed more diverse staining patterns. A small subset of histopathologically benign lesions had elevated levels of multiple markers associated with melanoma, suggesting that these represent naevi with an increased potential for transformation to melanoma...|$|E
40|$|Melanoma {{incidence}} in Australia {{remains the}} highest in the world; hence understanding its causation is paramount for future therapeutic developments. Multiple primary melanomas are also common occurrences among the Australian population with identified risk factors such as personal and family history of melanoma, fair skin type, <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> syndrome and history of significant ultraviolet exposure. The roles of both environmental and genetic factors have been elucidated in melanoma development, but the synergy of interactions between the two remains complex given the heterogeneous nature of the disease. We present a rare case of a 57 -year-old female with 20 cutaneous melanomas and review the role of genetic and environmental factors in development of her multiple primary melanomas...|$|E
40|$|Summary DNA {{flow cytometry}} was {{performed}} on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded melanocytic naevi. DNA aneuploidy was detected in all three types of naevus but was significantly more frequent in those naevi accepted as precursors of malignancy: that is, dysplastic and congenital pigmented hairy naevi. It {{may be that the}} presence of DNA aneuploidy has prognostic significance in these naevi. Technical problems were encountered in the analysis of data from melanocytic lesions so that caution is recommended in interpretation of studies using formalin fixed tissue. Melanocytic naevi may be precursors of malignant melanoma, in particular, the so-called <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> and the congenital pigmented hairy naevus. The dysplastic melanocytic naevus was described by Clark in 1984 who stated that 'the combination of persistent lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia (aberrant differentiation) and melanocytic nuclear atypia constitutes melanocytic dysplasia'. Other characteristic histological features now recognised include the bridging of rete pegs by ellipsoidall...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-violet {{radiation}} (UVR) {{in sunlight}} {{is thought to}} be the main cause of malignant melanoma in lightly-pigmented populations. Individuals with fair skin, fair hair, blue eyes and/or a tendency to burn rather than tan when exposed to the sun are at particularly high risk of melanoma and should be given special attention in primary prevention programmes. Intermittent exposure to the sun, as in recreational exposure, may be a more potent cause of melanoma than more continuous exposure. Primary prevention offers the best prospects for a substantial reduction in mortality from malignant melanoma. However, there is little evidence available to judge the effectiveness of primary prevention of melanoma through reduction of exposure to the sun. Education for reducing exposure to the sun is common in high-risk populations but has never been evaluated adequately. Mortality from melanoma could also possibly be reduced by earlier diagnosis through education or screening of high-risk groups. Regular screening of patients with the familial <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> syndrome should reduce their mortality from melanoma...|$|E
40|$|Unique and {{uncommon}} BamHI allelic restriction {{fragments of}} the Ha-ras locus {{have been reported in}} the genomes of patients with cancer and of three affected members of a familial melanoma kindred (Krontiris et al., 1986). Analysis of the BamHI and Msp/HpaII restriction fragments of peripheral blood leucocyte DNA from the members of two families with hereditary melanoma (HM) /familial <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> syndrome (DNS) revealed that the only Ha-ras allele common to four affected members of one kindred and two from a second kindred, was the 6. 7 kb allele which is found in 66 % of the normal population. This allele was found equally in affected and non-affected family members, and in one affected case was inherited from an unaffected homozygous parent. It was absent in two affected sisters in a third kindred. In the first kindred the karyotype of all three melanoma sufferers was 46 XX 9 qh+, while six unaffected members had a normal karyotype. BamHI polymorphism of the Ha-ras gene does not identify the affected members in the HM/DNS families studied...|$|E
40|$|A 39 -year-old woman {{reported}} to her general practitio-ner {{with a new}} pigmented skin lesion on her right pectoral region. Dermatoscopically there were no suspicious features and {{the decision was made}} to monitor it over a three-month period. At follow-up imaging there was some minor change, possibly related to technical factors (the original camera/ dermatoscope combination was not available), and after dis-cussion with the patient a decision was made to perform an excisional biopsy. The pathologist reported the lesion as a: “ … <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> of the compound type ” with “ … mild atypia and active lymphocytic regression. ” He made the addi-tional comment: “Two apparent scabies mites are present. ” This was not expected, as the patient had complained of no symptoms of scabies and no skin eruption had been observed to suggest that diagnosis. The patient returned for her routine postoperative review one week after the excision. She now complained of an intensely itchy skin eruption and wondered if she was having an allergic reaction to the local anaesthetic or antiseptic skin preparation solution used at the time of surgery.

40|$|Cutaneous melanoma, {{a type of}} skin tumor {{originating}} from melanocytes, often develops from premalignant naevoid lesions via a gradual transformation process driven by an accumulation of (epi) genetic lesions. These dysplastic naevi display altered morphology and often proliferation of melanocytes. Additionally, melanocytes in dysplastic naevi show structural mitochondrial and melanosomal alterations and have elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. For this study we performed genome-wide expression and proteomic analysis of melanocytes from <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> (DNMC) and adjacent normal skin (MC) from 18 patients. Whole genome expression profiles of the DNMC and MC of each individual patient subjected to GO-based comparative statistical analysis yielded significantly differentially expressed GO classes including “organellar ribosome,” “mitochondrial ribosome,” “hydrogen ion transporter activity,” and “prefoldin complex. ” Validation of 5 genes from these top GO classes revealed a heterogeneous differential expression pattern. Proteomic analysis demonstrated differentially expressed proteins in DNMC {{that are involved in}} cellular metabolism, detoxification, and cytoskeletal organization processes, such as GTP-binding Rho-like protein CDC 42, glutathione-S-transferase omega- 1 and prolyl 4 -hydroxylase. Collectively these results point to deregulation of cellular processes, such as metabolism and protein synthesis, consistent with the observed elevated oxidative stress levels in DNMC potentially resulting in oxidative DNA damage in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{this paper}} we discuss an {{efficient}} methodology for the image analysis and characterization of digital images containing skin lesions using Support Vector Machines and present {{the results of a}} preliminary study. Methods The methodology is based on the support vector machines algorithm for data classification and it has been applied to the problem of the recognition of malignant melanoma versus <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus.</b> Border and colour based features were extracted from digital images of skin lesions acquired under reproducible conditions, using basic image processing techniques. Two alternative classification methods, the statistical discriminant analysis and the application of neural networks were also applied to the same problem and the results are compared. Results The SVM (Support Vector Machines) algorithm performed quite well achieving 94. 1 % correct classification, which is better than the performance of the other two classification methodologies. The method of discriminant analysis classified correctly 88 % of cases (71 % of Malignant Melanoma and 100 % of Dysplastic Naevi), while the neural networks performed approximately the same. Conclusion The use of a computer-based system, like the one described in this paper, is intended to avoid human subjectivity and to perform specific tasks according to a number of criteria. However the presence of an expert dermatologist is considered necessary for the overall visual assessment of the skin lesion and the final diagnosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|When {{a biopsy}} is taken of a {{suspicious}} pigmented skin lesion, histological examination {{is expected to}} establish the definitive diagnosis. This study evaluated the inter-observer variation of 20 pathologists in the histological diagnosis of a randomly selected set of suspicious pigmented skin lesions (PSLs), by comparing their diagnoses to a reference diagnosis. Overall sensitivity for melanoma was 87 %, ranging from 55 % to 100 % between the observers. Sensitivity was significantly lower for thin (Breslow thickness < 1 mm) than for thick melanomas (83 % versus 97 %, p= 0. 005). Overall melanoma specificity was 94 %, ranging from 83 % to 100 % between observers. <b>Dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> {{was the most important}} source of false-positive diagnoses, mainly in situ melanomas. Positive and negative predictive values in the given test set were 75 % and 97 %, respectively. In the case of melanoma, there was quite some variation in measured Breslow thickness. This would have led to a different therapeutic approach in 12 % of the readings. Some of the variation seemed to be due to a different interpretation of the presence of a co-existent naevus. In 9 % (3 / 35) of the readings, participants did not agree on the presence of ulceration. These results reflect a tendency to overdiagnose mainly thin melanomas in general histopathological practice. They also demonstrate variation in the assessment of major prognostic factors of melanoma. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{melanoma}} {{may occur}} as isolated, so-called 'sporadic' cases or {{in association with}} multiple atyical naevi and in familial clusters, in which case it {{is referred to as}} the familial <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus</b> syndrome (DNS). In this retrospective study (a) the number and body distribution of naevocytic naevi and (b) the body distribution of malignant melanoma (MM) in individuals with familial DNS were compared in order to study their association. In 45 patients with familial DNS aged 20 - 39 years naevus counts on trunk and lower extremities were compared with melanoma data and distributions from a second group of 43 patients from the same DNS families aged 12 - 66 years. Men had significantly more naevi of a size greater-than-or-equal-to 2 mm or greater-than-or-equal-to 5 mm on the back than women (P= 0. 02). Women showed a tendency towards a greater number of naevi on the lower extremities than men, but in women no significant difference in naevi between the lower extremities and the back was found. The total number of naevi on the trunk and lower extremities in familial DNS patients was higher than that in the general population. In conclusion, it was found that predilection sites for melanoma in familial DNS patients of both sexes correspond with the distribution of naevi; in males naevi and melanoma counts and percentage distributions were higher on the back, in females both the back and the lower extremities were affected. These findings strongly suggest an association between naevus distribution and melanoma occurrence and site in familial DNS, analogous to earlier reports on sporadic melanoma. 1,...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Digital epiluminescence dermoscopy is a {{relatively}} recent tool, based on the acquisition of high-definition digital images, for the diagnosis of pigmented cutaneous lesions. PURPOSE: To verify the usefulness of digital dermoscopy in detecting pigmented lesions with features which may lead to suspicion of malignancy, when the examination is carried out by primary care physicians (PCP), not expert {{in that kind of}} diagnosis. Another target was an appraisal of the effectiveness and safety of telediagnosis based on epiluminescence digital dermoscopy on pigmented lesions. METHODS: Digital images from some peripheral centres (235 lesions) have been forwarded in real time to the reference centre (Unit of Plastic Surgery, University of Siena, Italy), with a double judgement by each primary care physician ('benign' or 'suspicious of malignancy') on the basis of anamnesis and clinical examination at first step, and dermoscopy as second step. The image analysis carried out from the reference centre identified every lesion examined as 'to be controlled' (219 lesions) or 'to be removed' (16 lesions). RESULTS: Regarding the patients with dermoscopic examination (197 subjects, 235 lesions), the investigation reduced the number of lesions suspected of malignancy from 68 to 29 after the first dermoscopy, and from 29 to 16 after the re-examination of the image by the central unit researchers. Fourteen lesions suspected of malignancy when examined in the peripheral centres were then evaluated as benign by the central unit researchers, while one lesion, judged as benign at first (always labelled as 'benign' by the PCP), was then revealed as a <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus.</b> CONCLUSION: Digital dermoscopy can be enhanced by telediagnosis, which provides a better control of cutaneous pigmented lesions in the peripheral areas, thus reducing the number of consultations in specialised centres...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is well {{documented}} that renal transplant recipients {{are at increased risk}} of developing skin cancers, in particular squamous cell carcinomas. Less extensively reviewed in the literature is the increased incidence of malignant melanoma. We have reviewed 10 patients in the Oxford renal transplant population who developed 12 melanomas following transplantation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and characteristics of melanoma in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: We reviewed the case notes and pathology of all patients who developed melanoma within the Oxford Renal Transplant Unit. The clinical details were recorded including date of transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, interval between transplant and melanoma, site of occurrence, history of sun exposure, type of clinician diagnosing the melanoma, history of other skin malignancies and outcome. From the histopathology we documented various prognostic factors. RESULTS: Ten patients developed 12 melanomas (one patient had three melanomas) from a population of 1874 transplanted patients. The total number of transplant years was 11 942. 2. The incidence of melanoma in our population was 12 per 11 942. 2 transplant years, which is approximately 8 times greater than the standardized rate for this region. We found that the mean interval between transplant and melanoma was approximately 11 years (median 8. 5). A dermatologist was the diagnosing clinician in at least 67 % of cases. Melanomas occurred on the trunk in the majority of cases (58 %), followed by the upper limb (25 %). All patients apart from one are alive with no recurrence of their melanoma. One patient {{died as a result of}} metastatic melanoma. The mean follow-up period following melanoma was 3. 7 years. In all patients apart from the patient who died, the melanomas were < 1 mm Breslow thickness. That patient's melanoma was 4. 5 mm thick. There was no precursor naevus in eight of the 12 melanomas. In two there was a precursor <b>dysplastic</b> <b>naevus.</b> In the cases in vertical growth phase the tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte response was absent in four cases and nonbrisk in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: In the Oxford transplant population studied melanomas occurred at approximately 8 times the rate in the general population. This is the highest rate reported in the literature. The patients had a better outcome than reported previously. This may be due to detection at a relatively early stage. Renal transplant recipients attend dedicated dermatology clinics in Oxford, which may have contributed to the early diagnosis and good outcome...|$|E
