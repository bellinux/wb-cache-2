25|$|If {{the court}} approves the petition, it orders a {{moratorium}} on the enforcement of most debts, which may be prolonged to up until six months. The court also appoints an administrator, who is tasked to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with the creditors. If the negotiations fail or the moratorium expires, normal debt <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings</b> may resume.|$|E
25|$|At most {{stages of}} the debt {{enforcement}} process, the law allows the debtor {{to stay the proceedings}} by settling his debts, coming to an accommodation with his debtors or requesting a court to examine the (continued) validity of the debtors' claims. Certain assets that are considered essential to the financial and physical survival of the debtor and his family are also exempt from all <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E

That request {{does not require}} any proof {{of the validity of}} the creditor's claim. The DCO will then serve a summons for payment (Zahlungsbefehl / commandement de payer) on the debtor.|$|E

25|$|A {{statutory}} debt {{restructuring agreement}} requires {{the consent of}} either {{a majority of the}} creditors representing two thirds of the sum of the claims, or a quarter of the creditors representing at least three quarters of the sum of the claims; in addition, it must be ratified by the court. It may be negotiated during a debt restructuring moratorium, as described above, or in the course of bankruptcy proceedings. Once concluded, it takes effect with respect to all creditors and sets an end to all ongoing debt <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{taxpayer}} Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that a taxpayer {{has a right to}} have the IRS explain why he or she is subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no threat of injury to the taxpayer, as the IRS had not yet initiated <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings</b> against him. In other words, the taxpayer was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, the taxpayer would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E
25|$|While union {{governance}} {{is founded}} upon freedom of association, {{the law requires}} basic standards democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations. Fundamentally, all unions are democratic organizations, but they divide between those where members elect delegates, who in turn choose the executive, and those where members directly elect the executive. In 1957, after the McClellan Committee of the US Senate found evidence of two rival Teamsters Union executives, Jimmy Hoffa and Dave Beck, falsifying delegate vote counts and stealing union funds, Congress passed the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. Under §411, every member {{has the right to}} vote, attend meetings, speak freely and organize, not have fees raised without a vote, not be deprived of the right to sue, or be suspended unjustly. Under §431, unions should file their constitutions and bylaws with the Secretary of Labor and be accessible by members: today union constitutions are online. Under §481 elections must occur at least every 5 years, and local officers every 3 years, by secret ballot. Additionally, state law may bar union officials who have prior convictions for felonies from holding office. As a response to the Hoffa and Beck scandals, there is also an express fiduciary duty on union officers for members' money, limits on loans to executives, requirements for bonds for handling money, and up to a $10,000 fine or up to 5 years prison for embezzlement. These rules, however, restated most of what was already the law, and codified principles of governance that unions already undertook. On the other hand, under §501(b) to bring a lawsuit, a union member must first make a demand on the executive to correct wrongdoing before any claim can be made to a court, even for misapplication of funds, and potentially wait four months' time. The Supreme Court has held that union members can intervene in <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings</b> brought by the US Department of Labor. Federal courts may review decisions by the Department to proceed with any prosecutions. The range of rights, and the level of enforcement has meant that labor unions display significantly higher standards of accountability, with fewer scandals, than corporations or financial institutions.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1969, Summers {{served on}} the board of {{directors}} of the Association for Union Democracy (AUD), a position he would not leave for almost four decades. He was also a member of the AUD Legal Review Committee, which helped decide which lawsuits the organization would participate in. Summers deeply influenced Supreme Court decisions several times. [...] He submitted the AUD's brief in Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1 (1973), in which the Supreme Court interpreted the Landrum-Griffin Act to permit the awarding of attorney's fees to successful plaintiffs. His arguments [...] "and the legitimacy his presence in the case lent to those arguments no doubt influenced the outcome of this case..." [...] He participated in two landmark Landrum-Griffin decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528 (1972) (which upheld the right of union members to intervene in <b>enforcement</b> <b>proceedings</b> brought by the United States Department of Labor) and Dunlop v. Bachowski, 421 U.S. 560 (1975) (which upheld the authority of federal courts to review the Department of Labor's decision to proceed or not proceed with prosecutions under Landrum-Griffin). Indeed, he wrote most of the legal brief in Trbovich. Due to his work with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), he later was asked to draft new constitutions for many UMWA locals as well as the international union. He also testified in a federal RICO prosecution against Teamsters Local 506, a favorable decision which eventually led to the establishment of federal trusteeship over the entire international union in 1989.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{introduction}} and {{overview of the}} international aspects of Japanese insolvency law. There are three international dimensions to Japan's insolvency law: jurisdiction of Japanese courts; the status of foreign claimants; and recognition and <b>enforcement</b> of foreign <b>proceedings.</b> These dimensions are characterized by a distinctly territorial approach. This inward-looking way of handling insolvency cases is incongruous with developments in the comparative and international law context. It is also at odds with broader globalization trends, {{some of which are}} evident in Japan's economic crisis. Analogies to international trade law are useful: the post-Uruguay Round dispute resolution mechanism has insights for the problem of jurisdiction; the famous national treatment principle is a basis for critiquing the status foreign claimants have in Japanese insolvency proceedings; and trade negotiations might be a model for expanding recognition and <b>enforcement</b> of foreign <b>proceedings.</b> As a corollary, the relationship between the extant insolvency regime and Japanese banks?many of which are internationally active?is explored. Problem banks {{are at the heart of}} the economic crisis. Yet, the insolvency law regime has not been applied to failed or failing banks, partly on grounds of the systemic risk that would be triggered by a stay of creditor proceedings. The reluctance to use the regime in bank cases is open to question on a number of grounds. Similarly, the failure to develop a harmonized set of international bank bankruptcy rules to avoid BCCI-type liquidation problems is addressed, and a proposal for proceeding in this direction is offered. ...|$|R
