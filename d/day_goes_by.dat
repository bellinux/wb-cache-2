5|$|In 2004, Trenyce {{began to}} focus on theatre, playing roles in the plays Not a <b>Day</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>By,</b> The Vagina Monologues, Soul Kittens Cabaret and Mama's Sweet Potato Pie. In 2006, she played the lead role of Deena Jones in an Indianapolis {{production}} of the musical Dreamgirls. She made her film debut in 2008 and became the first American Idol contestant to headline a show in Las Vegas. She originated the role of Portia in David E. Talbert's play Love in the Nick of Tyme. Trenyce performed in a 2009 North American tour of the musical Ain't Misbehavin'.|$|E

England lost the match on a penalty shoot-out, after the score had been tied at 1–1 following extra time. Robson said afterwards, [...] "ot a <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> <b>by</b> when [...] does not think about the semi-final and other choices [...] might have made." [...] Robson remains only the second coach, after Alf Ramsey, to take England to a World Cup semi-final, and the only coach to do so on foreign soil.|$|E
500|$|Trenyce's work in theatre {{has mostly}} focused on [...] "various {{entertainment}} aspects of African-American interest". In 2004, {{she made her}} theatre debut as Yancey in a North American tour of Not a <b>Day</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>By,</b> a play with songs adapted from the E. Lynn Harris' 2000 novel of the same name. The tour ran from January to May 2004. Jet magazine wrote that Trenyce [...] "breathes life and voice into Yancey", describing her {{as one of the}} show's [...] "rich vocal talents". The Chicago Defender felt that Trenyce displayed a [...] "theatrical perception as she interprets a character". She soon performed in the play The Vagina Monologues. In 2005, she played in two Nicci Gillbert stage productions: Soul Kittens Cabaret and Mama's Sweet Potato Pie, participating in a North American tour of the latter. Trenyce's performance as the wife in Mama's Sweet Potato Pie was praised by Call and Post's Chris Bournea. The same year, she made a cameo appearance in the comedy film Beauty Shop, and performed on the BET reality television series College Hill.|$|E

500|$|Mantle is {{best known}} for his long stint as general surgeon Dr Mike Barratt in 85 episodes of the TV series Casualty from October 1992 to November 1996, and 32 episodes of Holby City between 1999 and 2001. He {{previously}} appeared in Casualty as the brother of a patient in 1988. Mantle received much acclaim for his role and was one of the show's most popular characters. He was praised for being entirely convincing as a hospital consultant and very dominant and authoritative in his role, [...] "shouting orders in incomprehensible hospital-speak." [...] Daily Mirror described him as a [...] "heart-throb consultant" [...] and said that the role brought him [...] "an army of female fans". A 2001 poll by the Scottish Sunday Mail voted him 7th on a list of Top [...] "10 heart-throb docs on the box" [...] in a list which included the likes of George Clooney and Goran Višnjić. Mantle has said that during his role as the doctor he received a lot of fan mail, some of which were medically related and asking for his advice, believing him to be a real doctor, but professed that he couldn't even stand the sight of real blood. He has said, [...] "It's funny because people always treat me like a doctor. Not a <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> <b>by</b> without someone coming up to me and asking me for advice." [...] In 1996, he turned down an offer of £250,000 to continue playing the character, and last appeared in Casualty in November 1996. He said of his departure: ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2015, {{the song}} [...] "Help Is Coming" [...] from the Afterglow album, was {{released}} as a download and limited edition 7" [...] single {{to raise money}} for the charity Save the Children. The B-side, [...] "Anthem", was a previously unreleased track that was initially recorded in 1995, with the final vocal added in 2015. [...] The money will be used to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene for refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Neil Finn said of [...] "Help Is Coming"..."It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time I was thinking about the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families. There is such a huge scale and urgency to the current refugee crises that barely a <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> <b>by</b> without some crushing image or news account to confront us.

2500|$|During the {{off-season}} between the 1961 and 1962 seasons, Boros {{returned to the}} University of Michigan seeking to complete the required coursework for his bachelor's degree. Joe Falls quipped that Boros [...] "has learned that hitting the books is one thing; hitting an inside fastball is another." [...] The Associated Press also published a feature story about Boros' studious nature in March 1962. The article noted that Boros was studying contemporary literature in {{the off-season}} and hoped to become a professor of literature. The article added: [...] "Hardly a <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> <b>by</b> when Boros isn't carrying two or three books under his arms. He reads in hotel rooms, on planes and on trains." [...] Boros recalled {{that some of his}} minor league coaches had opposed his reading, claiming it was bad for his eyes. As for ribbing by his fellow player, he noted that Detroit pitcher Paul Foytack replied to a good fielding play by Boros by yelling, [...] "Atta boy, Steve. Just for that I'll buy you a book." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just my sentiments, sir. But I don't know: it's likely {{we may be}} wrong. There's {{nothing against}} John Jago, except that he is so odd in his ways. They do say he wears all that nasty hair on his face (I hate hair on a man's face) on account of a vow he made when he lost his wife. Don't you think, Mr. Lefrank, a man must be a little mad who shows his grief at losing his wife by vowing that he will never shave himself again? Well, that's what they do say John Jago vowed. Perhaps it's a lie. People are such liars here! Anyway, it's truth (the boys {{themselves}} confess that), when John came to the farm, he came with a first-rate character. The old father here isn't easy to please; and he pleased the old father. Yes, that's so. Mr. Meadowcroft don't like my countrymen in general. He's like his sons--English, bitter English, to the marrow of his bones. Somehow, in spite of that, John Jago got round him; maybe because John does certainly know his business. Oh yes! Cattle and crops, John knows his business. Since he's been overlooker, things have prospered as they didn't prosper {{in the time of}} the boys. Ambrose owned as much to me himself. Still, sir, it's hard to be set aside for a stranger; isn't it? John gives the orders now. The boys do their work; but they have no voice in it when John and the old man put their heads together over the business of the farm. I have been long in telling you of it, sir, but now you know how the envy and the hatred grew among the men before my time. Since I have been here, things seem to get worse and worse. There's hardly a <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> <b>by</b> that hard words don't pass between the boys and John, or the boys and their father. The old man has an aggravating way, Mr. Lefrank--a nasty way, as we do call it--of taking John Jago's part. Do speak to him about it when you get the chance. The main blame of the quarrel between Silas and John the other day lies at his door, as I think. I don't want to excuse Silas, either. It was brutal of him--though he is Ambrose's brother--to strike John, who is the smaller and weaker man of the two. But it was worse than brutal in John, sir, to out with his knife and try to stab Silas. Oh, he did it! If Silas had not caught the knife in his hand (his hand's awfully cut, I can tell you; I dressed it myself), it might have ended, for anything I know, in murder--" ...|$|E
60|$|Adventures {{like this}} are among the bitter {{memories}} of the angler. The fish that break away are monstrous animals; imagination increases their bulk, and fond desire paints them clean-run and bright as silver. There are other chances of the angler's life scarcely less sad than this. When a hook breaks just as the salmon was losing strength, was ceasing to struggle, and beginning to sway with the mere force of the stream, and to show his shining sides--when a hook breaks at such a moment, {{it is very hard}} to bear. The oath of Ernulphus seems all too weak to express the feelings of the sportsman and his wrath against the wretched tackle-maker. Again, when the fish is actually conquered; when he is being towed gently into some little harbour among the tall slim water- grasses, or into a pebbly cove, or up to a green bank; when the bitterness of struggle is past, and he seems resigned and almost happy; when at this crisis the clumsy gilly with the gaff scratches him, rouses him to a last exertion, and entangles the line, so that the salmon breaks free--that is an experience to which language cannot do justice. The ancient painter drew his veil over the face of Agamemnon present at his daughter's sacrifice. Silence and sympathy are all one can offer to the angler who has toiled all day, and in this wise caught nothing. There is yet another very bitter sorrow. It is a hard thing for a man to leave town and hurry to a river in the west, a river that perhaps he has known since he fished for minnows with a bent pin in happy childhood. The west is not a dry land; effeminate tourists complain that the rain it raineth every day. But the heavy soft rain is the very life of an angler. It keeps the stream of that clear brown hue, between porter and amber, which he loves; and it encourages the salmon to keep rushing from the estuary and the sea right up to the mountain loch, where they rest. But suppose there is a dry summer--and such things have been even in Argyleshire. The heart of the tourist is glad within him, but as the river shrinks and shrinks, a silver thread among slimy green mosses in the streams, a sheet of clear water in the pools, the angler repines. Day after sultry <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> <b>by,</b> and there is no hope. There is a cloud on the distant hill; it is only the smoke from some moor that has caught fire. The river grows so transparent that it is easy to watch the lazy fish sulking at the bottom. Then comes a terrible temptation. Men, men calling themselves sportsmen, have been known to fish in the innocent dewy morning, with worm, with black lob worm. Worse remains behind. Persons of ungoverned passions, maddened by the sight of the fish, are believed to have poached with rake-hooks, a cruel apparatus made of three hooks fastened back to back and loaded with lead. These are thrown over the fish, and then struck into him with a jerk. But the mind willingly turns away from the contemplation of such actions.|$|E
