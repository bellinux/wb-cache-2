500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] finished 24th in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 13.5, equivalent to approximately 12.6 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, ultimately saying the episode began the Simpsons fourth season in an amazing way. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, had mixed views about the episode. They said that it is [...] "A bit baffling to non-Americans unfamiliar with the summer camp system. But top grade stuff nonetheless. Anyone who's worked as a counsellor <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> can testify to this episode's authenticity." [...] The episode's reference to Ben-Hur was named the 31st greatest film reference {{in the history of the}} show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{finds an}} Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency {{operative}} named Skip (Vince Colosimo) {{and that he}} is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people.|$|E
