5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy <b>formulation</b> <b>process.</b> Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of nanoparticle formulation methods are based on nano-emulsion templates, which in turn are generated in various ways. It must therefore {{be taken into account}} that active principles and drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles can potentially be affected by these nano-emulsion <b>formulation</b> <b>processes.</b> Such potential differences may include drug sensitivity to temperature, high-shear devices, or even contact with organic solvents. Likewise, nano-emulsion <b>formulation</b> <b>processes</b> must be chosen in function of the selected therapeutic goals of the nano-carrier suspension and its administration route. This requires the nanoparticle <b>formulation</b> <b>processes</b> (and thus the nano-emulsion formation methods) to be more adapted {{to the nature of the}} encapsulated drugs, as well as to the chosen route of administration. Offering a comprehensive review, this paper proposes a link between nano-emulsion formulation methods and nanoparticle generation, while at the same time bearing in mind the above-mentioned parameters for active molecule encapsulation. The first part will deal with the nano-emulsion template through the different formulation methods, i. e. high energy methods on the one hand, and low-energy ones (essentially spontaneous emulsification and the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method) on the other. This will be followed by a review of the different families of nanoparticles (i. e. polymeric or lipid nanospheres and nanocapsules) highlighting the links (or potential links) between these nanoparticles and the different nano-emulsion formulation methods upon which they are based...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we propose}} an organic solvent-free, {{one-step}} mechanochemistry approach to engineer water-dispersible graphene oxide/superparamagnetic iron oxide (GO/SPIOs) hybrids, for biomedical applications. Although mechanochemistry {{has been proposed}} in the graphene field for applications such as drug loading, exfoliation or polymer-composite formation, {{this is the first}} study to report mechanochemistry for preparation of GO/ SPIOs hybrids. The statistical design of experiment (DoE) was employed to control the process parameters. DoE has been used to control <b>formulation</b> <b>processes</b> of other types of nanomaterials. The implementation of DoE for controlling the <b>formulation</b> <b>processes</b> of graphene-based nanomaterials is, however, novel. DoE approach could be of advantage as one can tailor GO-based hybrids of predicted yields and compositions. Hybrids were characterized by TEM, AFM FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, and TGA. The dose−response magnetic resonance (MR) properties were confirmed by MR imaging of phantoms. The biocompatibility of the hybrids with A 549 and J 774 cell lines was confirmed by the modified LDH assay...|$|R

In the later stages, lead drug substance and drug product formulations are evaluated for freeze-thaw stability to verify the formulation robustness.

40|$|Purpose - Today, {{industrial}} firms need to {{cope with}} competitive challenges related to innovation, dynamic responses, knowledge sharing, etc. by means of effective and dynamic strategy formulation. In light of these challenges, {{the purpose of the}} paper is to present and evaluate an assessment tool for strategy <b>formulation</b> <b>processes</b> that ensures high quality in process and outcome. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review was conducted to identify success criteria for strategy <b>formulation</b> <b>processes.</b> Then, a simple questionnaire and assessment tool was developed and used to test the validity of the success criteria through face-to-face interviews with 46 managers, workshops involving 40 managers, and two in-depth case studies. The success criteria have been slightly modified due to the empirical results, to yield the assessment tool. Findings - The resulting assessment tool integrates three generic approaches to strategy assessment, namely the goal-centred, comparative and improvement approaches, as found in the literature. Furthermore, it encompasses three phases of strategy formulation processes: strategic thinking, strategic planning and embedding of strategy. The tool reflects that the different approaches to assessment are relevant in all phases of strategy formulation, but weighted differently. Managerial perceptions expressed in particular that learning from experience should be accommodated in strategic thinking. The strategic planning stage is mainly assessed based on the goal-centred approach, but cases and managerial perceptions indicate that the need for accurate and detailed plans might be overrated in the literature, as implementation relies heavily on continuous improvement and empowerment. Concerning embedding, key aspects relate both to the goal-centred and improvement approaches, while the comparative approach appears to play a more modest role, related to monitoring external changes and enabling the organization to respond adaptively. Research limitations/implications - The proposed assessment tool is general {{in the sense that it}} does not take into account relationships between the strategic context and the assessment of strategy <b>formulation</b> <b>processes.</b> The investigated cases indicate that contingencies matter, and call for further investigation of particular applications. The present research maintained a focus on formal and relatively top-down-oriented strategy <b>formulation</b> <b>processes.</b> Practical implications - The integration of three different strategy assessment approaches has been made to obtain a holistic, multi-perspective reflection on strategy formulation. Such reflection is assumed to enable managers to proactively evaluate the potential outcome and performance of their chosen strategy. Originality/value - The originality of the paper lies in the combination and compilation of multiple approaches to strategy assessment, which draws on a wide range of literature, and in the proactive perspective on strategy assessment. Furthermore, the validity of the proposed assessment tool or checklist is based on multiple sources of empirical evidence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
