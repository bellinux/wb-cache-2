50|$|Graff-Kittanning Clay Products Company was {{incorporated}} in 1924, and construction was begun at the Craigsville site in that year. In 1925 production was started and has continued without interruption until the present date. In 1945 the Worthington Ceramics Division was acquired as a totally-owned subsidiary and {{was put into}} production shortly thereafter. In 1958, the Logan Clay Products Company of Logan, Ohio, purchased the Graff Kittanning Clay Products Company, and from that date on it {{was known as the}} Graff-Kittanning Division of the Logan Clay Products Company. R. M. Graff was president of Graff-Kittanning from the time of its incorporation until it was purchased by the Logan Clay Products Company. He was also General Manager of the operations from 1924 until his death in 1963. The following products are manufactured at the Craigsville plant: vitrified clay sewer pipe, clay flue liners, wall coping, and factory made joints. At the Worthington Ceramics Plant, clay building tile, drain tile, and <b>flue</b> <b>lining</b> are manufactured. A total of approximately two hundred people were employed at both operations, approximately one hundred fifty at the Graff-Kittanning Plant and fifty at Worthington Ceramics Plant. The products manufactured in both plants was distributed in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.|$|E

30|$|Bagasse fly ash (BFA) {{is a waste}} {{collected}} from the particulate separation equipment attached to the <b>flue</b> gas <b>line</b> of the sugarcane bagasse-fired boilers and {{has been used as}} an effective adsorbent for the removal of dyes. This is available in plenty, and almost free of cost from the sugar mills. In addition, bagasse fly ash generated in the sugar industry does not contain large amounts of toxic metals and hence, Mall et al. (2005) used bagasse fly ash (BFA) as adsorbent for the removal of MG from aqueous solutions. Maximum adsorption capacity for MG was reported as 170.33  mg/g (at pH 7.0 and adsorbent dosage of 1.0  g/L) and within 240  min of contact time.|$|R
50|$|All were {{superheated}} {{from the}} outset. The 36 class in original form had a round-top boiler {{rather than the}} Belpaire type. In the early to mid-1950s, {{the majority of the}} class were rebuilt with new, all-steel Belpaire boilers and re-designed cabs. Typical of the technology of the day, the riveted steel boilers originally fitted to the class had copper inner fireboxes, fire-tubes and superheater flues. The replacement Belpaire boilers had steel fireboxes, tubes and <b>flues,</b> in <b>line</b> with US practice and later NSWGR policy. Although copper provides superior heat transfer, it promotes a galvanic reaction resulting in the 'wasting' by corrosion of some steel boiler components such as crown stays and front tubeplates.|$|R

40|$|Optimizing the {{operating}} parameters to minimize polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDD/F) emission {{is the common}} interest of the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration industry. In this study, we investigated the distribution of tetra- to octa-CDD/F along the <b>flue</b> gas <b>line</b> in a full-scale reciprocating grate incinerator and evaluated the effects of temperature control and O- 2 level on PCDD/F formation. Six runs were laid out and all performed under sufficient burning conditions, in which the combustion efficiency of MSW was more than 99. 9 %. The total concentration of tetra- to octa-CDD/F measured at the boiler outlet showed an increasing tendency {{with the increase of}} boiler outlet temperature (TB) from 214 degrees C to 264 degrees C. When flue gas ran across the semi-dry scrubber and cyclone precipitator, in which the temperature varied from 264 degrees C to 162 degrees C, the concentrations of the lower chlorinated dioxins and furans were significantly raised, especially for the TCDF. Increasing 02 supply from 6. 0 % to 10. 5 % essentially led to a higher yield of tetra- to octa-PCDD/F, suggested that under sufficient burning conditions the lower O- 2 level was favorable for reducing PCDD/F formation and emission. The variation of O- 2 level did not give rise to a systematical change of PCDD/F homologue pattern. For all measurements, the isomer distributions of tetra- to hepta-PCDD/F were more or less the same, nearly independent of variations in {{the operating}} conditions and sampling positions. Only the significant increase of the sum of 1, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF and 1, 3, 7, 9 -TCDF was found in the zone after the boiler section. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This work {{analyzed}} the environmental compatibility of a biomass plant to be constructed to produce both {{electricity and heat}} (bioenergy) {{in a small town}} in Piedmont (northern Italy). In order to study both the critical local impacts (with specific reference to air quality) and the overall environmental benefit (decrease of GHG generation), we evaluated the emissive flow modifications for the hypothesis of activating the biomass plant in the municipal area, by considering introduced and eliminated pollutant loads. This analysis included a consideration of the non-energy-related emissions ("ground value") currently operating in the area. After carefully analyzing the major operational characteristics of the proposed plant and the principal characteristics of the surrounding territory and its energy needs, the evaluation was conducted using the tools of mass and energy balances, and an external costs methodology was also applied in order to define the social cost of the plant. In addition, the plant′s potential modification to local air quality was evaluated by considering the meteorological and physical characteristics of the considered area, using a pollutant dispersion model. Several different configurations for the <b>flue</b> gas purification <b>line</b> were also considered, so that the evaluation of the costs and benefits was based on the analysis of both industrial and external costs. The conclusions, while based only on the specific studied case, can be considered to be fairly representative in general as a methodological approach for studying the effects of the implementation of biomass energy plant...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrofit}} project {{related to}} an Al 2 O 3 calcination <b>flue</b> gas treatment <b>line,</b> consisting in the installation of a fabric filter downstream an existing electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was the object of this study. In this case, {{the replacement of the}} existing exhaust fan with a more performing one would have been potentially exposed the existing precipitator to suction conditions that did not fall within the process conditions considered when the ESP was designed. In other words, performing a detailed safety analysis focused on the interface between new and existing plants it was highlighted a possible risk of implosion that would not be easily found by following the most common classical approaches as the historical analysis or an HAZOP limited to the new equipments. This hazard would not have been easily reduced by installing reinforcements due to the difficulty (both technical and economical) to modify such existing equipment. The chosen approach was to face the problem analogously to the protection of a vessel from overpressure, that means to size a direct action PSV (counterweight actuated), which opens when a given differential pressure (with opposite sign with respect to the traditional PSV design) is reached. The risk thus determined was translated in terms of a worst case scenario, on the basis of which the design of safeguards has been carried out. In particular, this scenario was identified considering that all the pressure drops are concentrated upstream the equipment to protect, exposing the filter to maximum suction levels. The presence of a fabric filter bypass duct, allowing direct communication between fan and ESP, the complete obstruction of a duct upstream of it and the fan running at full rotational speed were the main hypotheses constituting the worst case scenario. Design choices were verified and validated through a computational fluid-dynamics analysis, evidencing that CFD can be a powerful and useful tool to address safety design issues, allowing to numerically test safeguards actions and consequently evaluating the impact that design choices would have for the purposes of risk reduction and mitigation...|$|R
40|$|A High Performance Power System (HIPPS) {{is being}} developed. This {{system is a}} coal-fired, {{combined}} cycle plant with indirect heating of gas turbine air. Foster Wheeler Development Corporation and a team consisting of Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation, Bechtel Corporation, University of Tennessee Space Institute and Westinghouse Electric Corporation are developing this system. In Phase 1 of the project, a conceptual design of a commercial plant was developed. Technical and economic analyses indicated that the plant would meet {{the goals of the}} project which include a 47 percent efficiency (HHV) and a 10 percent lower cost of electricity than an equivalent size PC plant. The concept uses a pyrolyzation process to convert coal into fuel gas and char. The char is fired in a High Temperature Advanced Furnace (HITAF). The HITAF is a pulverized fuel-fired boiler/air heater where steam is generated and gas turbine air is indirectly heated. The fuel gas generated in the pyrolyzer is then used to heat the gas turbine air further before it enters the gas turbine. The project is currently in Phase 2, which includes engineering analysis, laboratory testing and pilot plant testing. Research and development is being done on the HIPPS systems that are not commercial or being developed on other projects. Pilot plant testing of the pyrolyzer subsystem and the char combustion subsystem are being done separately, and after each experimental program has been completed, a larger scale pyrolyzer will be tested at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, Al. The facility is equipped with a gas turbine and a topping combustor, and as such, will provide an opportunity to evaluate integrated pyrolyzer and turbine operation. The design of the char burner was completed during this quarter. The burner is designed for arch-firing and has a maximum capacity of 30 MMBtu/hr. This size represents a half scale version of a typical commercial burner. The burner is outfitted with nozzles for separate injection of char, coal, and limestone. Burner performance will be rated according to three criteria, carbon conversion efficiency, NOx generation, and flame stability. If initial testing in the arch configuration proves successful, further tests will be performed in the wall-fired arrangement. A complete set of process and instrumentation drawings (P/ID's) were completed for the Combustion and Environmental Test Facility (CETF) this quarter. These drawings established an ISA approved instrument tagging structure, and provided a coherent database {{for the development of a}} data acquisition system. The data acquisition system polls tag information (value, range, engineering units, etc.) from the distributed control system (DCS) highway, and provides a platform for data reduction. The quadrupole mass spectrometer, used during the pyrolyzer tests performed at the pilot plant in Livingston, N. J., has been redesigned for use at the CETF. The mass spectrometer is designed to provide on-line gas analysis by identifying all of the chemical components within the secondary air <b>line,</b> the <b>flue</b> gas recycle <b>line,</b> and the furnace exit ducting. The construction effort at the CETF continued this quarter with the completion of the char storage system, reheat burner, flue gas recycle piping, and the pulverized coal feed system...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{combustion}} control systems for multiburner installations which rely on monitoring the average C 02 and/or 02 {{content of the}} gases {{have a number of}} inherent limitations on their ability to maintain efficient plant operation. Air infiltration'into the <b>flue</b> or sampling <b>lines</b> has the same effect as an instrumental error in causing the control system to adjust the stoichiometry to an incorrect level. Even' when the overall stoichiometry of the furnace is correctly and accurately controlled it is still extremely difficult to ensure that no individual burners are operating inefficiently due to local maldistributions of air or fuel, or to poor nozzle spray characteristics. The potential for fuel savings and for'improved limitation of pollutant emissions has provided strong incentive for the development of individual burner fuel/air ratio control systems which would eliminate the shortcomings associated with the global control method. The present report first reviews past attempts to identify some unique property of an individual flame which can be reliably interpreted as an indicator of the flame behavior over a wide range of operating conditions [...] Information potentially usable in this manner could be contained in the acoustic characteristics of the flame, in the local distribution of key chemical species, or in the electromagnetic radiation or absorption behavior of regions of the flame. For many reasons the previous studies have tended to concentrate on the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, with particular emphasis on emission from flames over much of the ultraviolet (u. v.), visible and infrared (i. r.) wavelength regions. A brief review is given of the pioneering work of Penzias and his associates, and of the later work carried out at Sheffield University by Smith which {{led to the development of}} the LandTM control system. All of these studies dealt with the infrared emission from flames, wilth particular emphasis on the CO 2 barnd at 4. 3 pm, and on the H 0 /CO 2 binds near 2. 8 m. The report then addresses the experimental work carried out at M. I. T under the sponsorship of five utility companies supporting the M. I. T. Energy Laboratory Electric Power Program. This focused initially on attempts to use a Land control system in the Combustion Research Facility (CRF), with limited success in terms of achieving stability and adequacy of control when operating conditions were varied over a moderate range. The experiments in the CRF also yielded very useful data on the intensities and sources of u. v. emission from No. 6 fuel oil flames over a wide range of fuel equivalence ratio. One other set of experiments carried out in the CRF made use of equipment and personnel supplied by the Foxboro Company, and results of this work are discussed. Also included in the report is a summary of measurements carried out on a small methane-fueled burner which add appreciably to the available information on the dependence of the infrared emission on viewing location relative to the flame front and on fuel equivalence ratio. The overall results obtained under this program do not leave the prospect of individual fuel/air ratio controllers within immediate grasp, but they substantially advance the state of knowledge required for attainment of such control. They give a strong indication that satisfactory control could be obtained over a wide range of furnace operating conditions if both i. r. and u. v. signals were monitored and used in the control system.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the fact that thermal power plants are {{responsible}} for the 1 / 3 of the anthropogenic CO 2 emitted to the atmosphere, it is argued that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies will contribute drastically to the reduction of the Greenhouse effect. This reality justifies the intensive research activity towards the CO 2 abatement from thermoelectric power units in order to achieve feasible technical and economic solutions. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of a power plant representative to the Greek electricity production industry fired with low quality lignite. The gross power output of a typical Greek lignite power plant lies within the range of 300 - 350 MWel. Taking into account that the application of CCS technologies results in the considerable reduction of the net power output of the unit, the size of the unit under investigation is 380 MWel gross, while the fuel chosen is the lignite extracted from the region of Florina. In order to estimate the performance parameters of the thermal power plants, the GateCycle software is used which is developed by General Electric. In the context of this thesis, the basic design characteristics of the CCS units are determined. In addition, the optimization of the thermodynamic design as well as the economic feasibility study is included. The application of the oxy-fuel technology is examined in the 3 rd chapter of the thesis. Specifically, this chapter includes the basic technical characteristics of the steam boiler, the <b>flue</b> gas treatment <b>line,</b> the air separation unit and the CO 2 purification and compression system. Primarily, the power plant performance is assessed without any efficiency optimization options being investigated. However, a large amount of heat produced from the air separation and flue gas treatment processes, is rejected to the cooling water. The exploitation of this low quality heat results in the significant reduction of the efficiency penalty implied by the application of the oxy-fuel CO 2 abatement technology. Finally, the thermodynamic design that maximizes the plant’s net efficiency is proposed. In the 4 th chapter the CO 2 chemical absorption from the flue gas with amines is evaluated. The CO 2 removal equipment consists mainly of the absorption column and the amine solution regeneration column. The technical characteristics of the equipment are presented. Importance has been placed on the examination of the requirements regarding the SOx and NO 2 concentration of the flue gas at the inlet of the absorber. Given that the amine will react preferentially with more acidic gases than CO 2 such as SO 2 and NO 2 to form more stable salts that cannot be broken down in the stripper, the concentration in the flue gas should be very low. Additionally, the technical options concerning the integration of low quality heat that is rejected to the cooling water are investigated. Finally the process integration that results in the optimal power plant performance is proposed. The conclusions that emerge from this thesis concern the performance of the steam generators, the specific heat consumption of the steam turbine as well as the net electrical efficiency of the power plant which integrate the CO 2 control technologies. The optimum plant design which maximizes the thermodynamic performance is proposed taking {{into account the}} CO 2 capture equipment requirements. As far as the economic viability is concerned, emphasis is placed on the economic remarks specific to the CO 2 control technologies application. ...|$|R
