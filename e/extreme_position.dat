To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> or opposed northern interests.|$|E

He produced an article for a January 1933 issue of the Negro Worker, and then another for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans, with figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki being far less radical in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments {{that he was able to}} express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself.|$|E

[...] Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional. [...] Theoretical laws would be reduced to empirical laws, while theoretical terms would garner meaning from observational terms via correspondence rules. [...] Mathematics in physics would reduce to symbolic logic via logicism, while rational reconstruction would convert ordinary language into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a logical syntax. [...] A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a logical calculus or empirical operation could verify its falsity or truth.|$|E
500|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on the issue of Philip's Christianity. Timothy Barnes, who reviewed Shahîd's chapters on [...] "The First Christian Emperor" [...] and [...] "Eusebius and the Arabs" [...] in 1979, would only say that Eusebius [...] " [...] Philip as a Christian", in his Constantine and Eusebius (1981). Warwick Ball, author of Rome and the East: The transformation of an empire (2000), argued in favor of Philip's Christianity. David Potter, author of The Roman Empire at Bay (2004), treated the matter dismissively: accounts of Philip's Christianity were simply [...] "bogus", Potter wrote, and works that accepted them should be treated with less respect on that count alone. Some scholars, like Glen Bowersock, took a middle route. Bowersock, reviewing Shahîd's Rome and the Arabs for the Classical Review in 1986, wrote: [...] "I doubt many will be convinced by the <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> that [...] has taken, but his arguments do offer some basis for believing that Philip was seriously interested in the religion".

2500|$|Different {{degrees of}} {{emphasis}} on this method or theory lead {{to a range of}} rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position [...] "that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge" [...] to the more <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> that reason is [...] "the unique path to knowledge". Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, rationalism is identical to philosophy, the Socratic life of inquiry, or the zetetic (skeptical) clear interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty). In recent decades, Leo Strauss sought to revive [...] "Classical Political Rationalism" [...] as a discipline that understands the task of reasoning, not as foundational, but as maieutic.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{influence}} of this work (and the ideas of Georg Gottfried Gervinus, according to whom [...] "the highest natural object of musical imitation is emotion, and the method of imitating emotion is to mimic speech"), Mussorgsky in 1868 rapidly set the first eleven scenes of Nikolai Gogol's The Marriage (Zhenitba), with his priority being to render into music the natural accents and patterns of the play's naturalistic and deliberately humdrum dialogue. This work marked an <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> in Mussorgsky's pursuit of naturalistic word-setting: he abandoned it unorchestrated after reaching {{the end of his}} 'Act 1', and though its characteristically 'Mussorgskyian' declamation is to be heard in all his later vocal music, the naturalistic mode of vocal writing more and more became merely one expressive element among many.|$|E

2500|$|Chomsky {{argued that}} the notions [...] "grammatical" [...] and [...] "ungrammatical" [...] could be defined in a {{meaningful}} and useful way. In contrast, an extreme behaviorist linguist would argue that language can only be studied through recordings or transcriptions of actual speech, {{the role of the}} linguist being to look for patterns in such observed speech, but not to hypothesize about why such patterns might occur, nor to label particular utterances as either [...] "grammatical" [...] or [...] "ungrammatical". Although few linguists in the 1950s actually took such an <b>extreme</b> <b>position,</b> Chomsky was at an opposite extreme, defining grammaticality in an unusually mentalistic way (for the time). He {{argued that the}} intuition of a native speaker is enough to define the grammaticalness of a sentence; that is, if a particular string of English words elicits a double take, or feeling of wrongness in a native English speaker, and when various extraneous factors affecting intuitions are controlled for, {{it can be said that}} the string of words is ungrammatical. This, according to Chomsky, is entirely distinct from the question of whether a sentence is meaningful, or can be understood. It is possible for a sentence to be both grammatical and meaningless, as in Chomsky's famous example [...] "colorless green ideas sleep furiously". But such sentences manifest a linguistic problem distinct from that posed by meaningful but ungrammatical (non)-sentences such as [...] "man the bit sandwich the," [...] the meaning of which is fairly clear, but no native speaker would accept as well formed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1680 a {{more extreme}} mood {{appeared}} among {{sections of the}} Covenanter underground, which found expression in a document known as the Sanquhar Declaration. [...] This was the manifesto of the followers of the Reverend Richard Cameron, soon {{to be known as}} the Cameronians. Hitherto, many in the Covenanter underground maintained an outward loyalty to the king, despite their opposition to the religious policy of his government; but the Cameronians took matters to a new height, renouncing their allegiance to Charles and denouncing his brother, James, as a papist. One <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> inevitably led to another: the government in attempting to stamp out sedition authorized field executions without trial. This was the beginning of what Robert Wodrow later called the Killing Time. Cameron himself was killed in a clash with government forces at Airds Moss in July 1680, but his followers, now a tiny part of the Covenanter movement, continued to exist. After the accession of James VII in 1685 the King issued a series of Letters of Indulgence allowing such [...] "ousted ministers as had lived peaceably and orderly to return to their livings". This succeeded in luring many ministers away from the struggle, but those remaining became more determined. When William of Orange summoned a Convention of the Estates which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh to consider whether Scotland should recognise him or James, forces of Cameronians arrived to bolster William's support. In the subsequent Jacobite rising, the Cameronian Guard helped to defeat the Jacobite Highlanders, particularly at the Battle of Dunkeld. Although the Cameronians had helped to defend the Revolution, they were disappointed that their religious views were not adopted by the new government. The binding obligation of the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) was passed over since the acts of parliament in favour of these had been rescinded by Charles and were not revived under William and Mary. For some Covenanters even William of Orange was an [...] "uncovenanted" [...] King since he was head of the Church of England which was an episcopal church. Perhaps 1000 people in the south west made an issue of the failure to maintain the covenants and also, with some justification, viewed the new establishment as tainted by Erastianism. They formed the United Societies refusing to recognise the [...] "usurped" [...] Church of Scotland.|$|E

Godley Buzard, the feminist novelist, had been the guest of some member to lunch, and the occasion was too provocative for any one about Dover's fireplace to avoid the topic. Buzard's presence, perhaps, drove Dover into an <b>extreme</b> <b>position</b> on the other side; he forgot Trafford's new-wedded condition, and handled this great argument, an argument which has scarcely progressed since its beginning in the days of Plato and Aristophanes, with the freedoms of an ancient Greek and the explicitness of a modern scientific man.|$|E
