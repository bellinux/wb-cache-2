5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, {{and over the}} fences of the mansion) so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although {{this may have been}} justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
500|$|Frank Sinatra {{stopped his}} car. The light was red. Pedestrians passed quickly across his {{windshield}} but, as usual, one did not. It {{was a girl}} in her twenties. She remained at the curb staring at him. Through {{the corner of his}} left eye <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> and he knew, because it happens almost every day, that she was thinking, It looks like him, but is it? ...|$|E
60|$|She started erect, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{pale face}} glow with joy.|$|E
60|$|Again {{she leaned}} towards {{him so that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "She kept wiping {{down the}} counter in front of ’im over an’ over agin, an’ <b>’e</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>’er</b> staring at ’is wrists as though she could ’ardly believe her eyes. Then she {{went back into the}} parlour, and Ginger ’eard her whispering, and by and by she came out agin with the blue-eyed barmaid.|$|R
60|$|It was Elizabeth's voice. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> {{framed in}} the doorway.|$|R
60|$|There {{was light}} on the drive. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face. Her eyes were troubled.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{had crossed}} over and was {{standing}} where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face illumined by the lamplight.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} him that when night fell black <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> white face so much more plainly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>her</b> {{mind was}} not clear. The perplexity was strong in her good-natured face. So he waited.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{approached}} him; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> lying {{with his}} face turned up to the night sky.|$|R
6000|$|He {{glanced up}} again at Lady Harman. (She was {{standing}} behind Mr. Brumley so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> but--did their eyes meet?) ...|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{hearing what}} he said, bent over {{him on the}} {{opposite}} side to Rachael, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Osborne {{was partly}} {{reassured}} by her voice. She spoke in her normal tone, but he wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> better.|$|E
60|$|She turned quite pale, even in {{that light}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> pallor, and her hands fell heavily on the keys.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{steadily}} {{at her for}} a moment, but her parasol {{had dropped}} a little upon his side and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{fixed and}} staring in the dark, {{but he did}} not cease to stroke her hand with his thin fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, come here"; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> clearly, for {{the cloud}} {{in front of}} his eyes. [...] "I'm not well, I want some sal volatile." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> breast heaving {{with a quick}} {{breathing}} {{painful to}} listen to. He leaned forward, patting her knee, and murmuring: [...] "Sorry--sorry." ...|$|E
60|$|She fixed {{those dark}} eyes on him, {{and in her}} bare throat, from which the coat had fallen back, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> resolutely {{swallowing}} down her agitation.|$|E
6000|$|After that Lewisham went on his southward way alone. He {{did not go}} {{straight}} to his room in Chelsea, but spent some hours in a street in Battersea, pacing to and fro {{in front of a}} possible house. His passion changed from savageness to a tender longing. If only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> to-night! He knew his own mind now. To-morrow he was resolved he would fling work to the dogs and meet her. The things Dunkerley had said had filled his mind with wonderful novel thoughts. If only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> now! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{bowed his}} head, {{and turned away}} {{out of respect for}} the tears which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>her</b> eyes, and which she made {{scarcely}} an effort to conceal.|$|R
60|$|She now looked {{straight}} into his eyes, {{and as he}} returned the gaze <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>her</b> pupils {{his head and his}} straw hat, with the clear sky beyond.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of a new voice the lady in the bower started, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by <b>her</b> outline through the crevices of the wood-work and creepers. The {{minister}} looked surprised.|$|R
60|$|She went back, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> stoop till {{her head}} {{was close to the}} margin of the pool. She started up, and hastened back to his side.|$|E
60|$|She stood {{silent for}} a little, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> lips tremble and her tearless eyes burn with a feverish lustre. Then she pressed her {{forehead}} in both hands.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned slowly}} round till <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face, still and pale and cold, almost, {{it seemed to}} him, luminously white in the heavy {{darkness}} of the moonless hour.|$|E
6000|$|The light flickered, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>her</b> head appear, {{with hair}} all loose, {{and her face}} turning up to him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only half <b>see,</b> half imagine it, mysterious, blurry; and he whispered: ...|$|R
60|$|She made no answer. She {{moved her}} head very {{slightly}} so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face, and remained sitting rather stiffly and awkwardly {{with her eyes}} upon the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "In bed, {{with two}} ribs broken and a bruise {{on her back}} and a cut on her head. I got a doctor. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in that black place they live."...|$|R
6000|$|Then he {{felt and}} heard a great sob, {{and there were two}} tears on her cheek when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face, but she smiled with happy, quivering lip, and said—- ...|$|E
6000|$|Flora blushed and {{wondered}} whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face. [...] "After all, {{that was not}} much help," [...] she said. [...] "My wishing you luck wouldn't alter the wind and tide." ...|$|E
60|$|She rolled over, {{scrambling}} into a cross-legged posture on the bed. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> eyes shining. But {{she did not}} speak; {{she seemed}} to know that in silence was her strength.|$|E
60|$|Berenice had leaned {{right back}} amongst the {{yielding}} cushions of her divan, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face. Yet {{her voice sounded}} to him strange and forced. He {{looked at her in}} some surprise.|$|R
60|$|She was silent, and in {{the gloom}} of the dimly lit {{apartment}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face. <b>He</b> drew a little breath of relief. The worst was over now. He continued tenderly, almost affectionately.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> when <b>he</b> entered, for {{agitation}} deadened his senses, and the dim cell {{was almost}} dark to him. He stood a moment after {{the door closed}} behind him, trembling and stupefied.|$|R
