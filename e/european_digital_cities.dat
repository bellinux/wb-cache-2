It {{is interesting to note}} that each <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> has a different goal: to explore a vertical market, a public communication space, a next generation metropolitan network, and a social information infrastructure for the 21 st century, respectively. Their different services, system architectures, and organizations result from the different goals. <b>Digital</b> <b>cities</b> will change together with the advance of computer and network technologies. No <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> can remain at its current status. This paper reviews those <b>digital</b> <b>cities</b> to have a better understanding of their current status and future. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> as a comprehensive, web-based representation, or reproduction, of several aspects or {{functions}} {{of a specific}} real city, open to nonexperts. Much more than a technical and practical issue, the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> has dimensions that are social, cultural, political, ideological, and of course also theoretical. I explore these broader conceptual underpinnings of the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> idea. More specifically: where do urban ideologies, urban structures and functions, and digital urban representations meet? How may the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> relate to the real city? On {{the basis of what}} choices might the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> be constructed? What might the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the <b>digital</b> <b>city,</b> seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society. A rough sketch is all that can be offered at this point because proper theories of the <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> cannot be developed independently of comprehensive theories of the real 21 st-century city. I close with a brief discussion of what these ideas might imply for digital-city designers. ...|$|R

We have {{developed}} a <b>digital</b> <b>city</b> for Kyoto, the old capital and cultural center of Japan, as a social information infrastructure for urban everyday life including shopping, business, transportation, education, social welfare and so on.
