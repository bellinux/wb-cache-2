5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family <b>Dendrobatidae</b> which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family <b>Dendrobatidae</b> exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family <b>Dendrobatidae).</b> The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
500|$|The skin of many frogs {{contains}} mild {{toxic substances}} called bufotoxins {{to make them}} unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located {{on the sides of}} their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future. Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as aposematism. The poison dart frogs in the family <b>Dendrobatidae</b> do this. They are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators. [...] Other species, such as the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina), have their warning colour underneath. They [...] "flash" [...] this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.|$|E
500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family <b>Dendrobatidae.</b> Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>Dendrobatidae,</b> D. leucomelas frogs secrete toxins {{from their}} skin, which they gain from eating certain {{unspecified}} arthropod prey. It is uncertain precisely which arthropods lend their toxicity to which genus of <b>Dendrobatidae,</b> but one such arthropod {{is thought to}} have been identified as a possible source of the toxin for <b>Dendrobatidae</b> Phyllobates terribilis (aka the golden poison frog), and it is a local variant of the Melyrid beetle.|$|E
5000|$|... "Colostethus" [...] poecilonotus is {{a species}} of frog that is endemic to Peru. It is only known from the holotype {{collected}} in the Amazonas Region.

50|$|The Aromobatidae were {{separated}} from the <b>Dendrobatidae</b> only in 2006, and some sources continue to treat these frogs {{as part of the}} <b>Dendrobatidae.</b> However, their position as the sister taxon is well supported, and the question is primarily about whether they should be ranked as a family or a subfamily.|$|E

5000|$|Colostethus {{was found}} to be [...] "rampantly nonmonophyletic" [...] in the taxonomic {{revision}} of poison dart frogs published in 2006. Before the revision, it had 138 species, but this was reduced to 18 species, after the former Colostethus were distributed among eightgenera in two families, that is, in <b>Dendrobatidae</b> and in the newly established family Aromobatidae (e..g., Anomaloglossus). Within <b>Dendrobatidae,</b> many former Colostethus species were moved to Hyloxalus, while three were moved to the new Silverstoneia genus.
