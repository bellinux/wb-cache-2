25|$|A receipt dated 24 November 1611, {{made out}} {{on behalf of}} Maître de Laforcade, in Lagor, and Catherine de Touya, his wife, {{daughter}} and heir of the late Maître Jean de Touya, while living a Minister of the Word of God, {{for the amount of}} 2,500 Bordeaux francs, that constituted the dowry of Damoiselle Rache de Touyaa in her notarized contract at the notary Jean de Lenfant in Monein, on 21 February 1610, with Maître Jean de Balguer, <b>Huissier</b> at the King's Conseil Ordinaire, provided by Maître Arnaud de Laforcade, father, on behalf of the aforementioned de Laforcade.|$|E
25|$|Noble Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix († 1684), <b>Huissier</b> at the Parliament of Navarre (1644-62), Fermier des monnaies de Béarn et (Lower) Navarre]] (Lessee of the Mints of Béarn and (Lower) Navarre). Jean de Forcade was {{admitted}} to the Order of Nobility of the Estates of Béarn as Seigneur de Rontignon. on 30 August 1658. With his purchase of Biaix in 1659, he is the founder of the Forcade-Biaix family line. He was subsequently received into the Order of Nobility of the Estates of Béarn as Seigneur de Biaix on 10 June 1659. He was the son of Isacq de Forcade and his wife Marie de Bordes. He married with Madeleine de Lanne (died after 1688) at the Protestant Temple in Morlaàs on 23 December 1659, with a notarized post-nuptial contract at the notary Jean d'Agoeix in Pau on 12 February 1660. From this marriage were born at least 13 children, including: Isaac (1660), Sophie Philippine (1661–1730), Jean (1663), Marie (1662–1732),) Magdelaine (1668), Abraham (1670), Armand (1671), Marthe (1673–1731)), Pierre (1673), Marthe (1676), Paul (1677–1705), Henri (1678) and Anne (1682).|$|E
500|$|French fashions in chairs, as with {{everything}} else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable [...] "Louis XV" [...] French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which {{interfered with the}} unified flow of curved seatrails into cabriole legs that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict guild regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was {{the business of the}} menuisier alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (<b>huissier),</b> both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable bergère ("shepherdess") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes rechampi en blanc) or left in the natural color (á la capuchine), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded boiseries for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Liège all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780.|$|E
60|$|Or seest thou {{with any}} distinctness, low down probably, not in places of honour, a Stanislas Maillard, riding-tipstaff (<b>huissier</b> a cheval) of the Chatelet; {{one of the}} shiftiest of men? A Captain Hulin of Geneva, Captain Elie of the Queen's Regiment; both {{with an air of}} half-pay? Jourdan, with tile-coloured whiskers, not yet with tile-beard; an unjust dealer in mules?

60|$|Roland Graeme's heart throbbed when {{he found}} himself so {{unexpectedly}} in the scene of Rizzio's slaughter, a catastrophe which had chilled with horror all even in that rude age, which had been the theme of wonder and pity through every cottage and castle in Scotland, and had not escaped that of Avenel. But his guide hurried him forward, permitting no farther question, and with the manner of one who has already tampered too much with a dangerous subject. A tap which he made at a low door {{at one end of}} the vestibule, was answered by a <b>huissier</b> or usher, who, opening it cautiously, received Michael's intimation that a page waited the Regent's leisure, who brought letters from the Knight of Avenel.|$|E
6000|$|Everything, in a court, goes by clock-work. Your little great {{may be out}} of time, {{and affect}} a want of punctuality, but a rigid {{attention}} to appointments is indispensable to those who are really in high situations. A failure in this respect would produce the same impression on the affairs of men, that a delay in the rising of the sun would produce on the day. The appearance of the different personages named, all so near each other, was the certain sign that one greater than all could not be far behind. They were the dawn of the royal presence. Accordingly, the door which communicated with the apartments of the king, and the only one within the railed space, opened with the announcement of [...] "Le service du Roi," [...] when a procession of footmen of the palace appeared, bearing the dishes of the first course. All the vessels, whether already on the table, or those in their hands, were of gold, richly wrought, or, at least, silver gilt, I had no means of knowing which; most probably they were of the former metal. The dishes were taken from the footmen by pages, of honour in scarlet dresses, and by them placed in order on the table. The first course was no sooner ready, than we heard the welcome announcement of [...] "Le Roi." [...] The family immediately made their appearance, at the same door by which the service had entered. They were followed by a proper number of lords and ladies in waiting. Every one arose, as a matter of course, even to the [...] "jeunes, jolies, et duchesses;" [...] and the music, as became it, gave us a royal crash. The <b>huissier,</b> in announcing the king, spoke in a modest voice, and less loud, I observed, than in announcing the Dauphin and the ladies. It was, however, a different person; and it is probable one was a common <b>huissier,</b> and the other a gentleman acting in that character.|$|E
6000|$|We {{might have}} been in the gallery fifteen minutes, when there was a stir at a door on the side where the females were seated, and a <b>huissier</b> cried out--"Madame la Dauphine!" [...] and, sure enough, the Dauphine appeared, {{followed}} by two dames d'honneur. She walked quite through the gallery, across the area reserved for the court, and passed out at the little gate in the railing which communicated with our side of the room, leaving the place by the same door at which we had entered. She was in high court dress, with diamonds and lappets, and was proceeding from her own apartments, in the other wing of the palace, to those of the king. As she went within six feet of me, I observed her hard and yet saddened countenance with interest; for she has the reputation of dwelling on her early fortunes, and of constantly anticipating evil. Of course she was saluted by all in passing, but she hardly raised her eyes from the floor; though, favoured by my position, I got a slight, melancholy smile, in return for my own bow.|$|E
60|$|I was seated, {{the other}} evening, in quiet conversation, with Madame la Princesse de ----. Several people {{had come and}} gone in the course of an hour, and all had been {{received}} in the usual manner. At length the <b>huissier,</b> walking fast through the ante-chamber, announced the wife of an ambassador. The Princesse, at the moment, was seated on a divan, with her feet raised so as not to touch the floor. I was startled with the suddenness and vehemence of her movements. She sprang to her feet, and rather ran than walked across the vast salon to the door, where she was met by her visitor, who, observing the empressement of her hostess, through the vista of rooms, had rushed forward as fast as decorum would at all allow, in order to anticipate her at the door. It was my impression, at first, that they were bosom friends, about to be restored to each other, after a long absence, and that the impetuosity of their feelings had gotten the better of their ordinary self-command. No such thing; it was merely a strife of courtesy, for the meeting was followed by an extreme attention to all the forms of society, profound curtsies, and the elaborated demeanour which marks ceremony rather than friendship.|$|E
6000|$|For {{four hours}} {{now has the}} World-Bedlam roared: call it the World-Chimaera, blowing fire! The poor Invalides have sunk under their battlements, or rise only with {{reversed}} muskets: {{they have made a}} white flag of napkins; go beating the chamade, or seeming to beat, for one can hear nothing. The very Swiss at the Portcullis look weary of firing; disheartened in the fire-deluge: a porthole at the drawbridge is opened, as by one that would speak. See <b>Huissier</b> Maillard, the shifty man! On his plank, swinging over the abyss of that stone-Ditch; plank resting on parapet, balanced by weight of Patriots,--he hovers perilous: such a Dove towards such an Ark! Deftly, thou shifty Usher: one man already fell; and lies smashed, far down there, against the masonry! Usher Maillard falls not: deftly, unerring he walks, with outspread palm. The Swiss holds a paper through his porthole; the shifty Usher snatches it, and returns. Terms of surrender: Pardon, immunity to all! Are they accepted?--"Foi d'officier, On the word of an officer," [...] answers half-pay Hulin,--or half-pay Elie, for men do not agree on it, [...] "they are!" [...] Sinks the drawbridge,--Usher Maillard bolting it when down; rushes-in the living deluge: the Bastille is fallen! Victoire! La Bastille est prise!

60|$|South of the cathedral, and in Colegio Street (so {{called from}} the Augustine college, [Footnote: There is still a college of that name where {{meteorological}} observations are regularly made.] now converted into a tribunal), we find a small old house with heavily barred windows--the ex-Inquisition. This also has been desecrated into utility. The Holy Office began in 1504, and became a free tribunal in 1567. Its palace was here founded in 1659 by Don José Balderan, and restored in 1787 by Don Diego Nicholas Eduardo, whose fine fronting staircase has been much admired. The Holy Tribunal broke up in 1820, when, the Constitution proving too strong for St. Dominic, the college-students mounted the belfry; and, amid the stupefaction of the shuddering multitude, joyously tolled its death-knell. All the material was sold, even the large leather chairs with gilt nails used for ecclesiastical sitting. 'God defend us from its resurrection,' mutters the civil old <b>huissier,</b> as he leads us to the dungeons below through the mean court with its poor verandah propped on wooden posts. Part of it facing the magistrates' chapel {{was turned into a}} prison for petty malefactors; and the two upper salas were converted into a provisional Audiencia, or supreme court, large halls hung with the portraits of the old governors. The new Audiencia at the bottom of Colegio Street, built by M. Botta at an expense of 20,000 dollars, has a fine court with covered cloisters above and an open gallery below, supported by thin pillars of basalt.|$|E

Hee found him lying bound stretched on St Andrew's Crosse, naked ready for execution. Hee told him hee was sent for to exhort him to die patiently and like a Christian. Then immediately they were all surprized to see him hold up his head wch he lett hang on one side before like a drooping calfe and speake as loud and clear as the ministre, to whom he said with a chearful air hee was glad to see him, that hee need not question butt that hee would dye like a Christian and patiently too. Then hee went and spoke some places of Scripture to encourage him which he heard with great attention. They afterward came to mention some things to move him to contrition, and there hee tooke an occasion to aggravate the horrour of a Crime of attempting against the King's person. Hee said hee did not know what hee meant. For his part hee never had any evill intention against the Person of the King.|$|E

In 1705 the two professions were fused by royal edict under the name <b>huissier.</b>|$|E

The bedel (mod. bedeau), or beadle, was the court's messenger and served process, especially summonses (sumunse, somonse, mod. semonce). And finally the sergens (mod. sergent), or tipstaff, enforced judgments of the court, seized property, and made arrests.

Daumier showed in his youth an irresistible inclination towards the artistic profession, which his father vainly tried to check by placing him first with a <b>huissier,</b> for whom he was employed as an errand boy, and later, with a bookseller. In 1822 he became protégé to Alexandre Lenoir, a friend of Daumier's father who was an artist and archaeologist. The following year Daumier entered the Académie Suisse.
