40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the control of articulated robots in unstructured environments. The proposed control ensures several properties.

Finally, the control law is explicitly shaped by the safety measure – the danger field. The proposed control law has been implemented and validated in a realistic experimental scenario, demonstrating the effectiveness in driving the robot to a given configuration in a cluttered environment, without any offline planning phase.

40|$|Drilling is {{a cutting}} process {{that uses a}} drill bit to cut or enlarge a hole of {{circular}} cross-section in solid materials. The drill bit is a rotary cutting tool, often multipoint.

40|$|Abstract—Optimization {{of cutting}} {{parameters}} important in precision machining {{in regards to}} efficiency and surface integrity of the machined part. Usually productivity and precision in machining {{is limited by the}} forces emanating from the cutting process. Due to the inherent varying nature of the workpiece in terms of geometry and material composition, the peak cutting forces vary from point to point during machining process. In order to increase productivity without compromising on machining accuracy, it is important to control these cutting forces. In this paper a fuzzy logic control algorithm is developed that can be applied in the control of peak cutting forces in milling of spherical surfaces using ball end mills. The controller can adaptively vary the feedrate to maintain allowable cutting <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> This control algorithm is implemented in a computer numerical control (CNC) machine.

40|$|Abstract: Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} joining {{process for}} materials with low melting points. The process uses a rotating tool {{that consists of}} a shoulder and a pin. The tool plastically deforms the material with its pin and then forges together the parent materials underneath the shoulder. Past research has established that the axial <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> that creates the forging pressure {{is a function of}} plunge depth, traverse speed, and rotation speed. Historically, force control of FSW has been accomplished by varying the plunge depth of the tool. The research presented in this paper examines the force control of FSW by varying each of the process parameters separately. A force controller was implemented on a retrofitted milling machine. The closed-loop proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control architecture was tuned using the Ziegler–Nichols method. Welding experiments were conducted by butt welding 1 / 4 inch (6. 35 mm) · 11 / 2 inch (38. 1 mm) · 8 inch (203. 2 mm) samples of aluminium 6061 -T 6511 with a 1 / 4 inch (6. 35 mm) FSW tool. The results indicate that force control via traverse speed is the most accurate and, as a by-product, heat distribution control along the weld seam occurs. Force control via plunge depth i...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: To {{be able to}} {{formulate}} criteria’s for determining {{the onset of the}} creation of a wood chip; it is desirable to be able to study the deformation fields in a vicinity of the edge of the chipping tool. To that end, an experimental setup has been developed in which the chipping can be performed under very well defined conditions. In this setup it is possible to control the rate of indentation of the chipping tool and also to measure the <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> The setup admits also that the angle of the wood specimen with respect to the cutting plane can be varied in both a horizontal and a vertical plane. To determine the deformations, a Digital Speckle Photography (DSP) equipment is used, which together with image processing software makes it possible to determine the strain field {{on the surface of the}} wood specimen. One observation that can be made in these studies is that prior to the creation of a chip, there is a localization of strains in a thin region starting from the edge of the tool and directed parallel to the grain. Another observation made during the experimental work is that there exist different types of fracture processes, each giving different chip thicknesses. Flisningsprocesse...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} an {{analytical}} model is developed which predicts thrust {{force in the}} drilling with a twist drill. The thermomechanical properties are accounted for to describe the material flow in the primary shear zone and at the element-chip interface. The chip flow {{is determined by the}} assumption that the friction <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> face is collinear to the chip flow direction. The model permits to predict the chip flow direction, the contact length between the chip and the tool and the temperature distribution at the tool-chip interface which has an important effect on the tool wear. A temperature friction law is introduced as (mu) over bar = (mu(0)) over bar [1 - ((T) over bar (int) /T-f) (q)) and the pressure on the tool-chip interface was modeled as p(Z(fl)) = p(0) (1 - Z(fl) /I-c) where (T) over bar (int) is the mean temperature in the shear interface and I-C is the contact length between the chip and the drill. Using the thermo-viscoplastic model and the temperature friction law, the tangential forces, friction coefficient and contact length on the cutting element as a function of radius, for different feed rate and cutting speed, are obtained. The proposed model results are compared with experimental results and good agreement is obtained. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

This {{research}} basically {{deals with}} Orthogonal Machining of Unidirectional Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Composites as secondary operations like machining {{is a very}} important process in composites manufacturing. Even though composites are manufactured to near net shape, machining operations becomes obvious to attain dimensional accuracy and surface finish for further assembly operations. The machining of FRP’s is different and more complicated to that of metals because of their anisotropic and inhomogeneous nature, along with the chip formation mode for its brittle behavior. Fibers are very abrasive in nature and cause extreme tool wear making it difficult for cutting and when combined with matrix which is comparatively weak produce fluctuating <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> to augment for the tool wear. It will be very helpful to study their behavior for optimizing the machining condition and to minimize the above mentioned drawbacks.

40|$|Fluid film {{bearings}} are {{a possible}} solution {{to be adopted}} in very high speed applications if the operating speeds overcome the maximum rotational speeds of rolling bearings. In particular, gas bearings offer important advantages thanks to the low viscosity of air and to the peculiarity of being non-contact systems. For these properties they are characterized by low friction, high accuracy and life almost unlimited. In machine tools, gas bearings are adopted in applications that usually are limited to electrospindles of small dimensions (like e. g. high speed grinding, milling, PCB drilling and coatings). For this reason in this paper the applicability of gas bearings for a larger electrospindle for machining process is investigated. The spindle, of 50 mm diameter, is accelerated by an asynchronous motor of nominal speed 75 krpm and power 2. 5 kW.

25|$|There are two tool speeds to be {{considered}} in friction-stir welding; how fast <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld it is necessary that the material surrounding <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> If <b>the</b> material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> may break.|$|R
