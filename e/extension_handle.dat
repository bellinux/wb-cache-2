50|$|Since World War II the {{contrabass}} trombone in F {{with two}} valve attachments has been primarily {{in use in}} orchestras, though the 18′ B version is still used by many. Originally due to reasons of limited space conditions in opera orchestra pits, the bell section was provided with a coil to reduce {{the length of the}} bell bow, but since the 1970s the long, straight form has taken precedence. Through the combination of both valves, the <b>extension</b> <b>handle</b> on the outer slide also became redundant and the instrument is provided with five or six working positions on the slide. Valve tuning combinations are E/B, D/B, or more rarely D/C.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contrabass}} trombone {{is usually}} pitched in 12′ F a perfect fourth {{lower than the}} modern tenor or bass trombone and has been {{through a number of}} changes in its history. Its first incarnation during the Renaissance was in 18′ B as the [...] "Octav-Posaune". During this period it was built as an oversized bass trombone with a long slide and <b>extension</b> <b>handle</b> to reach the lower positions. The innovation of the double slide took place towards the end of this period and was applied to the bass and contrabass trombones. The slide was wound back on itself to produce four tubes, each of which moved in tandem with its partner and halved the usual length of the slide shifts. During the nineteenth century, the contrabass trombone enjoyed a revival and it was constructed according to the double slide principle. At the turn of the 20th century, Conn manufactured a small number of contrabass trombones, of which three are known to survive.|$|E

The following year, the aircraft arrived on the fifth and last day of the Paris Air Show to perform five aerial displays, the fourth of which was marred by a minor incident when the emergency undercarriage <b>extension</b> <b>handle</b> was moved, preventing gear retraction.

In {{order to}} reduce the risk of occupational cumulative trauma disorders of the upper extremity, it is important to understand the factors that have been linked to the incidence of such disorders. This study focuses on quantifying the effects of forearm position (pronated and semipronated), wrist position (30 flexion, neutral, and 30 <b>extension),</b> <b>handle</b> diameter (1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, and 2. 5 inches), and submaximal exertion level (25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of maximum voluntary contraction). A full factorial design was used to analyze the palmar force distribution and electromyographic activity of the forearm flexor muscles that resulted from combinations of these factors. Force data was analyzed for nine force-sensing resistors (FSRs) that were placed on the phalanges and metacarpophalangeal joints of ten subjects during isometric power grip on cylindrical handles. The muscular efficiency of the forearm flexor muscles was also evaluated by calculating the force-to-EMG ratio. The results indicated that the force distribution was significantly affected by all factors. Average EMG activity was significantly affected by all factors except wrist position. In terms of force generation and muscular efficiency, and for the factors studied, the optimal conditions for forceful tasks involving a power grip on cylindrical handles were determined to consist of: 1) a semipronated forearm position, 2) a wrist angle between neutral and 30 extension, and 3) a handle diameter of 1. 5 inches. The 50 % MVC exertion level was found to exhibit the best muscular efficiency among the exertion levels tested. In {{order to reduce}} between-subject variability, anthropometric grip diameter was successfully used as a blocking factor for the EMG activity data. However, blocking by grip diameter did not significantly improve the force distribution results. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

40|$|Brass Consort von Humboldt is an {{ensemble}} {{devoted to the}} musics, instruments, and historically informed performance practices of the renaissance and baroque eras. Also added are ???missing links??? of continuo (bass and chords) and drums and other percussion. Founded {{in the summer of}} 1998, BCvH concertized extensively, appearing at the conferences (California Music Educator's Association and Historic Brass Society), community concerts, an organ concert at San Francisco's Palace of the Legion of Honor, for the H. M. B Endeavour (replica of Captain Cook's 1768 ship), and in numerous California churches, cathedrals, and missions. BCvH recorded a full-length audio CD which employed cornetti, sackbuts, natural trumpets, serpent, continuo instruments, string orchestra, and other resources. Since valves were not invented and refined until the 19 th century, the modern brasswinds and their fully chromatic capabilities were not known in earlier times, when "natural" brass could only play tones of the harmonic series. Developments ensued, and at a high point from about 1550 to 1650, ???Cornetti e tromboni??? were favored consort instruments [...] until the arrival of, and subsequent domination by, the violin. The cornetto is a hybrid combining a very small trumpet-type lip-reed mouthpiece with a body having a fingering system resembling recorder. Termed ???Zink??? in Germanic lands and prized there for its unique sound, it remained in use until the 1700 s in settings from civic bands to the cantatas of Bach. The trombone was an offshoot of ???zugtrumpet,??? the long trumpet of the renaissance having a single slide [...] and the trumpet moving back and forth on that slide [...] allowing additional notes beyond the basic ???bugle tones. ??? In Germany the trombone (an Italian name so common we take it for granted) was, and still is, termed Posaune; in England it was ???Sagbutt??? (alternatively Sackbut), a seeming derivative of continental (French and Spanish) terms meaning ???push and pull. ??? A research grant led to the exclusive design and construction for BCvH of a true quart/quintbass sackbut, able to play in low F and low Eb, and with the requisite slide so long that the player must use an <b>extension</b> <b>handle...</b>|$|E
