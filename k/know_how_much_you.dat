She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?' He said, 'Okay, send him out.' So I went out and auditioned and got the job." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I fancy <b>you</b> {{have never}} <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> bore about with you. Your modesty {{has been so}} perfect that you have not thought of {{yourself}} as more than other men. You have forgotten that you have had in your hand the disposal to some one woman of a throne in Paradise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] he said, whilst in the fast-gathering dusk {{she could}} only just {{perceive}} the sudden hardening of his face, the look of wild passion in his eyes, [...] "but for that evening in Boulogne, but for that alternative which that devil placed before me, I might never have <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> meant to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> admire and reverence Sir William Wallace. If {{you will}} come hither this evening, at eight o'clock, you shall see him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} {{more money from}} you than I meant to, already, Mr. Draconmeyer," [...] she protested. [...] "Does Linda <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> have lent me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{seems to}} me,' said Mike, 'that {{it has gone}} too far. I've got the sack. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> farther <b>you</b> want it to go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> longer <b>you</b> {{are going}} to stay," [...] she said. [...] "You have not been abroad before, {{and there are other}} places you ought to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But don't think I'm ungrateful,' she said. 'I'm {{so proud}} that I have your love. It seems to lift me {{up from the}} depths. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> good <b>you</b> have done me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll stand in," [...] Robinson decided {{after a few}} moments' silence. [...] "You can let me <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> {{will need}} to carry you through when you get your plans worked out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stay my charmer, can {{you leave}} me? [...] Cruel, cruel to deceive me; [...] Well you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> grieve me; [...] Cruel charmer, can you go! [...] Cruel charmer, can you go! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> {{really believe}} {{of all these}} things you tell us. You speak with such gravity {{that we are all}} taken in, and then it turns out that you've been {{laughing}} at us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He seemed {{relieved}} of whatever suspicion he felt, {{but he said}} finally, and {{with an air of}} precaution, [...] "I should like to <b>know</b> just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> mean by the place seeming full of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is enough}} for me that I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> trouble <b>you</b> took to warn me of danger. It is {{unnecessary}} {{for me to think}} of you in any other light than that of a friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{virtue of}} this {{appointment}} I went recently {{to see and}} take notes [...] of Her Majesty's famous ironclad turret-ship, the Thunderer. [...] <b>Knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> {{are interested in the}} navy of England, I will [...] relate a little of what I saw, premising, how ever, that although [...] strict veracity is not required of me, I am, as you know, a man of [...] principle, and therefore impose it on myself, so that whatever I say [...] in this letter in regard to this splendid man-of-war may be relied on [...] as absolutely true.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was queer---but I'm glad of it, for {{it kind of}} squares up," [...] {{answered}} the circus boy. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> think of your boat, but I think {{a whole lot of}} Wags." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN [not {{daring to}} understand] Wasn't it enough? Why didn't you tell me? [With a cunning gleam in her eye] I'll double it: I was {{intending}} to double it. Only let me <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> want.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} tell, {{but at last}} he said: [...] "I'll tell you what! You must keep me up to it. You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> enjoy making me do my duty, {{and this will be}} such a pleasure!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, girls, girls," [...] she said, with {{a little}} tremble in her voice, [...] "I can never thank you enough. It was so kind and sweet of <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> good <b>you</b> have done me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, you {{certainly}} touched upon rather a tender point. Might I ask <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> know?' He spoke {{now in a}} half-jesting fashion, but a look of terror still lurked {{at the back of}} his eyes.|$|R

He {{said he was going}} to teach at White Sands. Of course he <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real self-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Bevil listened {{at first}} with interest, {{then tried to}} lead away from the subject; but it was Robert's single idea, and he kept them to it till their departure, when Phoebe's first words were, as they drove from the door, 'Oh, thank you, <b>you</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> happier <b>you</b> have made me.' ...|$|R
