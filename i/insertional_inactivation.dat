All four components (molecular sizes 71, 60, 46, and 41 kilodaltons) of the MBRP complex were expressed from an 8. 5 -kilobase DNA fragment as judged by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. The {{order of the}} individual genes within the cloned DNA fragment was determined by deletion mutagenesis and subcloning of various restriction fragments. Three RNAs, transcribed from the same DNA strand, were identified within the MBRP-coding region: one large RNA of approximately 5. 9 kilobases, presumably coding for all four MBRP components, and two minor RNAs, coding for MBRP- 71 and MBRP- 60. The two minor RNAs seemed to be transcribed from promoters within the large transcription unit.

Sequence analysis of a 30. 8 -kb region upstream of gyrBr revealed the presence of 28 complete open reading frames (ORFs). Fifteen of the identified ORFs showed, on average, 84 % identity to corresponding ORFs in the biosynthetic gene cluster of novobiocin, another aminocoumarin antibiotic.

The entire biosynthetic gene cluster (lip gene cluster) was cloned and characterized.

Central to the cluster is a polyketide synthase locus that encodes an eight-module system comprised of four multifunctional proteins. In addition, one ORF shows homology to those for nonribosomal peptide synthetases, indicating that α-lipomycin belongs to the classification of hybrid peptide-polyketide natural products. Furthermore, the lip cluster includes genes responsible for the formation and attachment of d-digitoxose as well as ORFs that resemble those for putative regulatory and export functions.

Another mechanism by which rDNA insertion into chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes.

Roots of rgr 1 are shorter than those of wild-type, and they have reduced lateral root formation. In addition, roots of rgr 1 coil clockwise on inclined agar plates, unlike wild-type roots which grow in a wavy pattern. The rgr 1 mutant has increased resistance, as measured by root elongation, to exogenously applied auxins (6 -fold to indole- 3 -acetic acid, 3 -fold to 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2 -fold to napthyleneacetic acid). It is also resistant to polar auxin transport inhibitors (2 -fold to triiodobenzoic acid and 3 - to 5 -fold to napthylphthalamic acid). The rgr 1 mutant {{does not appear to}} be resistant to other plant hormone classes. When grown in the presence of 10 (- 7) M 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, rgr 1 roots have fewer root hairs than wild type. All these rgr 1 phenotypes are Mendelian recessives. Complementation tests indicate that rgr 1 is not allelic to previously characterized agravitropic or auxin-resistant mutants. The rgr 1 locus was mapped using visible markers to 1. 4 +/- 0. 6 map units from the CH 1 locus at 1 - 65. 4.

We used Tn 917 mutagenesis to identify a gene, rbf, affecting biofilm formation in S. aureus NCTC 8325 - 4. Sequencing revealed that Rbf contained a consensus region signature of the AraC/XylS family of regulators, suggesting that Rbf is a transcriptional regulator. <b>Insertional</b> duplication <b>inactivation</b> of the rbf gene confirmed that the gene was involved in biofilm formation on polystyrene and glass. Phenotypic analysis of the wild type and the mutant suggested that the rbf gene mediates the biofilm formation of S. aureus at the multicellular aggregation stage rather than at initial attachment. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that the mutation resulted {{in the loss of}} an ∼ 190 -kDa protein. Biofilm production by the mutant could be restored by complementation with a 2. 5 -kb DNA fragment containing the rbf gene. The rbf-specific mutation affected the induction of biofilm formation by glucose and a high concentration of NaCl but not by ethanol. The mutation did not affect the transcription of the ica genes previously shown to be required for biofilm formation. Taken together, our results suggest that the rbf gene is involved in the regulation of the multicellular aggregation step of S. aureus biofilm formation in response to glucose and salt and that this regulation may be mediated through the 190 -kDa protein...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of feline vaccine site-associated sarcomas (VSSs) remains obscure. The low {{prevalence of}} VSSs suggests that congenital or acquired genetic factors within individual susceptible cats may act as initiators of oncogenesis. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate potential viral candidates in the etiopathogenesis of VSSs. Retroviruses investigated included feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline foamy virus (FeFV) and endogenous feline leukemia virus (enFeLV). Vaccination could increase replication and/or expression of latent retroviruses or endogenous retroviruses within proliferating fibroblasts and/or inflammatory cells. Malignant transformation could then result from <b>insertional</b> activation or <b>inactivation</b> of cell cycle regulatory genes. DNA viruses evaluated included papillomavirus (PV), polyomavirus (PyV) and herpesvirus. Members of these three viral families have oncogenic potential and could be introduced either as vaccine contaminants or as skin contaminants transported to the subcutis by vaccination. Also, non-pathogenic or latent viruses pre-existing in host tissues could become oncogenic within the local milieu created by vaccination. Fifty formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded VSSs were negative for the five exogenous viruses using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or immunohistochemistry. The level of enFeLV RNA in VSSs was not significantly different compared to that in non vaccine site-associated feline fibrosarcomas using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The significance of these results is that the retroviruses FIV, FeFV and enFeLV, and the DNA viruses PV, PyV and herpesvirus do not appear to be directly involved in the etiopathogenesis of VSSs...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{has several}} {{potential}} advantages as a vector for delivering genes to the nervous system. The virus naturally infects and remains latent in neurons and has evolved {{the ability of}} highly efficient retrograde transport {{from the site of}} infection at the periphery to the site of latency in the spinal ganglia. HSV is a large virus, potentially allowing the insertion of multiple or very large transgenes. Furthermore, HSV does not integrate into the host chromosome, removing any potential for <b>insertional</b> activation or <b>inactivation</b> of cellular genes. However, the development of HSV vectors for the central nervous system that exploit these properties has been problematical. This has mainly been due to either vector toxicity or an inability to maintain transgene expression. Here we report the development of highly disabled versions of HSV- 1 deleted for ICP 27, ICP 4, and ICP 34. 5 /open reading frame P and with an inactivating mutation in VP 16. These viruses express only minimal levels of any of the immediate-early genes in noncomplementing cells. Transgene expression is maintained for extended periods with promoter systems containing elements from the HSV latency-associated transcript promoter (J. A. Palmer et al., J. Virol. 74 : 5604 – 5618, 2000). Unlike less-disabled viruses, these vectors allow highly effective gene delivery both to neurons in culture and to the central nervous system in vivo. Gene delivery in vivo is further enhanced by the retrograde transport capabilities of HSV. Here the vector is efficiently transported from the site of inoculation to connected sites within the nervous system. This is demonstrated by gene delivery to both the striatum and substantia nigra following striatal inoculation; to the spinal cord, spinal ganglia, and brainstem following injection into the spinal cord; and to retinal ganglion neurons following injection into the superior colliculus and thalamus...|$|R
