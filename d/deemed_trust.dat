40|$|This thesis first {{examines}} the short-term market- and risk-adjusted abnormal returns and their determinants around the announcement and effective dates for {{a sample of}} 37 business trust conversions from the period from January 1998 until September 2006. While positive and significant abnormal returns are associated with both event dates, the abnormal returns associated with the effective conversion dates are much smaller in magnitude and are not robust. The only empirically supported explanation for the market impact of trust conversion announcements is the tax savings associated with conversion to an income trust. The longer-term market- and risk-adjusted returns are then examined around the trust conversion announcements. Based on {{an examination of the}} Jensen alpha estimates {{for each of the three}} years before and after the trust conversion announcements, the average trust conversion exhibits positive abnormal returns in all six years but the abnormal returns are only significant in the year prior to the trust-conversion announcement and in the second year after the announcement. Thus, the evidence supports the conjecture that the market <b>deems</b> <b>trust</b> conversions as value-enhancing event...|$|R

50|$|Cromwell J {{disagreed}} with the Court of Appeal's interpretation of s. 57(4), based on the grammatical and ordinary sense of {{the words in the}} phrase “accrued to the date of the wind up” in that provision, together with the broader statutory context.

50|$|Deschamps J {{held that}} the {{statutory}} <b>deemed</b> <b>trust</b> constituted under s. 57(4) of the PBA is remedial in nature, as {{it is intended to}} protect the interests of the plan members.

All point toward inclusion of the wind-up deficiency with respect to employer contributions upon the wind up of the pension plan.|$|E
50|$|In this case, {{the judge}} at first {{instance}} considered factors that were relevant to the remedial objective of the CCAA, and found that Indalex had in fact demonstrated that the CCAA’s purpose would be frustrated without the DIP charge.

40|$|Abstract An interior-point {{method for}} {{nonlinear}} programming is presented. It enjoys theflexibility of switching between a line search method that computes steps by factoring the primal-dual equations and a trust region method {{that uses a}} conjugate gradientiteration. Steps computed by direct factorization are always tried first, {{but if they are}} <b>deemed</b> ineffective, a <b>trust</b> region iteration that guarantees progress toward stationar-ity is invoked. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the algorithm is implemented in the Knitro [6, 28] software package and is extensively tested on a wide selection of testproblems. 1 Introduction In this paper we describe an interior method for nonlinear programming and discuss its software implementation and numerical performance. A typical iteration computes a primary step by solving the primal-dual equations (using direct linear algebra) and performs a line search to ensure decrease in a merit function. In order to obtain global convergence in the presence of nonconvexity and Hessian or Jacobian rank deficiencies, the primary step is replaced, under certain circumstances, by a safeguarding trust region step. The algorithm can use exact second derivatives of the objective function and constraints or quasi-Newton approximations...|$|R
5000|$|The Restatement (2d) of Property, {{which is}} a {{treatise}} describing general legal principles applied by the courts in the United States states that Infectious invalidity means that the failure of certain transfers may cause interests that are otherwise valid to fail also. This approach was taken in New England Trust Co. v. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958). A trust provided for income {{to be paid to}} the surviving children of the settlor's brother for life, and on the death of the last surviving child of the settlor's brother, an equal division of the trust principle was to be made among the issue of the children of the settlor's brother. The gift to the issue of the brother's children failed, because the ascertainment of issue could not be made until the brother's children died, and the brother might have children born after the creation of the trust who might not die within the permissible period. However, a later trust had been established by the settlor, which stated that if any provision in the first trust indenture should be declared invalid, any income or principal which reverted to his estate should be <b>deemed</b> held in <b>trust</b> by the settlor for the benefit of his brother's children and their issue. Applying the doctrine of infectious invalidity to avoid a distortion of the settlor's [...] "clear desire," [...] the court held that the second trust should govern the trust distribution. It stated that by striking down all the gifts, valid and invalid, made in the first trust, and by giving effect to the second trust, the settlor's plan for the income gifts was substantially carried out. 1.5 comment 7 ...|$|R
