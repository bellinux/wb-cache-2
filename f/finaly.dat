50|$|The spectator {{representing}} the unbiased posterity has {{great admiration for}} the radiation of Béla Bevilaqua Borsody’s spirit, his indisputable and unexplainable attraction, by means of which, even in his physical and existential disability, {{he was able to}} attach a woman, who was enthusiastic about him, while he married another, giving romantic colour even to his death. “Eternal love. Without Hope. When two pronounce the hard and stubborn word of break-off, behind it with broken wings some hopemay glitter - when the train flies off, waving farewell with a shawl suggests future, and forthcoming tomorrow - but I was beaten by the sunset, and became a lonely one to keep your last face to my last face.” Olga <b>Finály.</b>|$|E

She paid his bills, typed his manuscripts, and who knows how further in tenderness enthusiastic love carried them. Because it was love, the deep mourn proves it.

With a sick child’s word / I ask you, like my father, / hold my hand when wandering / through a dense forest / crying to shout after you; / don’t say my wish is sick and senseless, / and remember then that I loved you.” ...|$|E
