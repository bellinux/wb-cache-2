50|$|The {{refractive}} {{indices of}} the oil and of the glass in the first lens element are nearly the same, {{which means that the}} refraction of light will be small upon entering the lens (the oil and glass are optically very similar). The correct <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> for an objective lens has to be used to ensure that the refractive indices are correctly matched. Use of an oil immersion lens with the incorrect <b>immersion</b> <b>oil,</b> or without <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> altogether, will suffer from spherical aberration.

5000|$|A Clifton nanolitre {{osmometer}} is {{a device}} that allows {{the determination of the}} melting and freezing point of an aqueous solution using a sample size of only nanolitres. The device consists of a controller box, a cooling stage, and a sample holder. Additionally, various micrometer syringes, <b>immersion</b> <b>oils</b> and microscopes are required for its use.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of synthetic <b>immersion</b> <b>oils</b> in the 1940s, cedar tree oil was widely used. Cedar oil has an index of refraction of approximately 1.516. The numerical aperture of cedar tree oil objectives is generally around 1.3. Cedar oil {{has a number of}} disadvantages however: it absorbs blue and ultraviolet light, yellows with age, has sufficient acidity to potentially damage objectives with repeated use (by attacking the cement used to join lenses), and diluting it with solvent changes its viscosity (and refraction index and dispersion). Cedar oil must be removed from the objective immediately after use before it can harden, since removing hardened cedar oil can damage the lens. In modern microscopy synthetic <b>immersion</b> <b>oils</b> are more commonly used, as they eliminate most of these problems. NA values of 1.6 can be achieved with different oils. Unlike natural oils synthetic ones do not harden on the lens and can typically be left on the objective for months at a time.|$|R
50|$|With {{an optical}} {{microscope}} having a high numerical aperture and using <b>oil</b> <b>immersion,</b> {{the best possible}} resolution is 200 nm corresponding to a magnification of around 1200×. Without <b>oil</b> <b>immersion,</b> the maximum usable magnification is around 800×. For details, see limitations of optical microscopes.|$|R

50|$|Ceramographic {{specimens}} are {{electrical insulators}} in most cases, {{and must be}} coated with a conductive ~10-nm layer of metal or carbon for electron microscopy, after polishing and etching. Gold or Au-Pd alloy from a sputter coater or evaporative coater also improves the reflection of visible light from the polished surface under a microscope, by the Fresnel formula below. Bare alumina (η ≈ 1.77, k ≈ 10 &minus;6) has a negligible extinction coefficient and reflects only 8% of the incident light from the microscope, as in Fig. 1. Gold-coated (η ≈ 0.82, k ≈ 1.59 @ λ = 500 nm) alumina reflects 44% in air, 39% in <b>immersion</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some microscopes {{make use}} of oil-immersion {{objectives}} or water-immersion objectives for greater resolution at high magnification. These are used with index-matching material such as <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> or water and a matched cover slip between the objective lens and the sample. The refractive index of the index-matching material is higher than air allowing the objective lens to have a larger numerical aperture (greater than 1) so that the light is transmitted from the specimen to the outer face of the objective lens with minimal refraction. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved. The larger numerical aperture allows collection of more light making detailed observation of smaller details possible. An oil immersion lens usually has a magnification of 40 to 100×.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, a California {{medical device}} manufacturer, 3Gen, {{introduced}} the first polarized dermatoscope, the DermLite. Polarised illumination, {{coupled with a}} cross-polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians {{no longer have to}} stop and apply <b>immersion</b> <b>oil,</b> alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate.|$|E

50|$|The maximum NA {{is limited}} by the {{refractive}} index of the medium between the lens and the sample. As with objective lenses, a condenser lens with a maximum numerical aperture of greater than 0.95 is designed to be used under oil immersion (or, more rarely, under water immersion), with a layer of <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> placed in contact with both the slide/coverslip and the lens of the condenser. An oil immersion condenser may typically have NA of up to 1.25. Without this oil layer, not only is maximum numerical aperture not realized, but the condenser mat not be able to precisely focus light on the object. Condensers with a numerical aperture of 0.95 or less are designed to be used without oil or other fluid on the top lens and are termed dry condensers. Dual dry/immersion condensers are basically oil immersion condensers that can nonetheless focus light with the same degree of precision even without oil between the top lens and the slide.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dermoscopy is {{a useful}} method that allows dermal and {{epidermal}} structures to be easily analysed non-invasively. Aim: In this study, <b>immersion</b> <b>oil,</b> which is widely used in dermoscopy, and ultrasound gel, which is less preferred, are evaluated comparatively in terms of displaying structural parameters and number of air bubbles in the image. Methods: A total of 71 nevomelanocytic or non-melanocytic pigmented lesions were taken up for this study. Structural characteristics of the obtained images were assessed by an experienced observer who scored the images in terms of color, pigment network, globule, vascular structure, number of air bubbles and other pigmentation parameters. Results: In the images obtained through <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> or ultrasound gel {{from all of the}} lesions, no statistical difference was found between the average values of air bubbles and in the evaluation of structural components (t = 1. 09, P = 0. 2). In the identification of pigment network in melanocytic lesions, <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> was observed to be more appropriate than ultrasound gel (t = 0. 01, P = 0. 02). Conclusions: Ultrasound gel may be preferred in the assessment of mucosa and nail bed lesions. Ultrasound gel is a good alternative compared to <b>immersion</b> <b>oil</b> in pigmented skin lesions as it is cheap and easily removable...|$|E
