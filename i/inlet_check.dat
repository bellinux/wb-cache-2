5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for metering. Diaphragm pumps have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through an <b>inlet</b> <b>check</b> valve during decompression and exits through an outlet check valve during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston pumps. Diaphragm pumps can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm metering pumps are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|E
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the <b>inlet</b> <b>check</b> valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|E
40|$|Refrigerator with no wear-related {{moving parts}} {{produces}} 0. 5 W of cooling at 118 K. When fully developed, refrigerator needs no electrical power, and {{life expectancy of}} more than 10 yr, operates unattended to cool sensitive infrared detectors for long periods. Only moving parts in adsorption cryocooler are check valves. As charcoal is cooled in canister, gas pressure drops, allowing <b>inlet</b> <b>check</b> valve to open and admit more nitrogen. When canister is heated, pressure rises, closing inlet valve and eventually opening outlet valve...|$|E

50|$|The Puget Sound system {{consists}} of four deep basins connected by shallower sills. The four basins are Hood Canal, west of the Kitsap Peninsula, Whidbey Basin, east of Whidbey Island, South Sound, south of the Tacoma Narrows, and the Main Basin, which is further subdivided into Admiralty Inlet and the Central Basin. Puget Sound's sills, a kind of submarine terminal moraine, separate the basins from one another, and Puget Sound from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Three sills are particularly significantâ€”the one at Admiralty <b>Inlet</b> which <b>checks</b> {{the flow of water}} between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget sound, the one at the entrance to Hood Canal (about 175 ft below the surface), and the one at the Tacoma Narrows (about 145 ft). Other sills that present less of a barrier include the ones at Blake Island, Agate Pass, Rich Passage, and Hammersley Inlet.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model based on equivalent electrical networks {{has been built}} to simulate the dynamic behavior of a positive-displacement MEMS micropump dedicated to insulin delivery. This device comprises a reservoir in direct communication with the <b>inlet</b> <b>check</b> valve, a pumping membrane actuated by a piezo actuator, two integrated piezoresistive pressure sensors, an anti-free-flow check valve at the outlet, and finally a fluidic pathway up to the patient cannula. The pressure profiles delivered by the sensors are continuously analyzed during the therapy in order to detect failures like occlusion. The {{numerical model}}ing is a reliable way {{to better understand the}} behavior of the micropump in case of failure. The experimental pressure profiles measured during the actuation phase have been used to validate the numerical modeling. The effect of partial occlusion on the pressure profiles has been also simulated. Based on this analysis, a new management of partial occlusion for MEMS micropump is finally proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide the}} high speed flow {{visualization}} and dynamic measurement {{results for the}} U-shaped and the inverted U-shaped heat driven pumps. The U-shaped heat driven pumps at the high heating powers consist of a succession of tiny bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence process. Once the "larger" spherical bubble or the bubble slug forms, it expands quickly in both upstream and downstream directions. The increased pressure leads to the liquid discharge through the outlet check valve. When the advancing vapor/liquid interface reaches a higher position in the vertical discharge branch, the condensation heat transfer in the discharge branch shrinks the bubble slug, leading to the decreased pressure and initiating the open of the <b>inlet</b> <b>check</b> valve. Thus the fresh liquid can be sucked into the system. Heat driven pumps operating at the low heating powers display the similar process. However, two major differences are identified. (1) A full cycle includes a set of positive pressure pulses corresponding {{to a set of}} tiny bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence process in each substage. Only {{at the end of the}} cycle, an apparent negative pressure pulse is created (2) For each substage in each cycle, when the newly formed bubble slug is chasing the ahead "old" bubble slug, the deformed liquid bridge is formed due to the gravity,force effect. When the two bubble slugs are merging together, a wave vapor/liquid interface occurs along the bottom of the capillary tube. For the inverted U-shaped heat driven pumps, there are fewer positive pressure pulses included, corresponding to lesser number of new bubble nucleation, growth, and coalescence process. The bubble slug in the capillary tube is very standard with the smooth vapor/liquid interface. The cycle periods and the pumping flow rates are given versus the heating powers...|$|E
