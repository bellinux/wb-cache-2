Poclain produced excavators, and was leader on the French and world market thanks to a revolutionary hydraulic motor. The Batailles were forced to sell the company to Case in 1974, an American company, which then took over completely in 1987, leaving them (the Batailles) only the <b>Hydraulics</b> <b>division,</b> which is still trading today.|$|E

40|$|Flanders <b>Hydraulics</b> Research <b>division,</b> Flemish Ministry for Mobility and Public WorksThe {{usefulness}} of hydrodynamic river models {{much depends on}} {{the accuracy of the}} model. The uncertainty in the results of hydrodynamic river models typically originates from uncertainties in the model parameters (calibration uncertainty), model schematization and input data. Based on a detailed insight in the river system, the modelling process and its shortcomings, most efficient model improvement actions can be designed. In this paper, several model improvement actions are suggested and tested for the hydrodynamic model of the Demer river in Belgium. A detailed model performance evaluation is conducted for that case based on field measurements of river water levels and discharges at different places along the river. The evaluation includes comparison of observed and simulated rainfall-runoff and river peak flows, low flows, cumulative volumes and empirical extreme value distributions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Knowing {{the values}} of {{evapotranspiration}} us closer {{to the reality of}} the water requirements of plants, to have an approximation as close to reality of these values is very important because it would help us to manage more efficiently the water resource. These approaches spatial from values distributed over a surface or over time, are performed by different spatial interpolation methods (tools in ArcGIS, ILWIS). Our objective was to evaluate the performance of three spatial interpolators (kriging, moving average and trend surface) to estimate reference evapotranspiration data of 2011, based on data recorded by <b>Hydraulics</b> and Irrigation <b>Division</b> of 6 weather stations distributed throughout the northwest of the state of São Paulo. These values of evapotranspiration were interpolated using the three spatial interpolation methods. The results indicated that kriging and moving average methods obtained statistically the same values and lower for average (4. 21), minimum (3. 79) and maximum (4. 62), while, trend surface obtained the most favorable results for the average (4. 20), minimum (3, 53) and maximum (4. 87) for the variable estimated of evapotranspiration regard to real values. We conclude that the use of spatial interpolators: trend surface, kriging and moving average obtained the estimated values closest to values real evapotranspiration northwest of São Paulo.

40|$|The {{geoprocessing}} {{is increasingly}} {{applied in the}} assessment of the spatial variability of parameters of interest in agricultural sciences. And when used software as ILWIS at its basic module, to analyze tabular data, the unit of analysis assumes the same value. An improved data analysis method is based on the interpolation of these data. Therefore, the intermediate values of the data are preserved, and the end result is a more continuous surface smoothed data, minimizing the contrasts between polygons. This study aims to compare the performance of three interpolation methods: Moving Average, Trend Surface and Krigagem. For this, we used rainfall data for 2011, obtained from CIIAGRO and <b>Hydraulics</b> & Irrigation <b>Division</b> in 12 weather stations northwest of São Paulo State. The analysis was realized visually using: thematic maps, verification of accuracy and performance of the interpolators, standard deviation methods and comparing the values of each method with real data. Trend Surface Interpolator presented unsatisfactory results regarding the comparison of thematic maps and performance of all interpolators, showing that use data such as precipitation distortion. While, in relation to the percentage of accumulated pixel was obtained smallest standard deviation. The best performance was obtained by the Kriging Interpolator, therefore, a greater number of samples, in the case of expected precipitation data for better visualization. Pages: 5338 - 534...|$|R

40|$|A reevaluation {{of design}} floods for dam safety {{within the united}} states showed that the need to modify dams to {{accommodate}} larger floods has greatly increased in recent years. The occurrence of larger design floods would result in overtopping of the dams at many existing reservoirs due to insufficient storage or release capacity. When the addition of storage or release capacity becomes impractical or too costly, dam owners must sometimes resort to providing overtopping protection. An ASCE <b>Hydraulics</b> <b>Division</b> Task committee on Alternatives for Overtopping Protection for Dams was established in 1991 to inventory and evaluate modification alternatives for new, innovative spillway designs and overtopping protection concepts for dams. Results of this task committee are being prepared for publication by ASCE during late 1992. This paper provides an overview of some recent research and prototype applications of several alternatives for overtopping protection and some modifications to prevent overtopping...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Hydraulics</b> <b>division</b> (WT) in The Hague, part of het Delta department, {{consists}} of 5 production-departments that execute the so-called "advising-proces", i. e. {{they support the}} Deltaworks by supervising and carrying out technica 1 studies. Today their planning and accounting system (PLAC) is mainly a partial and uniform time-accounting- system. To investigate the WT-organisation a function model has been developed, after defining some presentive words as "product" or "project", that descripes the transformation of "questions' into "answers". The controling system of this proces {{consists of}} 4 echelons; i. e. production-control or feed-forward adjustment, projectplanning or scheduling, production- or resourceplanning and policyplanning. On each echelon these "decision-functions" are supported and adj usted by management- informat ion- functions. Comparing the model and WT we learned that WT tries to control the proces by separately controling each professional activity. Projectplans and prcductionplans are only made once, are not realizable and therefore not used. A policy that can be transformed in realizable guiding standards Is nonexistent. Proposed is to develop such a policy to make a realizable and adjustable planning posible. Plans should then be checked and, if necessary, revised. To make this work 5 measure-functions are built in into the model. The proposal is completed by a corresponding personal structure in the organisation, i. e. an internal projectorganisation.
