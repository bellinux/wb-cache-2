Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E

5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere <b>in</b> <b>regions</b> inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E

5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred <b>in</b> <b>regions</b> where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E

5|$|Dense {{vegetation}} (such as that {{of tropical}} rainforests) and urban habitats are not ideal {{for the establishment of}} the human transmission cycle. However, <b>in</b> <b>regions</b> where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.|$|E
25|$|This {{complex concept}} is {{reflected}} in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae, which places the Di Consentes Penates <b>in</b> <b>region</b> I with the Favores Opertanei; Ceres and Genius <b>in</b> <b>region</b> V; Pales <b>in</b> <b>region</b> VI; Favor and Genius (again) <b>in</b> <b>region</b> VII; Secundanus Pales, Fortuna and Favor Pastor <b>in</b> <b>region</b> XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations {{may be due to}} the fact that Penates belonging to different categories (of Jupiter <b>in</b> <b>region</b> I, earthly or of mortal men <b>in</b> <b>region</b> V) are intended. Favor(es) may be the Etruscan masculine equivalent of Fortuna.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised <b>in</b> <b>regions</b> with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{globular}} clusters show that these stellar formations arise primarily <b>in</b> <b>regions</b> of efficient star formation, {{and where the}} interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. Globular cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies. Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black holes (SMBH) {{and the extent of}} the globular cluster systems of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's {{globular clusters}}.|$|E

5|$|Since 2012 Chad {{has been}} divided into 23 regions.

The departments are divided into 200 sub-prefectures, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.|$|E
5|$|Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence <b>in</b> <b>regions</b> where the Monroe Doctrine applied.
