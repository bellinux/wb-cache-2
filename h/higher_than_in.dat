40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} of insulin resistance (IR) extent with systemic inflammatory response and target organ damage in children with sepsis. Methods: A total of 70 patients with sepsis who were treated in our hospital between June 2013 and July 2016 were collected as observation group, 50 healthy children who received vaccination in our hospital {{during the same period}} were selected as normal control group, the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) of two groups of children were determined, the median of HOMA-IR of observation group was referred to further divide them into high HOMA-IR group and low HOMA-IR group, 35 cases in each group. The systemic inflammatory response and target organ damage extent were compared between sepsis children with different HOMA-IR levels. Results: HOMA-IR level in observation group was significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> normal control group. Serum inflammatory factors PCT, IL- 1 β, IL- 8 and IL- 10 contents in high HOMA-IR group were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> low HOMA-IR group; serum myocardial injury indexes CK, CK-MB and LDH contents were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> low HOMA-IR group; serum liver injury indexes ALT, AST and TBIL contents were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> low HOMA-IR group while ALB content was lower <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> low HOMA-IR group; serum renal injury indexes Cr, BUN and CysC contents were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> low HOMA-IR group.

40|$|Objective: To analyze {{changes of}} serum lipid and hs-CRP levels in {{patients}} with subclinical hypothyroidism in order to explore their correlations with TSH level. Methods: A total of 90 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism {{were included in the}} study and divided into the mild, moderate, and severe groups according to TSH level with 30 cases in each group; meanwhile, 30 healthy individuals were served as the control groups. The changes of the levels of TSH, serum lipid indicators (TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA, ApoB, and Lpa), and hs-CRP in the four groups were observed. The correlation of serum lipid and hs-CRP with TSH was analyzed. Results: The levels of TSH, TC, TG, Lpa, and hs-CRP in the subclinical hypothyroidism subgroups were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> the control group. The levels of HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA, and ApoB {{in patients with}} subclinical hypothyroidism were increased when compared with the control group.

To elucidate the relationship between antibodies and late asthmatic responses (LAR), antigen-specific IgG subclass antibodies in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of asthmatics were measured by avidin-biotin ELISA before provocation by antigen. The BALF levels of IgG and IgG 1 antibodies to mite and Candida antigen in bronchial asthmatics were <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> healthy subjects (p< 0. 05). Followed by inhalation of house dust or Candida antigen, bronchial asthmatics were divided into group A (higher levels of BALF IgG 1 antibody) and gourp B (lower levels of BALF IgG 1 antibody). The percentages of LAR including DAR after inhalation of house dust antigen in group A were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> group B (p< 0. 05). The percentages of LAR including DAR after inhalation of Candida antigen in group A were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> group B (p< 0. 01).
