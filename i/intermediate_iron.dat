Here, the hypothesis that the recently discovered natural product, myo-inositol 1, 2, 3 -trisphosphate represents the simplest structure to mimic phytate's antioxidant activity has been tested. The first synthesis of myo-inositol 1, 2, 3 -trisphosphate has been completed, along with its X-ray structure determination and that of key synthetic <b>intermediates.</b> <b>Iron</b> binding studies of myo-inositol 1, 2, 3 -trisphosphate demonstrated that phosphate groups with the equatorial-axial-equatorial conformation are required for complete inhibition of hydroxyl radical formation. myo-Inositol monophosphatase is a key enzyme in recycling myo-inositol from its monophosphates in the brain and its inhibition is implicated in lithium's antimanic properties. Current synthetic strategies require inositol compounds to be protected (often with more than one group), resolved, phosphorylated and deprotected to produce the desired optically active myo-inositol phosphates. Here, the synthesis of myo-inositol 3 -phosphate has been achieved in only 4 steps from myo-inositol.

The use of alternative electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration is critical in environments where oxygen is limited or absent – such as soils of the Arctic Coastal Plain. Continuous permafrost below the active layer of soil restricts drainage, creating anoxic conditions. Thus, anaerobic respiration dominates all but the top few centimeters of soil. Climate change effects acutely impact the Arctic, {{and the potential for}} positive feedback from soil respiration is substantial. Biogeochemical cycling in this environment warrants further study, particularly concerning anaerobic electron acceptors which contribute to CO 2 fluxes and can compete with methanogenesis, further impacting greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this dissertation is to explore metabolism of unusual electron acceptors in Arctic tundra soils, focusing on the importance of humic substances, their interactions with iron, and the role of organohalide respiration in the Arctic carbon cycle. The research contained within unites microbiological techniques, soil chemistry methods, and innovative interdisciplinary tools to study these compounds from a variety of vantage points. Soil extract measurements, potentiometric redox titrations, and cyclic voltammetry revealed that metabolism involving humic acids in this environment may contribute nearly 400 moles of electrons per square meter of soil (e-/m 2), accounting for over 10 % of ecosystem respiration. Performing a field-based soil amendment experiment and laboratory incubations validated that reduction of large, insoluble humic acids can be facilitated by way of soluble <b>iron</b> <b>intermediates,</b> <b>iron</b> is an electron-accepting moiety in humic acids, and iron-reducing bacteria liberate complexed iron from the structure of humic acids.

40|$|Two {{different}} methods for the regioselective nitration of different meso-triarylcorroles {{leading to the}} corresponding beta-substituted nitrocorrole iron complexes have been developed. A two-step procedure affords three Fe(III) nitrosyl products-the unsubstituted corrole, the 3 -nitrocorrole, and the 3, 17 -dinitrocorrole. In contrast, a one-pot synthetic approach drives the reaction almost exclusively to formation of the iron nitrosyl 3, 17 -dinitrocorrole. Electron-releasing substituents on the meso-aryl groups of the triarylcorroles induce higher yields and longer reaction times than what is observed for the synthesis of similar triarylcorroles with electron-withdrawing functionalities, and these results can be confidently attributed to the facile formation and stabilization of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>iron</b> corrole pi-cation radical. Electron-withdrawing substituents on the meso-aryl groups of triarylcorrole also seem to labilize the axial nitrosyl group which, {{in the case of}} the pentafluorophenylcorrole derivative, results in the direct formation of a disubstituted iron mu-oxo dimer complex.

This paper suggests to consider that each cell contains an oriented microstructure of iron whose direction and shape are optimized by the method. Findings – Coupled with convexity and sensitivity mappings quite common in the field of topology optimization, the use of the microstructure allows the optimization algorithm to converge systematically toward the same design.

The catalyst preparation requires {{the right balance}} {{between the amount of}} the Nafion necessary to protect the C-surface and the minimum encapsulation of the Fe-cluster catalytic sites inside the Nafion to allow the photocatalysis to proceed. The C-Nafion/Fe fabric can be used up to pH 10 under light to photocatalyze the disappearance of Orange II in the presence of H 2 O 2. The photocatalysis mediated by the C-Nafion/Fe-ion fabric increased with the applied light intensity and reaction temperature in the reaction needing an activation energy of 9. 8 kcal/mol. This indicates that ion- and radical-molecule reactions take place during Orange II disappearance. The build up and decomposition of <b>intermediate</b> <b>iron</b> complexes under light involves the recycling of Fe 2 + and was detected by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

40|$|Hemoenzymes are {{prevalent}} {{in nature and}} participate {{in a wide range}} of biological activities. Frequently, high-valence <b>iron</b> <b>intermediates</b> are involved in the catalytic events of these enzymes, especially when the activation of peroxide or dioxygen is involved. Building on the fundamental framework of iron-oxygen chemistry, the mechanistic understandings of these enzymes and their reactive intermediates constantly attract attention from the enzymology community. This dissertation work focused on the mechanistic studies on two hemoenzymes, tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO) and MauG, both of which catalyze unique chemical transformations, i. e., tryptophan oxidation. TDO and MauG are structurally distinct from each other; they catalyze different types of oxidization reactions on tryptophan via diverse strategies. TDO catalyzes the ring-cleavage dioxygenation reaction of free L-tryptophan, incorporating both oxygen atoms from dioxygen into the substrate. MauG uses hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant to catalyze a complex posttranslational-modification reaction on two tryptophan residues from a protein substrate. It utilizes radical chemistry to perform a 40 -Å long-range catalytic event. Despite the differences in their catalytic behavior, both enzymes are suggested to employ high-valence <b>iron</b> <b>intermediates</b> in their reactions. A collection of biochemical and spectroscopic approaches was employed to obtain detailed insight into the electronic and structural contributions to the formation and stabilization of high-valence <b>iron</b> <b>intermediates,</b> and into the heme-dependent tryptophan-oxidizing mechanisms. In the study TDO, we solved the long-standing mystery of how the active Fe(II) enzyme is generated from the resting Fe(III) form by hydrogen peroxide. A peroxide-driven reactivation mechanism was established based on the identification of a compound ES-type ferryl intermediate. Additional efforts were dedicated to clarify the controversy in the literature regarding the catalytic roles of a distal histidine residue. Chemical-rescue approaches were used to specify the catalytic contributions of the target residue. In the study of MauG, we discovered an unprecedented tryptophan-mediated charge-resonance phenomenon in the bis-Fe(IV) redox state. This discovery provides the molecular basis for the chemical reactivity and stability of the catalytically competent bis-Fe(IV) intermediate.

Ow-ing {{to the requirements}} of the erythroid marrow in particular, large amounts of iron must constantly pass from one cell to another through the plasma. This plasma transport is brought about by a # 3 -globulin transferrin, which handles iron in a highly selective fashion, removing it from donor tissues such as the reticuloendothelial cells and releasing it to those tissues which have a need for iron. It is likely that this direction of motion is accomplished by the relative affinity of individual cellular receptors for iron as compared to that of transferrin. Thus weaker receptors yield iron to transferrin and stronger receptors assimilate it. Recently, powerful chelating agents have been developed which may participate in tissue iron exchange (1 - 10). Such chelates have been shown to compete in vitro with transferrin for iron (5, 6). They have also been shown to mobilize iron from body tissues when injected parenterally (3, 4).

Here we investigate variations in sedimentary iron diagenesis and depositional environments for the last 35 ka by analyzing the rock magnetic and geochemical properties of two sediment cores collected in the Santa Barbara Basin (California). In organic-rich sediments, early diagenesis often leads to partial dissolution of detrital iron oxides and stepwise formation of authigenic pyrite (FeS 2). The pyritization process takes place following several geochemical pathways, sometimes involving <b>intermediate</b> <b>iron</b> sulfide species such as greigite (Fe 3 S 4). Sedimentary conditions in the basin appear to have recurrently favored preservation of greigite (identified by its magnetic properties) and inhibited its complete transformation into pyrite. The Holocene interval contains a series of centimeter-thick greigite-bearing layers that are associated with large flood deposits, which are known in the basin as ‘‘gray layers. ’’ We propose that greigite preservation was enabled in these sediments by their relative enrichment in reactive iron over organic matter and/or hydrogen sulfide (because of their high ratio of terrigenous over organic material), which limited pyritization reactions. Within the glacial deposits, formation and preservation of meter-thick greigite layers occurred in terrigenous-rich and organic-poor sedimentary layers and is proposed to result from a similar diagenetic process to that in the Holocene greigite-bearing layers (dominance of reactive iron over organic matter and/or HS�). The terrigenous enrichments in the glacial greigite-bearing layers are probably related to climatic or sea level changes because they occur at times of massive iceberg releases in the North Atlantic, the so-called Heinrich events...|$|E

Whereas the calcined catalysts showed negligible activity in benzene hydroxylation, high-temperature treatment resulted in dramatic improvements in activity and selectivity. The selectivity to phenol decreased strongly with increasing Fe content. The profound changes in catalytic reactivity {{are related to the}} changes in iron speciation upon high-temperature treatment. Besides considerable extraction of Al from framework positions, resonance Raman spectroscopy points to changes {{in the structure of the}} iron oxide species of low nuclearity. A useful model is the reconstruction of charge-compensating cationic iron species to iron species stabilized by extraframework Al species located in the zeolite micropores. Further analysis of spectroscopic data suggests that oligonuclear, perhaps binuclear, iron sites appear most favorable for nitrous oxide decomposition, whereas the mononuclear iron sites are active for benzene hydroxylation to phenol.

30|$|Based on our {{understanding}} of the FESEM, EDX, micro-Raman, TG, and HRTEM analyses, the possibility of a nucleation-growth model of Fe-filled sphere-like GS to almost catalyst-free CNT is proposed as in Figure  3 as follows: A selected area in a large group of sphere-like GS structure was observed using HRTEM during exposure to heat under nitrogen ambient at 800 °C under varying synthesis times (Figure  3 a). The shape and diameter size of the Fe-graphene shell-CNT influenced by the synthesis time were investigated. Since the nature of the ferrocene compound consists of one iron atom, ten carbon atoms, and ten hydrogen atoms, in the first few minutes, cyclopentadienyl rings bound to the opposite sides of a central Fe atom break and decompose into free micro-sized Fe atomic cluster. At the same time, micro-sized Fe atomic cluster acts as a catalyst, promoting further growth on micro-sized Fe structure. Encapsulation of few-layer graphene consisting of free-carbon network due to the decomposition of camphor oil on micro-sized Fe structure surface was observed, as shown in Figure  3 b. However, recently, Schaper and co-workers reported that it was a formation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>iron</b> carbide (Fe 3 C) determined by the dissolution of carbon element in the quasi-liquid catalyst particle and its segregation in the form of graphitic layers in the case of super-saturation [40]. Recently, it was supported by Fedoseeva et al. [41] who also reported on the synthesis of defect-like carbon (also known as iron-containing rods covered by graphite-like shells and embedded into carbon matrix) by air oxidation and carbonization methods. As in Figures  6 b and 3 c, we could observe a portion of the nano-size Fe catalyst seeds from micro-size Fe catalyst domain. Thereby, the axial movements of nano-size Fe catalyst inside the sphere-like GS is due to the buildup competition between the interfacial force and the expulsive force between the graphitized tube walls and core material (micro-size Fe catalyst), respectively. On the other hand, during these structural transformations, the outer CNT diameter size remained almost constant due to compressive stress during the thickness growth of the graphitic tube walls. Ren et al. [42] proposed the thinner catalyst layer, producing thinner diameter size nanotubes. The length of a nanotube can be easily tailored by simply changing the synthesis time. Previous findings, such as those of Xiang et al. [43, 44], have theoretically and experimentally confirmed that higher synthesis time is beneficial with regard to growing longer CNT. Reit et al. [45] reported the length of nanotube was slightly increased as synthesis time was increased. As a result, the electrochemical performance of the CNT super-capacitor is dependent on synthesis time. One possible explanation why the synthesis time could affect the length of nanotube is presented here. The CNT growth increases rapidly once a carbon atom becomes sufficiently saturated onto the catalyst surface as illustrated in Figure  1 g. At current stage, it is found that our samples are free of camphor-feedstock diffusion resistance and Fe catalyst deactivation (i.e., causes the growth to decelerate), allowing CNT to grow on sphere-like GS surface. However, further investigation is needed to predict the critical length of CNT in different synthesis parameters, subjecting the CNT array to strong diffusion resistance. Moreover, further investigation is needed to demonstrate the possibility of cap-opening and cap-closing mechanisms as referred to in Figure  3 e,f. Finally, this mechanism demonstrates how nanotube growth is being made and supports the validity of the concept of carbon-through-metal diffusion and of the dissolution of carbon element in metal catalyst.|$|E
40|$|Context: Superluminous type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may be {{explained}} by super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions of rapidly rotating white dwarfs (WDs). In a preceding paper, we showed that the deflagration scenario applied to rapidly rotating WDs generates explosions that cannot explain the majority of SNe Ia. Aims: Rotation of the progenitor star allows super-Chandrasekhar-mass WDs to form that have a shallower density stratification. We use simple estimates of the production of <b>intermediate</b> and <b>iron</b> group elements in pure detonations of rapidly rotating WDs to assess their viability in explaining rare SNe Ia. Methods: We numerically construct WDs in hydrostatic equilibrium that rotate according to a variety of rotation laws. The explosion products are estimated by considering the density stratification and by evaluating the result of hydrodynamics simulations. Results: We show that a significant amount of intermediate mass elements is produced for theoretically motivated rotation laws, even for prompt detonations of WDs. Conclusions: Rapidly rotating WDs that detonate may provide an explanation of rare superluminous SNe Ia in terms of both burning species and explosion kinematics.

40|$|Thioglycolate-induced murine peritoneal macrophages {{infected}} with Ehrlichia risticii and treated in vitro with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) developed antiehrlichial activity that eliminated the intracellular bacteria. This antiehrlichial activity was suppressed by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis from L-arginine, {{but not by}} L-tryptophan. Increased levels of nitrite, an oxidative product of nitric oxide, were measured in cultures of infected macrophages treated with IFN-gamma. Sodium nitroprusside, which spontaneously releases nitric oxide, also showed the antiehrlichial activity. The antiehrlichial activity by reactive nitrogen intermediates was not mediated by elevation of the cellular concentration of cyclic GMP since the addition of 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP itself had no influence on ehrlichial infection of macrophages. Addition of the intracellular iron chelator deferoxamine also inhibited E. risticii infection in vitro. These results suggest that intracellular E. risticii survival is iron dependent and that production of reactive nitrogen <b>intermediates</b> triggers <b>iron</b> loss from critical target enzymes of E. risticii, leading to lethal metabolic inhibition. However, addition of excess FeSO 4, ferric citrate, or iron-saturated transferrin did not counteract the antiehrlichial effect induced by IFN-gamma...|$|R
