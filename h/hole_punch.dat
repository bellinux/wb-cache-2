50|$|A typical <b>hole</b> <b>punch,</b> {{whether a}} single or {{multiple}} <b>hole</b> <b>punch,</b> {{has a long}} lever {{which is used to}} push a bladed cylinder straight through a number of sheets of paper. As the vertical travel distance of the cylinder is only a few millimeters, it can be positioned within a centimeter of the lever fulcrum. For low volume hole punches, the resulting lever need not be more than 8 cm for sufficient force.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hole</b> <b>punch</b> (also {{known as}} a hole puncher) is a common office tool {{that is used to}} create holes in sheets of paper, often for the purpose of {{collecting}} the sheets in a binder or folder. A leather punch, of different construction from one designed for paper, is used for leather goods, cloth, or thin plastic sheeting. <b>Hole</b> <b>punch</b> tools are also made for use on sheet metal, such as aluminum siding or metal air ducts.|$|E
40|$|Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} work on {{the presumption}} that all nodes in the network are connectable. However, NAT boxes and firewalls prevent connections to many nodes on the Internet. For UDP based protocols, the UDP hole-punching technique has been proposed to mitigate this problem. This paper presents {{a study of the}} efficacy of UDP <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> on the Internet {{in the context of an}} actual P 2 P network. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has provided similar measurements. Our results show that UDP <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> is an effective method to increase the connectability of peers on the Internet: approximately 64 % of all peers are behind a NAT box or firewall which should allow <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> to work, and more than 80 % of <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> attempts between these peers succeed.

40|$|J’fais des trous, des petits trous [...] . toujours des petits trous- S. Gainsbourg Network Address Translation (NAT) causes {{well-known}} difculties for peer-to-peer (P 2 P) communication, {{since the}} peers involved {{may not be}} reachable at any globally valid IP address. Several NAT traversal techniques are known, but their documentation is slim, and data about their robustness or relative merits is slimmer. This paper documents and analyzes one of the simplest but most ro-bust and practical NAT traversal techniques, commonly known as <b>hole</b> <b>punching.</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>punching</b> is moderately well-understood for UDP communication, but we show {{how it can be}} reliably used to set up peer-to-peer TCP streams as well. After gathering data on the reliability of this technique {{on a wide variety of}} deployed NATs, we nd that about 82 % of the NATs tested support <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> for UDP, and about 64 % support <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> for TCP streams. As NAT vendors become increasingly conscious of the needs of important P 2 P applications such as Voice over IP and online gaming protocols, support for <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> is likely to increase in the future. ...|$|R
