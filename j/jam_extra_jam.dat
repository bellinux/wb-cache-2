25|$|<b>Extra</b> <b>jam</b> {{is subject}} to {{somewhat}} stricter rules that set higher standards for the minimum fruit content (45% instead of 35% as a general rule, but lower for some fruits such as redcurrants and blackcurrants), as well specifying {{as the use of}} unconcentrated fruit pulp, and forbidding the mixture of certain fruits and vegetables with others.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} considers joint transmitter-receiver {{design in}} general multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where uplink and downlink use time-division duplex (TDD). We {{assume that there}} exist multiuser interference {{as well as other}} jamming signals in the system. The optimization strategy considered in this contribution represents one of the applications of the theory proposed in Lie-Liang-transmitter-receiver-VTC 07 -B, where the transmitters and receivers are respectively optimized in order to achieve their altruistic (O) -optimum and egocentric (E) -optimum solutions. Furthermore, a novel criterion of minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) is proposed for transmitter preprocessing. Our design motivates simple mobile terminals (MTs) with low-complexity. Our study and performance results show that the MPDR-assisted transmitter preprocessing is capable of efficiently suppressing the multiuser interference. However, joint transmitter-receiver optimization is required, in order to suppress the <b>extra</b> <b>jamming</b> signals...|$|R
40|$|Cherry (Prunus cerasus var. Oblačinska) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. Owing to the excellent sensory and physico-chemical characteristics and the very high concentration of biologically active ingredients, it is a very good potential for obtaining value added products or products with high content of bioactive, nutritionally and biologically valuable ingredients. The processing techniques of fresh fruit have a large influence on the content of bioactive components. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of processing technologies of sour cherries on the content of bioactive compounds (total phenols, total flavonoids and anthocyanins) and the antioxidant capacity. Products that were analysed were juice, concentrate, <b>extra</b> <b>jam</b> and lyophilisate. The content of bioactive components and antioxidant capacity of these products was compared with fresh cherries. The results showed that the greatest influence on the content of bioactive ingredients has process where vacuum concentration is applied. More sophisticated technology such as lyophilization would contribute to the retention of bioactive components and could increase product competitiveness at the market...|$|R
40|$|We {{design a}} jamming-resistant {{receiver}} scheme {{to enhance the}} robustness of a massive MIMO uplink system against jamming. We assume that a jammer attacks the system both in the pilot and data transmission phases. The key feature of the proposed scheme is that, in the pilot phase, we estimate not only the legitimate channel, but also the jamming channel by exploiting a purposely unused pilot sequence. The jamming channel estimate is used to constructed linear receive filters that reject {{the impact of the}} jamming signal. The performance of the proposed scheme is analytically evaluated using asymptotic properties of massive MIMO. The optimal regularized zero-forcing receiver and the optimal power allocation are also studied. Numerical results are provided to verify our analysis and show that the proposed scheme greatly improves the achievable rates, as compared to conventional receivers. Interestingly, the proposed scheme works particularly well under strong jamming attacks, since the improved estimate of the <b>jamming</b> channel outweighs the <b>extra</b> <b>jamming</b> power.

5000|$|Polyester is {{the most}} recent film base to have been developed. It was first used for {{specialized}} photography applications in 1955, {{but it was only}} in the 1990s that it became overwhelmingly popular for motion picture prints. It is highly preferable for post-production, exhibition, and archival purposes because of its flexibility, strength, and stability. Its strength is sometimes also seen as a disadvantage, however, in that polyester-base films are so resistant to breakage that they are often more likely to break the film equipment should a <b>jam</b> or <b>extra</b> tension occur. Movie cameras therefore do not use this base for shooting the original camera negative, as it is vastly preferable and less costly in time and money for the film to break instead (besides which, cameras require [...] "short-pitch" [...] BH [...] "negative" [...] perforations and a lap-spliceable triacetate base, whereas projectors customarily require [...] "long-pitch" [...] KS [...] "positive" [...] perforations with either triacetate or polyester base—polyester base being the current practice).|$|R

On this occasion, the middle jam-section was interrupted when Wright's Hammond suddenly failed, resulting in the remaining three members of the band continuing to <b>jam</b> for an <b>extra</b> fifteen minutes while waiting for the instrument to be repaired.

50|$|After {{the release}} of the Teenage Depression album, which gave them their first {{appearance}} in the UK Albums Chart, they recorded another EP called Live - At the Sound Of Speed. During the gig from which this EP was recorded, Graeme Douglas (formerly of the Kursaal Flyers) joined the band onstage and <b>jammed</b> along adding <b>extra</b> lead lines. Afterwards his membership of the band was made permanent, and they set about writing and recording for their second album. The live recording of the Sound of Speed EP featured Douglas on only one track, he therefore set about recording additional lead guitar overdubs in the studio, though to keep in with the essence of a live release, he was only given one attempt at recording each song.|$|R
