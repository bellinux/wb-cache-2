5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
25|$|The Great Heck rail crash {{happened}} on 28 February 2001, at 06:13 after Gary Hart, a sleep-deprived driver, swerved off the M62 onto the East Coast Main Line near Selby.

Since 2005, Clemens has also {{appeared in}} many commercials for Texas-based supermarket chain H-E-B. In 2007, he appeared on a baseball-themed episode of MythBusters ("Baseball Myths"). He has also starred in a recent commercial for Cingular parodying his return from retirement. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> his wife, Debra Godfrey, and a dropped call resulted in his return to the Yankees.|$|E

50|$|The Upanishad {{states that}} Rudra is {{resident}} {{in the soul}} in the heart. In chapter 4, the text offers mystical explanations to why Rudra is described the way <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> Om, states the text, because when uttered he makes Prana go upwards. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the holy <b>call</b> because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the essence of all the Vedas. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> all prevading because he permeates {{the silence of the}} universe. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> infinite because when uttered there is no end of it in any dimension, states the text.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> protecting, because <b>he</b> {{removes the}} fear of rebirth and suffering. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> subtle, asserts the text, because uttering him makes the limbs tinge. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the highest Brahman because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the highest of the highest, the highest goal, the {{strength}} that strengthens the strong. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the one because everything ends in him and he unites all creatures. He, asserts the text <b>is</b> <b>called</b> the exalted Maheshwara because from him all the Vedas flow and in him is raised through {{the perception of the}} Atman (soul, self) and the mastery of Yoga.|$|R
25|$|Operation Hardnose was a Central Intelligence Agency-run espionage {{operation}} spying {{upon the}} Ho Chi Minh trail that began during the Laotian Civil War. Started in Summer 1963, it soon {{attracted the attention}} of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. By December 1963, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> for its expansion. Operation Hardnose expanded and continued to report on the Ho Chi Minh trail even as American military intelligence activities mounted against the communist supply artery. In an attempt to adapt technology for use by illiterate Lao Theung, some of the U.S. Air Force's survival radios were modified by the CIA for use by their spies.|$|E
25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the names}} were based on [...] "Southern puns", and it took Chun a while to {{think of all the}} names. All of the props, cards, and box were {{designed}} by the series' prop department. The producers tried to market the game as a real product, although that never came to fruition. Chun crafted the cold open after being inspired by the second season episode [...] "The Fight" [...] because he wanted to see more [...] "Karate Dwight". In the original version of the open, the scripted featured Dwight and Michael kicking each other in the groin. Jennifer Celotta, however, suggested that Dwight fight himself. The episode guest-stars Andy Buckley, who plays David Wallace. Buckley appears only via the telephone, and recorded his lines in the annex of the set, to give the illusion that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> from a long ways away.|$|E

500|$|In 1808, Cuvier {{identified}} a fossil found in Maastricht {{as a giant}} marine reptile that would later be named Mosasaurus. He also identified, from a drawing, another fossil found in Bavaria as a flying reptile and named it Pterodactylus. He speculated, based on the strata in which these fossils were found, that large reptiles had lived prior to what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> [...] "the age of mammals". Cuvier's speculation would be supported {{by a series of}} finds that would be made in Great Britain {{over the course of the}} next two decades. Mary Anning, a professional fossil collector since age eleven, collected the fossils of a number of marine reptiles from the Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis. These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized as such, which was collected in 1811, and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found in 1821 and 1823. Many of her discoveries would be described scientifically by the geologists William Conybeare, Henry De la Beche, and William Buckland. It was Anning who observed that stony objects known as [...] "bezoar stones" [...] were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons, and she noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. This led her to suggest to Buckland that they were fossilized feces, which he named coprolites, and which he used to better understand ancient food chains.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, {{announced}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> a General Election at [...] "The Mount" [...] in Tettenhall Wood.

2500|$|A warrant {{was issued}} in Zimbabwe for Olonga's arrest {{on charges of}} treason. Death threats made him go {{temporarily}} into hiding, and then into exile in England after Zimbabwe's last match of the tournament, against Sri Lanka in East London. [...] A knee injury forced his retirement from first-class cricket later in 2003, but he has played occasional matches since 2005 for the Lashings World XI.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{exhaustive}} {{discussion of the}} production of this material is the 1862 LeConte text. He was writing with {{the express purpose of}} increasing production in the Confederate States to support their needs during the American Civil War. Since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> for the assistance of rural farming communities, the descriptions and instructions are both simple and explicit. He details the [...] "French Method", along with several variations, as well as a [...] "Swiss method". N.B.

2500|$|Later in {{the same}} month Patrick again came under fire, this time for {{contacting}} Citigroup Executive Committee chair and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin {{on behalf of the}} financially beleaguered mortgage company Ameriquest, a subsidiary of ACC Capital Holdings, that had been accused of predatory lending practices and of which Patrick is a former board member. Both Citigroup and ACC Capital Holdings have substantial holdings in Massachusetts. Patrick attempted to deflect criticism, claiming <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> not as governor but as a private citizen. Later Patrick backed down, stating [...] "I appreciate that I should not have made the call. I regret the mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) {{is both a}} psychotherapeutic {{system of}} theory and {{practices}} and a school of thought established by Albert Ellis. Ellis first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956 then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled [...] "Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology", in which he set the foundation for what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> Rational Therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from Rudolf Dreikurs and others about {{the similarities and differences}} with Alfred Adler's Individual psychology. This was around a decade before psychiatrist Aaron Beck first set forth his [...] "cognitive therapy", after Ellis had contacted him in the mid 1960s. Ellis' own approach was renamed to Rational Emotive Therapy in 1959, then to the current term in 1992.|$|E

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> also {{referred}} to as Lord of Lothlórien or Lord of the Wood interchangeably.

2500|$|Danny Tidwell {{was born}} in Norfolk, Virginia and raised in nearby Virginia Beach. His early {{childhood}} was turbulent, and he sometimes got into trouble. [...] Tidwell started dancing {{at the age of}} eight in an after-school program for at-risk youth. Local dance instructor Vicky Cooke took notice of the [...] "little bit of a kid in a straddle, trying to reach his fingers to his toes", and after the program closed, Cooke mentioned the boy to Denise Wall. The two women decided to accept him to their studio, Denise Wall’s Dance Energy, for free. Over the next couple of years, Wall took a personal interest in Tidwell, {{and by the time he}} was ten, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> Wall [...] "Mom" [...] and her other sons (Scotty, Travis, Tyler and Shannon) his brothers. She found out that the boy would often walk part or all of the ten miles (16km) home after dance class, had little adult supervision outside of the studio, and, at one point, had not been registered in school for months. [...] He lived with his biological mother and two sisters until he was ten, before moving in with Wall; she officially took custody of Tidwell at the age of twelve.|$|E
2500|$|Jones was {{not only}} a consummately skilled golfer but {{exemplified}} the principles of sportsmanship and fair play. In {{the first round of the}} 1925 U.S. Open at the Worcester Country Club near Boston, his approach shot to the 11th hole's elevated green fell short into the deep rough of the embankment. As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner Walter Hagen and the USGA official covering their match that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play. [...] After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated Rule 18, moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones' self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost. Although praised by many sports writers for his gesture, Jones was reported to have said, [...] "You might as well praise me for not robbing banks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone {{argued that}} the Kentucky {{resolution}} might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. [...] In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, [...] "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien and Sedition Acts would [...] "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood." [...] Historian Ron Chernow says of this [...] "he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government {{of which he was}} vice president." [...] Jefferson [...] "thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution." [...] Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. [...] Historian Garry Wills argued [...] "Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [...] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure" [...] The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was [...] "deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if [...] "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", they would [...] "dissolve the union or produce coercion". [...] The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. Future president James Garfield, {{at the close of the}} Civil War, said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution [...] "contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits".|$|E

2500|$|Sullivan praised Elvis {{at the end}} of the show, saying [...] "This is a real decent, fine boy. We've {{never had}} a pleasanter {{experience}} on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right"—a remark that could either be interpreted as a [...] "ringing endorsement" [...] that [...] "legitimized the singer with an adult audience" [...] or as [...] "a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show." [...] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, [...] "The way Elvis looked out at us at that moment, I thought I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing." [...] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, [...] "had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.") Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> me, at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hart was {{notorious for}} pulling {{elaborate}} [...] "ribs" [...] (pranks) on fellow wrestlers. During a shoot interview Tony Norris, who wrestled in the WWF during the mid-90's as Ahmed Johnson and faced Hart {{in the ring}} on many occasions, stated that he had {{received a phone call}} saying he was to be featured as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. After spending a large amount of money on new clothes for the occasion, he was told a limousine was to pick him up and deliver him to the studio. After waiting a seemingly long time, he says that Hart appeared and asked him why he wasn't at the show yet. Norris, suspicious as to how Hart could've known about his guest appearance as he had not told anyone, said that Hart was then on the ground laughing; he then realized that Hart was behind the ruse and there was no guest spot on The Tonight Show. Despite this, Norris spoke very highly of Hart and said that he had loved working with him. During the segments of wrestlers sharing stories about Hart during the RAW IS OWEN broadcast following his death, Shane McMahon mentions Hart and himself taking his brother Bret's wrestling boots and hiding them in a shower. Shane mentioned he was fearful of what Bret would do when he found out. In his autobiography, his brother Bret spoke of a time when he, their father Stu, and Bret's oldest daughter Jade were in a hotel room during the WrestleMania IV weekend when Stu received a phone call apparently from former bodybuilder and wrestler Reg Park, who said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>calling</b> from the hotel's lobby. [...] Having been acquaintances before, Stu was originally cordial until Park supposedly began accusing him of cowardice and challenging him to a confrontation. [...] Bret mentions Stu becoming extremely irritated to the point of anger and was ready to meet Park face to face until he slammed the phone down, mentioning that it was Owen all along.|$|E
