40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in <b>determining</b> <b>constituent</b> trends from the ER- 2 flight data is {{the large amount of}} day to day variability generated by the motion of the polar vortex. To reduce this variability, the observations have been transformed into the conservative (Lagrangian) reference frames consisting of the coordinate pairs, potential temperature (PT) and potential vorticity (PV), or PT and N 2 O. The requirement of only two independent coordinates rests on the assumption that constituent distributions and their chemical processes are nearly zonal in that coordinate system. Flight data is used everywhere for these transformation except for potential vorticity. Potential vorticity is determined from level flight segments, and NMC PV values during flight dives and takeoffs are combined with flight data in a smooth fashion...|$|E

40|$|We apply color-spin and flavor-spin quark-quark {{interactions}} to the meson and baryon constituent quarks, and calculate constituent quark masses, {{as well as}} {{the coupling}} constants of these interactions. The main goal of this paper was to <b>determine</b> <b>constituent</b> quark masses from light and open bottom hadron masses, using the fitting method we have developed and clustering of hadron groups. We use color-spin Fermi-Breit (FB) and flavor-spin Glozman-Riska (GR) hyperfine interaction (HFI) to <b>determine</b> <b>constituent</b> quark masses (especially $b$ quark mass). Another aim was to discern between the FB and GR HFI because our previous findings had indicated that both interactions were satisfactory. Our improved fitting procedure of constituent quark masses showed that on average color-spin (Fermi-Breit) hyperfine interaction yields better fits. The method also shows the way how the constituent quark masses and the strength of the interaction constants appear in different hadron environments. Comment: 15 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore an {{alternative}} approach for <b>determining</b> <b>constituent</b> weights for equity indices. This approach makes use of alternative definitions of company size, and {{is referred to as}} Fundamental Indexation (Arnott et al (2005)). Based upon a data set that comprises the largest 1, 000 US stocks for each year in our sample, our results show that between 1968 and 2011 the fundamental index alternatives that we consider have out-performed a comparable index constructed {{on the basis of the}} market capitalisation of the index constituents in risk-adjusted terms. Our Monte Carlo experiments show that this superior risk-adjusted performance cannot be attributed easily to luck. We also find that although the superior performance is achieved with higher constituent turnover than required using the Market-cap approach to index construction, the turnover is lower, and in some cases much lower, than required by some of the heuristic and optimised index construction techniques that we explored in our last paper. Finally, we find that although the application of a simple market-timing rule does not enhance the returns on these fundamentally-weighted indices very significantly, it does reduce the volatility of their returns and their maximum drawdown quite considerably...|$|E
