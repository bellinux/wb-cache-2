Fortunately for Jourdan, Marceau and Bernadotte capably held off the Austrian advance guards long enough for the French left wing to barely get away. Meanwhile, Castelverd withdrew into Neuwied's {{bridgehead}} where his troops were secure behind prepared fortifications. On 19 September, as the last French columns were still filing through Altenkirchen, Jourdan ordered Marceau to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> little longer with Poncet's division. During the fighting Marceau was fatally hit by a bullet and died early the next morning.|$|E

500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

500|$|Confusion {{had been}} caused by the {{original}} attacking divisions on the ridge, having control over the artillery which covered the area occupied by the reserve divisions down the eastern slope. The arrangement had been intended to protect the ridge from large German counter-attacks, which might force the reserve divisions back up the slope. The mistaken bombardments of friendly troops ended late on 9 June, when the New Zealand, 16th (Irish) and 36th (Ulster) divisions were withdrawn into reserve and the normal corps organisation was restored; anticipated large German counter-attacks had not occurred. On 10 June, the attack down the Blauwepoortbeek began but met strong resistance from the fresh German 11th Division, brought in from Group Ypres. The 3rd Australian Division advanced [...] either side the river Douve, consolidating their <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rise around Thatched Cottage, which secured the right flank of the new Messines position; early on 11 June, the Germans evacuated the Blauwepoortbeek sector. British observation from the Oosttaverne line proved to be poor, which led Plumer to order a further advance down the slope. On 14 June, the II Anzac Corps was to push forward on the right from Plugstreet Wood to Trois Tilleuls Farm and [...] and another [...] to the Gapaard spur and Ferme de la Croix. IX Corps was to take Joye Farm, the Wambeke hamlet and come level with the Australians at Delporte Farm; X Corps was to capture the Spoil Bank and the areas adjacent. The attack was forestalled by a German retirement {{on the night of}} [...] and by 14 June, British advanced posts had been established without resistance.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street {{and some of}} the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead.

[...] Washington, D.C., the Mojave Desert and Fox's soundstages in Los Angeles also served as locations. The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X-Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had [...] "never worked under such time pressure". The film cost approximately $160million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140million.|$|E
2500|$|According to Benny Morris, {{the result}} of these {{five and a half}} months of {{fighting}} was a [...] "decisive Jewish victory".

2500|$|Although veteran Drew Bledsoe was {{the initial}} starter at quarterback, fourth-year backup Tony Romo {{replaced}} Bledsoe at half-time of their week 7 matchup with the Giants. Romo became the starter in week 8 due to Bledsoe's rough starts with frequent sacks and interceptions. [...] Romo initially played very well, going 5–1 {{in his first}} six NFL starts, including a win over the previously unbeaten Indianapolis Colts, but finished the season 1–3 with six TDs, six interceptions and two fumbles lost. [...] The Cowboys secured a playoff berth {{for the first time}} since 2003, but did not win the division when in the final week they were defeated by the then 2–13 Lions, and wound up losing their first week in the playoffs to the Seattle Seahawks, a game in which Romo botched the <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> go-ahead field goal inside the final two minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon asked Anna Chennault {{to be his}} [...] "channel to Mr. Thieu" [...] {{in order}} to advise him to refuse {{participation}} in the talks. Thieu was promised a better deal under a Nixon administration. Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu {{had no intention of}} attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: [...] "I have just heard from my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [...] is going to win. And you tell your boss [...] to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> while longer." [...] In 1997, Chennault admitted that [...] "I was constantly in touch with Nixon and Mitchell." [...] The effort also involved Texas Senator John Tower and Kissinger, who traveled to Paris on behalf of the Nixon campaign. William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained [...] "no useful inside information" [...] from his trip to Paris, and [...] "almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion". While Kissinger may have [...] "hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation," [...] this sort of [...] "self-promotion....is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Horace's Hellenistic {{background}} is {{clear in his}} Satires, even though the genre was unique to Latin literature. He brought to it a style and outlook suited to the social and ethical issues confronting Rome but he changed its role from public, social engagement to private meditation. Meanwhile, {{he was beginning to}} interest Octavian's supporters, a gradual process described by him in one of his satires. The way was opened for him by his friend, the poet Virgil, who had gained admission into the privileged circle around Maecenas, Octavian's lieutenant, following the success of his [...] Eclogues. An introduction soon followed and, after a discreet interval, Horace too was accepted. He depicted the process as an honourable one, based on merit and mutual respect, eventually leading to true friendship, and {{there is reason to believe}} that his relationship was genuinely friendly, not just with Maecenas but afterwards with Augustus as well. On the other hand, the poet has been unsympathetically described by one scholar as [...] "a sharp and rising young man, with an eye to the main chance." [...] There were advantages on both sides: Horace gained encouragement and material support, the politicians gained a <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> potential dissident. His republican sympathies, and his role at Philippi, may have caused him some pangs of remorse over his new status. However most Romans considered the civil wars to be the result of contentio dignitatis, or rivalry between the foremost families of the city, and he too seems to have accepted the principate as Rome's last hope for much needed peace.|$|E
