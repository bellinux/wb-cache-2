40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 41) 6061 aluminum is a precipitation hardenable alloy that is {{used extensively}} in structural applications. Large ring shaped parts fabricated from 6061 are often rolled from annealed flat stock. A welding operation is required to join {{the ends of the}} part after shaping. The part is then precipitation hardened to bring the 6061 alloy up to the T 6 condition. Unfortunately, the weld metals commonly used to join 6061 do not achieve the same hardness as the parent metal in the T 6 condition. In this study the effects of weld rod type, welding procedure, and postweld heat treatments were examined. Four different weld rods were used to join 6061 samples. The welding was done with and without a water chi lied fixture attached to the specimens being welded. Welded specimens were aged using ten different heat treatment cycles that included 9900 F or 9700 F solution treatments and natural or artificial aging at 3200 F or 3500 F. The 6061 parent material relies on a Magnesium Silicide precipitate for hardening effects. Three of the weld rods used, (X 4643, 5356, & 5556), have similar AI-Mg-Si alloy constituents. The fourth rod, 4043, is a AI-Si alloy. The X 4643 weld rod was the only weld alloy to match the T 6 condition of the 6061 parent metal after aging.

Particularly {{in the case of}} the Ni-based superalloys, LAM processes can produce highly complex shape components more cheaply with respect to the traditional technologies. However, nowadays, there is still a lack of knowledge on the study of the process parameters on the microstructure and densification levels and the study of tailored heat treatments to meet standard qualification as well as precise industrial requirements. This thesis presents the research performed on two Ni-based superalloys produced by LAM processes. Inconel 625 (IN 625) fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) and Hastelloy X (HX) built by LPBF. For LPBF IN 625 alloy was studied the effect of different process parameters on the hardness and densification level, obtaining dense samples (relative density over 99. 8 %). Afterward, it was studied in detail the microstructure, mechanical and thermomechanical properties of as-built IN 625. The results showed that the tensile behaviours of as-built IN 625 state are higher than minimum values requirements for wrought IN 625 alloys, due to very <b>fine</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> (mainly less than 1. 5 micron) coupled with high dislocation density. However, the characterisation of as-built IN 625 samples revealed that heat treatments are necessary to decrease the residual stresses, reduce elements segregation, and produce mechanical properties suitable for industrial applications. For this reason, the microstructural evolution of LPBF IN 625 under different heat treatments was investigated. According to the performed heat treatment, the mechanical properties of heat-treated IN 625 were influenced by phases precipitation (mainly γʺ phases and carbides) and/or recrystallisation, grain growth and dissolution of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures.</b> For DED IN 625 alloy, the aim of this work was to determine the impact of different process parameters on the densification level (relative density over 99. 7 %), hardness and microstructure in order to select the appropriate parameters for industrial production. Finally, LPBF HX alloy was studied in a research collaboration with GE AVIO s. r. l. The target of this work was to investigate the microstructure of as-built and post-processed LPBF HX alloy. The as-built HX samples showed different microcracks caused by the LPBF process, so some samples were hot isostatically pressed (HIPed) to close the microcracks. The microstructure, grain size, phases and hardness of the as-built, heat-treated and HIPed HX samples were investigated.

40|$|Currently, {{intricate}} {{problems of}} surface treatment {{can be solved}} through precision cladding using advanced laser technology. However, {{the high price of}} CO(sub 2) and Nd:YAG lasers, the effort required for beam guiding as well as the low absorption of the CO(sub 2) irradiation limit the applications. In light of this, a new and promising solution is provided by the current availability of high-power diode lasers: it makes laser cladding essentially more efficient and practicable. By one- step cladding with a 1. 4 kW diode laser, protection layers of Co-based alloys, a carbide-reinforced Ni alloy, and alumina can be deposited onto steels and aluminium based light alloys. The width of single tracks is up to 5 mm, with a layer thickness of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm. For tasks of repair and remanufacturing, multilayer stacking of metal alloys can be easily performed. The layers are dense and with a <b>fine</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure</b> and are metallurgically or chemically bonded to the substrate. For the Co- and Ni-based alloys, the cladding rate is 0. 5 kg/h. This high value is due to the higher absorption degree of the 0. 94 µm diode irradiation compared to the 10. 6 µm CO(sub 2) irradiation. Comparison of the cladding results for tracks produced with CO(sub 2) and diode lasers has shown that 1. 4 kW diode power is equivalent to 3. 9 kW CO(sub 2) laser power. Thus, the absorption obviously increases by a factor of at least 2. 5. In addition to the higher efficiency, the resulting tracks appear to be of better quality.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} observed {{that there is}} a performance gap between the corrosion resistance of thermally sprayed coatings and the equivalent bulk material. This is attributed to the significantly modified microstructure of the sprayed coatings. However, currently there is no detailed understanding of which aspects of microstructural modification are primarily responsible for this performance gap. In this work several deliberately microstructurally modified versions of the Ni-based superalloy Inconel 625 were produced. These were subjected to potentiodynamic electrochemical testing in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 to investigate the links between specific microstructural features and electrochemical behaviour. Samples were prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying, laser surface remelting using a high power diode laser and conventional powder sintering. Microstructural features were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Potentiodynamic testing was carried out on the following forms of Inconel 625 : wrought sheet; HVOF sprayed coatings; sintered powder compacts; laser melted wrought sheet and HVOF sprayed coatings. Using the corrosion behaviour, i. e. passive current density, of the wrought sheet as a baseline, the performance of different forms of Inconel 625 were compared. It is found that a <b>fine</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure</b> (with associated microsegregation) produced by laser remelting wrought sheet has no significant effect on corrosion performance. Up to 12 % porosity in sintered powder samples increases the passive current density by a factor of only around 2. As observed previously, the passive current density of HVOF sprayed coatings is 20 - 40 times greater. However, HVOF coatings subjected to laser surface remelting are found to have a passive current density close to that of wrought material. It is concluded that, whilst porosity in coatings produces some decrease in corrosion resistance, the main contributing factor is the galvanic corrosion of localised Cr-depleted regions which are associated with oxide inclusions within HVOF sprayed samples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Laser {{surface melting}} (LSM) of {{aluminum}} alloy 6013 was conducted using a high power Nd-YAG laser under nitrogen gas {{with the aim}} of improving the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance of the alloy. The SCC behavior was studied in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution using a slow strain rate test (SSRT). A laser-melted layer in the order of 500 µm thick was produced, which consists of <b>fine</b> <b>dendritic</b> and cellular <b>structures</b> with some Al-Si-Cu-Fe-Mn phase particles formed at interdentritic boundaries. The results of the SSRT test showed that the susceptibility of the alloy to SCC, in terms of total elongation to failure, was decreased after the laser surface modification. This was considered to be attributed to the presence of the laser-formed AlN film, which acted as a barrier to the ingress of the corrosive Cl- into the material and enhanced the pitting resistance of the material. An examination of the fractured surface indicated that the crack propagation path, in the early stage of SCC, was along the tortuous dendrite and cell boundaries. This caused the crack path deviated from the growing direction and resulted in a longer crack length covered before failure thus increasing the overall crack propagation resistance...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The initial experiments consisting in alloying the {{hot work tool steel}} indicate to the clear influence of the laser power on the run face shape and its depth. Findings: The structure of material solidifying after laser remelting is characteristic of the diversified morphology connected with the repeated changes of the crystals’ growth direction, from the small dendrites, whose principal axes are oriented in accordance with the heat removal directions at the boundary between the solid and liquid phases, clusters of carbides arranged in accordance with the swirls caused by the metallic liquid convection motion, and partially non-remelted WC conglomerates as the alloying material in the central area of the remelted zone, to the fine equiaxial grains in the subsurface zone. Research limitations/implications: Laser remelting and alloying with the tungsten carbide results in refinement of the structure in the entire laser power range and in diversification of the grain size in the particular surface layer zones. Practical implications: Laser alloying has the important cognitive significance and gives grounds to the practical employment of these technologies for forming the surfaces of new tools and regeneration of the used ones. Originality/value: The <b>fine</b> grained, <b>dendritic</b> <b>structure</b> occurs in the remelted and alloyed zone with the crystallization direction connected with the dynamical heat abstraction from the laser beam influence zone. The fine grained martensite structure is responsible for hardness increase of the alloyed layer...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} the fragile X mental {{retardation}} protein (FMRP), encoded by the FMR 1 gene, is responsible for pathologic manifestations in the Fragile X Syndrome, the most frequent cause of inherited mental retardation. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein associated with polysomes {{as part of a}} messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. Although its function is poorly understood, various observations suggest a role in local protein translation at neuronal dendrites and in dendritic spine maturation. We present here the identification of CYFIP 1 / 2 (Cytoplasmic FMRP Interacting Proteins) as FMRP interactors. CYFIP 1 / 2 share 88 % amino acid sequence identity and represent the two members in humans of a highly conserved protein family. Remarkably, whereas CYFIP 2 also interacts with the FMRP-related proteins FXR 1 P/ 2 P, CYFIP 1 interacts exclusively with FMRP, FMRP-CYFIP interaction involves the domain of FMRP also mediating homo- and heteromerization, thus suggesting a competition between interaction among the FXR proteins and interaction with CYFIP, CYFIP 1 / 2 are proteins of unknown function, but CYFIP 1 has recently been shown to interact with the small GTPase Rad, which is implicated in development and maintenance of neuronal structures. Consistent with FMRP and Rad localization in <b>dendritic</b> <b>fine</b> <b>structures,</b> CYFIP 1 / 2 are present in synaptosomal extracts. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{dendrite}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} esthetically pleasing structures, with the best-known example being snowflakes. Although the formation of dendrites has been studied for centuries, the way to control their growth is limited. Here we report an attempt to manipulate the growth of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> via controlling chemical diffusion and reaction. The silver <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> are synthesized by reducing silver ions in solution. The diffusion of chemical agents is regulated by changing the viscosity of the solution while the reaction is regulated by adding acids. The decrease of reaction rate leads to the disappearance of side branch of dendrites while the reduction of diffusion rate shortens the main trunk of dendrites. The silver dendrites are finely tuned by chemical diffusion and reaction. Following studies suggest that diffusion and reaction determines the chemical concentration around the growth fronts, which influences the growth of crystal structures, leading to the formation of diverse silver <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures.</b> The findings in this study indicate that chemical diffusion and reaction are two effective tools to regulate <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures,</b> promising a different way to promote or prevent the growth of <b>dendritic</b> <b>structures</b> in industries.
