25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're <b>just</b> <b>playing</b> dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E

An often-told story {{from this time}} period is that Ginger decided {{to start his own}} band after falling {{down a flight of stairs}} with a bottle of Jack Daniel's but {{emerging}} with the bottle intact. Had the bottle smashed, he would have slit his wrists with the shards, but instead he resolved to form a band in which he could exercise his songwriting skills, rather than <b>just</b> <b>playing</b> guitar as in his previous bands. Throughout the band's career, Ginger has written almost all the songs himself.|$|E
25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words {{are as important as}} the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve <b>just</b> <b>playing</b> or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E
25|$|The band {{opened the}} 1983 Monsters of Rock festival at Donington, and {{supported}} Black Sabbath on their 'Born Again' European tour. After getting dropped by MCA in January 1984 Diamond Head started {{work on their}} fourth studio album, entitled Flight East. Although never released, five tracks (Be Good, A New Messiah, Someone Waiting, Today and Back In The Powerage) emerged on bootleg and shows the band totally changing direction with the dropping of all the characteristic signature guitar solos and heavy dynamic riffs. The change in the band's musical direction was with the duo becoming bored of <b>just</b> <b>playing</b> Heavy Metal and {{felt that it was}} time to change. Another change the band made at the time was Brian switching from his Flying V to a Gibson Les Paul. Harris' lyrics had also taken a religious route, as with one of the new songs A New Messiah. After little interest from any record label to pick up the project (and with no money coming in) the band fell apart and in 1985 Tatler and Harris decided to take a break from one another.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{research}} has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: trivialisation, dissociation, embarrassment association, busy working priority, compliance with a competitive norm, audience modelling, and responsibility transfer. In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) noticing that something is wrong, i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) interpreting a need for help—sometimes children think others are <b>just</b> <b>playing</b> rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) feeling empathy, i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) processing the school's moral frames—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) scanning for social status and relations, i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) condensing motives for action, such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs, and (g) acting, i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.|$|E

Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way: [...] "The Europeans took our game and evolved it, while we stood still or even went backwards. [...] The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that... There was this hockey world evolving through international competition, and we're back here, stuck, <b>just</b> <b>playing</b> ourselves. [...] It was a business monopoly. [...] And like any monopoly, the NHL got stagnant." [...] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe, and emphasized conditioning and skills development.|$|E

Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment.
