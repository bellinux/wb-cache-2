3000|$|III-V-based alloys and heterostructures {{have been}} {{attracting}} much interest {{because of their}} great device applications {{as well as their}} fundamental importance. A major issue of composing III-V-based systems is the miscibility gap in solids[1]. It is known that the mixing enthalpy of the systems, such as GaAs-GaSb and GaP-GaSb, is proportional to the square of the difference in lattice constant of the two end binary components of the system[2]. This reason prohibits the epitaxial growth of most alloys at ordinary growth temperatures[3]. Therefore, the epitaxial growth of these systems was not achieved until the first growth of GaAs-GaSb was done in 1979 by carrying out the growth under a high-supersaturation condition, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)[4].

30|$|We have {{performed}} transport measurements on a <b>gallium</b> phosphide <b>antimonide</b> (GaPSb) film grown on GaAs. At low temperatures (T), transport {{is governed by}} three-dimensional Mott variable range hopping (VRH) due to strong localization. Therefore, electron–electron interactions are not significant in GaPSb. With increasing T, the coexistence of VRH conduction and the activated behavior with a gap of 20 meV is found. The fact that the measured gap {{is comparable to the}} thermal broadening at room temperature (approximately 25 meV) demonstrates that electrons can be thermally activated in an intrinsic GaPSb film. Moreover, the observed carrier density dependence on temperature also supports the coexistence of VRH and the activated behavior. It is shown that the carriers are delocalized either with increasing temperature or magnetic field in GaPSb. Our new experimental results provide important information regarding GaPSb which may well lay the foundation for possible GaPSb-based device applications such as in high-electron-mobility transistor and heterojunction bipolar transistors.|$|R

In {{the first method}} nano-structures are realized by self-organization using mask-less dry-etching. GaSb cone structures are achieved with a maximum density of 1. 2 · 10 11 cm- 2. During etching a 5 nm thick amorphous Ga layer is formed, also the surface oxidizes immediately under atmosphere, {{and as a consequence}} the dots are optoelectronically inactive, thus no photoluminescence (PL) can be achieved. Several attempts are made to revoke these effects, but the nanostructures stay inactive. In the second approach self-assembled optoelectronically active GaAsSb QDs are grown on GaAs in Stranski-Krastanov mode. With these QDs efficient lasers are grown, exemplarily with an emission wavelength around 900 nm. In pulsed mode a minimum threshold current density of jth = 121. 7 A/cm 2 and a maximum in differential quantum efficiency of ηd = 0. 66 are measured at T = 130 K.

50|$|Indium <b>gallium</b> {{arsenide}} <b>antimonide</b> (InGaAsSb) is {{a compound}} III-V semiconductor. (InxGa1−xAsySb1−y) The addition of GaAs {{allows for a}} narrower bandgap (0.5 to 0.6 eV), and therefore better absorption of long wavelengths. Specifically, the bandgap was engineered to 0.55 eV. With this bandgap, the compound achieved a photon-weighted internal quantum efficiency of 79% with a fill factor of 65% for a black body at 1100 °C. This was for a device grown on a GaSb substrate by organometallic vapour phase epitaxy (OMVPE). Devices have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of these devices are approaching 90%, while devices grown by the other two techniques exceed 95%. The largest problem with InGaAsSb cells is phase separation. Compositional inconsistencies throughout the device degrade its performance. When phase separation can be avoided, the IQE and fill factor of InGaAsSb approach theoretical limits in wavelength ranges near the bandgap energy. However, the Voc/Eg ratio {{is far from the}} ideal. Current methods to manufacture InGaAsSb PVs are expensive and not commercially viable.|$|R

40|$|The {{inherent}} low conductivity {{of metals}} and low skin depth at terahertz (THz) frequencies and above decrease antennas radiation efficiency at such high frequencies. In {{addition to the}} high surface impedance, due to the small dimensions of metallic antennas at THz frequencies and above can further reduce the radiation efficiency. Nevertheless, attention has been drawn to metallic antennas {{that are designed to}} operate at optical frequencies due to their ability to create substantial field confinement and enhancement at their terminals. In this thesis, a highly conductive nanomaterial, Bundled Carbon Nanotubes (BCNTs) is examined to overcome the low efficiency of metallic antenna at THz frequencies. Due to their axial current, BCNTs are modeled by a 2 D anisotropic resistive sheet having a tensor surface resistivity. Using a numerical method, the radiation efficiency of antennas consisting of BCNTs and gold are compared and it is concluded that BCNTs should be packed up about 1, 000 times more than the current density of BCNTs to outperform gold at 2 THz. Efficient nanoantennas near infrared (IR) frequencies are also studied to enhance the performance of uncooled IR detectors and thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) power transducers. A gold bowtie dipole antenna topology loaded with a low bandgap indium <b>gallium</b> arsenide <b>antimonide</b> (InGaAsSb) p-n junction is investigated for this purpose. Through optimized arrangements, it is shown that a large array of flexible load bowtie nanoantennas can produce an efficient TPV system that can absorb 95 % of the incident power. Similarly, a focal-plane array of nano-bowtie antennas used as an uncooled IR detector is demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of the detector by a factor equal to the field enhancement factor, approximately 23 when compared to a detector made from a thick layer of the same material, InGaAsSb. Finally, a more advanced antenna topology using a cross tapered-bowtie antenna for detecting circularly polarized (CP) IR signals is designed and its perfect CP property is verified experimentally for the microwave range.

50|$|Interband cascade lasers (ICLs) are a type {{of laser}} diode that can produce {{coherent}} radiation over {{a large part of}} the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are fabricated from epitaxially-grown semiconductor heterostructures composed of layers of indium arsenide (InAs), <b>gallium</b> <b>antimonide</b> (GaSb), aluminum antimonide (AlSb), and related alloys. These lasers are similar to quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) in several ways. Like QCLs, ICLs employ the concept of bandstructure engineering to achieve an optimized laser design and reuse injected electrons to emit multiple photons. However, in ICLs, photons are generated with interband transitions, rather than the intersubband transitions used in QCLs. Consequently, the rate at which the carriers injected into the upper laser subband thermally relax to the lower subband is determined by interband Auger, radiative, and Shockley-Read carrier recombination. These processes typically occur on a much slower time scale than the longitudinal optical phonon interactions that mediates the intersubband relaxation of injected electrons in mid-IR QCLs. The use of interband transitions allows laser action in ICLs to be achieved at lower electrical input powers than is possible with QCLs.|$|E

40|$|A {{radioisotope}} thermophotovoltaic generator space {{power system}} (RTPV) is lightweight, low-cost {{alternative to the}} present radioisotope thermoelectric generator system (RTG). The fabrication of such an RTPV generator has recently become feasible {{as the result of}} the invention of the GaSb infrared sensitive photovoltaic cell. Herein, we present the results of a parametric study of emitters and optical filters in conjuction with existing data on <b>gallium</b> <b>antimonide</b> cells. We compare a polished tungsten emitter with an Erbia selective emitter for use in combination with a simple dielectric filter and a <b>gallium</b> <b>antimonide</b> cell array. We find that the polished tungsten emitter is by itself a very selective emitter with low emissivity beyond 4 microns. Given a <b>gallium</b> <b>antimonide</b> cell and a tungsten emitter, a simple dielectric filter can be designed to transmit radiant energy below 1. 7 microns and to reflect radiant energy between 1. 7 and 4 microns back to the emitter. Because of the low long wavelength emissivity associated with the polished tungsten emitter, this simple dielectric filter then yields very respectable system performance. Also as a result of the longer wavelength fall-off in the tungsten emissivity curve, the radiation energy peak for a polished tungsten emitter operating at 1300 K shifts to shorter wavelengths relative to the blackbody spectrum so that the radiated energy peak falls right at the <b>gallium</b> <b>antimonide</b> cell bandedge. The result is that the response of the <b>gallium</b> <b>antimonide</b> cell is well matched to a polished tungsten emitter.
