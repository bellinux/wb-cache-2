By 2000, Tony Touch signed a deal with Tommy Boy to release his first album to not only include his DJ work and some production, but his own rhymes as well. In addition to himself, the album featured production from the likes of Gang Starr's DJ Premier, Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs, and the Alchemist, among several others. The album also included several guest artists on it including Gang Starr, Cypress Hill, and Wu-Tang Clan. In addition, two singles were released from the album [...] "I Wonder Why? (<b>He</b> <b>s</b> <b>The</b> Greatest DJ)" [...] and [...] "The Return Of The Diaz Bros.," [...] both of which found minor chart success on the Billboard R&B charts. The Piece Maker proved popular enough that Tony Touch released a sequel in 2004 titled The Piece Maker 2.|$|E

40|$|In {{many ways}} the Palestinian {{civilian}} is the ultimate or significant ‘other' for the Israeli soldier serving in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). (<b>S)</b> <b>he</b> is <b>the</b> one who will be stopped, checked, controlled and at times arrested. (<b>S)</b> <b>he</b> is <b>the</b> one who negotiates, pleads, begs and sometimes curses the soldier. This other represents, amongst other things, disorder for <b>the</b> soldiers. (<b>S)</b> <b>he</b> becomes <b>the</b> ‘face’ of the hardship, the frustration, anger, doubt and boredom the soldiers associate with their work within a military occupation. To regain a sense of order, control and normalcy soldiers construct the military checkpoint as a ‘moral geography’ where the Palestinian is actively ‘othered’. In this paper I will explore how moral boundaries are drawn along these physical borders in a landscape of conflict, while not losing sight of the symbolic meaning of this border. I will do this by exploring the way Palestinians are made into a moral other by Israeli soldiers, {{in an effort to}} create a certain sense of order, at the checkpoint. I will first discuss the checkpoint as a site of ‘moral geography’ that enhances and legitimizes these processes of othering that I will explore next. Finally, I will discuss the way Palestinians are made into a moral other, while tracing this back to a moral discourse that is geared to establish a ‘normalized’ self...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to examine the phonetic {{correlates}} of stress and accent in Catalan. We analyzed five acoustic correlates of stress (syllable duration, spectral balance, vowel quality, vowel pitch, and vowel intensity) in two stress conditions and in two accent conditions, which is to say, in stressed and unstressed syllables in both accented and unaccented environments (that is, appositions in sentences such as Vol la vela, la vella (<b>S)</b> <b>he</b> wants <b>the</b> sail, the old sail vs. right-dislocated subjects in Vol la vela, la vella (<b>S)</b> <b>he</b> wants <b>the</b> sail, the old lady. In keeping with the findings of Slujter & collaborators on Dutch and on English [1], [2], [3], and Campbell & Beckman on English [4], Catalan reveals systematic differences in the acoustic characterization of the accent and stress dimensions. Specifically, syllable duration, spectral balance, and vowel quality are reliable acoustic correlates of stress differences, while accentual differences are acoustically marked by intensity and pitch cues...|$|R
