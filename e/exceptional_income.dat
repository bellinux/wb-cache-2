Ferguson purchased land in Tobago himself in 1778 and later, after he inherited the Castara estate on Patrick's death, {{he became one of}} the most important landowners on the island. An <b>exceptional</b> <b>income</b> was made from the sugar plantation and a large workforce of slaves was used.|$|E
50|$|Immigration to Germany as a non-EU-citizen {{is still}} limited to skilled workers (individuals {{with either a}} {{university}} or polytechnic degree or at least 3 years of training together with job experience), students and their immediate family members. Germany has 3 types of immigration titles: Visas (validity of up to 90 days), (temporary) residence permits, and settlement permits (permanent residence permits). Work permits, if granted, are no longer issued independently but included within the immigration title and are available for foreigners that either {{fall into one of}} the several available permit categories (IT specialists, company trained specialist within a group of companies, managing personnel, scientists, highly skilled workers with <b>exceptional</b> <b>income,</b> etc.) or can prove a public interest in the employment. The categories and all requirements are listed in the ordinance on employment.|$|E
5000|$|Stanton {{also argued}} that the Sixteenth Amendment [...] "authorizes only an <b>exceptional</b> direct <b>income</b> tax without apportionment, to which the tax in {{question}} does not conform" [...] and that therefore the income tax was [...] "not within the authority of that Amendment." [...] The Court also rejected this argument and upheld {{the constitutionality of the}} income tax under the 1913 Revenue Act.|$|R
60|$|When {{that problem}} is at last faced, the {{question}} of the proportion in which the national income shall be distributed can have only one answer. All our shares must be equal. It has always been so; it always will be so. It is true that the incomes of robbers vary considerably from individual to individual; and the variation is reflected in the incomes of their parasites. The commercialization of certain exceptional talents has also produced <b>exceptional</b> <b>incomes,</b> direct and derivative. Persons who live on rent of land and capital are economically, though not legally, in the category of robbers, and have grotesquely different incomes. But in the huge mass of mankind variation Of income from individual to individual is unknown, because it is ridiculously impracticable. As a device for persuading a carpenter that a judge is a creature of superior nature to himself, to be deferred and submitted to even to the death, we may give a carpenter a hundred pounds a year and a judge five thousand; but the wage for one carpenter is the wage for all the carpenters: the salary for one judge is the salary for all the judges.|$|R
2500|$|Stanton {{argued that}} the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied [...] "to mining {{companies}} and their stockholders {{equal protection of the}} laws and deprive them of their property without due process of law". The Court rejected that argument. Stanton also {{argued that the}} Sixteenth Amendment [...] "authorizes only an <b>exceptional</b> direct <b>income</b> tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform" [...] and that therefore the income tax was [...] "not within the authority of that Amendment". The Court also rejected this argument. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Act, contradicts those tax protesters arguments that the income tax is unconstitutional under either the Fifth Amendment or the Sixteenth Amendment.|$|R
50|$|The commissioners had no {{particular}} reason to be partial to the clergy and they applied themselves to the task with much diligence. Where the figures can be checked, for example against the financial records of the king's officials in charge of dissolving monasteries in the later 1530s, they are shown to be broadly accurate though on the low side, in some cases {{by as much as}} 15%. There is, particularly in the north, a tendency to underestimate the value of some important classes of asset, especially agricultural land held in desmesne and woodland with standing timber. One theory to account for this is the natural tendency of taxpayers to make conservative estimates combined with the rushed nature of the work, which encouraged the commissioners to give the benefit of the doubt. Standing timber moreover, by its nature, provides a resource of occasional <b>exceptional</b> <b>income,</b> rather than a steady annual income stream, and hence was commonly ignored in income assessments for 16th century inventories of landed assets.|$|E
40|$|Australia {{has done}} well to hold up {{economic}} activity through what {{for the rest of}} the developed world is the deepest recession since the Great Depression. I give high marks to the Government’s immediate policy response: the early and decisive reduction of interest rates, expansion of government expenditure and the Commonwealth guarantee of the banks ’ wholesale borrowing. The successful management of the Great Crash leaves a heavy economic policy agenda. These remarks are mainly directed to the macro-economic dimensions of that agenda. The Great Crash of 2008 (Garnaut with Llewellyn-Smith, 2009) noted that countries with larger current account deficits before the Crash would have additional adjustment problems beyond those with surpluses; and that commodity exporting countries which had spent most of the proceeds of the exceptionally high terms of trade before the boom would face greater adjustment challenges than those who had prudently saved a larger proportion of the <b>exceptional</b> <b>income</b> from high export prices. It noted that at their boom...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} view of {{the political}} economy of public debt is that myopic and unconstrained politicians prefer to disregard intertemporal smoothing considerations and extract political rents as fast as possible. From this perspective, it seems that the world has much to celebrate, as most emerging market economies [...] often suspect of having weak political institutions [...] have chosen to save rather than waste most of their <b>exceptional</b> <b>income</b> from high commodity prices. Unfortunately, the optimistic conclusion that these countries may have turned the corner with respect to public resource management may be premature. In this paper we show that {{while it is true that}} in the long run there is a negative connection between the level of public debt and the quality of political institutions, this needs not be the case in the short run. Quite the opposite, in the short run, governments with weak political institutions are likely to save more than governments with better institutions facing the same uncertainty. This is due to an option value of rent-seeking whereby the prospect of potentially squandering funds in the future makes governments more "precautionary" today. We show that this result relies on three assumptions: Economic risk is high relative to political risk, markets are sufficiently incomplete, and there exists a rent-less policy-making regime. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the income effect of non productivity related discriminatory factors, compared to productivity related returns on human capital in Shenzhen. The {{design of the}} Shenzhen Household Survey 2005 that was employed enables us to include a large set of discriminating factors in a Mincer Becker type of income model. Further, {{we are able to}} take a unique look at the migrant population in this outstanding urban centre. Our results show that the human capital approach holds. We also find strong evidence of a significant influence of social norms and policies, particularly relevant in a developing and transition economy, even in such an <b>exceptional</b> city.

40|$|Working-age Americans work {{longer hours}} than adults in other industrialized countries. At the same time, the United States. {{has one of}} the least equal income {{distributions}} of any rich country. This paper provides a cross-national analysis {{of the impact of the}} <b>exceptional</b> U. S. <b>income</b> distribution and labor supply patterns on time available for child caregiving by comparing the income distributions and work hours distributions of seven rich countries. Our analysis shows that Americans tend to work longer hours than Canadians and Western Europeans at both the top and bottom of the income distribution, but the proportional difference is largest at the bottom of the distribution. Americans at the bottom of the income distribution work longer hours than their counterparts in other rich countries but nonetheless achieve a relative standard of living that is below that enjoyed by working-age adults in other countries who hold a comparable position in their national income distributions. U. S. household heads responsible for rearing children are unusually time constrained. Parents in the middle and top part of the U. S. distribution derive an important advantage from devoting so much of their time to paid employment: They receive higher labor incomes and enjoy greater ability to purchase time-saving household services. Lowincome U. S. parents do not derive a comparable advantage from their long hours of work. They work more than parents in other industrial countries who have the same low rank in the income distribution, but their incomes are proportionately further below the median income in their country...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth in}} {{multinational}} corporations looking {{to expand and}} invest in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging markets such as Africa, has grown tremendously. “Africa is already the world’s second fastest growing economy after expanding 5 % {{a year in the}} past two years, well above the global average. ” (World Economic Forum, 2013). This has resulted in the movement of human capital between different tax jurisdictions and an increase in expatriates all across the world. The focus of the study is to expand on the current knowledge on the taxation of inbound expatriates working within South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Nigeria, as the world has turned its focus on Africa in terms of investment and expansion, as supported by Shelley (2004 : 3), and to provide both employers and employees with knowledge of the different tax regimes (source-based taxation and residence-based taxation) found in some of the emerging and fastest growing markets in Africa: namely Botswana, Namibia, Nigeria and South Africa. It was found that the African tax landscape provides for a vast range of tax systems, of which, most are either residence–based or source-based. The tax systems of South Africa and Nigeria are similar in that they are residence-based. In each of these two countries, tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on income from specific sources. Therefore, residency is an essential concept in each of these tax systems. The above-mentioned countries, however, apply different methods and factors in determining the concept of residency. As a result of the difference in determining tax residency and differences in their domestic income tax legislations, the taxability of income earned abroad differs in these countries. The tax systems of Botswana and Namibia are similar in that they are source-based. In each of these countries, income is taxable when it is from a source or deemed source within these countries. Although in <b>exceptional</b> circumstances, some <b>income</b> which is not from a source within these countries may be taxable, relief is applied in terms of the domestic legislation, in order to lessen the burden of tax. Source is therefore a vital concept in each of these tax systems. The definition and application of the term source is different in both countries. However, similarities are found in that the source is primarily where the services were physically rendered. Both employers and employees should consider the basis of taxation (source basis and residence basis) that is applied by the prospective host country when making a decision regarding an assignment to a foreign country as this forms a major factor in how their income (both local and foreign) will be treated.

40|$|A person's {{income is}} {{generally}} explained {{as a function}} of human capital variables and variables that measure the strength or structure of the economy. Income is usually studied as a variable dependent on education, union involvement, the income of others, and experience. Regional breakdowns of income in the United States, however, show significant variations in regional wages that may not be accounted for in traditional wage equations. This paper explores the determinants of income {{in each of the four}} U. S. Census regions to determine if significant differences exist and to account for the structural and regional causes of such differences. The results could have significant ramifications for policy makers and businessmen. This paper creates a regional income model to be evaluated using both OLS and neural networks. Results from OLS and the Cotton-Neumark decomposition method are compared with those of neural network to evaluate the advantages in methodology. Clearly, some of the variations in regional wages are due to differences in the variables making up the wage equations. Other variations, or residual differences, can be summed up as the regional coefficient that explains regional peculiarities in wage determination. To improve and extend the analysis, the data are also evaluated by a forward-feeding back-propagating neural network. Neural networks offer a significant advantage through their ability to determine the relationship between variables using only input and output data. Non-linear relationships can be modeled with neural networks, accounting for variation in behavior that could not accurately be modeled linearly. The networks will be run in two modes: prediction and classification. In the prediction mode, the neural network is directly analogous to the traditional economic model using OLS. As with the OLS regression, the network is run both with and without the regional dummy variables to measure the influence of a county's location. The neural network results are compared to OLS through R values between the predicted and actual values. Correlation values for various neural networks are in the range of. 90 to. 95, with <b>exceptional</b> <b>income</b> prediction in low and middle income counties. In the classification mode, the network interprets the county data, including income, and assigns each county to one of the four census regions. How accurately the network assigns counties their known regions illuminates the regional differences. Success is measured through several means. ...|$|E
