Irrigation scheduling is equally important in micro-irrigation systems. The significance of various irrigation schedules and emitter flow uniformities were examined in a system design. Several irrigation schedules were compared with an optimal <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule.</b> The optimal <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> can achieve optimal return and also provide water saving compared with the conventional <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> in which the whole field is fully irrigated at the same time. Deep seepage can be eliminated or minimised by scheduling deficit irrigation.

For high uniformity the effects of crop sensitivity to deficit irrigation are not important and result in only limited (or acceptable) yield reduction and over-irrigation.

The <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> practices were: tensiometer-based with the tensiometers placed at 50 or 75 % of the root-zone depth and irrigations started when tensiometer readings reached 6 kPa for sandy soils, 23 kPa for sandy loam soils, 44 kPa for loamy soils, and 74 kPa for clay loam soils; and at 50 % plant available water depletion (PAWD) level regardless of soil type. The objective was to use <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> model IRRSCHM, a volume balance, mixing-cell, type <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> and pesticide transport model, to assess and compare the impact of different <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> practices on cyanazine and metolachlor concentrations at 180 cm below the soil surface during a 30 -year cropping sequence. The region was divided into different soil textural classes to facilitate rapid estimation of soil parameters needed for the model. Very low pesticide concentrations were predicted at 180 cm below the soil surface. However, the predicted pesticide concentrations increased as soil sand fractions increased, regardless of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> practice. The tensiometer based <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> resulted in the highest pesticide concentrations. The lowest concentrations were predicted under the farmer's practices due to deficit irrigation. Dual concentrations at 180 cm depth of the sandy soil class were ~ 20 times less than the Health Advisory Level under the tensiometer-based <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> practices, while the farmer's practices resulted in metolachlor concentrations ~ 625 times less than the Health Advisory Level. Similarly, the predicted cyanazine concentration in sandy soil class was 3125 times less than the Health Advisory Level under the tensiometer-based <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> and ~ 416 [*] 000 times less than the Health Advisory Level under farmer's practices.

40|$|<b>Irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> is {{accepted}} {{as the process}} to decide when to irrigate crops {{and how much to}} apply and is assumed {{to play an important role}} in the general improvement of water efficiency on the farm. However, the idea that there is a single key to the adoption of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> on the farm is simplistic. It implies that science has all the answers, and “we need just to convince the farmers”. The objectives of this study were to investigate the adoption process in South Africa with the further purpose to identify the possible human and socio-economic factors that may influence it. In order to appreciate the spectrum of soil-plant-atmosphere <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> models and techniques that are available to potential users, it was necessary to quantitatively describe and classify the scheduling methods. The adoption of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> methods among commercial and small-scale farmers was investigated on a scheme (macro) level as well as on-farm (micro) level through a quantitative assessment of scheduling methods on a national basis, semi-structured interviews with irrigation professionals, survey among a stratified sample of commercial farmers and case studies of small scale irrigation farmers. It was hypothesized that the adoption behaviour of irrigation farmers is determine by socio-economic (independent) and intervening factors. It was also hypothesized that ground level support and effective dialogue between scientist and farmers are conducive for the implementation of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling.</b> The study indicates that only 18 % of irrigation farmers in South Africa make use of objective <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> method, while the rest make use of subjective scheduling methods based on intuition, observation, local knowledge and experience. Differential perceptions occur between farmers as well as between farmers and scientists with regard to the concept of “irrigation scheduling” commonly being used. These differences contributed to the communication gap between science and the practice of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> resulting in the unsuccessful communication between farmers and scientists and the ultimate low adoption rate. The implementation of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> models are predominantly advisor-driven and not farmer-driven, as they are perceived by farmers to be complex and not easy to implement on the farm. Younger farmers are more willing to use irrigation models because of their higher computer literacy levels and positive attitude towards the use of computers in general. The technology level of a farm, size of farming operation and the value of the crop being produced determine the selection of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> methods. The general problems experienced by some farmers with regard to bulk water delivery hampers the implementation of more precise <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Farmers’ awareness, flexibility and willingness to change, innovate and step outside of accustomed ways of implementing irrigation, are strongly influenced by their social, economic, cultural and institutional settings, and not merely by <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> technology. Perceived indicators of efficient use of irrigation on the farm include increased production levels, decreasing electricity costs, improvement of crop quality and efficiency of fertiliser use. Farmers identified accuracy, reliability, ease of implementing and affordability as important technological characteristics of scheduling methods and devices. The case studies of small-scale irrigation farming revealed that weak institutional arrangements and handling of farmers’ affairs on the level of several small-scale irrigation schemes hampers sustainable agricultural development. Small-scale irrigators have reported that the lack of competent extension support prevents them from implementing <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Also, the scientific framework used by scientists and advisors to convey information to irrigators often follows the linear transfer of technology approach instead of following the “learning based approach”. A significant relationship exists between the number of information sources used and the implementation of the type of scheduling methods The majority of irrigation farmers are more interested in the use of <b>irrigation</b> <b>scheduling</b> to identify “troubles or problems” experienced with irrigation, and inevitably farmers will differ in their selection of the most appropriate scheduling method and technique.

The study included two regimes of bio-fertilizers (without bio-fertilization and bio-fertilization) with combined bio-fertilizer (Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae and Bacillus megatherium var. phosphaticum strains) and three <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> (without supplementary irrigation (rain fed), one supplementary irrigation 45 mm and two supplementary irrigation 90 mm),. The obtained results showed that:-adding two supplementary irrigations(90 mm) caused the highest values for all measured characteristics of yield and its components in both studied crops. -The measurements of yield and its components i. e., plant height at harvest (cm), number of branches/plant; number of branches/m 2; number of grains/plant; number of grains/pod; 100 grains weight (g); and biological, straw and grains yields (kg/fed) were significantly increased by adding bio-fertilizer than the control. -In respect to {{the interaction between the}} two studied factors, biofertilizer and two supplementary irrigation with 90 mm/fed gave the highest values for all measured characteristics in both crops...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} several deficit {{irrigation}} scenarios on faba bean yield were simulated using Yield-Stress model through calibration and the {{validation of the}} model with three years field trials in 1998 / 99, 1999 / 00 and 2001 / 02 growing seasons at Beni Sweif Governorate, Egypt under two treatments of irrigation water quality (fresh and drainage). The goodness of fit between measured and predicted values by the model was tested by calculated percent difference between measured and predicted values of yield and consumptive use, in addition to root mean squared error and Willmott index of agreement. Then, the model was used to predict the effect of four deficit irrigation treatments (95, 90, 85, and 80 % of full irrigation). Water productivity was calculated under all cases. The {{results showed that the}} model performance was highly acceptable in predicting faba bean yield and consumptive use. The results of the model showed that up to 20 % of full irrigation could be saved with yield reduction reached 7 %. Changing <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> reduced yield losses to less than 1 % and resulted in saving around 20 % of full irrigation under the three growing. Water productivity was the highest when <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> was changed under irrigation with either fresh or drainage water amounts...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} was conducted during 2013 - 2014 and 2014 - 2015 at the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Ishwardi, Pabna, Bangladesh {{to find out}} the appropriate <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> for optimum bulb yield and subsequent effect of <b>irrigation</b> <b>schedule</b> on storability of garlic. Th e experiments consisted of four irrigation frequencies (interval of 10, 15, 20 and 25 days) that were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Th e results showed that irrigation interval significantly influenced yield and morphological characteristics (plant height, individual bulb weight/plant, number of clove/bulb, clove weight and bulb yield). Irrigation frequency of 10 days interval resulted with the highest bulb yield of 10. 48 t/ha with 372 mm of seasonal water used. It was followed by 15 days interval (9. 81 t/ha) where 275 mm of seasonal water was used. It was clearly shown that the bulbs lost their weight progressively after all irrigation treatments in storage conditions. Minimum weight loss was obtained at 10 and 15 days interval. From an economic point of view, farmers can take irrigation schedules of 10 or 15 days interval for maximum return where irrigation water is available. At water stress conditions garlic might be irrigated at 20 days interval but consequently bulb yield will be reduced...|$|E
