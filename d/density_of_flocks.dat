40|$|In real flocks, it was {{revealed}} that the angular density of nearest neighbors shows a strong anisotropic structure of individuals by very recent extensive field studies by Ballerini et al [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 105, pp. 1232 - 1237 (2008) ]. In this paper, we show that this empirical evidence in real flocks, namely, the structure of anisotropy also emerges in an artificial flock simulation based on the BOIDS by Reynolds [Computer Graphics 21, pp. 25 - 34 (1987) ]. We numerically find that appropriate combinations of the weights for just only three essential factors of the BOIDS, namely, `Cohesion', `Alignment' and `Separation' lead to a strong anisotropy in the flock. This result seems to be highly counter-intuitive and also provides a justification of the hypothesis that the anisotropy emerges as a result of self-organization of interacting intelligent agents (birds for instance). To quantify the anisotropy, we evaluate a useful statistics (a kind of order parameters in statistical physics), that is to say, the so-called γ-value defined as an inner product between the vector {{in the direction of the}} lowest angular <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocks</b> and the vector in the direction of the moving of the flock. Our results concerning the emergence of the anisotropy through the γ-value might enable us to judge whether an arbitrary flock simulation seems to be realistic or not.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{effectiveness}} of the protection measures currently in place to conserve the natural environment in Kuwait State. Comparison of protection effectiveness was based on the measurements of ecological habitat quality and biodiversity. In order to achieve this, 2 protected areas (SAANR and Kabd) and 2 comparable unprotected areas (B-SAANR and R-Kabd) were studied. In addition, an arable land area, the Pivot farm, was also studied. I examined the floral and avifaunal richness in these five areas. Distribution and abundance of members of the lark family Alaudidae, and the crested lark Galerida cristata in particular, were measured as a key habitat indicator. I also investigated the importance of water provison for wildlife. The diurnal use of a water hole and behaviour of crested larks during foraging and shading was observed. The challenge that larks face to cope with the high temperature during the breeding seasons was also examined. The assessment of the vegetation identified the plant species richness as an index of habitat types, and this was examined in relation to human activity factors (e. g. grazing, camping, etc). Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) showed three sample-groups of vegetation types (labelled A, B and C), a Haloxylon community (C); a sub-community (B: indicated by Helianthemum) of the Stipa community type; and a sub-community (A: indicated by Plantago and Schismus) of the mixed Stipa - Cyperus community type. Vegetation is a powerful indicator of land degradation in Kuwait. Richness of plant species was correlated negatively with land degradation. Lark species were used as indicators to measure the benefit of the current conservation measures. There was a significant difference between lark density and species richness in protected, non-protected and arable lands. Density of larks was very low in non-protected areas, being about one individual km- 2 (Figure 3. 3). An obvious conclusion from the results was the important role of protected areas in conservation context. As an example larks' species abundance and density in SAANR were remarkably higher than B-SAANR (Figure 3. 9 and 3. 10). Furthermore, all other larks' species were absent in B-SAANR area in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. 	This study showed the important role that a water hole can play in attracting wildlife in desert areas and in influencing several aspects of behaviour. Overall 96 animal species used the Talha water hole in SAANR, Kuwait throughout 2009. Talha water hole became an essential spot for attraction of most wildlife in the SAANR, especially in summer. There may of course be cost associated with gathering in one place, such as at a water hole. Gregarious birds optimize vigilant attentiveness according to their group size. My study on the behavior of crested larks during winter and summer seasons in Kuwait revealed the presence of relationships between vigilance behaviours (head up, crest up and closed eye) verses group size. The study showed there are strong linkages between these behaviours and flock size. I found also a correlation between sitting individuals and having their crest up during shading. In addition, these vigilance behaviours were affected by the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>flocks.</b> Hence, distance between foragers influences their social vigilance. The breeding survey showed that larks face environmental challenges to breed in Kuwait. Absence of nests in unprotected areas B-SAANR and R-Kabd were correlated with their poor vegetation cover. Signs of larks breeding such as courtship display, protecting a territory or presence of nest were seen in the protected areas SAANR and Kabd. In SAANR, at least one of those signs was seen for greater hoopoe larks, crested larks and bar-tailed larks. In Kabd, juveniles of the black-crowned sparrow lark were seen. Arable lands can play an important role for resident breeding species, especially in annual seasons that are characterised by a shortage of rainfall. For example, crested larks and doves were attracted to the Pivot farm. Territories and nests of crested larks were identified in alfalfa and barley crops. The Pivot farm possess potential characteristics that are absent in open areas and in protected areas. Crested larks were found mostly nesting in arable lands to compensate for poor habitat quality, low vegetation cover and rainfall shortages in protected areas. The effect of macro and microhabitat nest site selections on larks and doves thermoregulation was examined to determine the favourable position of the nest. Position and site location showed a remarkable effect on nest temperature. Further more, nest temperatures varied between different habitats and vegetation cover. The Pivot farm presents a good alternative habitat for crested larks to breed until mid-June. To further study adaptations to warm weathers, I examined egg shell structure. A comparison of components of egg shell morphology reveals the presence of morphological and structural differences both between sibling species, and within the same species, collected at different latitudes. Two sibling species, crested larks Galerida cristata (from Kuwait) and skylarks Alauda arvensis (from the United Kingdom) have different egg volume, shell pigmentation and colour, thickness and water loss through the shell. The other sibling dove species showed difference in eggshell thickness between arid and temperate zones. Within the same species, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, variation in eggshell thickness was also found between birds from Kuwait and the United Kingdom. The eggshells of house sparrows were thinner in Kuwaiti samples than in those collected in the United Kingdom. Moreover, within the United Kingdom there was also a similar latitudinal trend, with Scottish shell samples being thicker and those from further south in the UK being thinner. There was however little difference in water loss. In addition, average length and width of laughing dove eggs varied between South Africa and Kuwait samples. Hence, they differ in egg volume. These results suggest local adaptation in egg shell structure. Egg shell thickness increased at higher latitudes in both the sibling species, and in the within species, comparisons. This suggests that latitude, presumably via the effects of environmental temperature, can influence optimal eggshell structure, since the pattern was similar across the lark species compared with the within species variation in the sparrows. My data also reveal some variations among the eggshell characteristic of larks in response to temperature and latitude. This study reveals the challenge that larks face to breed in Kuwait. To breed, a suitable secure habitat is essential. Habitat degradation was a remarkable in most non protected areas in Kuwait. Recommendations for conservation measures in Kuwait are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} continuum theory of "flocking": the collective coherent motion {{of large numbers}} of self-propelled organisms. Our model predicts the existence of an "ordered phase" <b>of</b> <b>flocks,</b> in which all members <b>of</b> the <b>flock</b> move together with the same mean velocity. This coherent motion <b>of</b> the <b>flock</b> is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry. The "Goldstone modes" associated with this "spontaneously broken rotational symmetry" are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part <b>of</b> the <b>flock</b> away from the mean direction. These "Goldstone modes" mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations <b>of</b> the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flock.</b> Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an n = d component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions d > 4, the long distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory. For d < 4, non-linear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in d = 2, where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in d = 2 (the "Mermin-Wagner" theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging <b>of</b> real <b>flocks.</b> Comment: Long paper on flocking with 11 figure...|$|R

On individual sheep where louse density was 0. 5 per 10 cm part or greater, there were only marginal gains from inspecting more than 10 parts per animal. Increasing the number of sheep inspected always increased sensitivity more than increasing number of parts per sheep by an equivalent amount.

One hour <b>of</b> <b>flock</b> noise (background machinery and hen vocalisations) was recorded from 21 commercial free-range laying hen flocks aged ≥ 35 weeks. Ten <b>of</b> the <b>flocks</b> {{were classified as}} feather pecking (based on a plumage condition score) and 11 as non-feather pecking. 3. Recordings were made using a Sony DAT recorder and Audio-Technica omni-directional microphone, placed in {{the centre of the}} house~ 1. 5 m from the ground. Avisoft-SASlab Pro was used to create and analyse audio spectrograms. 4. There was no effect <b>of</b> <b>flock</b> size or farm on calls/s or acoustic parameters <b>of</b> <b>flock</b> noise. However, strain had a significant (P = 0. 021) effect on the number of Total vocalisations/s; the Hebden Black flock made more calls than Lohmann flocks. Feather pecking flocks made significantly more Squawks/s (P = 0. 010) and more Total vocalisations/s (P = 0. 005) than non-feather pecking flocks. Feather pecking did not explain variation in alarm call rate or, intensity (dB) and frequency (Hz) measures <b>of</b> <b>flock</b> noise. 5. The differences between Squawk and Total vocalisation call rates of feather and non-feather pecking flocks are a new finding. An increase or change in flock calling rate may be evident before other conventional measures of laying hen welfare such as a drop in egg production or increase in plumage damage, thus enabling farmers to make management or husbandry changes to prevent an outbreak of feather pecking...|$|R
