Commercial and industrial (C) lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices, allowing credit risks to be spread across {{a greater number of}} participating banks and non-bank lenders. Perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of C loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)-special purpose entities that buy C loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures. CLOs allow loans to be financed primarily with high-rated <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> to institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies.

We use a panel gravity model to investigate country specific factors attracting foreign subsidiaries as issuer. The data clearly support the prediction that the locational choice is positively influenced by a low withholding tax rate. There is also some evidence that corporate tax rates play a role. We do not find support for creditor protection rules in bankruptcy as a driver of cross-border <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issues.</b> Hence, countries who wish to attract issuers are well-advised to reduce their withholding tax rates – creditor rights seem not to matter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{scope of}} this article is to point out the {{features}} of European corporate bond market, in particular its development since the euro introduction. We structured our paper on chapters that present its economic importance, the implications of the common currency in respect to its growth and the level of integration in the present context. This market, including the <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by non-financial corporations, non-monetary financial corporations and monetary financial institutions, is economically important, as it contributes to the allocation of funds to their most profitable uses. Its rapid growth since the introduction of the euro can be explained by developments in economic activity, the costs of issuance and mergers &acquisitions-related activity. The adoption of the common currency had a direct and permanent effect on <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by non-monetary financial corporations. However, the use of corporate bonds at the euro area level is not uniform across countries. Country-specific factors continue to matter, despite the fact that financial markets are gradually becoming more integrated. ...|$|E
5000|$|Legally, a CMO is a <b>debt</b> <b>security</b> <b>issued</b> by an abstraction—a {{special purpose}} entity—and {{is not a}} debt owed by the {{institution}} creating and operating the entity. The entity is the legal owner {{of a set of}} mortgages, called a pool. Investors in a CMO buy bonds issued by the entity, and they receive payments from the income generated by the mortgages according to a defined set of rules. With regard to terminology, the mortgages themselves are termed collateral, ''''classes'''' refers to groups of mortgages issued to borrowers of roughly similar credit worthiness, tranches are specified fractions or slices, metaphorically speaking, of a pool of mortgages and the income they produce that are combined into an individual security, while the structure is the set of rules that dictates how the income received from the collateral will be distributed. The legal entity, collateral, and structure are collectively referred to as the deal. Unlike traditional mortgage pass-through securities, CMOs feature different payment streams and risks, depending on investor preferences. [...] For tax purposes, CMOs are generally structured as Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, which avoid the potential for [...] "double-taxation".|$|R
