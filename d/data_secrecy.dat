For both problems we consider two situations: 1) only two parties are involved where one holds the data and the other possesses the processing algorithm; 2) an additional non-colluding third party exists.

40|$|Abstract—Content {{distribution}} systems {{benefit from}} network coding {{in terms of}} error/loss protection and faster dissemination {{at the cost of}} exposing the data to intermediate nodes that are not the intended recipients. In these systems <b>data</b> <b>secrecy</b> is at risk and it can be guaranteed by using encryption as a straightforward method. However, this inevitably increases the communication costs and decreases the willingness to cooperate of intermediate nodes, which have no expectation of recovering the file. In this paper we propose an incentive secrecy preserving scheme based on obfuscation for time-sensitive data. The source intentionally obscures the original file and informs only the intended recipients which file blocks are corrupted. This scheme, combined with network coding, preserves the <b>data</b> <b>secrecy</b> and, in the meantime, fosters the cooperation of intermediate nodes. The evaluation of our solution shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient than encryption based secrecy preserving methods.

We make the case that the exact form of established CR is linked inherently to the data processing task at hand, and its characterization can lead to a structural understanding of the associated algorithms.

Our design for data aggregation eliminates redundant sensor readings without using encryption and maintains <b>data</b> <b>secrecy</b> and privacy during transmission.

In contrast to conventional schemes, our proposed scheme provides security and privacy, and duplicate instances of original readings will be aggregated {{into a single}} packet. Our scheme is resilient to known-plaintext attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, ciphertext-only attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks.
