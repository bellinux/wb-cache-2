As Roy enters the mothership, one of the aliens pauses for a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that {{correspond}} to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space, as Barry bids Roy goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{begins a}} <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> after Dracula ends. Count Dracula {{has just been}} {{destroyed}} by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to Scotland Yard, where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because {{he had already been}} dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem...

The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on a litter, {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict. This desertion proved the final shock and he finally collapsed into a fever, only coming to for a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> during which he gave confession. Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E

The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E

Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E

5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov {{shook his head in}} disbelief.|$|E

Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up what would be a potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards.

5|$|Pressure high up {{the pitch}} from Barcelona kept Manchester United {{in their own}} half, forcing them into {{attempting}} long balls downfield. A scrappy <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> {{in and around the}} centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had put his hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez {{on the edge of the}} Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.|$|E

5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the Forge to tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the Forge to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the Forge and destroys the station, beaming Munro off in the last <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Voyager and other active ships {{in the area are}} freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E

Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E
