5|$|Although most serpins control {{proteolytic}} cascades, some proteins with a serpin structure are not enzyme inhibitors, {{but instead}} perform diverse {{functions such as}} storage (as in egg white—ovalbumin), transport as in hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding <b>globulin,</b> cortisol-binding <b>globulin)</b> and molecular chaperoning (HSP47). The term serpin is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, since they are evolutionarily related.|$|E
5|$|After secretion, only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to thyroxine-binding <b>globulin</b> (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and albumin (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely has hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E
5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin {{conformational}} change {{as part of their}} function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding <b>globulin</b> has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E
5000|$|Gamma <b>globulins</b> are a {{class of}} <b>globulins,</b> {{identified}} by their position after serum protein electrophoresis. The most significant gamma <b>globulins</b> are immunoglobulins (antibodies), although some immunoglobulins are not gamma <b>globulins,</b> and some gamma <b>globulins</b> are not immunoglobulins.|$|R
50|$|<b>Globulins</b> {{exist in}} various sizes. The lightest <b>globulins</b> are the alpha <b>globulins,</b> which {{typically}} have molecular weights of around 93 kDa, while the heaviest class of <b>globulins</b> are the gamma <b>globulins,</b> which typically weigh about 1193 kDa. Being the heaviest, the gamma <b>globulins</b> {{are among the}} slowest to segregate in gél electrophoresis.|$|R
50|$|Beta <b>globulins</b> are a {{group of}} {{globular}} proteins in plasma that are more mobile in alkaline or electrically charged solutions than gamma <b>globulins,</b> but less mobile than alpha <b>globulins.</b>|$|R
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding <b>globulin</b> and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|This {{development}} greatly facilitated {{vaccine research}} and ultimately {{allowed for the}} development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Other important advances that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma <b>globulin</b> protects against paralytic polio.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and <b>globulin)</b> and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>globulins</b> are {{a family}} of {{globular}} proteins that have higher molecular weights than albumins and are insoluble in pure water but dissolve in dilute salt solutions. Some <b>globulins</b> are produced in the liver, while others are made by the immune system. <b>Globulins,</b> albumins, and fibrinogen are the major blood proteins. The normal concentration of <b>globulins</b> in human blood is about 2.6-4.6 g/dL.|$|R

25|$|Autoimmune hepatitis. This {{disease is}} caused by an attack of the liver by lymphocytes, causing {{inflammation}} and eventually scarring and cirrhosis. Findings include elevations in serum <b>globulins,</b> especially gamma <b>globulins.</b>|$|R
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma <b>globulin</b> fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
25|$|All spermatophytes {{except for}} the grass/cereal family contain soybean-like 7S (vicilin) and/or 11S (legumin), (S denotes Svedberg, {{sedimentation}} coefficients) seed storage <b>globulin</b> proteins. Oats and rice are anomalous in that they also contain a majority of soybean-like protein. Cocoa, for example, contains the 7S <b>globulin,</b> which contributes to cocoa/chocolate taste and aroma;, whereas coffee beans (coffee grounds) contain the 11S <b>globulin</b> responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.|$|E
25|$|The {{plasma protein}} binding of {{dydrogesterone}} and 20α-DHD are unknown, {{but based on}} the plasma protein binding of other progestins, they are probably bound to albumin and not to sex hormone-binding <b>globulin</b> or corticosteroid-binding <b>globulin.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of all classes of immunoglobulins seems {{to follow a}} basically similar architectural pattern. Whereas light polypeptide chains (kappa and lambda) represent structural units common to all classes of immunoglobulins, the physicochemical and antigenic properties of heavy chains differ markedly from one class to another. Deutsch and Morton (1) showed that 19 S IgM <b>globulins</b> are easily dissociated, by mild reduction and alkylation at neutral pH, into 7 - 8 S subunits. Accordingly, an additional level of molecular organization was assumed for IgM <b>globulins</b> compared to IgG <b>globulins.</b> However, the structure of human IgM <b>globulins</b> has only been partially elucidated and many structural concepts have been inferred from the molecular models proposed for IgG <b>globulins.</b> As first shown by Lapresle (2), enzymatic digestion {{has proved to be}} a very useful method for elucidating the structure of globular proteins. The physicochemical and immunological study of proteolytic fragments, in which configuration and biological activity of the intact molecule are preserved as much as possible, has led to valuable information on the structure of rabbit and human IgG <b>globulins.</b> Porter, using activate...|$|R

25|$|Spironolactone and its {{metabolite}} canrenone {{are highly}} plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7α-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding <b>globulin</b> (SHBG). In accordance, {{a study of}} high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding <b>globulin</b> (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins.

40|$|By {{means of}} {{immunodiffusion}} and immunoelectrophoresis {{study has been}} made of antigenic relationships of Bence Jones proteins, and the three classes of normal and pathological immunoglobulins, 7 S γ, β 2 A, and β 2 M. All thirty-nine Bence Jones proteins studied could be classified into either one of two distinct antigenic types, A or B. Both types are related to the immunoelectrophoretically slow (S) fragment of a papain digest of normal γ-globulin; B is related more closely than A, but neither has antigenic determinants in common with the fast (F) fragment. The 7 S γ myeloma <b>globulins</b> were either immunological type I or II. The papain digests of these proteins produced the S and F precipitin lines in immunoelectrophoresis but multiple bands in starch gel electrophoresis, especially in the F region. The S fraction of type I myeloma <b>globulins</b> is antigenically similar to Bence Jones protein of type B, and the S component of type II myeloma <b>globulins</b> has antigenic determinants in common with type A Bence Jones protein. Correspondingly, myeloma patients with type I <b>globulins</b> and proteinuria usually excrete type B Bence Jones proteins, whereas patients with type II excrete type A proteins. The F fragment is the part common to normal 7 S γ-globulin and types I and II myeloma <b>globulins</b> but is absent in β 2 A and β 2 M pathological <b>globulins</b> and in both types of Bence Jones proteins. Papain digests of β 2 A myeloma <b>globulins</b> produced a single precipitin line in immunoelectrophoresis. β 2 A myeloma <b>globulins</b> appeared to have two antigenic units, one in common with type B Bence Jones protein and normal γ-globulin, and another specific to β 2 A. The β 2 A myeloma patients excreted type B Bence Jones protein. The papain digest of a macroglobulin produced two precipitin lines, the faster of which had antigenic determinants in common with type B Bence Jones protein, the slower seemed specific for the macroglobulin. Five serum micromolecular <b>globulins</b> proved to be either type A or B Bence Jones proteins. From the above results, an antigenic map was constructed showing which determinants are shared and which are specific for normal 7 S γ-globulin, types I and II myeloma <b>globulins,</b> β 2 A myeloma <b>globulins,</b> a macroglobulin, and types A and B Bence Jones proteins...|$|R
40|$|Human γ <b>globulins</b> {{are shown}} {{by means of}} special {{antisera}} and papain digestion to consist of three to five different species which share only some of their determinants. A minimum total number of eight determinants is suggested. Only four of these determinants are possessed by {{the bulk of the}} serum <b>globulins</b> and one of these four determinants is shown to be shared with the cryoglobulin of a Waldenström serum. This cryoglobulin is shown to have a further minimum of two determinants shared with one of the subsidiary γ <b>globulins</b> occurring in normal human sera, as well as at least one specific determinant not found in normal sera. Other macroglobulinaemic sera are shown to have variable amounts of <b>globulins</b> antigenically related to this cryoglobulin and even normal sera appear to have traces of such macroglobulins. All γ <b>globulins</b> appear to be split more readily than other serum proteins, but the Waldenström macroglobulin more readily still. It is suggested that the slight forking of the γ-globulin line often seen in immuno-electrophoretic patterns near the cathode side {{may be due to the}} existence of antigenically related, but not identical, γ <b>globulins</b> whose range of electrophoretic mobilities does not quite overlap there and may vary in different subjects.

Neither the association of immune bodies with <b>globulins</b> nor the direct absorption of protein by new-born animals is a new fact.

50|$|Serum protein {{electrophoresis}} (SPEP or SPE) is {{a laboratory}} test that examines specific proteins {{in the blood}} called <b>globulins.</b> The most common indications for a serum protein electrophoresis test are to diagnose or monitor multiple myeloma, a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), or further investigate a discrepancy between a low albumin and a relatively high total protein.
