5|$|This {{series of}} Blackadder {{was one of}} the first {{television}} programmes in Britain to be made and transmitted with stereo sound, using the NICAM digital system, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> viewers could only afford, or were only able to receive due to their location, the standard FM mono audio carrier signal.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E
5|$|Many {{regional}} {{international organisations}} such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.|$|E

5|$|Tropical cyclone {{data was}} {{gathered}} at 6 hour intervals throughout the season. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> intensity assessments were estimates via the Dvorak Technique, {{there was a}} large research mission for Tropical cyclogenesis in the Pacific. A NOAA research mission investigated Hurricane Jimena and gathered a few surface observations. Track forecasts were slightly more accurate than the past three years; intensity forecasts were comparable to the previous three seasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> {{consumer}} {{items are}} in short supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> {{ethnic groups}} prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by {{a small minority of}} the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E

5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava River basin, generally used for public water supply of potable water, as a source of water for industrial use, but also as the mainstay of aquatic ecosystems. There are 41 identified significant groundwater bodies in the Sava River basin of basin-wide importance, ranging in area size from , as well as numerous minor ground water bodies. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> of them are transboundary waters, eleven are considered to be largely located in Slovenia, fourteen in Croatia, seven in Bosnia-Herzegovina, five in Serbia and four in Montenegro.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong leathery plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that requires the use of the cerci.|$|E

50|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> {{nowadays}} <b>most</b> Esperantists highly value cultivating the language—and {{the proportion}} of Esperanto-speakers who cultivate the language without propagating it is larger than ever—the ideological Raŭmismo (Civitanismo) has isolated itself somewhat within the Esperanto community because Civitanists are perceived to spend more energy on criticising the finvenkist Esperanto movement than on cultivating Esperanto.|$|R

25|$|The {{reality is}} that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> {{organizational}} work processes are largely designed around documentation, much remains unrecorded, especially that to do with decision-making.

25|$|The Latino {{demographics}} caused {{controversy in}} the 1970s, when many drug cartels were selling drugs, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> people were not actually affected by it. While some media sources placed culpability on the wire transfer stores along Roosevelt Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful to the community. Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed to as another trace of evidence, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> were actually just places for typical Latino immigrants to hang out. Little India was also controversial. Although Indians are a minority in Jackson Heights, a vibrant commercial area developed on 74th Street in the 1990s, and by 1993, {{it was the largest}} Asian Indian shopping area in the country.|$|E
50|$|IsnegsThe isnegs {{traditionally}} only consume two meals a day; {{one in the}} mid-morning and one in {{the late}} afternoon, or one at noon and the other in the <b>evening.</b> <b>Though</b> <b>most</b> of their meals include rice, rice is always scarce because of the limited womanpower. Hence, they resort to trade to satisfy demands. Meals also include vegetables and root crops such as camote and occasionally, fish and wild pig or wild deer. Dogs, pigs and chickens are only eaten during feasts and chicken eggs are seldom eaten because they are generally allowed to hatch. Sometimes, before or after meals, the typical isneg families enjoy home-grown coffee while gathering around the hearth while rice wine is only consumed during festive occasions.|$|R

25|$|Fundamentally, {{an atomic}} orbital is a one-electron wave function, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>most</b> {{electrons}} {{do not exist}} in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation.

25|$|Polish historian, Julian Kwiek, who has {{published}} existing Polish documents regarding the Kraków event {{stated that he}} is not familiar with the documents quoted by Cichopek from outside the scientific literature.
