500|$|According to the {{historian}} Peter Hammerschmidt, based on {{files of the}} German Federal Intelligence Service and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the BND, under the cover-up company [...] "Merex", was {{in close contact with}} former SS and Nazi Party members. In 1966, Merex, represented by Walter Drück, a former Generalmajor in the Wehrmacht and BND agent, helped by the contacts established by Rudel and Sassen, sold <b>discarded</b> <b>equipment</b> of the Bundeswehr (German Federal armed forces) to various dictators in Latin America. According to Hammerschmidt, Rudel assisted in establishing contact between Merex and Friedrich Schwend, {{a former member of the}} Reich Main Security Office and involved in Operation Bernhard. Schwend, according to Hammerschmidt, had close links with the military services of Peru and Bolivia. In the early sixties, Rudel, Schwend and Klaus Barbie, founded a company called [...] "La Estrella", the star, which employed a number of former SS officers who had fled to Latin America. Rudel, through La Estrella, was also in contact with Otto Skorzeny, who had his own network of former SS and Wehrmacht officers.|$|E
500|$|The {{bodies of}} six Viet Cong {{soldiers}} {{were also found}} by the Australians. Among the dead was the commander of C3 Company, D445 Battalion and his second-in-command, while others were identified as personnel from the command elements of the battalion and the heavy weapons company. Three of the dead were NVA soldiers, possibly from 275th Regiment, although this {{was not able to}} be confirmed. Many more bodies were thought to have been carried away, while one AK-47 assault rifle and a small quantity of ammunition and equipment was also located. The Viet Cong position was found to have been hastily prepared overnight, and consisted of well-sited, but shallow weapon pits rather than bunkers, approximately half of which had overhead protection. Assessed as a good night defensive position rather than a position designed for a deliberate defensive battle, it had been laid out {{in the shape of a}} half-moon; by the fortunes of war B Company had directly assaulted into the centre of the position. Yet the flat terrain had offered good fields of fire, while the dense vegetation provided excellent concealment. The Australians believed that the Viet Cong had withdrawn to the east, and B Company subsequently patrolled through the [...] "Light Green" [...] up to the small village of Ap Gia Thanh, [...] east, supported by the APCs, hooking south along the jungle tracks towards the swamps along the Song Rai river. Although signs of heavy foot traffic were obvious the Viet Cong had long since left the area, while no evidence of blood trails or <b>discarded</b> <b>equipment</b> were found, indicating an orderly retirement from the battlefield. B Company returned to Nui Dat by 17:30, while the remainder of 6 RAR was extracted by helicopter. The last APCs from A Squadron finally returned by 20:10 that evening as Operation Bribie concluded.|$|E
2500|$|While passing {{above the}} Pacific Ocean, the robotic {{arm of the}} space station {{released}} the HTV-1 positioned at 12m below the station on 30 October 2009. The departure was delayed for one ISS orbit to avoid [...] debris (COSMOS 2421). [...] HTV-1 was loaded with 199 items of <b>discarded</b> <b>equipment</b> & waste of 727.7kg, as well as 896kg empty racks, totaling 1,624kg. [...] At 17:32 (UTC), HTV-1 was released from SSRMS and began its planned maneuvers to leave the station proximity. HTV-1 gradually departed from the ISS orbit by performing several thruster burns and entered to its solo-flight mode.|$|E

2500|$|The western {{approach}} to the bridge was managed by a platoon of the 9th Military Police Company. The foot soldiers dodged around <b>discarded</b> <b>equipment,</b> weapons, helmets, and packs. One soldier said it was [...] "hard to walk without tripping over the wounded and dead." [...] Every time a shell came down, the soldiers on the approaches and on the bridge itself were forced to drop where they were {{with no place to}} take shelter. The [...] long approach ramp to the bridge was so exposed to German artillery, who successfully and repeatedly killed soldiers and destroyed equipment lined up to cross the bridge, that the GIs nicknamed it [...] "Dead Man's Corner". Medics normally removed bodies as quickly as possible because of the negative impact it had on morale. But bodies accumulated so quickly on the {{approach to}} the bridge, and there were so many wounded for the medics to tend to, that corpses were stacked head high.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the likely}} {{presence}} of a significant force nearby the Australians remained cautious as they searched for the Viet Cong. Over {{the next two days}} they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering more dead as they did so. Yet with up to two Viet Cong battalions still believed to be in the area and the continued vulnerability of Nui Dat to attack from the 274th Regiment, Jackson lacked the resources to pursue the withdrawing force. Company patrols continued to search up to [...] east, and to the north of Nui Dat 2. The search area was subsequently expanded to include that contested during Operation Hobart. Several tracks were found with telephone cables running along them, as well as further drag marks, blood stains, <b>discarded</b> <b>equipment,</b> fresh graves and evidence of use by heavy cart and foot traffic. The main Viet Cong withdrawal route was discovered after midday on 19 August, moving east away from the scene of the fighting. Townsend requested permission to follow it believing he had sufficient forces, but Jackson would only permit 6 RAR to advance a further [...] to remain within artillery cover, and would not allow the guns to move forward to increase the range of their protective fire. By 20 August the Australians had counted 245 Viet Cong dead, while scores more were found later. Up to four weeks after the battle decomposed bodies were found in the area, while numerous graves were also located, none of which were included in the estimates of Viet Cong losses. The bodies found later brought the total to about 300 dead. D Company, 5 RAR returned to Nui Dat early on 21 August, while D Company, 6 RAR was also withdrawn for two days leave in Vung Tau.|$|E

50|$|In {{the game}} scenario, Earth has been {{replaced}} by a dark mass (the creature) that is growing outward toward the six planets of the remaining galactic species. Cryptic transmissions from Earth can be obtained from satellites or from communication relays that players can construct during the course of the game; these transmissions are goals that specify actions to take, such as <b>discarding</b> <b>equipment</b> or people, or visiting certain places on the board. Through game play, players can build new spaceships, upgrade their spaceships, or build mines that slow the process of the creature. They do this by visiting places on the board that can be tagged to produce various resources that can be used to hire personnel and build technology and equipment. Each turn, a random event drawn from a deck of event cards can either benefit or hinder the player whose turn it is. Creature growth cards can be added to the event deck to alter the difficulty of the game.|$|R
