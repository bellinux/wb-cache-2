The microwave estimator {{is the first}} to utilize 54 -, 118 -, and 183 -GHz channels for simultaneously retrieving a relative <b>humidity</b> <b>profile.</b> It utilizes 2 separate instruments simultaneously. The first instrument is a medium-resolution dual-band radiometer with one set of 8 double-sideband 118 -GHz channels and a second set of 8 single-sideband 54 -GHz channels. The other instrument is a high-resolution double-sideband radiometer with a set of 3 183 -GHz channels, and additional channels at 89, 220, and 150 GHz. The infrared estimator is among the first to utilize a hyperspectral infrared aircraft instrument for relative <b>humidity</b> <b>profile</b> retrievals. The infrared instrument is a 9000 -channel interferometer operative over the wavelength range of 3. 8 - 16. 2 microns. Both estimators utilized neural networks of comparable topology and training methods. The training data was generated from the SATIGR set of 1761 RAOBs using a different implementation of the discrete radiative transfer equation for each estimator. The test data were from two clear-air ER- 2 aircraft flights during the tropical CAMEX- 3 mission near Andros Island. The retrievals were robust in the face of unknown instrument bias and noise, which introduced a difference between the training data and the flight data. A noise-averaging technique achieved robustness in exchange for a degradation in sensitivity of the retrieval algorithms. Robustness was demonstrated by the retrieval agreement between the microwave and infrared instruments. The theoretical average rms error in relative humidity for the various techniques on the training set was 12 % for the microwave estimator, 11 % for the infrared, and 10 % for a linear regression of the two. In application to two flights, the rms error was 9. 4 % for the microwave, 7. 7 % for the infrared, and 7. 7 % for the combination, based on comparisons with nearby radiosondes. by Jay Brian Hancock.

The ISCCP-DX data of GMS were used to compute the cloud amount for each cloud type over the 1. 5 degree grid area centered at the radiosonde station. To obtain the reliable cloud type classification, the data at 00 UTC when the visible data were available were used. The radiosonde observations when the 1. 5 degree grid area is covered by single cloud type were used to compare the relative <b>humidity</b> <b>profile.</b> Four cloud types of low-level, middle-level, cirrus- and cumulonimbus-type cloud were selected for the comparison. As was expected, the relative humidity was highest at all levels when the cumulonimbus-type cloud existed and was lowest at all levels when no cloud existed. The relative humidity was higher than that of a cloud-free case at middle-level (low-level) when middle-cloud (low-cloud) existed. Cirrus clouds are difficult to identify objectively from single infrared measurement. In ISCCP, however, cirrus cloud can be identified with the use of visible and infrared measurements. When cirrus cloud existed, the high level relative humidity showed local maximum and was higher than that when low- and middle-cloud existed...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict {{terrestrial}} evapotranspiration (E) {{is limited by}} the complexity of rate-limiting pathways as water moves through the soil, vegetation (roots, xylem, stomata), canopy air space, and the atmospheric boundary layer. The impossibility of specifying the numerous parameters required to model this process in full spatial detail has necessitated spatially upscaled models that depend on effective parameters such as the surface vapor conductance (Csurf). Csurf accounts for the biophysical and hydrological effects on diffusion through the soil and vegetation substrate. This approach, however, requires either site-specific calibration of Csurf to measured E, or further parameterization based on metrics such as leaf area, senescence state, stomatal conductance, soil texture, soil moisture, and water table depth. Here, we show that this key, rate-limiting, parameter can be estimated from an emergent relationship between the diurnal cycle of the relative <b>humidity</b> <b>profile</b> and E. The relation is that the vertical variance of the relative <b>humidity</b> <b>profile</b> is less than would occur for increased or decreased evaporation rates, suggesting that land–atmosphere feedback processes minimize this variance. It is found to hold over a wide range of climate conditions (arid–humid) and limiting factors (soil moisture, leaf area, energy). With this relation, estimates of E and Csurf can be obtained globally from widely available meteorological measurements, many of which have been archived since the early 1900 s.

Volumes of radiometric data have been collected using airborne MIR measurements during a series of field experiments since May 1992.

Even greater improvement of retrieved <b>humidity</b> <b>profiles</b> can be accomplished by increasing the number of channels used and by selecting their spectral location and bandpass to obtain sharper independent weighting functions.
