5|$|The Hynish tower {{has been}} {{converted}} to house the Skerryvore Lighthouse Museum, run by the Hebridean Trust who have also restored the pier. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to visit Skerryvore with Tiree-based Skipinnish Sea Tours.|$|E
5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of nicotine replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|The head {{today is}} used {{for a variety of}} reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all over the head due to the well defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the Bournemouth Coast Path. In 2008, many paths were resurfaced, making more (though not all) parts of the head {{wheelchair}} accessible. For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to gain wheelchair access to Quarry Pool. Regular field trips to the site are made by students of all ages and there are occasional guided tours or meetings around the head covering a wide variety of subjects.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> {{to reach}} the station through the Temple Quay office {{development}} (on {{the site of the}} goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to {{test for}} {{heterozygosity}} by measuring 17α-hydroxyprogesterone elevation after ACTH stimulation, or more recently by direct gene sequencing.|$|E
50|$|Suddenly <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> {{to travel}} from Fredericton into Nova Scotia (and on to Halifax or New Glasgow) {{completely}} on a four-lane controlled access highway.|$|R
50|$|A local {{newspaper}} reported that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> {{to look forward}} to the day when Llandilo would be connected by rail with ports in the north of England.|$|R
25|$|Blavatsky {{claimed that}} its {{contents}} had been revealed {{to her by}} 'mahatmas' who had retained knowledge of humanity's spiritual history, knowledge that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible,</b> in part, to reveal.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{thanks to}} the {{adoption}} of modern technologies, such as Virtual and Augmented reality systems, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to develop immersive and interactive digital environments for the exploitation of the underwater archaeology.|$|E
25|$|Previously, {{the amount}} of water contaminating {{biodiesel}} has been difficult to measure by taking samples, since water and oil separate. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to measure the water content using water-in-oil sensors.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> {{to install}} and select non-English {{languages}} on a per-user basis which transforms the entire shell and application user interfaces based on that language. Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish are examples of supported languages. This feature is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to {{converse}} without actually shouting, and Joe {{was eager to}} understand why the tug remained immovable when in the ordinary course of events she should be beating herself to pieces on the shoal.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were very}} modern for their time, and {{were similar in}} design to the standard gauge Einheitslokomotiven. The engines fulfilled expectations; by double-heading <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to haul even very long (up to 56 axles) narrow gauge trains uphill.|$|R
50|$|Turbocharger {{technology}} was improved greatly by developments during World War II and subsequent {{development of the}} gas turbine. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to use smaller turbochargers on smaller, higher-speed engines. Diesel locomotives with turbodiesels began appearing in the late 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
25|$|The ticket system changed {{again from}} 15 August 2012. E-Cards were {{replaced}} by Vilnius Citizen Cards ("Vilniečio Kortelė"). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to buy a card or change an old one in newspaper stands and have it credited with an appropriate amount of money or {{a particular type of}} ticket. Single trip tickets have been replaced by 30 and 60-minute tickets.|$|E
25|$|The {{non-linear}} {{nature of}} digital audio technology {{has also made}} selecting and accessing the required recordings much more flexible than tape-based models. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to take a recording of every birdcall {{you are likely to}} encounter in a given area out into the field stored on a device that will slip into your pocket, and to retrieve calls for playback and comparison in any order you choose.|$|E
25|$|Cryofixation – {{freezing}} {{a specimen}} so rapidly, in liquid ethane, and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even liquid helium temperatures, {{so that the}} water forms vitreous (non-crystalline) ice. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called cryo-electron microscopy has branched from this technique. With the development of cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.|$|E
60|$|After {{three days}} the storm subsided. The Persians then {{repaired}} the damages {{which had been}} sustained, so far as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to repair them, collected {{what remained of the}} fleet, took the shipwrecked mariners from their rude fortification on the beach, and set sail again on their voyage to the southward.|$|R
60|$|She {{then turned}} her {{attention}} to the external world once more. The rain continued as usual, but the wind had abated considerably during the discourse. Judging that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to keep an umbrella erect, she pulled her hood again over her bonnet, bade the witch good-bye, and went her way.|$|R
25|$|Another {{part of the}} 2007 {{electoral reform}} <b>was</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to {{accommodate}} election observers in the election process. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development declined the invitation to send observers, however, stating that the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights had insufficient funds to send observers on such short notice.|$|R
25|$|Before O. 53 was amended in 2011, the High Court did {{not have}} {{jurisdiction}} to grant a declaration under O.53 proceedings, as a declaration is not a prerogative order. If an applicant wished to obtain both prerogative orders and declarations, a separate action had to be commenced for the declarations. After the amendment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to include a claim for a declaration if leave has been granted to the applicant to apply for prerogative orders.|$|E
25|$|Today, all the {{conservatories}} {{of music}} in Ukraine offer courses majoring in bandura performance. Bandura instruction is also offered in all music colleges and most music schools, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to get advanced degrees specialising in bandura performance and pedagogy. The most renowned of these establishments are the Kyiv and Lviv conservatories and the Kiev University of Culture, primarily because of their well-established staff. Other centers of rising prominence are the Odessa Conservatory and Kharkiv University of Culture.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} {{software-based}} virtual studio environments have emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. Such tools provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to create high quality music using {{little more than a}} single laptop computer. Such advances have democratized music creation, leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet.|$|E
50|$|This gate, {{for those}} {{travelling}} by land, {{was called the}} Spaarnwouderpoort. With the new canal and its towpath, the trip <b>was</b> so short, <b>it</b> became much more popular, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to travel {{back and forth to}} Amsterdam on the same day. Thus the name of the gate changed to Amsterdamse Poort.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} MaxModule {{processing}} modules were developed for MaxVideo 20. One {{of these was}} Siegel's MiniWarper, a 20 MHz real-time warper based on a new ASIC design, MW4242. With the advent of MaxModules, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to implement an imaging function on a small and simple board with much less overhead than a full VME board.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NDC made the {{strategically}} important decision {{to focus on}} creating a generic controls platform for AGV builders. Driven {{by the development of}} computer technology, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> for NDC to offer the flexibility that AGV builders needed to create customized driverless vehicles. The new NDC business model was born: “Generic technology to be applied by others.” ...|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{increasing}} popularity of contact lenses and laser corrective eye surgery, glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that {{return to their}} correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as titanium alloys, which were not available in earlier times.|$|E
25|$|Air quality {{monitoring}} has improved {{in recent years}} and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to compare BC communities on a variety of measures. Comparative data on four measuresfine particulate matter, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxideshows the Fraser Valley to rank lower than Vancouver on several measures of air quality. For example, Fraser Valley communities had less than half the levels of nitrogen dioxide, and were lower in fine particulate matter and sulphur dioxide (on the latter measure, Abbotsford and Chilliwack were among the lowest of all BC sites).|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to use {{computers}} {{to search for}} routes using the nonlinearities in {{the gravity of the}} planets and moons of the Solar System. For example, it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to Mars, passing close to one of the Earth's Trojan points. Collectively referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network, these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the Lagrange point (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections). The biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow, taking many years. In addition launch windows can be very far apart.|$|E
50|$|The section between I-70 on the West Side and I-71 on {{the south}} side opened in August 1970. In late 1970, {{sections}} opened on the east side between US 33 and I-70, and between State Route 3 (SR 3) in Westerville and SR 161 on the east side. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to bypass Columbus using I-270 by going around {{the south side of the}} city.|$|R
50|$|In 1867 KPM had to {{make way}} for the {{construction}} of the Prussian Parliament close to Potsdamer Platz. The new building was on the edge of the Tiergarten. It cost 360,000 thaler. On account of its position by the river Spree <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to transport raw materials and manufactured goods on barges. Constructed between 1868 and 1872, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> equipped with the most modern techniques of the day.|$|R
50|$|Archaeology {{increasingly}} {{became a}} professional activity {{during the first}} half of the 20th century. Although the bulk of an excavation's workforce would still consist of volunteers, <b>it</b> would normally <b>be</b> led by a professional. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools, and by the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates.|$|R
