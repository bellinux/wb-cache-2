Moderate frequency (5 Hz) is found to be more effective than lower or higher frequency on steel surface cleanliness. A novel interpretation of cyclic voltammagrams is used to estimate the surface cleanliness. This correlates very well with XPS determination of surface carbon levels.

The support structures, which keep the inner tank in position to the outer tank, are made of materials with low thermal conductivity, e. g. glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastics. The remaining heat inleak leads to a boil-off rate of 1 to 3 percent per day. Active cooling systems to increase the stand-by time before evaporation losses occur are being studied.

40|$|High strength, high {{toughness}} and good weldability {{are the major}} demanding factors for engineering structural materials uses in naval construction. HSLA- 80 steel is essentially low carbon micro alloyed and copper strengthened high strength steel typically used for ship building application. The hydrogen presence in high strength steels causes untimely brittle fracture under static load condition. Hydrogen enters into metal and reduces the cohesive strength of metallic atom, creates void and enhance the brittlement. In the present study, the loss in ductility and susceptibility to fracture of HSLA 80 grade steel was studied by using fracture toughness parameters (J integral and CTOD) in hydrogen and air environment. The tests were carried out with very slow displacement rate through cyclic loading. The hydrogen environment was generated with NaOH aqueous solution. Single Edge Notched Beam (SENB) samples with fatigue precrack {{were used for the}} tests. J-R and Ä-R curve were developed by ASTM standards. It is observed that fracture toughness of air environment tested sample was higher than hydrogen environment tested sample and fracture occurs after stable tearing. The fracture surface of the failed samples was examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and it was observed that the failure occurred by cleavage, quasi cleavage and transgranular fracture. From the present study it was clear that in <b>hydrogen</b> environment the <b>brittleness</b> is more and the related fracture toughness values confirm the same. The hydrogen enhanced local plasticity is more applicable mechanism for hydrogen embrittlement. Mechanical property of the as received steel was studied by tensile testing and hardness test.

40|$|Fleischmann等于 1974 年首次在电化学氧化还原粗糙化处理银电极表面观察到吸附吡啶分子的高质量拉曼光谱，随后被证实该电极存在约 106 的表面增强拉曼效应。表面增强拉曼光谱(Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy，简称SERS）具有独特的、对表面物种的极高检测灵敏度（目前报道的最高表面增强因子可达 1014) ，是表面科学乃至单分子科学的重要的谱学技术。但是，二十余年来与纳米科学的一些基本问题紧密相关的SERS机理迄今未被全面认知。国际上公认该技术的实际应用仅局限于具有强SERS效应的自由电子性质的银、金、铜三种金属。因此，如何将SERS研究拓宽至其它金属（特别是具有广泛应用背景的过渡金属）体系是解决上述难题的关键。最近，田中群研究组建立和发展了数种表面制备和处理方法，并充分挖掘高灵敏度共焦显微拉曼光谱仪的潜力，在宽广的电极电位区间分别获取一系列纯过渡金属（如铂、镍、铁、钻、钯、铑、钉等及其合金）电极体系的各种表面物种的高质量SERS信号。通过实验发现各种过渡金属分别具有一至四个数量级的表面增强效应，这对于表征过渡金属催化剂或电极表面少量吸附分子是极其重要的，也更新了表面科学和光谱学界普遍认为过渡金属不具有表面增强效应的原有观点。然而，由于所有这些金属表面的几何结构和电子结构的复杂性，其增强机理仍然不完全被人们所理解。 在SERS发现之后，人们又观察到了其它表面增强光学效应（如表面增强红外（(SEIRS). 表面增强二次谐波(SESHG）和表面增强合频(SESFG)) ，但是相关的表面增强机理也尚未披个面认知。基于这些效应皆需要在纳米尺度上的粗糙表面或颗粒体系方可产生的实验事实，我们认为以SERS效应为代表的表面增强光学效应不仅是表面科学、而且是纳米科学的尚待解决的基本问题。因此，本课题的主要目的是通过理论研究，促进SERS机理和相关纳米科学问题研究的深入开展。 目前，人们探讨表面增强机理通常从两个方面出发：(I) 电磁场增强，它主要是从经典电磁场理论出发，通过解Maxwell方程研究激发光和拉曼散射光与金属表面作用产生表面局域光电场的增益；(2) 化学增强，它主要是吸附分子在金属表面发生化学吸附，导致吸附分子的某些振动模的拉曼散射截面增大，进而增强拉曼信号。在化学增强机理中类似于共振拉曼效应的光诱导电荷转移机理常对拉曼信号有显著的贡献。但由于金属表面结构的复杂性，目前从理论上研究表面增强拉曼散射效应仍存在很大的困难，这主要表现在以 下几个方面 i) 振动谱时间分辨率。在时间上，吸附分子在金属表面发生拉曼散射是一种极快的过程，约为皮秒到飞秒数量级。而大量的实验结果目前仍局限于常规谱学结果，这为理论分析带来很大的困难。 ii) 金属表面结构的复杂性。通常用于表面增强拉曼光谱实验研究的金属表面要通过粗糙化处理或为纳米级金属粒子表面，在理论上较难直接描述其真实几何结构和能级结构因此，理论上仅是借用一定的模型进行理论模拟。采用量子力学方法，很难像单晶面那样得到准确的能带结构并描述其光学过程。 iii) 在金属表面上吸附分子的拉曼散射过程常涉及到基态和激发态的势能面。因此，从理论上确定在金属表面发生化学吸附分子的好的势能面是极为困难的。 iv) 如何从理论上描述金属基底、吸附分子与入射光子二者之间的相互作用关系，将电磁场增强机理和化学增强机理有机地结合仍然是理论研究表面增强效应的重要任务。 以上几个方面的困难导致目前表面增强拉曼散射机理研究仍处在探索和发展阶段。本研究工作主要针对过渡金属电极表面的吸附及其表面拉曼光谱强度进行了理论探讨。虽然氢原子和吡啶分子属于结构简单的表面探针，但它们在表而化学乃至表面科学技术中都具有极为重要的地位。所以我们选择这两个模型分子在过渡金属表面的吸附和表面增强拉曼散射作为主要研究体系。 氢原子在电极表面的吸附涉及到许多重要的表面过程，如表面析氢反应、金属氢脆、燃料电池反应等。而吡啶分子是芳香化合物在表面过程中的典型探针分子。由于拉曼光谱不仅反映吸附分子的振动信息，而且与表面电子结构密切相关。因此，理论研究电极表面拉曼光散机理有利于从电子水平、揭示电化学界面现象的本质。对氢原子在铂(100) 表面吸附的研究结果表明，桥位吸附氢最为稳定，项位次之，穴位最不稳定。由于采用了金属簇模型和Gauss基密度泛函理论，在计算中金属簇的电子自旋多重度是一个需要选择的极为重要的物理量。通过对各种自旋多重度电子态的计算，基于能量分布规律，确定出所选金属簇的电子基态波函数，并作为能反映电极表面主要电子性质的电子波函数。并以此作为进一步研究表面拉曼光谱性质的出发点，探讨了氢原子吸附在铂电极表而的多种因素〔吸附位、覆盖度、激发光波长和电极电位）对表面拉曼光谱强度的影响。在铂电极表面，采用氩离子激光线 514. 50 nm并在负电位和高覆盖度情况下，可以检测到项位吸附氢原子的拉曼信号。虽然桥位和穴位氢的振动模都具有拉曼光学活性，但其拉曼散射截面明显比顶位氢的低，导致难以采用该激发线得到它们的拉曼信号。同时也探讨了表面吸附氢原子扩散到表面内层的机理。发现从穴位到潜表面位，潜表面氢原子的稳定性密切相关于表面电子结构。 由吡啶分子在钴电极上的表面增强拉曼散射光谱得到环呼吸振动模的增强因子约为 103 。虽然这明显比吡啶分子吸附在币族金属上的增强因子（ 105 - 106 ）小。但是它对检测表面小量吸附分子是极为重要的，特别是对高磁性的金属钴。基于电磁增强和化学增强两种机理，理论计算增强因子分别为 80 - 160 倍和 24 - 43 倍。电磁场增强与表面金属粒子的形状有关，如采用椭球长径比为 3 : 1 ，则平均电磁增强因子达到 500 倍。这明显大于长径比为 2 : 1 的椭球的平均增强因子。实验结果表明光诱导电荷转移方向从电极表面到吸附吡啶分子，且在电位变化过程中可能存在两种电荷转移态的贡献。其贡献人小依赖于实验所施加的电位值。基于KHD色散方程，理论分析了两个激发电荷转移态（ 2 B 1 和 2 A 2 ）对拉曼散射截面的贡献。对不同的激发光波长的电位-强度关系图分析，得到两个激发电荷转移态在不同电位下的能量位置、均相常数和跃迁电偶极矩。由于界面毗啶浓度相对较高和拉曼光谱中有 240 cm- 1 谱带，因此，吡啶分子主要以氮端直立或略微倾斜式吸附。 总之，本博士后工作的初步研究结果表明，表面增强拉曼光谱是一种极为有用的谱学手段，人们从它不仅可以得到表面吸附探针分子的信息，也可以从它获取表面低能电子动态信息。随着激光源的发展和新型激光器的应用，选择合适的探针分子，SERS谱将有助于人们探索更宽能量范围的表面电子结构信息 最后应当指出，本研究报告中理论工作仍处于探索阶段，对于描述表面复杂的光学过程仍然很不完善。作者会在以后的工作中继续进行这方面的研究，争取发展和完善该领域的理论研究方法，为SERS机理的理论研究工作做出一点贡献。Fleischmann et al. {{observed}} {{for the first}} time the high quality Raman spectra of pyridineadsorbed on an electrochemically roughened Ag electrode surface in 1974. A six-orderenhancement of the Raman signal for the adsorbate was confirmed later. Surface-enhancedRaman spectroscopy (SERS), which has of a unique and high sensitivity for detecting surfacespecies (the highest enhancement factor reported reaches to 1014 so far), is an importantspectroscopic technique in surface science and single-molecular sciences. However, the SERSmechanism closely associated with some fundamental but key problems of nanometer sciencecannot be understood completely for about two decades. The well-known potential applicationof the technique was only limited to the free electron metals with strong SERS effect such as Ag,An and Cu. Therefore, how to extend the SERS study to the other metal systems, especially totransition metals with wider potential applications, is a key to solve the above difficult problem. Recently, the research group of Tian has established and developed several methods for surfacepreparation and treatment. With the help of these methods and by use of confocal microprobeRaman spectrometer the high quality Raman spectra of various adsorbates have been obtainedfrom a series of pure transition metals, such as platinum, nickel, iron, cobalt, palladium, rhodium,ruthenium and their alloys in a potential region. These experiments give evidences that thesetransition metals exist the SERS effect with the enhancement factor of 101 to 104. This is not onlyvery important for characterizing small quantity of adsorbates on these metals, but also change theoriginal viewpoint that surface scientists and the spectroscopist think the transition metals havingno surface enhancement effect. However, owing to the complexity of the surface geometric andelectronic structures, the enhancement mechanism of SERS on all these metal surfaces has not yetbeen understood completely. After the discovery of the SERS, people also found other surface enhanced optical effects. such as SEIRS, SESHG and SESFG. But the enhancement mechanisms of these phenomena alsocannot be understood completely. Based on the fact that all these enhancement effects arenecessary to be generated from rough surfaces or particles at the scale of nanometer, we think that the surface enhanced optical effect is not only a fundamental problem for surface sciences, butalso for nanosciences. Therefore, the goal of the project is to promote our understanding of theSERS mechanism and its correlation with nanosciences. There are two widely accepted mechanisms in literature for the interpretation of the SERSeffect. One is the electromagnetic enhancement, which describes the gain of the local opticalelectric field with respect to that of the incident (scattering) light by solving the Maxwell equation. The other is the chemical enhancement, which arises from the chemisorption of adsorbate onmetal surfaces, resulting in the increase of Raman scattering cross section and the enhancement ofthe Raman signals for some given vibrational modes of adsorbates. Similar to the resonanceRaman effect, the photo-induced charge-transfer mechanism contributes to the SERS signal in thechemical enhancement. However, due to the complexity of the metal surfaces, it is still difficult tostudy the SERS effect theoretically. The following four difficulties encountered in SERS mayaccount for the slow development of SERS theory. i) Time resolution of vibrational spectroscopy. The Raman scattering process for adsorbateon metal surfaces occurs in a very short period, which is at a scale about picosecond tofemtosecond. While the present experiments were generally carried at the scale of convenient time,yielding a great difficulty in theoretical analysis of the experimental data. ii) Metal surface structural complexity. It is too difficult to describe the realistic geometricand band structures due to the roughened metal surfaces or nanoscale metal particle surfaces usedin the SERS experiments. Therefore, one has to borrow a model to simulate the SERS spectra ofadsorbate on these specific surfaces. Furthermore, it is difficult to describe accurately the opticalprocess in terms of the geometry and band structures on rough surfaces by the quantummechanical theory as it does on single crystal surfaces. iii) The Raman scattering involves usually the ground and excited states of adsorbate onmetal surfaces. So, it is much difficult to determine the potential energy surfaces of the groundand excited states. iv) How to describe the relationship among the interactions of the substrate, adsorbate andphoton and to combine organically the electromagnetic and chemical mechanisms are key tasks oftheoretical study. performed the theoretical studies on hydrogen and pyridine adsorption on the transition metalelectrodes. In the spite of the simple structures of hydrogen and pyridine, they play very importantroles in electrochemistry and surface sciences. So both molecules are selected to study theadsorption and SERS on the transition metal surfaces. Adsorption of hydrogen atom on electrodes is involved in a number of important processes,such as <b>hydrogen</b> evolution reaction, <b>brittleness</b> of metals and fuel cell reaction. On the other hand,pyridine is a typical probe in the vast amount of aromatic molecules on the surface reaction. TheSERS reflects not only the vibrational information of the adsorbates but also is closely associatedwith the electronic structure of electrode surfaces. Therefore, the theoretical study of the SERSmechanism on the electrodes is helpful to reveal the nature of the electrochemical interface at thelevel of electrons In chapter I, the calculation result for hydrogen adsorbed on platinum shows that thestability of hydrogen on platinum decreases in the order of the bridge site, on-top site and hollowsite. Since in present work, the metallic cluster modeling and the density functional theory withthe Gaussian basis were used, an appropriate selection of the spin multiplicity is very important tothe calculation. Based on the rule of energy distribution, the present work for the metal clustersprovides the ground state wave functions, which are used to calculate spectroscopic properties ofhydrogen adsorbed on platinum. Those factors, which influence the Raman intensity, werediscussed in Chapter 2. The result indicates that the Raman signal can only be detected for thehydrogen adsorbed on the top site with a monolayer coverage probed by the Ar ion line (514. 5 nm) at negative potentials, in agreement with the experiment. Although the vibrational modes ofhydrogen on the bridge and hollow sites are of Raman activity, the Raman scattering crosssections are very low, resulting in the difficulty in the detection of the Raman signal by thisexcitation line. The mechanism of the hydrogen diffusion from surface to subsurface was alsodiscussed in Chapter 3. The result shows that the stability of the subsurface hydrogen is closelyassociated with the surface electronic structure The experimental Raman spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the cobalt electrode showed thatthe enhancement factor for the ring breath mode is about 103. Although the value is smaller thanthe enhancement factor (105 - 106) for pyridine adsorbed on the coinage metals, this is veryimportant for characterizing small quantity of adsorbates on transition metals, especially for cobalt with high magnetism. Based on the electromagnetic and chemical enhancementmechanisms, the enhancement factors predicted in Chapter 4 are about 80 [...] 160 and 24 [...] 43 folds,respectively. The electromagnetic enhancement depends on the shape and size of the nanoparticleson the electrode. For instance, the average enhancement factor is about 500 folds for the prolatespheroid with an aspect ratio of 3 : 1, which is obviously larger than that with the aspect ratio of 2 : 1. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that the direction of forming the photo-inducedexcited charge transfer (ECT) state is from metal to pyridine and there are two ECT states (2 B 1 and 2 A 2) with the variation of the potential. The contributions arising from both ECT states toRaman intensity rely on the potential applied and are analyzed based on theKramers-Heisenberg-Dirac dispersion equation. The energy positions, homogenous dampingconstants and the electronic transition dipole moments of both ECT states are obtained fromanalyzing potential-Raman intensity profiles. Considering that the concentration of pyridine atinterface are quite high and the 240 cm- 1 band originated from the Co-N vibration can be detected,the adsorption orientation of pyridine is proposed to be perpendicular to or slightly titled on thecobalt electrode surfaces. In summary, the preliminary result of the present report reveals that the SER spectroscopy isa powerful technique, which can not only provide the information of adsorbed probed molecule,but also acquire the information of the electronic structure of metal (electrode) surfaces. With thedevelopment of the laser technique and the application of new types of laser with varyingwavelength, it will be more convenient to probe the surface electronic structure with the widerange in energy by choosing proper molecular probe and using SERS. Finally, it is necessary to point out that the studies on SERS theory are still very preliminaryfor describing the complex optical process of adsorbates on surfaces. Thus, further systematictheoretical studies are highly desired. The author would like to continue to work on this directionto further develop and establish the research method for such kind of system in hope of makingsome meaningful contribution to reveal the complicated SERS effect. 学位：博士后院系专业：化学化工学院化学系_物理化学(含化学物理) 学号：BHBG 0000...|$|R
