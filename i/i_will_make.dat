5|$|King Artaxerxes {{thinks it}} {{just that the}} cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But {{whichever}} of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon them <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> every {{sacrifice}} {{required of}} me to stay on this path.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> a sortie, {{flying over}} those calm clouds in a {{peaceful}} emotion. I can think about neither life nor death. A man should die once, and no day is more honorable than today to dedicate myself for the eternal cause. (...) I {{will go to the}} front smiling. On the day of the sortie too, and forever.|$|E
60|$|MAGISTRATE. Well, I'll remand {{them for}} a week. Bring them again to-day week; if I see no reason against it then, <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>make</b> an order.|$|R
60|$|DICK. Have some Eau de Cologne. <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>make</b> you a bandage. [He {{takes the}} Eau de Cologne, {{and makes a}} bandage with his handkerchief.] It's quite clean.|$|R

25|$|If any injury {{has been}} done to you, if any blow has been aimed at your {{political}} character and reputation, it is I who have attempted it; revenge yourself on me, renounce me, but assist in saving your country—I will retire, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> any extirpation or atonement that can satisfy you—you are younger, more active, more able than I am, you can do more good. If my...renunciation of the world will restore you to the public service, God forbid I should hesitate a moment.|$|E
25|$|Now the Lord {{had shown}} unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were {{organized}} {{before the world}} was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good, and {{he stood in the}} midst of them, and he said: These <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.|$|E
25|$|King Artaxerxes {{thinks it}} {{just that the}} cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians.

25|$|At any rate, in 1464 (9 Aug.), Billing {{was added}} to the three judges of the king's bench, but by the king's writ only: and the {{question}} being thereupon raised, it was decided that a commission in addition to the writ was required for the appointment of a justice of assize. Baker in his Chronology,' and Hale in his ‘Pleas of the Crown,' says that on the trial of Walter Walker for treason in 1460, for having said to his son, 'Tom, if thou behavest thyself well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> thee heir to the Crown' i.e. of the Crown Inn, of which he was landlord, Billing ruled a conviction, and Lord Campbell accepts the story. But it would seem from the report of the judgment of Chief-justice Bromley in the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, 17 April 1554, that the judge at that trial was John Markham, afterwards chief justice next before Billing, and that he directed an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{had picked}} a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin {{would not have}} allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt {{compelled}} to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> an exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E
500|$|Roman {{troops at}} first {{attempted}} to dissuade Lucullus {{from engaging in}} battle since October 6 marked {{the day of the}} disastrous battle of Arausio, where the general Quintus Servilius Caepio and his Roman army were delivered a crushing defeat by the Germanic Cimbri and Teuton tribes. Ignoring his troops' superstitious beliefs, Lucullus is said to have responded, [...] "Verily, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> this day, too, a lucky one for the Romans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom, <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>make</b> {{a bargain}} with you," [...] cried Fanny, eagerly. [...] "It {{was n't my}} fault that Gus and Frank were there, and I could n't help their {{speaking}} to me. I do as well as I can, and papa need n't be angry; for I behave ever so much better than some of the girls. Don't I, Polly?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Here I might {{enter on}} a chaste description, [...] Having {{withstood}} temptation in my youth, [...] But hear that several people take exception [...] At {{the first two}} books having too much truth; [...] Therefore <b>I</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>make</b> Don Juan leave the ship soon, [...] Because the publisher declares, in sooth, [...] Through needles' eyes {{it easier for the}} camel is [...] To pass, than those two cantos into families.|$|R
500|$|Another {{well known}} line {{of this book}} by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, [...] "In that case <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> you an offer {{that no one would}} decline." [...] This has been {{reworked}} by Mario Puzo in the novel The Godfather (1969) and its film adaptation (1972); [...] "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{controversy}} at the rear-end of the grid, as Spyker asked the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) {{to look at}} the new updates that were put on the Super Aguri at Indianapolis to see whether the Aguri team are receiving current Honda parts. On Saturday, Super Aguri's managing director Daniel Audetto said [...] "We have rules – they [...] can just protest. Tell them to protest – if I have something to complain about, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> a protest." ...|$|E
500|$|Cambridge were coxed by Leigh Weiss while Oxford's cox was Alison Norrish [...] it was {{the first}} time in the history of the Boat Race that both crews had female coxes. [...] Prior to the race, Oxford coach Pat Sweeney criticised Weiss: [...] "Their cox is so useless she might hit us. [...] It's not her fault, but Cambridge should have chosen someone who knows the river." [...] Weiss responded [...] "I feel {{confident}} that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> the decisions to make Cambridge win." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Let me {{catch my}} fish, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> soon <b>make</b> you a fire,' he {{answered}} gaily, {{for he was}} young, and {{knew nothing about the}} difficulties of fire-making.|$|R
500|$|Richard Cantillon {{amassed a}} great fortune from his speculation, buying Mississippi Company shares early {{and selling them}} at {{inflated}} prices. Cantillon's financial success and growing influence caused friction in his relationship with John Law, and sometime thereafter Law threatened to imprison Cantillon if the latter did not leave France within twenty-four hours. Cantillon replied: [...] "I shall not go away; but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> your system succeed." [...] To that end, in 1718 Law, Cantillon, and wealthy speculator Joseph Gage formed a private company centred on financing further speculation in North American real estate.|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} that the Beast says while {{negotiating with the}} Axe Gang for killing the Landlady and Landlord – [...] "...then young friend, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> an offer you cannot refuse", is a reference of the dialogue from the movie The Godfather. Also, the Landlady's comment to Brother Sum – [...] "We brought a gift you cannot refuse" [...] is an obvious parody of the same, to which Sum replies (in the dubbed version of the film), [...] "Ha! With the Beast on our side, we shall see for whom the bell tolls", {{a reference to the}} 1943 film.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Kennedy {{announced}} he would form an exploratory committee {{to run in the}} newly redrawn 4th congressional district. Congressman Barney Frank, who had previously represented the district, had announced his retirement, leaving an open field for the seat. Kennedy explained, [...] "I will then begin {{to reach out to the}} people of the Fourth District in order to hear directly from them about the challenges they are facing and their ideas on how we can restore fairness to our system. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> a final decision about entering the race in the weeks thereafter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miles," [...] he confessed, as {{he entered}} the sitting room, [...] "there are some things <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never <b>make</b> fun of again. Have you a {{personal}} enemy here?" ...|$|R
40|$|After {{many centuries}} Greece has again {{captured}} the attention of the world. This time is not about the innovations that Greeks have provided in mathematics, philosophy and arts. However, this note is not about the past but the future. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>make</b> any comments about the current situation or what has brought us here. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> only <b>make</b> three statements about what can take us out of the dire straits. For the latter to take place we, the Greeks, need to participate in one wedding and two funerals...|$|R
6000|$|That 'is' to say, with 'some exception', [...] For though <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>make</b> confession, [...] I've {{seen too}} much of man's {{deception}} [...] Ever again to trust profession.|$|R
500|$|In early May 1916 Des Jardien {{signed to}} play Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Indians. Indians manager Lee Fohl {{said at the}} time, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> him a good pitcher. He already has learned to put more on his fast ball while his control is almost perfect." [...] He made his debut on May 20, 1916, {{pitching}} one inning and allowing one hit, one base on balls, and two earned runs. Des Jardien did not pitch another game in Major League Baseball. In the summer of 1917, Des Jardien played semi-professional baseball with the Mohawks in the Chicago League.|$|E
500|$|Many {{writers have}} adopted an intertextual approach, looking at earlier texts {{from which the}} author of the Mark Gospel may have drawn. In particular, {{parallels}} have often been noted between the darkness and the prediction in the Book of Amos of an earthquake in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah: [...] "On that day, says the Lord God, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight". Particularly in connection with this reference, read as a prophecy of the future, the darkness can be seen as portending the end times.|$|E
500|$|Boycott was {{involved}} in a number of disputes while on Achill. Two years after his arrival, he was unsuccessfully sued for assault by Thomas Clarke, a local man. Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott's house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay him and told him to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: [...] "If you do not be off, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> you." [...] Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually owe him any money.|$|E
