500|$|Cobb went on {{to write}} the first single-author book in {{environmental}} ethics, <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>Too</b> Late? A Theology of Ecology, in 1971. [...] In the book, he argued for an ecological worldview that acknowledges the continuity between human beings and other living things, {{as well as their}} mutual dependence. [...] He also proposed that Christianity specifically needed to appropriate knowledge from the biological sciences in order to undercut its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness) and devaluation of the non-human world.|$|E
500|$|This {{work has}} been pioneered by John B. Cobb, Jr., whose book <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>Too</b> Late? A Theology of Ecology (1971) was the first single-authored book in {{environmental}} ethics. [...] Cobb also co-authored a book with leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly entitled For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to economics, and received the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy (1994), which aimed to challenge [...] "economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth." ...|$|E

500|$|Luke's line, [...] "Welcome to the O.C., bitch", {{which he}} says after beating up Ryan, became a tagline for the show. TV Land placed the line as 83rd in its 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases in 2006. Hadley Freeman of The Guardian noted that the teen-focused show made many {{cultural}} references due to a [...] "renewed interest in the teen market", adding {{that the use of}} cropped tops, micro-minis, and beaded flip-flops showed a [...] "decidedly West Coast approach to fashion". The episode's cultural references to fashion included Julie Cooper's question to her pre-pubescent daughter, [...] "Do you like my hair this straight or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> Avril Lavigne?", while another mother complains, [...] "What are you doing putting my daughter in Calvin Klein? She was supposed to be in Vera Wang!" [...] Teenage misfit Seth complains that [...] "Every day's a fashion show for these kids".|$|E

2500|$|Some of the victims' {{families}} {{said they}} felt cheated, as his suicide meant {{they would never have}} the satisfaction of Shipman's confession, and answers as to why he committed his crimes. The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: [...] "You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is even {{a further}} {{suggestion}} that Drews has noticed. Why was the reversal of the order made? Evidently to bring the Intercession before the Consecration. This means to change from the same order as Antioch to that of Alexandria. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> much to suppose {{that we have here}} a case of Alexandrine influence at Rome? Now it is noticeable that Gelasius personally had a great reverence for the venerable [...] "second See" [...] founded by St. Mark, and that since 482 Bishop John Talaia of Alexandria, being expelled from his own Church by the Monophysites, sought and found refuge in Rome. He would have celebrated his own liturgy in the pope's city, and was certainly greatly honoured as a confessor and exile for the Faith. May we then even {{go so far as to}} suggest that we owe the present certainly unusual order of our Canon to Gelasius and the influence of John Talaia? So far Drews (p.38).|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Sir Colin Hope stated: [...] "...he {{factory in}} {{question}} was not owned or operated by this Company. It was {{owned and operated by}} a company known as J.W. Roberts Limited ("JWR"). JWR ceased production at that factory in 1958/59, and vacated and sold the premises shortly thereafter. Although JWR continued in business for some time after leaving the Armley site, the company ceased to trade over twenty years ago... I am aware of the various comments and allegations that have been made about JWR's Armley factory, particularly as the source of the contamination to which you refer. Those comments and allegations are not accepted." [...] In the Commons, John Battle responded that he was in possession of correspondence [...] "in which the same T plc sought to convince Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes that, for tax purposes, J.W. Roberts of Armley was still in business {{as an integral part of}} T and should be taken into account when calculating tax reductions. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> cynical to suggest that JWR is counted in only for profits, but discounted when it comes to its responsibility for local lives?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914 caused {{the enactment of}} Home Rule to be postponed {{for the duration of}} the conflict. Judged from the perspective of that time, Redmond had won a form of triumph: he had secured the passing of Home Rule with the provision that the implementation of the measure would be delayed [...] "not later than the end of the present war", which [...] "would be bloody but short lived". His Unionist opponents were in confusion and dismayed by the passing of the Home Rule Act and by the absence of any definite provisions for the exclusion of Ulster. In two speeches delivered by Redmond in August and September 1914, deemed as critical turning-points in the Home Rule process, he stated: [...] "Armed Nationalist Catholics in the South will be only too glad to join arms with the armed Protestant Ulstermen in the North. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> much to hope that out of this situation there may spring a result which will be good, not merely for the Empire, but good for the future welfare and integrity of the Irish nation?" ...|$|E

60|$|This {{time his}} uncle smiled. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{difficult}} for Shelton to feel angry at that ironic merriment, with its sudden ending; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> impersonal to irritate: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> concerned with human nature.|$|R

5000|$|Another reason {{given for}} these {{failures}} <b>was</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> {{far ahead of}} the buying habits of the public. One quote from journal Automation in Marketing said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just <b>too</b> much for the average mind to grasp; too far in advance of the public thinking.
