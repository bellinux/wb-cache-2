50|$|The Laurel Falls Trail is {{the most}} trampled, beaten, and worn <b>down</b> <b>path</b> in the entire {{national}} park- {{at least to the}} waterfall. Because of this the national park service has had to pave this segment trail with a dark concrete, so as to prevent further erosion of the trailside. Furthermore, there is a wooden post at every 0.1 mi, giving the many visitors who walk the 1.3 mi to Laurel Falls an indicator of just how far they have to go. The paved section of the path, while often very crowded, does offer a nice, gentle walk in the woods, accessible to most children, and inasmuch has been designated as a nature trail by the park service. The second-growth forest is rather thick over this period, and is often decorated with a thick laurel thrush, for which the Laurel Branch and her signature waterfall are named. As the hiker approaches the falls, s/he should begin to hear the roars of both tumbling waters and a host of visitors who have made the trip to the surprisingly powerful cascade. Laurel Falls is an 80-foot (25m) multi-level waterfall. The trail crosses over the midsection of the waterfall via a grip of boulders, as the gushing waterfall sprays mist overhead and dives into a narrow gorge below. Although much has been mentioned of how heavily trafficked the trail can be at times, the waterfall is popular for a reason: {{it is one of the}} most magnificent in the national park.|$|E

Since TDS does not measure the magnitude of an attribute, we undertook Time Intensity studies to assess stickiness of peanut pastes during oral processing. In the absence of another attribute becoming dominant, the intensity of sticky/cohesive sensations may remain paramount but diminish in intensity, prior to swallowing...|$|E

40|$|In this project, two {{new power}} {{efficient}} data-aware cells have been proposed. In the proposed cells, dynamic power consumption {{is reduced by}} reducing the voltage swing on the respective bit-lines during write operation. In first proposed cell (7 T BLC), an extra transistor is included {{in one of the}} pull <b>down</b> <b>path</b> of the 6 T cell. This transistor is known as a tail transistor and its switching activity is controlled by the voltage at the bit-line. The second cell (9 T cell) is designed after modifying the conventional 6 T cell at the architecture level. The switching operation of the pull up and pull down transistors of the left inverter is controlled by an additional write signal. The value of the write signal is decided by the data to be written in the cell. The cell behaves dynamically during write operation due to a broken latch which allows the data to be flipped quickly. The read operation in the 9 T cell is performed on a separate circuit which consists of two series connected transistors and one read bit-line...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This brief {{proposes a}} novel {{low-power}} digital logic design {{scheme based on}} the energy exchange in the switched inductor–capacitor (SLC) circuit. It presents a design paradigm which in ideal case {{may lead to a}} circuit capable of performing logic operations with no switching losses. In traditional integrated circuit design, the energy is stored in the output load capacitor through a pull-up path (corresponding to storing a logic 1). When the output changes its logic value, this stored energy is dissipated through the pull <b>down</b> <b>path</b> to the ground. In order to reduce this switching energy dissipation each time the load capacitor is discharged, we store its energy in the magnetic field of the inductor in the proposed SLC architecture. Whenever the output load needs to be charged again, we transfer the energy back from the inductor to the load capacitor. This significantly reduces the switching energy. We illustrated the operation of the SLC architecture through SPICE simulation. A brief discussion of some practical considerations for this architecture is also presented.

40|$|Abstract. We provide {{informal}} psychophysical {{support for}} a strategy where bottom ^ up features guide attention toward a target, and the top ^ <b>down</b> <b>path</b> interprets hypothetical shapes at the target locationöas opposed to a dominant top ^ down approach. In our survey, for which we used the familiar picture of a Dalmatian dog against a dappled background, (i) 75 % of subjects initially found a bulging body which overlaps that of the dog, but final `top ^ down ' percepts were unexpected: nearly all subjects assigned an incorrect head and limbs to the body; (ii) after random rotation of texture elements overlapping computed features only 45 % of subjects reported a bulging body, with a few adding limbs etc. The picture of the Dalmatian dog must therefore contain many bottom ^ up featuresöa top ^ down strategy may find `incorrect ' targets at correct target locations. Computational support for these claims is more easily constructed than one may expect. We could compute at least two bottom ^ up features, both useful in 3 -D surface interpolation from 2 -D scenes, which yielded significant values {{at the location of}} the Dalmatian dog: anisotropic texture compression and affine texture distortion cues. We therefore conclude that the role of top ^ down processing is overstated in a traditional example such as the Dalmatian dog picture. ...|$|E

40|$|Wavefunctionals {{of three}} {{dimensional}} quantum gravity are {{extracted from the}} 3 D field theoretic analogs of the four dimensional Donaldson polynomials. Our procedure is generalizable to four and other dimensions. CTP # 2363, hep-th/ 9409146 September 1994 Since topological invariants are a subset of diffeomorphism invariants, elucidation of their role in gravity {{is expected to be}} of (at least) pedagogical value in constructing a quantum gravity theory. We know how to write <b>down</b> <b>path</b> integral expressions 1 for the Donaldson polynomial invariants 2 of four dimensional manifolds. Thus we will investigate the role the topological gravity analogs of these invariants play in ordinary quantum gravity. The simplest setting to examine this is in three dimensions where quantum gravity can be written as a BF of Chern-Simons topological field theory 3. In the interest of applications to four and higher dimensions, our discussion below will emphasize generality 4. Consider a general field theory (GFT) with action SGFT[X] and a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) 5 with action STQFT[X, Y] = SGFT[X] + SS[X, Y], (1) both on a manifold, M, with boundary, ∂M = Σ. The set of fields Y are akin to the super-partners of the GFT fields X. Let O(X, Y) denote a product of observables in the TQFT whose total ghost number is equal to the dimension of the moduli space the TQFT is defined for. Construct the Hartle-Hawking wavefunctional (the notation |Σ means restriction to Σ), Ψ[X|Σ, Y |Σ] = [dX][dY]e −STQF T O(X, Y), (2) in the TQFT by performing the indicated functional integrals with fixed boundary values, X|Σ and Y |Σ, for the fields. Then set Y |Σ = 0 in this TQFT wavefunctional This is a summary of a talk presented at the Seventh Marcel Grossmann Meeting on Genera...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} interplay between global finance and remote firms and institutions. It {{highlights}} the interactions between global institutional investors and Japanese firms on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards, {{and the process of}} change in Japanese corporate governance practices. It focuses on analysing the responses of large Japanese firms {{with a high level of}} foreign ownership to global finance and global institutional investors' strategies for engagement. Japan provides an excellent research environment for the topic. It is geographically and culturally remote from the West, and has the worldâs third largest economy with increasing foreign ownership on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Under the influence of global finance, the Japanese economy has been in transition despite the persistence of its traditional institutions. There are many globally recognised Japanese firms, although certain firms have come under scrutiny in several recent corporate governance scandals. Recently, corporate reform has become one of the priority policy agendas, which has led to incremental convergence to global standards. The aims of this thesis are as follows: (i) to analyse the evolution of shareholder activism and corporate governance practices in ownership structure change (Chapter 3); (ii) to examine how global institutional investors privately engage with remote firms (Chapter 4); (iii) to explore the power of global investors in an industry with lower foreign ownership (Chapter 5); (iv) to analyse the perceptions of local firms towards global ESG standards under policy change (Chapter 6). The thesis revealed the following findings. First, global investors provide one of the only opportunities for ESG-related dialogues for local firms, in a country where local institutional investors are not active shareholders. Global finance has the power to transform local corporate governance practices by breaking <b>down</b> <b>path</b> dependence and institutional complementarities, although the status quo does persist. Second, local firms' norms and perceptions based on the existing institutions are culturally derived informal constraints, which slow down the change of corporate governance practices even after instrumental change. Third, the target firms of engagement activities are home-biased and limited to a small number of large global brand firms; hence, non-target firms and industries maintain their ESG standards unless policy reform occurs. Finally, local firms' unfamiliarity with engagement activities limits the power of global finance in a remote market. There is a gap between global institutional investors' motivation for engagement and Japanese firmsâ readiness to respond; hence, considered strategies and modes of communication are critical for effective engagement with remote firms, especially when language and organisational issues are present. </p...|$|E
