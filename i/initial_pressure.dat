The resistance of the dielectric is of a different nature and has been compared to the compression of multitudes of springs, which, under compression, yield with an increasing back pressure, up to a point where the total back pressure equals the <b>initial</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the <b>initial</b> <b>pressure</b> is withdrawn the energy expended in compressing the [...] "springs" [...] is returned to the circuit, concurrently with the return of the springs to their original condition, this producing a reaction in the opposite direction.

40|$|In this work, hydrate-based CO 2 {{removal from}} a CH 4 /CO 2 mixture was studied. CH 4 /CO 2 led to faster hydrate {{formation}} than pure CH 4, because {{the existence of}} CO 2 resulted in easier hydrate nucleation. Kinetic separation of CO 2 was observed in the CH 4 /CO 2 hydrate formation with different initial CO 2 proportions (1. 83 - 27. 76 %) due to the higher CO 2 affinity of formation of hydrates. However, the initial CO 2 proportion of CH 4 /CO 2 showed no obvious effects on the hydration ratio of CH 4 and CO 2 and the separation efficiency when the gas was superfluous in hydrate formation. In addition, hydrate-based multistage separation of CH 4 /CO 2 was established and conducted at different <b>initial</b> <b>pressures</b> (4, 5 and 6 MPa). The CH 4 proportions were increased from 72. 24 % to 97. 30 %, 97. 22 % and 97. 14 % after separation by four, five and seven stages at <b>initial</b> <b>pressures</b> of 4, 5, and 6 MPa, respectively.
