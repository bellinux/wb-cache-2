Tool runout causes tool cutting edges to experience uneven forces during milling. This fact also affects tool life and deteriorates workpiece surface quality. In this article a procedure, in order to diminish the effects of tool runout, is presented. The procedure is based on chip thickness modification {{by means of the}} fast correction of the tool feed rate. Dynamic feed rate modification is provided by superposing our own design of a <b>fast</b> <b>feed</b> system driven by a piezoelectric actuator to the conventional feed drive of the CNC machine tool. Previously, a model of the dynamic behaviour of the system was developed to analyze the influence of <b>fast</b> <b>feed</b> rate modification on cutting forces.

The purpose is the precise removal of In 2 O 3 SnO 2 thin-film nanostructures from optical PET diaphragm surfaces for digital-paper surface. In the current experiment it was found that a large rotational diameter (Dc) for the cathode with a small gap width between the anode and the PET diaphragm surfaces was found to remove the In 2 O 3 SnO 2 rapidly. A small edge radius of the cathode, or a short arc length of the anode, reduces the time taken for In 2 O 3 SnO 2 removal. A high feed rate of the PET and adequate electrical power results in fast machining. Pulsed direct current improves dregs discharge and this is an advantage with a <b>fast</b> <b>feed.</b> A high electrode rotational speed also corresponds to faster removal of the In 2 O 3 SnO 2 nanostructures.

We observed a network of predominantly secondary and higher order areas belonging to the auditory and motor modality. The extent of activity was clearly increased by imagination of the absent modality. However, this network did neither comprise primary auditory nor primary motor areas in any condition.

Fluorochrome-labeled anti-chicken CT 4 and CT 8 monoclonal antibodies were used to examine molting effects on chicken T cells and polyclonal anti-chicken immunoglobulin was used to detect chicken B cells. The labeled cell preparations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Molted hens had significantly decreased CT 4 + peripheral blood T cells on Day 3 in both trials and on Day 10 in one trial. No effects on peripheral blood CT 8 + T cells were observed. Splenic CT 4 + T cells were decreased on Day 11 in one trial whereas splenic CT 8 + T cells were significantly increased on Day 4 in two trials and on Day 11 in one trial. Peripheral blood and splenic B cells were largely unaffected in both trials.

The objective of this work is to give additional insight into HT technology. In the industrial research laboratory, HT screening has matured to become a reliable approach for rapid screening of both reaction parameter spaces, as well as material properties relevant for exhaust gas catalyst development. Due to the speed of optimized screening involving 48 parallel reactors, automated handling of primary data is an imported requirement.

To evaluate and improve separation methods, we processed test samples {{with a new}} procedure using a spiral panning table (panner) to wash and pre-concentrate heavy minerals before magnetic and lithium polytungstate (LST) heavy liquid separations. Our control sample was hand washed, separated magnetically, and processed with LST. Panner trial # 1 used a fast sample feed rate and slow rotation speed, resulting in 11 mg heavy minerals. Our yield was approximately doubled in trial # 2 using a slow sample feed rate. Jet Dry® was used in trial # 3 to cut surface tension, but yielded less than trial # 2. Last, trial # 4 used a fast rotation speed and a <b>fast</b> <b>feed</b> rate, which produced the highest yield of 38 mg heavy minerals. Compared with our expected yield (~ 5000 mg), yields from control (~ 800 mg) and panner (11 - 38 mg) were much less. However, the panner yielded 10 x the concentration of the denser zircon than the control, so toxic methylene iodide was not needed to separate apatite from zircon, which makes our protocol safer than current methods. Our experimental process took ~ 2. 5 hours per sample, compared to ~ 47 hours in the control, to complete. The greater speed, improved zircon concentration, and avoidance of toxic liquids are significant advantages of the new method, and further development should improve recovery efficiency...|$|E

Six broiler starter diets (a complete factorial of two methods of preparation and three particle sizes) were fed to chicks in three experiments. In all studies, feed intake was inversely related to the calculated surface area of the ground sorghum, independent of the method of grinding. In one experiment feed intake was recorded daily during 10 days starting at 4 days of age, in a choice situation. The chicks consumed feed in accordance to its coarseness.

Feed intake, body weight gain, and feed:gain ratio were determined in chicks kept in individual cages (two per cage) from 7 to 21 days of age.

The two SBRs were operated in parallel under the same conditions of organic load (0. 85 gCOD l(- 1) d(- 1)) and sludge age (about 10 d), the only difference being {{the length of the}} feed: less than 1 min vs. 5 h. In this way the conditions of a plug flow reactor and of a completely mixed reactor were simulated. The two systems were compared on sludge settleability (related to filaments abundance and floc morphology), substrate uptake rates and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) storage rates. The main difference between the two systems was in the settling properties of the sludge: both SVI and effluent solids were higher in the system with slow feed. With regard to filamentous microorganisms, even though both reactors were inoculated with the same sludge with high concentration of filaments, they were rapidly washed out from both systems. Microscopic observations showed that the reason for the different settling properties of the two sludges was in the floc structure, which was more compact in the system operated with <b>fast</b> <b>feed.</b> These data support the theory of the role of diffusion inside the flocs in determining the settling properties of the sludge.

The {{aim was to}} detect different frequencies of nuclear changes (apoptosis, necrosis, heterochromatin decondensation) under conditions assumed to be stressful in blood-sucking hemipterans. The insects were fasted for up to 90 days at 28 oC and their survival was followed daily. Groups of nymphs were separated each month, with {{part of the group}} being refed and the other part kept fasting. Insects in each of these subgroups received either a heat shock at 40 oC for 1 h or were maintained at 28 oC (control for heat shock). The Malpighian tubules were removed one and seven days af-ter each assay and subjected to the Feulgen reaction for identification and counting of the various nuclear pheno-types. Insect survival was high (90 %) even after 40 days of starvation but decreased thereafter. Necrosis rather than apoptosis, increased with <b>fasting.</b> <b>Feeding</b> after <b>fasting</b> increased the frequency of apoptosis but not of necrosis. The short heat shock as used here did not additionally affect the responses induced by fasting and refeeding.
