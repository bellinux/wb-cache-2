40|$|ABSTRACT: Today’s <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> are extreme complex {{information}} systems, which {{run on the}} Internet [1]. The facili-ties of <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> {{are increasing}} daily as the technology advances with a motive to provide the appropriate information to its users. The very purpose of the <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> is to provide the required information to its users in a convenient and fashioned manner. Since the <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> are running on the Internet and the users are from different psychological, educational and social backgrounds, the usage of <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> is varying from user to user which entail the need of best user interface. Hence, this paper proposes some design principles for user interfaces for <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> for its effective implemen-tation...|$|R

Although there is as yet no general consensus on the definition of DLs, they are generally referred to as "collections of information that are both digitised and organised" (Lesk, 1998). But, they are different from the Web in that they are different in several important aspects. For example, the Web represents a set of objects joined tog [...] ...|$|R

The improved availability does not have much effect on improved accessibility of resources. Accessibility is related to making the resources useable and useful for the user [1]. This shortcoming can be addressed by changing the focus from user-centered design to learner-centered design of <b>digital</b> <b>libraries.</b> In this paper, I present a theory of learning that is a natural fit for online <b>digital</b> <b>libraries.</b> Based on this theory, I will present a framework that provides guidance for design and development of educational <b>digital</b> <b>libraries.</b> I call the resulting <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> “Enabling <b>Digital</b> Libraries”. Enabling <b>digital</b> <b>libraries</b> are characterized by the interactions that provide processes and representations that enable a learner to grasp {{a higher level of}} understanding related to her task / information requirements / learning needs.
