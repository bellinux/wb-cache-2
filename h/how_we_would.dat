500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|Conran and Avnet {{were able}} to cut costs {{considerably}} by shooting the entire movie in 26 days (not the usual {{three to four months}} that this kind of movie normally takes) on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 and working entirely on three different blue screen soundstages in London, England with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because {{there was no time to}} shoot it on a blue screen soundstage. The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running Final Cut Pro that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, [...] "I don't know <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have made this movie. It's really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there." [...] After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in L.A. who added CG and sent it back.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'.

2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> land." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky, the Chairman of the Met, {{stated that}} after the 2017 {{financial}} setbacks, the Director position would be appointed separately from the position of CEO. Following a commissioned report from the Boston Consulting Group, the current interim CEO, president, and COO of the Met, Daniel Weiss, said that the Met's 2015–2017 financial setbacks were caused by [...] "slowing revenue, rising costs, and too many projects at once." [...] Weiss was further reported as having hired Will Manzer, formerly an executive at Perry Ellis, to help re-invigorate recently declining revenues at the museum. On April 26, Weiss stated that the budget shortfall of $15 million might require a re-assessment and increase in the museum's current admission payment policy. Weiss added that there remained concerns for a sustainable fiscal model for the Met in which city officials [...] "have {{a right to a}} clear understanding of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be engaging the public, how we balance access with sustainability." [...] In May 2017, the Met filed formal proposal to attempt to charge admission fees to out-of-state visitors. Robin Pogrebin, writing for the Times, reported that the request for out-of-state admissions would call for the re-legislation of the New York State 1893 Act which requires that the museum's collections [...] "shall be kept open and accessible to the public free of all charge throughout the year," [...] and any unlegislated changes would be subject to challenge by the New York State attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, or one of the tristate counselors, Christopher Porrino or George Jepsen.|$|E

In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes [...] "Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: [...] "they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and I think that they make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again.

During the fight, he is pulled into the game's fictional depiction of the real world. The injured Krueger arms himself with two razor claws to continue to battle Kahn.

In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cited the character's violent nature and iconic status as reasoning for the inclusion in the game, [...] "Over the years, we’ve certainly had a number of conversations about guest characters.

We never got a grip on <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do it, whether they’d be DLC characters or what. We also wanted to introduce a character who was unexpected. This DLC thing opens the doors to realizing these ideas." [...] Krueger went on to become playable in the mobile edition of the game's sequel, Mortal Kombat X, alongside Jason from Friday the 13th. In October 2017, Krueger's 2010 version was released as a downloadable playable character in the seventh chapter of the asymmetric survival horror game Dead by Daylight, alongside Quentin Smith.|$|E
