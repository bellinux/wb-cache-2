Recently the tension in Korean peninsula increased rapidly in accordance to when South Korea is going through the change in authorities with the new president. The international society’s attention was gathered with Korea welcoming its first female president Park Geun-hye; moreover she is the daughter of the former president Park Jung-hee, who made significance in Korean history. Provoking South Korea was a great risk for North Korea, possibly causing the country to completely isolated in the international society.

Traditionally as producers we 2 ̆ 7 re very good at producing, and by golly, somebody will buy it: build it and they will come. You will be learning today about what can and cannot be produced in these [alternative] systems and how profitably it can be done. This is very important, but you 2 ̆ 7 ve still got to sell the stuff. I think some of these alternative systems offer some challenges, and we 2 ̆ 7 re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at those. And they offer some opportunities {{that we have not}} seen for a long, long time. We 2 ̆ 7 re going {{to talk a little bit}} about those as well. So, we 2 ̆ 7 ll just get right into it...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} nowadays {{have made}} strict rules (and rightly so) for collectors, partly {{for the protection}} of the flora and fauna and to thwart unscrupulous exterminators of butterflies and orchids, partly, we suspect, also as a check on industrial espionage. Obviously, administrators behind their desks have no inkling of what dedicated botanists (and zoologists) are doing in the forest. Especially when the scientists come from the so-called ’rich’ countries the civil servants ask themselves why anybody would like to exchange a nice chair in an air-conditioned office with a lot of paper work for a most uncomfortable, hard log under a leaky fly in an insect-infested, humid, scary forest. Since they themselves certainly are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> there for themselves, they suspect other motives, and until they find out what these are, scientists are under suspicion and should be kept on a leash. Sometimes the requirements border on the ridiculous, as a few instances that have come to attention show: Unicates must be left with the host institute and can only be had on loan. Well, one could live with this, although especially these collections are often the most interesting...|$|E
40|$|This seminar {{deals with}} the {{determinants}} and consequences of economic inequality in modern societies. The topics {{we are going to}} cover are related to income and wealth inequality today and throughout history. The emphasis will be placed on what happens to income and wealth shares {{at the very top of}} the cross-sectional distribution of these economic variables. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at various chapters of the recent book of Thomas Piketty “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”. First, we are going to review the arguments presented in the book, and then we will carefully evaluate them. Basic Information about the Seminar Requirements: The registered participants in the seminar are expected to give a presentation of around 60 minutes on one of the topics listed below. They could use as a base for their presentation the chapters/papers listed under each topic. In addition to that, they need to submit a 10 - 15 pages 1 term paper which can later serve as an extended abstract of a potential master’s thesis based broadly on the topic(s) discussed in the seminar.

40|$|In 2010 almost 272. 000 pilgrims {{completed}} Camino de Santiago. Even though, it {{was just}} about 5. 000 pilgrims 20 years ago. Why? Thats the fundamental question and main theme of this diploma work. Seeking the answers, we need to specify cultural pattern of Camino de Santiago. As the topic is quite wide the analysis {{needs to be done}} on several theoretical levels. First of all, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the dimension of pilgrimage throughout the human history. We will follow its evolution from nomad way of life to todays phenomenon of independent travelling. The character of modern nomad will be also defined. The aim of the second chapter is to interpret human relation to sceneries and paths, human ability to structurize the space we live in and a short contemplation about the art of walking. Last chapter is about the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage. Major routes to Santiago de Compsotela are described at this part, focusing on their cultural environment, historical context and landscape disposals. Methodology mainly consists of reviewing relevant literature and participant observations made while making the pilgrimage in 2007 and 2010. Recently, the pilgrimage has gained a significant role in public interest as it has gained its legitimacy via natural human need and therefore reflects the condition of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Trade is a {{key element}} of the {{development}} policy of the European Union (EU). As the most important trading partner of developing countries, the EU attempts to facilitate the participation of developing countries in global trade and contribute to economic growth through providing market access and financial assistance. For twenty-five years, the commitment of the EU was largely focused on its former colonies, more specifically in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP). The developing world, in terms of the EU’s trade policy, was therefore divided between ACP states with special provisions under the Lomé Conventions and all other developing countries. With the new millennium, this special relationship came to an end. Pressure from several member states 1 and the World Trade Organization (WTO) led to an overhaul of the EU’s trade regime vis-à-vis developing countries and to the loss of the privileged position of ACP countries. The result of this overhaul is still pending. Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) – to be negotiated between the EU and several ACP regions – have only been realized in the Caribbean. This article will to examine the negotiations between the EU and West Africa and discuss the interests involved on the African side. Following the introduction, the second part of this article is dedicated to the Lomé Conventions with a focus on the change occurring from the third to the fourth revision {{in order to understand the}} current situation. The third part is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the Cotonou agreement and the trade regime of the EU in general before turning to the negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the EU and West Africa. The conclusion summarizes the main findings...|$|E
