5|$|As {{technical}} director of Digital's Corporate Strategy Group, Kotok {{was instrumental in}} creating the Internet Business Group which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web-based technologies. Digital created the AltaVista search engine, the Internet firewall, the Web portal, the webcast and live election returns. Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer.

We predict positive forecast error (i. e., optimism) <b>for</b> <b>buy</b> recommendations and negative forecast error (i. e., pessimism) for sell recom-mendations. We offer two explanations for this prediction: (1) the unconscious tendency to process information in a manner that supports one’s goal, which we refer to as the “objectivity illusion ” hypothesis, and (2) the economic in-centive to boost trade, which we refer to as the “trade boosting ” hypothesis. The pattern of analyst forecast bias we predict (i. e., optimism <b>for</b> <b>buys</b> and pes-simism <b>for</b> sells) is opposite in direction to that predicted by the management relations hypothesis—a commonly cited hypothesis for analyst forecast bias. We find broker-analyst earnings forecast errors are significantly op-timistic <b>for</b> <b>buy</b> recommendations and significantly pessimistic for sell ∗ Santa Clara University; †Brigham Young University and PricewaterhouseCoopers; ‡ University of Washington.

The platforms have step-free access to the trams, allowing unhindered accessibility by wheelchairs and perambulators.|$|E
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, not so much <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> things, but {{to interact with the}} people.

5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous {{for the next}} ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2006 {{decision}} {{to convert the}} Kolsås Line to metro standard, Akershus County Council announced they would order five units. In November 2006, the city government proposed that {{the maintenance of the}} new trains be privatized. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, after a few weeks, the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service. The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies Oslo T-banedrift and Oslo Sporvognsdrift, the latter being the operator of the tramway. Responsibility for the debt accumulated <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{empirical}} {{restrictions of}} a model of optimal order submissions in a limit order market. A trader’s optimal order submission depends on the trader’s valuation for the asset and the trade offs between order prices, execution probabilities and picking off risks. The optimal order submission strategy is a monotone function of a trader’s valuation for the asset. We test the monotonicity restriction {{in a sample of}} order submissions and their realized outcomes from the Stockholm Stock Exchange. We do not reject the monotonicity restriction <b>for</b> <b>buy</b> orders or sell orders considered separately, but reject the monotonicity restriction <b>for</b> <b>buy</b> and sell orders considered jointly...|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the bishops}} in England {{did not want to}} be consecrated by Stigand. Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford {{travelled}} to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester. Abbots of monasteries, however, came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as Æthelsige as abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> the office, so the charge is suspect.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese {{so they could}} eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese a bad reputation <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.|$|E

An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala Labyrinth, accessed after the Protagonist has reached {{a certain point in}} the story. The Labyrinth is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the Labyrinth requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act as a means of locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to moving}} its {{headquarters}} to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) {{was the largest}} company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, {{in an effort to}} attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city <b>for</b> <b>buying</b> a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.|$|E
