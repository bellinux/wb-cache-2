Microtearing modes dominate the non-lithiated pedestal top. The stabilization of these modes at the lithiated pedestal top enables the electron temperature pedestal to extend further inwards, as observed experimentally. Kinetic ballooning modes {{are found to}} be unstable mainly at the mid-pedestal of both types of discharges, with unstable trapped electron modes nearer the separatrix region.

40|$|Introduction A single {{electron}} transistor (SET) is a three terminal device without a classically conducting path from source to drain: between source and drain resides a capacitatively gated island with tunnel junctions {{on either side}} (cf.

For islands with dimensions comparable to the <b>electron</b> thermal <b>wavelength,</b> however, quantum confinement effects and energy-dependent tunnelling rates render the orthodox theory inapplicable. It is these quantum dot SETs that the present paper addresses. Computation of the conductance of such devices calls for a microscopic approach, that accounts correctly for both the quantum mechanics and the statistical mechanics of the quantum dot and its surroundings. 2.

We describe the rich transport physics in graphene-based nanodevices through optical analogies: From the Bethe and Kirchhoff-like diffraction patterns in the conductance of graphene slits to the Fabry-Perot oscillations of the conductance in nanoribbons. We introduce the concept of electronic diffraction barriers, which transmission cancels at the Dirac point. This gives central insight in the properties of Graphene subwavelength devices including nanoelectronics standard systems, such as quantum dots. As an application we propose {{a new type of}} quantum dots, namely functionalized subwavelength quantum dots, which could be used as molecular spin valves.

This thesis explores {{the framework of the}} very promising implementation of ptychography called the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE). The PIE algorithm provides an elegant solution to the phase problem that facilitates recovery of complex representations of both the illuminating wave and the object of interest. The aim of this thesis is to present work done on the study of the machinery behind the PIE algorithm. This thesis formulates the solution provided by the PIE algorithm in reciprocal space; this shows the exact minimisation routine implemented by the PIE update function and provides a unified framework for quantifying the performance of the PIE algorithm. This work is timely because it highlights aspects of the PIE algorithm that permits practical implementation of bandwidth extrapolation of a specimen from a small detector and demonstrates the uniqueness of the corresponding solution provided by the PIE algorithm. This thesis also presents a viable scheme that utilises the redundancy of the ptychographic dataset to greatly reduce the sampling requirement on the detector; thus optimising the dataset size employed in real-time high-resolution reconstruction of the specimen over a wide field of view.

5000|$|It {{has long}} been known that the best {{achievable}} spatial resolution of an optical microscope, that is the smallest feature it can observe, is of the order of the wavelength of the light λ, which is about 550 nm for green light. One route to improve this resolution is to use particles with smaller λ, such as high-energy electrons. Practical limitations set a convenient electron energy to 100-300 keV that corresponds to λ = 3.7-2.0 pm. Unfortunately, the resolution of electron microscopes is limited not by the <b>electron</b> <b>wavelength,</b> but by intrinsic imperfections of electron lenses. These are referred to as spherical and chromatic aberrations because of their similarity to aberrations in optical lenses. Those aberrations are reduced by installing in a microscope a set of specially designed auxiliary [...] "lenses" [...] which are called aberration correctors.|$|E
