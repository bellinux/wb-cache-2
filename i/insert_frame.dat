40|$|Space-time {{interest}} points (STIP) {{represent the}} significant variations in video, {{which do not}} alter greatly under spatial and temporal attacks and can enhance the robustness of video watermarking. In this paper, a novel video watermarking scheme exploiting STIP in DCT-SVD (Discrete Cosine Transform – Singular Value Decomposition) domain is proposed. Unlike the usual algorithm, STIP are selected by global and local steps. All global STIP are ordered in ascending order according to their response values, and STIP corresponding to the first several global response values are selected to maintain the stability. Afterwards, the STIP with largest local response value in one frame is selected as the center to generate square embedding region. The region is transformed into DCT-SVD domain, and the mid-frequency coefficients are segmented to embed the watermark by modifying the norm of the largest singular value using quantization. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed scheme guarantees high peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and is very robust against frame swapping, frame <b>insert,</b> <b>frame</b> dropping, noising, filtering etc. </span...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: 3 D SIFP (3 {{dimensional}} scale invariant features points) can {{embody the}} great changes in video both in {{spatial and temporal}} domain, which can assure the stability against spatial and temporal attacks. As a result, they enforce the robustness of video watermarking. In this paper, a novel video watermarking scheme exploiting 3 D SIFP in DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) domain is proposed. We establish the 3 D difference of Gaussian pyramid (3 D DoGP) and 3 D Hessian matrix to locate the 3 D SIFP, which are selected by global and local steps. All global SIFP are ordered in ascending order according to their 3 D Hessian matrix response values, and SIFP corresponding to the first several global response values are selected to maintain the stability. Afterwards, the SIFP with the largest local response value in detected frame are selected as the center to generate the square embedding region. The region is transformed into DCT domain, and the ZigZag scanned mid-frequency coefficients are segmented to embed the watermark by using modified odd-even quantization. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed scheme guarantees high peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and is very robust against noising, filtering, JPEG compression, frame swapping, frame <b>insert,</b> <b>frame</b> dropping, scaling etc. Copyright © 2014 IFSA Publishing, S.

40|$|Nowadays, a vast {{diversity}} of video formats co-exist. Displaying a different formatted video requires a {{conversion of the}} video into the display format usually by interpolation. In this thesis, two format conversions requiring interpolation are investigated: Deinterlacing and frame rate up conversion (FRUC). Deinterlacing converts the interlaced into progressive formatted video by filling up the missing scanning lines of the interlaced video. With a wrong selection of interpolation direction from spatial and temporal domain, the resultant video would suffer from visual artifacts including flicker, blur, distorted edge and so on. FRUC increases <b>frame</b> rate by <b>inserting</b> extra <b>frames</b> into the original video. Unlike deinterlacing, FRUC has no partial pixel information of inserted frames; thus, accurate correspondence between two successive frames is necessary for avoiding visual artifacts, such as blocking artifacts, blur and distorted structure. A line-warping based deinterlacing system is proposed in this thesis. Line-warping between two spatial lines can effectively interpolate the missing line. However, temporal lines have less correlation than the missing line due to possible motions. Therefore, a robust multiple temporal line-warping is proposed, which exploits all possible motion directions for interpolation. With a spatial-temporal merger and a soft switch between interpolated result and pure temporal average, the deinterlaced result is more robust and has fewer artifacts than the compared methods in both stationary and motion region. A novel framework for FRUC is developed by adopting a hybrid of predictive variable block-size motion estimation and optical flow for reliable motion estimation. The hybrid structure can complement each shortcoming; consequently, the found dense and smooth motion field adapt to large motion. With the accurate motion field, the missing frame can be interpolated robustly through proposed motion vector interpolation and selection. <b>Inserted</b> <b>frames</b> are shown to have higher visual quality than pure motion estimation and pure optical flow based method...|$|R

In the intended model, the highest tensions were in the places where the frame trailer is connected to the body and in bent parts of the frame and carrier of the wheels as well. The reinforcement of these sections at the time of manufacturing will result in the required safety.

40|$|Most {{computing}} {{and communicating}} devices have been personal computers that {{were connected to}} Internet through a fixed network connection. It is believed that future communication devices will not be of this type. Instead the intelligence and communication capability will move into various objects that surround us. This {{is often referred to}} as the "Internet of Things" or "Wireless Embedded Internet". This thesis deals with video processing and communication in these types of systems. One application scenario that is dealt with in this thesis is real-time video transmission over wireless ad-hoc networks. Here a set of devices automatically form a network and start to communicate without the need for any previous infrastructure. These devices act as both hosts and routers and can build up large networks where they forward information for each other. We have identified two major problems when sending real-time video over wireless ad-hoc networks. One is the reactive design used by most ad-hoc routing protocols. When nodes move some links that are used in the communication path between the sender and the receiver may disappear. The reactive routing protocols wait until some links on the path breaks and then start to search for a new path. This will lead to long interruptions in packet delivery and does not work well for real-time video transmission. Instead we propose an approach where we identify when a route is about to break and start to search for new routes before this happen. This is called a proactive approach. Another problem is that video codecs are very sensitive for packet losses and at the same time the wireless ad-hoc network is very error prone. The most common way to handle lost packets in video codecs is to periodically <b>insert</b> <b>frames</b> that are not predictively coded. This method periodically corrects errors regardless there has been an error or not. The method we propose is to <b>insert</b> <b>frames</b> that are not predictively coded directly after a packet has been lost, and only if a packet has been lost. Another area that is dealt with in this thesis is video sensor networks. These are small devices that have communication and computational capacity, they are equipped with an image sensor so that they can capture video. Since these devices in general have very limited resources in terms of energy, computation, communication and memory they demand a lot of the video compression algorithms used. In standard video compression algorithms the complexity is high for the encoder while the decoder has low complexity and is just passively controlled by the encoder. We propose video compression algorithms for wireless video sensor networks where complexity is reduced in the encoder by moving some of the image analysis to the decoder side. We have implemented our approach on actual low-power sensor nodes to test our developed algorithms. Finally we have built a "Digital Zoo" that is a complete system including a large scale outdoor video sensor network. The goal is to use the collected data from the video sensor network to create new experiences for physical visitors in the zoo, or "cyber" visitors from home. Here several topics that relate to practical deployments of sensor networks are addressed...|$|R

40|$|William Beckford (1760 - 1844) {{is known}} chiefly as a collector, bibliophile, Orientalist, {{and author of}} the Gothic novel, Vathek. In his early life he was also an inveterate traveller, and the {{published}} and unpublished writing he produced {{on the basis of his}} travels vastly outweighed his fictional output, but has received surprisingly little critical attention by comparison. Travel books were a prominent part of Beckford’s nationally celebrated library, and, as was his habit with books of all kinds, he made careful notes on his reading, extracting interesting passages and occasionally <b>inserting</b> <b>framing</b> remarks or observations of his own. This article briefly reviews Beckford’s career as a traveller and travel writer as context for a study of his practices and preferences as a travel reader, using as its raw material compilations of his reading notes, and books formerly owned by Beckford (with manuscript notes intact), held by the Bodleian Library. Whereas Beckford’s travel writing displays in abundance those qualities of interiority and imaginative freedom long synonymous with the idea of Romantic travel, as a travel reader he shows a keen interest in the empirical content of books, with a particular eye for landscape descriptions, natural history, and anthropological curiosities. At the same time, he is capable of talking directly and animatedly to books or their authors, and is occasionally provoked into comment on social or political matters. The article is a case study in the history of reading, with a rare focus on the popular Romantic genre of travel literature...|$|R

5000|$|This film is shot in {{a variety}} of aspect ratios, which differ {{depending}} on the camera or <b>frame</b> <b>insert</b> used. The most common aspect ratios are 6×6 cm (square/1:1) and 6×4.5 cm (rectangular/4:3). Other frequently used aspect ratios are 6×7 cm, 6×9 cm, and 6×17 cm panoramic. The 6×4.5 cm format is usually referred to as [...] "645", with many cameras that use this ratio bearing [...] "645" [...] in their product name. Cameras that can switch to different aspect ratios do so by either switching camera backs, by using a <b>frame</b> <b>insert,</b> or by use of special multi-format backs. All of these dimensions are nominal; actual dimensions are a bit different. For example, 6×7 cm might give an image on film that is actually 56×70 mm; this enlarges exactly to fill an 8×10 sheet of paper. Another feature of many medium-format models is the ability to use Polaroid instant film in an interchangeable back.
