5|$|Antoinism is {{a healing}} and Christian-oriented new {{religious}} movement founded in 1910 by the Walloon Louis-Joseph Antoine (1846–1912) in Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, Seraing. With a total of 64 temples, over forty reading rooms across the world and thousands of members, it remains the only religion established in Belgium whose notoriety and success has reached outside the country. Mainly active in France, the religious movement {{is characterized by a}} <b>decentralized</b> structure, simple rites, discretion and tolerance towards other faiths.|$|E

5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their <b>decentralized</b> mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as {{it was difficult to}} extract information from them.

5|$|President Hoover was {{defeated}} in the 1932 election by Franklin D. Roosevelt. MacArthur and Roosevelt had worked together before World War I and, despite political differences, remained friends. MacArthur supported the New Deal through the Army's operation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. He ensured that detailed plans were drawn up for its employment and <b>decentralized</b> its administration to the corps areas, which became {{an important factor in}} the program's success. MacArthur's support for a strong military, and his public criticism of pacifism and isolationism, made him unpopular with the Roosevelt administration.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how configurations of urban railroads and highways influenced urban form in Chinese cities since 1990. Each radial highway displaces about 4 percent of central city population to surrounding regions and ring roads displace about an additional 20 percent, with stronger {{effects in the}} richer coastal and central regions. Each radial railroad reduces central city industrial GDP by about 20 percent, with ring roads displacing an additional 50 percent. Similar estimates for the locations of manufacturing jobs and residential location of manufacturing workers is evidence that radial highways <b>decentralize</b> service sector activity, radial railroads <b>decentralize</b> industrial activity and ring roads <b>decentralize</b> both.

The chancellor, usually a former governor general, lieutenant governor, premier or diplomat, is the ceremonial head of the university.

5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others {{did the same with}} a <b>decentralized</b> collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E
