40|$|Abstract: Even {{when the}} main {{interest}} is in the sensory processes, the process of iden-tifying a visual pattern under threshold conditions {{is determined by the}} way sensory and decision processes are <b>interlocked.</b> Important <b>work</b> concerned with these questions was done by e. g. Ashby and Townsend (1986) and Kadlec and Townsend (1992), who investigated the conditions of sampling independence and perceptual and decisional sep-arability as tests for perceptual independence. These tests are computationally involved and the question is whether there exist simpler, more direct procedures allowing to test for sampling and perceptual independence. Here, methods of Dual Scaling and in par-ticular Correspondence Analysis (CA), applied to confusion matrices, are suggested. CA of confusion matrices yields scale values for (i) the stimulus patterns, and (ii) for the responses. It will be argued that to the extend the sensory activity, generated by show-ing a stimulus pattern, can be represented by a random variable, the scale values of the stimuli will provide estimates of the mean values of these random variables, relative to their variances, an the scale values of the responses provide information about possible response biasses. The argument carries over to data from discrimination experiments; however, in this paper only data from identification experiments will be considered. ...|$|R

This dissertation is simultaneously {{a study in}} the sociology of science, especially criminology, the life course, and gender relations in academia. I examine careers of male and female criminologists spanning nearly six decades in the post-WWII United States from a life course perspective, focusing on both careers stages and career trajectories as well as investigating differences by cohort membership, gender, and graduate department affiliation. Survey and interview data along with detailed information about crime-related scholarship published in leading sociology and criminology journals illustrate the unfolding of careers over time and offer insights into how and why careers progressed as they did. Cohort membership helps us understand how large scale changes affected individual opportunities and experiences, though career mobility and trajectories were largely stable over time. While gender initially appeared to play a limited role in the careers of male and female scholars, explicit attention to work and family life in the analysis of career trajectories demonstrated how the lives of scholars are clearly gendered at their intersection. Graduate department differences reflected both the concentration of specialized training programs in non-Research 1 institutions and the career opportunities available. My work illustrates the strengths of the life course approach, considering specific historical, social, and institutional contexts, demonstrating the <b>interlock</b> of <b>work</b> and family life, and showing the importance of early career experiences for institutional mobility and career trajectories.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{performance}} scaling lies in massively parallel workloads, but less-parallel applications will remain important. Unfortunately, future process technologies and core microarchitectures no longer promise major per-thread performance improvements, so microarchitects must {{find new ways}} to address a growing per-thread performance deficit.

40|$|Filtration as a {{means of}} {{separating}} solids from liquids is an important unit operation employed in a range of different industrial sectors, e. g. forest products, mineral, chemical process and pharmaceutical industries to name but a few. Accurate and applicable models for the filtration unit operation are imperative if industrial filtration equipment is to be designed correctly. Easy-to-filter, incompressible or near-incompressible materials can currently be modelled satisfactorily, thereby facilitating scale-up and design. There is, however, a lack of good models for compressible cakes that are formed by hard-to-filter materials. Efforts attempting to model filtration have often been based on average filtration properties; although providing certain information regarding filtration, this approach is inferior to that of using models based on local data. Models for filtration often contain lumped parameters, i. e. the classical filtration equation describes the filtration properties of particles using the average specific filtration resistance parameter. An alternative would be to base their filtration properties on the interactions experienced during filtration. Important interactions that should be considered between particles include surface forces, material bridges between particles and <b>interlocking.</b> This <b>work</b> investigates hard-to-filter materials. Two materials are used. A model material, titanium dioxide, is used to investigate the effects of particle interactions on filtration behaviour. Although all of the interactions mentioned above may be of interest, depending on the filtration situation, this thesis focuses on electrostatic interactions. The separation of green liquor, a process that is of great interest in the pulp and paper industry, is also investigated. Green liquor dregs form hard-to-filter, compressible cakes. As far as titanium dioxide is concerned, local filtration properties are investigated for different particle interactions. The inter-particle interactions are changed by controlling the ζ-potential. Both local solidosity and pressure are measured, and a local specific filtration resistance calculated from this data. It could be concluded that the compressibility of the filtration cake is changed substantially by altering the ζ-potential. Several published constitutive relationships for filtration are applied; they yield very similar parameters that are in good accordance to the characterization of the material...|$|R

The two termini are controlled by semaphores while the whole of the main line is equipped with colour-lights, ten of these being automatic. The boxes at Hardwick Central and Everglades Junction are fitted with Westinghouse 'L' type frames with, respectively, twenty-three and thirty-one miniature levers. The former was once part of the 227-lever installation at Crewe South junction while the latter is the complete frame from South Croydon junction. The country terminus, Cockcrow Hill, has a 16-lever full-size 'knee' frame manufactured by the Railway Signal Company, probably around 1930. It came from the Waterloo terminus of the Waterloo & City line. Exactly as in full-size practice trains are offered and accepted between signal boxes by the use of Block instruments. Because of the complication of the area it controls, and there may be as many as six trains on the track diagram at once, Everglades Junction box is also equipped with a train describer to assist the signalmen, usually two on duty together, in keeping track of movements. The signalling system is all-electric, including the <b>interlocking,</b> semaphores being <b>worked</b> by solenoids sealed for outdoor use. All signals return to 'danger' when the train has passed into the next track-circuit section.

The few sprung points are also detected to ensure closure after a train has passed through in the trailing direction.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} histologic changes {{produced}} by platinum microcoils with an inner core of cross-linked bovine collagen in experimentally induced aneurysms in swine, {{and to assess}} the feasibility of the system for the delivery of the collagen. METHODS: Bilateral pouch aneurysms were created in the side wall of the common carotid artery in seven barnyard pigs. Eight aneurysms were treated with coils designed with an interlocking detachment mechanism: in four of these, the coils had an inner core of collagen; in the other four, the platinum microcoils had a similar design but without the collagen mandrel. The packing density of the coils within the aneurysm was approximately the same for both types of coils. The other six aneurysms were left untreated and served as controls. Angiograms were obtained {{at the time of}} treatment (2 weeks after the aneu-rysms were created) and at 1, 4, and 8 weeks after treatment. All animals were killed 8 weeks after the treatment (10 weeks after the aneurysms were created). Arteries and aneurysms were resected en bloc and fixed for histopathologic study. RESULTS: The <b>interlocking</b> detachment mechanism <b>worked</b> well. Little difference was noted between the two types of coils in their ability to effect complete aneurysmal thrombosis (three of four aneurysms treated with collagen-core coils and two of four aneurysms treated with conventional coils). The collagen-core coils stimulated new colla-gen formation in areas proximal to the coils, and more fibroblasts were noted near the collagen-core coils than near the conventional coils. CONCLUSION: Local fibroblast proliferation and collagen production were stimulated by heterologous cross-linked collagen embedded in micro-coils in this experimental model. Such biologic stimulation holds promise for improving the endovascular cure rate of aneurysms in humans...|$|R

Chapter One introduces {{the field of}} mechanically interlocked molecules focusing on rotaxane and catenane surface assemblies {{in the form of}} single molecule thick self-assembled monolayers. A review of the surface-attached characteristics of mechanically interlocked molecules is given before exploring specific anion template directed strategies for their construction. The potential to incorporate both redox-active and optically-active functional groups within these mechanically interlocked molecules is also discussed. Chapter Two provides the experimental details and procedures employed in this thesis to characterise the molecular systems under investigation. Chapter Three introduces several surface characterisation techniques such as; ellipsometry, contact angle, X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, with a particular focus of applying these tools to probe the surface co-conformation of switchable and interlocked molecules at surfaces. Electroanalytical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrical impedance spectroscopy are also introduced. Chapter Four details the surface assembly of a series of ferrocene containing anion templated catenane self-assembled monolayers on gold. Detailed electrochemical and angle resolved X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterisation elucidates the co-conformation upon surface attachment. Chapter Five details the anion templated surface assembly of a redox-active rotaxane self- assembled monolayer on gold.

The Leader helps the Checker keep up by passing it branch results and prefetches. Next, this dissertation enhances Paceline with BlueShift, a circuit design method for TS architectures that improves a circuit's common-case delay rather than focusing on worst-case delay like traditional design flows. BlueShift profiles a gate-level design as it runs real benchmark applications to identify the frequently-exercised circuit paths and then applies speed optimizations to those paths only. These optimizations can be implemented in a way that can be enabled and disabled at run-time so that they do not exact a power cost when they are not needed (ie. when the processor is executing a throughput workload). Finally, this work presents LeadOut, a CMP design that combines Paceline with an additional per-thread performance enhancement: the ability to increase core supply voltage above nominal. LeadOut evaluates the performance gains that are possible with Paceline alone, voltage boosting alone, and both together. It shows major gains from applying the two techniques together when feasible and also shows that, in many cases, future CMPs have power and temperature headroom to exploit still more per-thread enhancements {{as long as they can}} be enabled and disabled dynamically according to application demand. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R

A pattern represents an encapsulated conceptual solution to a recurring design problem. Patterns save architects and designers from having to reinvent the wheel; they can use solutions that evolved over time to address similar problems. Contract patterns represent encapsulated solutions within a legal agreement (or set of agreements) to a particular legal problem. This problem might consist of a need to match the particular objectives of counterparties in a discrete part of a bargain or to address certain legal rules. A particular contract pattern <b>interlocks,</b> nests, and <b>works</b> together with other contract patterns to solve more complex problems and create more elaborate bargains. Interlocking patterns enable scalability. If Alexander’s architectural patterns for rooms create patterns for buildings, which create patterns for neighborhoods and cities, then patterns of individual contract provisions together form patterns for larger legal agreements. Patterns for legal agreements, in turn, interlock to create patterns for transactions, which mesh to create patterns for markets. For example, contract patterns help lawyers draft real estate contracts. These contracts interlock in sophisticated real estate transactions, which mesh with other contract patterns to form securitization transactions. Securitization patterns create markets for asset-backed securities, which form {{part of the larger}} shadow banking system. This scalability differentiates contract patterns from boilerplate. However, legal scholarship on boilerplate – including Henry Smith’s work on the modularity of contract boilerplate – illuminates how contract patterns function and how they allow certain debt contracts to become what Gary Gorton calls 2 ̆ 2 informationally insensitive 2 ̆ 2 and to enjoy many of the economic features of money. The pattern language framework explains not only how sophisticated contracts function, but also how they fail. The pattern language framework provides a lens for examining recent contracts law scholarship on the failures of sophisticated contract design, including 2 ̆ 2 sticky 2 ̆ 2 contract provisions in sovereign bond agreements, 2 ̆ 2 Frankenstein 2 ̆ 2 contracts in mortgage-backed securitizations, and the 2 ̆ 2 flash crash. 2 ̆ 2 If modularity and contract design patterns foster the development of new financial instruments and markets, then their features can also contribute to the unraveling of these markets. For example, by restricting the information content of contracts, patterns and modularity not only midwifed the creation of liquid markets for those contracts, they also played a role in 2 ̆ 2 shadow bank runs 2 ̆ 2 and the catastrophic freezing of these markets. The failure of contract patterns can have systemic effects for entire markets when a particular contract enjoys widespread use or when it is so connected to other critical contracts that cascading failures occur.

40|$|An {{interlocking}} system forms {{a vital part}} of a railway signaling system because it ensures the safe movement of trains. For one by controlling movable track elements like switches and for an-other by controlling signals. The engineering design of {{interlocking system}}s poses challenges to both engineers at e. g. Siemens and the infrastructure manager, e. g. Prorail in the Netherlands. Challenges arise from the cumber-some, labor intensive, conservative, ambiguous and failsafe nature of the interlocking engineering design processes. Best practices in lean production systems raise Siemens’ interest in a lean engineering approach, i. e. reduce the ‘waste’ that does not contribute value to the final rail product. The development of RailML, an open source IT tool that aims to standardize the ex-change of data in a variety of rail processes, may prove the lean catalyst. The lean philosophy has however seldom been applied in engineering design processes. Therefore, this research aims to provide insight in the drivers of the engineering design chain that decrease development time, increase data reliability and make application more flexible, while ensuring (fail-) safe systems. For that purpose, this thesis investigates the next research question: To which extent can RailML potentially enable a leaner engineering design of rail interlocking systems? This study focuses on the Dutch railway network. Furthermore, this study only considers engineering design processes and RailML as the data exchange tool. Five sub research questions lead to an answer: Which methodology leads to a lean transformation of rail interlocking systems’ engineering design? Best practices about lean transformations lead to a methodology that commences with defining complexity into standardized and varying requirements of the final design. A future lean structure of the chain follows from mitigating ‘waste’ and achieving lean transformation directions. The more standardized the require-ments, the higher the potential for an IT tool like RailML to miti-gate ‘waste’. Case specific transformation directions include ‘waste’ prioritization, process standardization, open source IT tools, a modular process and information sharing. A model study allows to quantify the improvement of a strategy like RailML on the status quo and benchmark the lean effect. Four criteria count: costs, time, interdependencies and ambiguities. How would a future lean interlocking engineering design change the status quo? The status quo contains twenty processes that struggle with non value added work in progress, many (non machine readable) data transfers, ambiguous interlocking design from scratch, high fixed costs, many validation processes and low productivity rates. A lean engineering design process mitigates most of that ‘waste’ by concentrating on five main processes: project definition, data preparation, interlocking area design, interlocking engineering and a dry test. Realistically, varying requirements and completely new interlocking areas prevent full automation of the engineering design chain. How should interlocking be implemented into RailML for the purposes desired by Prorail? Prorail proposed to use and provided the files of the Santpoort Noord interlocking area as a case study to formalize the interlock-ing in RailML. A RailML interlocking formalization from the per-spective of a train requesting a route, results in a complete, con-cise and RailML group coherent interlocking formalization that allows to capture all necessary rail elements for (Siemens’) inter-locking engineering and the two-block three-aspect system ATB-EG. The RailML structure contains two main sub elements: signals and segments. The signal element captures aspect dependencies on the basis of entrance speed profiles, signal aspect and target signal combinations. The segments element covers route relevant elements. In the case of ETCS level 3, the interlocking formaliza-tion might ultimately become superfluous. How does RailML change the interlocking engineering design chain when implemented as the rail data exchange tool for railway signaling systems in the Netherlands? RailML mainly improves the design stage by machine readable transfers, elimination of interlocking area design from scratch and automates test protocol development. At the engineering stage, RailML eliminates the data preparation process and a part of interlocking IT engineering. These improvements do however assume the existence of a single data source in the chain e. g. a GIS. RailML mainly lacks the ability to achieve a modular engi-neering design, continuous process flow, improved project man-agement and lean perfectionism / learning effect. What benefits does the application of the RailML formaliza-tion have during the engineering design of an interlocking area over the traditional and lean process structure? RailML reduces Siemens’ costs between 17 %- 27 % and covers 21 %- 35 % of a lean cost reduction, depending on project complexity. RailML improves productivity by 26 %- 47 % although this only covers 6 %- 14 % of a lean improvement. RailML relatively improves transaction costs but needs a larger average of non value added work-in-progress to achieve so. RailML reduces the tier rejection rate by 47 %- 77 %, which is 50 %- 81 % lean. RailML worsens the non value added work-in-progress for high complexity projects. RailML shows deviating lead time performance: a reduction of 2 %- 25 % which is 2 %- 64 % lean. RailML reduces the current amount of design rules by 55 %, which is 85 % lean. In general, RailML improves the performance of the interlocking engineering design chain on almost every performance metric, for each project complexity. RailML covers about 43 % of the lean state for a medium complexity interlocking area as Santpoort Noord. Academically, the proposed interlocking formalization excels in its way of incorporating signal aspect dependencies, minimal amount of data (barely any redundancy) and alignment with both industry and infrastructure managers. In fact, on the RailML congress of September 2013, the RailML group decided to study the implementation of the developed formalization for different signaling systems than the Dutch and different engi-neering processes than Siemens’. The lean methodology leads to a scientific benchmark of a strategy’s, e. g. RailML’s, lean perfor-mance. The methodology however needs a substantial amount of data and does not seem to work as well for high complexity pro-jects as simpler ones. The author mainly recommends Siemens and Prorail to continue with the development of RailML, to start an interlocking engineer-ing design pilot project with RailML and to enlarge the degree in which interlocking areas can be standardized. From an academic standpoint, the author mainly recommends to study whether the <b>interlocking</b> formalization <b>works</b> for different signaling systems, infrastructure managers and interlocking engineers, to quantify the effects on the safety case, to investi-gate effects of more detailed data, to find design modeling tech-niques that work on a micro level and to test the hypothesis that high complexity engineering design projects suit less for a lean transformation.
