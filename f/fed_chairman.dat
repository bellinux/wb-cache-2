25|$|Besides {{interest}} rate targeting {{there are other}} possible targets of open markets operations. A second possible target is the contraction of the money supply, {{as was the case}} in the U.S. in the late 1970s through the early 1980s under <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> Paul Volcker.|$|E
25|$|Republican Senator Jim Bunning, {{who opposed}} Greenspan's fifth reconfirmation, charged that Greenspan should comment only on {{monetary}} policy, not fiscal policy.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{a simple}} {{model of the}} Federal Reserve's "reaction function" - that is, the relationship between economic developments and the fed's response to them. We focus on how this estimated reaction function has changed over time. Such changes are not surprising given compositional changes in the Federal Open Market Committee, and we consider three subsamples delineated {{by the terms of}} recent <b>fed</b> <b>Chairmen.</b> We find that the estimated reaction functions for each period vary in ways that seem broadly consistent with the success or failure during the period at controlling inflation. These results suggest that a Taylor-rule framework is a useful way to summarize key elements of monetary policy.

5|$|The {{final report}} of the National Monetary Commission was {{published}} on January 11, 1911. For nearly two years legislators debated the proposal {{and it was not}} until December 23, 1913, that Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act. President Woodrow Wilson signed the legislation immediately and the legislation was enacted on the same day, December 23, 1913, creating the Federal Reserve System. Charles Hamlin became the <b>Fed's</b> first <b>chairman,</b> and none other than Morgan's deputy Benjamin Strong became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the most important regional bank with a permanent seat on the Federal Open Market Committee.|$|R
5000|$|Edwin le Heron and Emmanuel Carre {{state that}} [...] "Nowadays, 'Fedspeak’ (Bernanke, 2004) means clear and {{extensive}} communication of the <b>Fed’s</b> action."

In 2014 a new detailed level of Fed communication was dubbed Fedspeak 3.0.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> Alan Greenspan went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E
500|$|On 15 February, a {{statement}} issued from the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Moscow affirmed that Japan would not face high level international criticism for its planned monetary policy. In a remark endorsed by US <b>Fed</b> <b>chairman</b> Ben Bernanke, the IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde said that recent concerns about a possible currency war had been [...] "overblown". Paul Krugman has echoed Eichengreen's view that central bank's unconventional monetary policy is best understood as a shared concern to boost growth, not as currency war. Goldman Sachs strategist Kamakshya Trivedi has suggested that rising stock markets imply that market players generally agree that central bank's actions are best understood as monetary easing and not as competitive devaluation. Other analysts have however continued to assert that ongoing tensions over currency valuation remain, with currency war and even trade war still a significant risk. Central bank officials ranging from New Zealand and Switzerland to China have made fresh statements about possible further interventions against their currencies.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Bachelor thesis is to {{identify}} the main determinants of mort-gage crisis in the USA that erupted in the early 21 st century. The paper focuses on the period before the outbreak. First, the paper deals with major imbalances which led to outbreak of mortgage crisis. Further, emphasizing the role and influence of the U. S. central bank <b>FED</b> with <b>Chairman</b> Alan Greenspan, which is often referred {{as one of the}} main determinants of the problems in the financial markets. Part of the paper is a chronological structuring of the events that preceded the outbreak of the mortgage crisis, in which it is possible to watch similar macroeconomic characteristics of the U. S. economy...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2008 Joseph Stiglitz {{stated that}} Greenspan [...] "didn't {{really believe in}} regulation; when {{the excesses of the}} {{financial}} system were noted, (he and others) called for self-regulation—an oxymoron". Greenspan, according to the New York Times, says he himself is blameless. On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: [...] "Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the <b>Fed</b> <b>chairman,</b> Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems." [...] Despite this, Greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, [...] "History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums" [...] as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Summers {{hailed the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act in 1999, which lifted {{more than six}} decades of {{restrictions}} against banks offering [...] commercial banking, insurance, and investment services (by repealing key provisions in the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act): [...] "Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the Great Depression {{and replace them with}} a system for the 21st century," [...] Summers said. [...] "This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy." [...] Many critics, including President Barack Obama, have suggested the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act. [...] Indeed, as a member of President Clinton's Working Group on Financial Markets, Summers, along with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt, <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> Greenspan, and Secretary Rubin, torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in Fall 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Miller was <b>Fed</b> <b>chairman</b> {{for just}} over a year when Carter {{appointed}} him Secretary of the Treasury in August 1979, replacing Michael Blumenthal as part of a major cabinet shuffle in which five Cabinet members were replaced. [...] Carter appointed Paul Volcker to replace Miller. [...] He thus became the only person to serve as both Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the Federal Reserve. [...] As Treasury Secretary, Miller {{is best known for his}} role on the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board, which oversaw management of a $1.5 billion loan to rescue the carmaker from bankruptcy. [...] This attracted some controversy as the bailout was thought to reward mismanagement and impede fair trade relations between the United States and Japan. [...] Miller agreed that [...] "The administration does not favor, as a general proposition, government aid to private corporations," [...] but thought an exception should be made in Chrysler's case. [...] Chrysler recovered in the early 1980s and paid off the loan early.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Chris Dodd, who co-proposed {{the legislation}}, has {{classified}} the legislation as [...] "sweeping, bold, comprehensive, [...] long overdue". In {{regards to the}} Fed and what he regarded as their failure to protect consumers, Dodd voiced his opinion that [...] " [...] I really want the Federal Reserve {{to get back to}} its core enterprises [...] We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure. So the idea that we're {{going to go back and}} expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform is going in the wrong way." [...] However, Dodd pointed out that the transfer of powers from the Fed to other agencies should not be construed as criticism of <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> Ben Bernanke, but rather that [...] "t's about putting together an architecture that works".|$|E
2500|$|Miller succeeded Arthur Burns as <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> in March 1978. [...] He {{inherited}} a high inflation economy, still {{suffering from the}} increase in oil prices from OPEC. [...] The change in the Consumer Price Index was 4.9% in 1976 and 6.7% in 1977. [...] Nevertheless, Miller believed that inflation was not too high, and would be self-correcting. [...] He thus pursued a strongly dovish policy and opposed raising interest rates. [...] The effect of this was to send the dollar's value spiraling downward. [...] In November 1978, only 11 months into his term, the dollar had fallen nearly 34% against the German mark and almost 42% against the Japanese yen, prompting the Carter administration to launch a [...] "dollar rescue package" [...] including emergency sales from the U.S. gold stock, borrowing from the International Monetary Fund, and auctions of Treasury securities denominated in foreign currencies. [...] This proved only a short-term fix; although temporarily steadying the dollar, it soon resumed its fall. [...] The portmanteau stagflation, the combination of stagnation and inflation, was used increasingly during this time to describe {{the high rate of}} inflation, which failed to spur the economy.|$|E
