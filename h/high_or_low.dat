5|$|The term men's bikini is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} swim briefs. Men's bikinis can have <b>high</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and sun tanning. The posing brief standard to bodybuilding competitions {{is an example of}} this style. Male punk rock musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs. The 2000 Bollywood film Hera Pheri shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be women from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be <b>high</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at <b>high</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E

25|$|Chromatin {{structure}} inhibition is {{the process}} wherein the promoter is hidden by chromatin structure.

25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{shoreline}} and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, {{so there is no}} simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon's position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater bathymetry and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology's effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of <b>high</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> tide (the lunitidal interval) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of <b>high</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> tide relative to other points on the same coast.

40|$|We {{construct}} twisted D-modules on the projective line P^ 1 {{that are}} equivariant for {{the action of}} the diagonal torus subgroup of SL_ 2. In the most interesting case these arise as extensions from local systems on C^×. We discuss their subquotient structure. Their sheaf cohomology groups are weight modules for the Lie algebra sl_ 2. We also discuss their subquotient structure and in case these modules are not the familiar <b>highest</b> <b>or</b> <b>lowest</b> weight modules, we give an explicit presentation for them. Our computations illustrate some basic D-module concepts and the Beilinson-Bernstein equivalence. They are {{the first step in a}} program that aims to describe categories of modules over semisimple and affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras that are next to <b>highest</b> (<b>or</b> <b>lowest)</b> weight via D-modules on the flag variety.

25|$|Digestion is {{a complex}} process {{controlled}} by several factors. pH {{plays a crucial role}} in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a <b>high</b> <b>or</b> <b>low</b> pH environment.|$|E
