40|$|Our thermo-optical {{measurement}} device with atmospheric control (TOM-AC) allows to follow {{changes in the}} shapes of samples (up to 40 mm in diameter) with an accuracy of about 0. 5 micron by contact-less measurements. Samples of arbitrary shape can be monitored by TOM-AC during the heat treatment at chosen temperatures and atmospheres. Its contour - and thus dimensional changes - are detected by a sophisticated algorithm. Applications range from determining the shrinkage or shape distortion of powder <b>metallurgical</b> <b>products</b> to measuring the wetting angle of melts. Atmospheric control, i. e. controlling and changing the gas atmosphere (e. g. inert gas / reducing gas at different pressures or vacuum) is realized during the heat treatment via a specific code on standard PCs.
