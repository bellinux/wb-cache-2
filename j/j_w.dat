5|$|With the {{feedback}} received from players {{after the release}} of Nightmare, Brett Clements and Phillip Tanner started work on the major update to the series. They struck a deal with <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> Spear & Sons, to use publishing experience and market research with Nightmare to help create the new game. The deal allowed <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> Spear & Sons to have input into how the game was developed, which was not the case with Nightmare. Village Roadshow was also involved with the game's development and with its release in the United States. The development ended six years after it started, with about six million dollars invested {{in the development of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|A {{documentary}} film was commissioned {{to celebrate the}} 25th anniversary of Last of the Summer Wine.

5|$|<b>J</b> <b>W</b> W Gabriel became sole {{managing}} director in 1932. The directors {{had been for}} some years working with the Cincinnati Milling Machine Co, of which Gabriel had been an employee before World War I, and in 1933 Cincinnati established an English subsidiary, with Gabriel as chairman.

5|$|<b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> McFadden Inc. was the building's {{original}} owner. Subsequent {{owners have}} included C. C. and Leedy Maude, J. S. Middleton, Oregon Theatre Co., Mary Watt, and Ernest Bass. The theater's front doors and ticket office were altered by <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> McFadden Inc. in 1930, {{along with the}} construction of a new ticket booth. In 1949, when the Waverly Heights Congregational United Church of Christ was reconstructing a new church building on its property at Southeast 33rd and Woodward, church services were held at the Oregon Theatre. According to the Puget Sound Theatre Organ Society, the organ was repossessed by the William Wood Organ Co. and re-installed at radio station KXL's studios in Portland. The theater's front entrance, including its doors and 1930s ticket booth, were remodeled by Ferguson Cassady Co. in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Supporting {{cast members}} were added {{throughout}} {{the run of}} the show. The only addition with no professional acting experience was the Holmfirth resident Gordon Wharmby, who performed so well during his audition as mechanic Wesley Pegden that Alan <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> Bell cast him in one episode. Pegden became a regular character after a positive audience reception.|$|E
5|$|The organ was {{originally}} built in 1685 by Renatus Harris {{at a cost}} of £500. This has been removed and repaired many times.

5|$|These scenic {{areas were}} first {{described}} {{for the public}} in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916. People like Forest Supervisor <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest.

5|$|After playing {{baseball}} at <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida, the Yankees drafted Clippard {{in the ninth}} round of the 2003 MLB draft. He debuted with the Yankees as a starting pitcher in 2007. The Yankees traded him to the Nationals before the 2008 season, and the Nationals converted him into a relief pitcher in 2009. Clippard led the major leagues in holds in 2014. He {{was named to the}} MLB All-Star Game in 2011 and 2014, and won the MLB Delivery Man of the Month Award in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, surgeon <b>J.</b> <b>W.</b> Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
