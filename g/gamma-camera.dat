40|$|Single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) is a non-invasive imaging technique, which provides information reporting the functional states of tissues. SPECT imaging {{has been used}} as a diagnostic tool in several human disorders and can be used in animal models of diseases for physiopathological, genomic and drug discovery studies. However, most of the experimental models used in research involve rodents, which are at least one order of magnitude smaller in linear dimensions than man. Consequently, images of targets obtained with conventional <b>gamma-cameras</b> and collimators have poor spatial resolution and statistical quality. We review the methodological approaches developed in recent years in order to obtain images of small targets with good spatial resolution and sensitivity. Multipinhole, coded mask- and slit-based collimators are presented as alternative approaches to improve image quality. In combination with appropriate decoding algorithms, these collimators permit a significant reduction of the time needed to register the projections used to make 3 -D representations of the volumetric distribution of target&# 8217;s radiotracers. Simultaneously, they can be used to minimize artifacts and blurring arising when single pinhole collimators are used. Representation images are presented, which illustrate the use of these collimators. We also comment on the use of coded masks to attain tomographic resolution with a single projection, as discussed by some investigators since their introduction to obtain near-field images. We conclude this review by showing that the use of appropriate hardware and software tools adapted to conventional <b>gamma-cameras</b> can be of great help in obtaining relevant functional information in experiments using small animals.

40|$|Paraaortic {{sentinel}} node biopsy may be {{a challenging}} procedure because the sentinel nodes are located retroperitoneally {{in close proximity to}} vital structures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe and evaluate the value of preoperative SPECT/CT for lymphatic mapping, and a portable <b>gamma-camera</b> for intraoperative radioguidance, in patients with paraaortic sentinel nodes. METHODS: We evaluated our practice in 18 patients, who were treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute with sentinel lymphadenectomy for different urologic malignancies and showed paraaortic drainage on preoperative images. After intratumoral injection of (99 m) Tc-nanocolloid, the patients underwent sequential planar lymphoscintigraphy, hybrid SPECT/CT, and sentinel lymphadenectomy. Intraoperative node detection and localization were guided by a laparoscopic gamma-probe and a portable <b>gamma-camera.</b> This <b>gamma-camera</b> was set to display both the (99 m) Tc signal and the (125) I-seed signal. This (125) I seed was placed on top of the gamma-probe, functioning as a pointer on screen, thus enabling real-time sentinel node localization with the <b>gamma-camera.</b> RESULTS: In 16 patients with midabdominal drainage on planar images and in 2 patients with nonvisualization on planar images, SPECT/CT showed clear localization of paraaortic sentinel nodes in relation to the abdominal vessels. Five patients underwent open surgery, and 13 patients underwent laparoscopy. The paraaortic sentinel nodes were successfully localized and removed in 15 patients with the help of the portable <b>gamma-camera</b> and gamma-probe and in 3 patients with the gamma-probe only.

In 73 patients (61 %), whose ECGs were unhelpful or difficult to interpret, scintigraphy allowed infarction to be diagnosed in 11 (15 %) and to be excluded in five (7 %). In 32 (44 %) of this group whose ECGs were totally uninterpretable due to previous myocardial damage or disorders of electrical activation, scintigraphy provided confirmation of a diagnosis that otherwise rested only on whether enzyme concentrations were raised.

Principal applications include improvement in accuracy for nondestructive assay of heterogeneous material (e. g., residues) and wide-area imaging of nuclear material in facilities (e. g., holdup). Portable gamma cameras with gamma-ray spectroscopy are available commercially and are being applied to holdup measurements. The technology has the potential to significantly reduce effort and exposure in holdup campaigns; and, with imaging, some of the limiting assumptions required for conventional holdup analysis can be relaxed, resulting in a more general analysis.

40|$|Following a {{diagnosis}} of breast cancer (BC), the early detection of local recurrence is important to define appropriate therapeutic strategies and increase {{the chances of a}} cure. In fact, despite major progress in surgical treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy protocols, tumor recurrence is still a major problem. Moreover, the diagnosis of recurrence with conventional imaging methods can be difficult {{as a result of the}} presence of scar tissue. Molecular breast imaging (MBI) with gamma-ray emitting radiotracers may be very useful in this clinical setting, because it is not affected by the post-therapy morphologic changes. This review summarises the applications of 99 mTc-sestamibi and 99 mTc-tetrofosmin, the two most employed gamma emitter radiopharmaceuticals for MBI, in the diagnosis of local disease recurrence in patients with BC. The main limitation of MBI using conventional <b>gamma-cameras</b> is the low sensitivity for small BCs. The recent development of hybrid single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography devices and especially of high-resolution specific breast cameras can improve the detection rate of sub-centimetric malignant lesions. Nevertheless, probably only the large availability of dedicated cameras will allow the clinical acceptance of MBI as useful complementary diagnostic technique in BC recurrence. The possible role of MBI with specific cameras in monitoring the local response of BC to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|AimWe {{previously}} {{developed a}} data-driven (DD) respiratory-motion (RM) correction method for conventional SPECT <b>gamma-cameras</b> (REGAT) and adapted {{it to the}} new CZT camera (Discovery NM 530 c). We recently reported that RM correction with REGAT applied to CZT myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging (MPI) is clinically feasible and impacts substantially myocardial perfusion defects. In this evaluation, we study whether REGAT applied to MPI (Discovery NM 530 c) is capable of generating a data-driven (DD) cardiac gating signal allowing the generation of valid global left ventricular (LV) function parameters (EDV: end diastolic volume; ESV: end systolic volume; EF: ejection fraction). Materials and methodsWere included 7 patients addressed for stress/rest MPI. All patients had prone stress MPI (2 MBq/Kg 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin) and rest MPI 3 -hours later (6 MBq/Kg). All acquisitions were made on Discovery NM 530 c. Each acquisition was processed with REGAT to generate a dynamic SPECT acquisition study. The latter was processed to generate a DD cardiac gating signal and generate a mean DD cardiac GSPECT study (GSPECT-DD). In parallel, a mean ECG cardiac GSPECT study was generated using the ECG trigger signal provided by traditional ECG monitor (GSPECT-M). The 2 generated cardiac GSPECT studies were reconstructed on Xeleris workstation and processed with Emory Cardiac Toolbox (ECT). LV EDV, ESV and EF were compared between cardiac GSPECT-DD and GSPECT-M. ResultsStress LV EVD, ESV, and EF were 91 ± 24 mL, 29 ± 13 ml, and 68 ± 10 % vs 95 ± 23 ml, 29 ± 12 ml, and 70 ± 11 % with GSPECT-DD vs GSPECTM respectively (P:NS).

Therefore, the aim of this thesis was devoted to the development of computational methods to enable quantitative molecular imaging in PET, SPET and in vivo patient dosimetry with CMOS image sensors. The first task was to develop a novel quantitative dual isotope method for simultaneous assessments of regional lung ventilation and perfusion using a SPET technique. This method included correction routines for photon scattering, non uniform attenuation at two different photon energies (140 and 392 keV) and organ outline. This quantitative method was validated both with phantom experiments and physiological studies on healthy subjects. The second task was to develop and clinically apply a quantitative method for tumour to background activity uptake measurements using planar mammo-scintigraphy, with partial volume compensation. The third stage was to produce several computational models to assess the spatial resolution limitations in PET from the positron range, the annihilation photon non-collineairy and the photon depth of interaction. Finally, a quantitative image processing method for a CMOS image sensor for applications in ion beam therapy dosimetry was developed. From the obtained phantom and physiological results it was concluded that the methodologies developed for the simultaneous measurement of the lung ventilation and perfusion and for the quantification of the tumour malignancy grade in breast carcinoma were both accurate. Further, the obtained models for the influence that the positron range in various human tissues, and the photon emission non-collinearity and depth of interaction have on PET image spatial resolution, could be used both to optimise future PET camera designs and spatial resolution recovery algorithms.

40|$|Clinical Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a {{scanning}} technique which acquires <b>gamma-camera</b> images ('projections') over a {{range of}} angles around a patient. These projections allow the reconstruction of cross sectional ('tomographic') images of the gamma-radiating pharmaceutical distribution in the patient, thus providing interesting information about the functioning of organs and tissues. SPECT images are seriously affected {{by a variety of}} image degrading processes. Restrictions on the amount of radio-pharmaceutical that can be administered to a patient cause noise in the projections and the limited spatial resolution of the <b>gamma-camera</b> results in blurring of the projections. In addition to these image degradations, the reconstruction of cross-sections is complicated by Compton scattering of gamma-photons in tissue, which causes attenuation of the photon flux received by the <b>gamma-camera</b> and causes improper detection of photons which have been scattered in tissue. This results in some additional blurring and loss of accuracy of the SPECT images in predicting activity concentrations. Tremendous efforts have been made to improve the quantitative accuracy and the spatial resolution of SPECT, and to reduce the noise in the reconstructed images. These efforts have resulted in corrective reconstruction algorithms, which are generally based on incorporation of accurate models of the main image degrading factors. Improvements of the data acquisition hardware can further increase image quality. In this paper, the image formation process of SPECT, including image-degrading factors, is explained. In addition, reconstruction algorithms and hardware modifications are reviewed, and their effects on image quality are illustrated with physical phantom and simulation experiments...|$|E
40|$|Scintimammography is a {{molecular}} breast imaging technique using tumour-seeking radiopharmaceuticals; with standard gamma-cameras, it proved of value especially when mammography is indeterminate and {{in women with}} dense breasts; nevertheless, this technique shows a high sensitivity only for cancers > 1 cm. The issue of detecting small cancers is critical for the future development and clinical usefulness of breast imaging with radiopharmaceuticals, because other modalities are increasingly employed for early identification of small abnormalities. The use of high-resolution dedicated cameras for breast imaging is the best option to improve small cancers' detection: they allow greater flexibility in patient positioning, {{and the availability of}} projections similar to those of mammography. Moreover, the detector can be placed directly against the breast, and a mild compression is possible, with the results of reducing breast thickness, increasing the target-to-background ratio and the sensitivity. Our first clinical findings using the dedicated camera Lumagem 3200 S (Gamma Medica, Inc., Northridge, USA) are very satisfactory.

By introducing variabilities in these steps the combined uncertainty in the output quantity is determined. The importance of different sources of uncertainty is assessed by observing the decrease in standard deviation when removing a particular source.

40|$|PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors inducing angiogenesis in tumors. Nine splice-variant isoforms of VEGF-A have been identified, each having different properties. Recently, we showed that radiolabeled anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, accumulates specifically in VEGF-A expressing tumors. In this study, we investigated in a nude mouse model which VEGF-isoforms are responsible for tumor accretion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The humanized anti-VEGF-A antibody, A. 4. 6. 1. (bevacizumab), was radiolabeled with In- 111. The originally VEGF-negative Mel 57 tumor was transfected with different VEGF isoforms (VEGF- 121, VEGF- 165, and VEGF- 189). The obtained melanoma xenografts specifically expressing different VEGF-isoforms were used in mice. The bevacizumab uptake was examined in biodistribution studies and by <b>gamma-camera</b> imaging. RESULTS: The tumor cell line expressing VEGF- 121 did not show specific uptake, most likely as a result of the fact that this isoform is freely diffusible. Tumors expressing VEGF- 165 and - 189 were clearly visualized by using <b>gamma-camera</b> imaging. CONCLUSION: The accumulation of radiolabeled bevacizumab in the tumor is due to interaction with VEGF-A isoforms that are associated with the tumor cell surface and/or the extracellular matrix. Scintigraphic imaging of the expression of these VEGF isoforms may thus be useful to predict response to angiogenic therapy...|$|E
40|$|A compact, {{portable}} {{and large}} field-of-view gamma camera to identify, locate and quantify gamma-ray emitting radioisotopes in real-time has been developed. The device delivers spectroscopic and imaging capabilities, which allow one {{to use it}} in a variety of nuclear waste characterisation scenarios, such as radioactivity monitoring in nuclear power plants and more specifically for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The technical development of this apparatus and some examples of its application in field measurements are reported in this article. The performance of the presented <b>gamma-camera</b> is also benchmarked against other conventional techniques...|$|E
40|$|Tc(VII) will {{be reduced}} and precipitated in FRC sediments under {{anaerobic}} conditions in batch experiments (progressive microcosms). The complementary microcosm experiments using low pH/nigh nitrate sediments from 3 (near FW 009) are imminent, with the sediment cores already shipped to Manchester. HYPOTHESIS 2. Tc(VII) reduction and precipitation can be visualized in discrete biogeochemical zones in sediment columns using 99 mTc and a <b>gamma-camera.</b> Preliminary experiments testing the use of 99 mTc as a radiotracer to address hypotheses 2 and 3 {{have suggested that the}} 99 mTc associates with Fe(II) -bearing sediments in microcosms and stratified columns containing FRC sediments. Initial proof of concept microcosms containing Fe(II) -bearing, microbially-reduced FRC sediments were spiked with 99 mTc and imaged using a <b>gamma-camera.</b> In comparison with oxic controls, 99 mTc was significantly partitioned in the solid phase in Fe(III) -reducing sediments in batch experiments. Column experiments using FRC background area soil with stratified biogeochemical zones after stimulation of anaerobic processes through nutrient supplementation, suggested that 99 mTc transport was retarded through areas of Fe(III) reduction. HYPOTHESIS 3. Sediment-bound reduced 99 mTc can be solubilized by perturbations including oxidation coupled to biological nitrate reduction, and mobilization visualized in real-time using a <b>gamma-camera.</b> Significant progress has been made focusing on the impact of nitrate on the biogeochemical behavior of technetium. Additions of 100 mM nitrate to FRC sediment microcosms, which could potentially compete for electrons during metal reduction, inhibited the reduction of both Fe(III) and Tc(VII) completely. Experiments have also addressed the impact of high nitrate concentrations on Fe(II) and Tc(IV) in pre-reduced sediments, showing no significant resolubilization of Tc with the addition of 25 mM nitrate. A parallel set of experiments addressing the impact of aerobic conditions on the stability/solubility of Fe(II) and Tc(IV), found 80 % resolubilization of the Tc. Column experiments exploring this behavior are being planned. HYPOTHESIS 4 The mobility of 99 mTc in the sediment columns can be modeled using a coupled speciation and transport code. Microbiological and geochemical characterization of the column experiments is ongoing and transport and geochemical modeling experiments are being planned...|$|E
