5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries.|$|E
25|$|Fruits: Fresh fruits such as apples, strawberries, {{cherries}} rarely {{yield the}} expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes {{are found in}} a perfume, {{they are more likely}} to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, litsea cubeba, vanilla, and <b>juniper</b> <b>berry.</b> The most commonly used fruits yield their aromatics from the rind; they include citrus such as oranges, lemons, and limes. Although grapefruit rind is still used for aromatics, more and more commercially used grapefruit aromatics are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains sulfur and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.|$|E
500|$|A <b>juniper</b> <b>berry</b> is {{the female}} seed cone {{produced}} by the various species of junipers. [...] It is not a true berry but a cone with unusually fleshy and merged scales, which give it a berry-like appearance. The cones {{from a handful of}} species, especially Juniperus communis, are used as a spice, particularly in European cuisine, and also give gin its distinctive flavour. Juniper berries have been called the only spice derived from conifers, although tar and inner bark from pine trees is sometimes considered a spice as well.|$|E
500|$|<b>Juniper</b> <b>berries</b> {{are used}} in {{northern}} European and particularly Scandinavian cuisine to [...] "impart a sharp, clear flavor" [...] to meat dishes, especially wild birds (including thrush, blackbird, and woodcock) and game meats (including boar and venison). They also season pork, cabbage, and sauerkraut dishes. Traditional recipes for choucroute garnie, an Alsatian dish of sauerkraut and meats, universally include <b>juniper</b> <b>berries.</b> Besides Norwegian and Swedish dishes, <b>juniper</b> <b>berries</b> are also sometimes used in German, Austrian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian cuisine, often with roasts (such as German sauerbraten). Northern Italian cuisine, especially that of the South Tyrol, also incorporates <b>juniper</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Juniper</b> <b>berries</b> {{have long}} been used as {{medicine}} by many cultures including the Navajo people.

500|$|<b>Juniper</b> <b>berries,</b> {{including}} Juniperus phoenicea and Juniperus oxycedrus {{have been}} found in ancient Egyptian tombs at multiple sites. J. oxycedrus is not known to grow in Egypt, and neither is Juniperus excelsa, which was found along with J. oxycedrus in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The berries imported into Egypt may have come from Greece; the Greeks record using <b>juniper</b> <b>berries</b> as a medicine long before mentioning their use in food. The Greeks used the berries in many of their Olympics events because of their belief that the berries increased physical stamina in athletes. The Romans used <b>juniper</b> <b>berries</b> as a cheap domestically produced substitute for the expensive black pepper and long pepper imported from India. It was also used as an adulterant, as reported in Pliny the Elder's Natural History: [...] "Pepper is adulterated with <b>juniper</b> <b>berries,</b> which have the property, to a marvellous degree, of assuming the pungency of pepper." [...] Pliny also incorrectly asserted that black pepper grew on trees that were [...] "very similar in appearance to our junipers".|$|R
