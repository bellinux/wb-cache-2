5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} {{is high in}} <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> only moderate in protein. Salt licks {{are very}} important to the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E
40|$|The Rho {{subfamily}} of the Rho small G protein family (Rho) regulates {{formation of}} stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions in {{many types of}} cultured cells. In moving cells, dynamic and coordinate disassembly and reassembly of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions are observed, but the precise mechanisms in the regulation of these processes are poorly understood. We previously showed that 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) first induced disassembly of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions followed by their reassembly in MDCK cells. The reassembled stress fibers showed radial-like morphology that was apparently different from the original. We analyzed here the mechanisms of these TPA-induced processes. Rho inactivation and activation were necessary for the TPA-induced disassembly and reassembly, respectively, of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions. Both inactivation and activation of the Rac subfamily of the Rho family (Rac) inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly. Moreover, microinjection or transient expression of Rab GDI, a regulator of all the Rab small G protein family members, inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly, indicating that, furthermore, activation of some Rab family members is necessary for their TPA-induced reassembly. Of the Rab family members, at least Rab 5 activation was necessary for the TPA-induced reassembly of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions. The TPA-induced, small G protein-mediated reorganization of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions was {{closely related to the}} TPA-induced cell motility. These results indicate that the Rho and Rab family members coordinately regulate the TPA-induced reorganization of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions that may cause cell motility...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the <b>fiber,</b> <b>and</b> improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E

5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, <b>fiber,</b> <b>and</b> bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E

When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used.

At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding.

40|$|Rho, {{a member}} of the Rho small G protein family, regulates the {{formation}} of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions in various types of cultured cells. We investigated here the actions of ROCK and mDia, both of which have been identified to be putative downstream target molecules of Rho, in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. The dominant active mutant of RhoA induced the formation of parallel stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions, whereas the dominant active mutant of ROCK induced the formation of stellate stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions, and the dominant active mutant of mDia induced the weak formation of parallel stress fibers without affecting the formation of focal adhesions. In the presence of C 3 ADP-ribosyltransferase for Rho, the dominant active mutant of ROCK induced the formation of stellate stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions, whereas the dominant active mutant of mDia induced only the diffuse localization of actin filaments. These results indicate that ROCK and mDia show distinct actions in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The dominant negative mutant of either ROCK or mDia inhibited the formation of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions, indicating that both ROCK and mDia are necessary for the formation of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions. Moreover, inactivation and reactivation of both ROCK and mDia were necessary for the 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate–induced disassembly and reassembly, respectively, of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions. The morphologies of stress <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> focal adhesions in the cells expressing both the dominant active mutants of ROCK and mDia were not identical to those induced by the dominant active mutant of Rho.
