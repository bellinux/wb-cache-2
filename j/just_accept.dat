5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
25|$|While {{a lot of}} {{high school}} players <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> {{that this is just}} how it is, some object to this rule. They say that it puts excess stress on them because they start being {{recruited}} in their junior year of high school. If they have a bad season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year.|$|E

500|$|In The Scotsman, Graham Leicester {{writes that}} the [...] "overblown rhetoric invites a sceptical reaction. But I suggest we <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> this {{extraordinary}} compliment graciously." [...] It was likely influenced by Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization {{and the result of}} a marketing strategy. Several reviewers found that Herman was successful in proving that Scots did have a disproportionate impact on modernity. Herman continued this type of theme with his next book, To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World, published in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. Everybody seems to know a little bit about everything and that's how we process information now. This just reflects that." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston, also {{writing for}} The Guardian, wrote {{positively}} of the scare {{factor in the}} episode, {{as well as the}} sadness. Neela Debnath of The Independent described it as a [...] "wonderful swansong to the duo" [...] and particularly praised the [...] "stylish" [...] cinematography and sense of danger. However, she considered the [...] "only flaw" [...] to be [...] "the rule that time cannot be changed if one knows {{what is going to happen}} ... though it is probably best not to question the timey wimey side of things and <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> it and enjoy the adventure". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, writing that it [...] "stood strong as a heartfelt, emotional end for the TARDIS' longest serving companions (since the show's noughties' return at least), and the best episode of the season thus far". Risley also praised the three leads, though he did admit the episode [...] "left a few nitpicky questions".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Crosetti and Lewis {{looking for clues}} in a dark alley. Levinson and Attanasio {{specifically}} wanted a dialogue-driven prologue scene that did not immediately clarify {{the fact that the}} two men were detectives or what they were looking for. The dialogue and staging of the scene were imitated in the final scene of the last Homicide episode, [...] "Forgive Us Our Trespasses", which aired on May 21, 1999. In that final scene, Detective Rene Sheppard (played by Michael Michele) says to Lewis, [...] "Life is a mystery, <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> it", a line spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Lewis also said, [...] "That's what's wrong with this job. It ain't got nothin' to do do with life", a line also spoken by Crosetti in the first episode. Early scenes in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] also involved Giardello introducing rookie detective Bayliss to the homicide unit. Attanasio sought to use Bayliss' orientation as a way of introducing exposition and background about the show to the viewer as well.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{oriented}} scientists, {{as opposed}} to authors, test whether particular practices work better for different subcultures or personality types, rather than <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> received wisdom. [...] For example, the MATCH Study run at many sites around the US by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) tested whether particular types of clients with alcohol dependence would benefit differentially from three different treatment approaches {{to which they were}} randomly assigned. The idea was not to test the approaches but the matching of clients to treatments, and though this missed the question of client choice, it did demonstrate a lack of difference between the different approaches regardless of most client characteristics, with the exception that clients with high anger scores did better with the non-confrontational Motivational Enhancement approach which has been demonstrated superior in a meta-analysis of alcohol treatment outcome research and only required four {{as opposed to}} twelve session within Project MATCH.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 January 2012, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, gave {{a speech}} calling on African nations to repeal laws that place {{sanctions}} on homosexual conduct. Speaking to a journalist, African Cardinal Robert Sarah, president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, called the speech stupid. The journalist reported: [...] "Asked if Ban Ki-moon was overstepping his responsibilities, Cardinal Sarah replied: 'Sure, you cannot impose something stupid like that.' He added: 'Poor countries like Africa <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> it because it's imposed upon them through money, through being tied to aid.'" [...] He said that African bishops must react against this move against African culture. Meanwhile, Cardinal Peter Turkson, while recognising {{that some of the}} sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an [...] "exaggeration", stated that the [...] "intensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition". [...] "Just as there's a sense of a call for rights, there's also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people", he said. [...] "So, if it's being stigmatized, in fairness, it's probably right to find out why it is being stigmatized." [...] He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues.|$|E

2500|$|Outside the US, {{the episode}} also {{prompted}} a polarized response. The BBC's Entertainment reporter Kev Geoghegan {{felt that the}} episode was [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] and that [...] "the show was wrapped up rather nicely". Michael Deacon in The Daily Telegraph was [...] "beatifically surprised" [...] at the [...] "great" [...] ending. Shane Hegarty in The Irish Times felt that the final scene was [...] "somewhat of a letdown", comparing it to the recent similar ending of Ashes to Ashes and contrasting it with the last ever episode of The Sopranos. He remarked: [...] " [...] was not about mystery, but its final scene was so inscrutable that fans are still squinting {{in an effort to}} figure it out. Losts finale, though, was not too obtuse." [...] Some reviewers ended puzzled about the meaning of Lost. Tim Teeman in The Times referred to [...] "a global scratching of heads" [...] in his review but concluded [...] "The questions are ceaseless: it may be healthier, as one online fan put it, 'to <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> it and move on. Steve Busfield and Richard Vine of The Guardian spoke positively about the episode, saying that the series would [...] "continue to baffle, infuriate and delight fans for an eternity". Conversely, the TV critic Charlie Brooker, also writing for The Guardian, remarked that [...] "The End" [...] plot [...] "made less sense than a milk hammock", while the comedian Danny Baker called the episode [...] "an outrage".|$|E

6000|$|Will {{there ever}} be the same romance about the {{warships}} of the present day,--what those of the future will be like we do not care to speculate,--and the old [...] "wooden walls" [...] whose prowess on the high seas founded England's maritime glory? Will a Dibdin ever arise to sing a Devastation or a Glatton? Can a Devastation or a Glatton ever inspire poetic thoughts and images? One would say that the singer must be endowed in no ordinary degree with the sacred fire whom such a theme as a modern ironclad turret-ship should move to lyric utterance. It has been said that all the romance of the road died out with the old coaching days; and certainly a locomotive engine, with its long black train of practical-looking cars, makes hardly so picturesque a feature in the landscape as one of the old stage-coaches with its red-coated driver, horn-blowing guard, and team of mettled greys; but a railway train is an embodiment of poetry compared with a turret-ship. But if it be true that poetry and romance must more and more cease to be associated with our navy, we must <b>just</b> <b>accept</b> the fact, for nothing is more certain than that, whatever the warships of the future may be, we can never again return to the days of the old wooden ships.|$|E
