Ground water withdrawals in the United States make up roughly one-fifth of the total water use in the United States. For this reason, it is one of our most important resources which must be, protected from contamination. The occurrence of human enteric viruses in ground water, however, has been well documented. Viral contamination of ground water from septic tank, sewer line, or waste disposal site failures has lead to increased efforts to quantify the transport of viruses through the ground water. Ground water transport models can be used to predict the transport of viruses. However, if current public domain virus transport models are to be used for this purpose, they need to be verified under operating field conditions. To evaluate these models it is useful to use data from a "worst case scenario" for contaminant transport: a sand and gravel aquifer under a <b>forced</b> <b>gradient.</b> Field studies have been conducted to trace large-scale (34 in) and small-scale (10 in) virus transport under a <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> through the sand and gravel aquifer at the ground water research site and the Texas A&M Research Farm. Field instrumentation was developed to inject and monitor the virus tracer. Virus transport was monitored under natural and <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> conditions using MS- 2 and PRD- 1 bacteriophage as virus tracers and bromide as a conservative tracer. Simulations of the virus transport at the research site were also completed using the VIRALT virus transport model and parameters taken from past studies at the site. Results indicate virus and bromide transport in both the large and small-scale field tests, although comparison {{of the results of the}} two large-scale and the two small-scale was not consistent. These differences can be attributed to the heterogeneity of the sand and gravel aquifer at the site, different injection methods, and different sampling methods.

A second model describing the recovery of tracer from a layer {{in which there are}} discharges due to vertical flow in the injection borehole is also presented. Application of the models to field tracer test data indicates that the observed recoveries, which are not proportional to the abstraction rate in each layer, are consistent with the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer when natural vertical head gradients are taken into account. Investigation with the models illustrates that the vertical distribution of tracer recovery depends strongly upon the background heads and that tracer tests conducted in the same aquifer, but at different times, may interrogate different aquifer layers. It is also shown generally that for a given abstraction rate the vertical distribution of tracer recovery in small-scale tracer tests is controlled largely by the transmissivity distribution but that as the spatial scale of the test increases, the distribution of recovery becomes proportional to the discharges from the injection borehole because of vertical flows within it, which may be natural or induced by pumping in the monitoring borehole.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was the {{quantification}} of horizontal and vertical solute transport of possible contaminants in the close vicinity (< 10 m) around pumped wells in conurbations. The Birmingham Triassic Sandstone aquifer was chosen to build a borehole array of five wells in the Wildmoor Sandstone. The five wells of the test site at the University of Birmingham approached seven sandstone layers, separated by six mudstone layers, approved with geophysical well logging. Specifically constructed packers were used to process tests quantifying the hydraulic and solute transport characteristics. Hydraulic conductivities between 1. 27 m/d and 11. 37 m/d were calculated with data of 14 pumping tests. Storage coefficients between 1. 76 x 10 - 5 and 1. 32 x 10 - 5 were determined. Average linear velocities of six sandstones were determined between 0. 156 to 3. 28 m/d. Corresponding hydraulic gradients of 0. 033 to 0. 288 with up-flow in wells were calculated. Horizontal <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> tracer tests, being processed in three aquifers, recovered between 48 % to 97 % rhodamine WT and fluorescein. Effective porosity values between 0. 00225 and 0. 346 were calculated.

A new non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) characterization technology that is superior to conventional technologies has been developed and applied at full-scale. This technology, referred to as the Partitioning Interwell Tracer Test (PITT), has been adopted from oil-field practices and tailored to environmental application in the vadose and saturated zones. A PITT has been applied {{for the first time at}} full-scale to characterize DNAPL in the vadose zone. The PITT was applied in December 1995 beneath two side-by-side organic disposal pits at Sandia National Laboratories/New Mexico (SNL/NM) RCRA Interim Status Chemical Waste Landfill (CWL), located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. DNAPL, consisting of a mixture of chlorinated solvents, aromatic hydrocarbons, and PCE oils, is known to exist in at least one of the two buried pits.

To date dipole flow tracer tests {{have been used to}} measure the conservative and hydraulic parameters of an aquifer, while push-pull tests are well characterised for use with biodegrading tracers. The effect of typical aquifer physical heterogeneity on the ability of single well tests to successfully estimate parameters has not yet been characterised. Also, the ability of single well tests to accurately and quickly measure aquifer parameters using tracer mixtures should be analysed. To investigate the effect of physical heterogeneity on single well tests scaled down ultraviolet imaging experiments were performed in a low profile box. Potential tracers for use in mixtures were investigated through column and batch experiments: Inorganic anions and fluorescein, inorganic cations, acetate and trichlorofluoroethene were considered to measure conservative transport parameters, cation exchange capacity, biodegradation potential and hydrophobic sorption respectively. Numerical modelling was used to simulate reactive tracer signals in single well <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> tests. Results suggest that dipole flow tracer tests are appropriate for measuring conservative transport parameters and the sorption of lowly retarded tracers, but are not highly suitable for biodegrading tracers. Tests could be performed with non-recirculating flow, allowing simpler modelling, if equal injection and extraction flow rates could be ensured. Push-pull tests are suitable for biodegrading tracers and moderate to highly retarded tracers. This limits the potential to use reactive tracer mixtures in these tests. Dipole flow tracer test breakthrough curves are highly susceptible to heterogeneity, and could be used to identify discrete permeability variations in aquifers. The effect of heterogeneity is not significant on push-pull test breakthrough curves, but seriously affects tracer plume migration. Inorganic anions provided the most reliable conservative tracer. Trichlorofluoroethene was found to be a suitable tracer to measure hydrophobic sorption. The biodegradation surrogate chosen for a field test should biodegrade similarly to the contaminant under study. ...|$|E

The central {{idea is to}} apply the diffusion maps algorithm on a training data set to produce a stochastic matrix whose generator is a discrete approx-imation to the backward Kolmogorov operator of the underlying dynamics. The eigenvectors of this stochastic matrix, which we will {{refer to as the}} diffusion coordinates, are discrete approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov operator and form an orthonormal basis for functions defined on the data set. Using this basis, we consider the projection of three uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems (prediction, filtering, and response) into the diffusion coordinates. In these coordinates, the nonlinear prediction and response problems reduce to solving systems of infinite-dimensional linear ordinary differential equations. Similarly, the continuous-time nonlinear filtering problem re-duces to solving a system of infinite-dimensional linear stochastic differential equations. Solving the UQ problems then reduces to solving the corresponding truncated linear systems in finitely many diffusion coordinates. By solving these systems we give a model-free algorithm for UQ on gradient flow systems with isotropic diffusion.

Nonreactive tracer experiments were conducted at the Hanford 300 Area, along with constant-rate injection tests and electromagnetic borehole flow meter tests. A Bayesian data assimilation technique, the method of anchored distributions (MAD) (Rubin et al., 2010), was applied to assimilate the experimental tracer test data with the other types of data and to infer the three-dimensional heterogeneous structure of the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone of the Hanford formation. In this study, the Bayesian prior information on the underlying random hydraulic conductivity field was obtained from previous field characterization efforts using constant-rate injection and borehole flow meter test data. The posterior distribution of the conductivity field was obtained by further conditioning the field on the temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves at various observation wells. MAD was implemented with the massively parallel three-dimensional flow and transport code PFLOTRAN {{to cope with the}} highly transient flow boundary conditions at the site and to meet the computational demands of MAD.

40|$|The {{field-scale}} {{transport of}} natural organic matter (NOM) was examined in a two-well <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> injection experiment in a sandy, coastal plain aquifer in Georgetown, South Carolina. Spatial moments described {{the migration of}} the center of mass of NOM and conservative tracer. Temporal moments were used to estimate mass loss and retardation of the NOM along a transect of six sampling locations at two depths and at the withdrawal well. Large differences were observed in transport behavior of different subcomponents of NOM. Larger and more strongly binding NOM components in the injection solution are postulated to adsorb and displace weakly binding, low-molecular weight NOM in groundwater. Conversely, NOM components that were similar to the groundwater NOM were transported almost conservatively, presumably due to 'passivation' of the aquifer by previously adsorbed components of the groundwater NOM. NOM may thus exhibit two types of effects on contaminant dynamics in the subsurface. When the equilibria between solution and solid phase NOM is disrupted by introduction of a novel source of NOM, descriptions of the multicomponent transport process are complex and predictive modeling is problematic. Because of the differences in transport behavior of NOM subcomponents, the chemical properties and, more importantly, the functional behavior of NOM with respect to contaminant migration will vary with time and distance along a flow path. However, when groundwater NOM exists at a steady state with respect to adsorption on aquifer surfaces, the migration of NOM, and the contaminant-NOM complex, may be approximated as the transport of a conservative solut...|$|E

Special emphasis {{was given to the}} hydrological heterogeneity of the site,with the idea that the flow field must be accurately known in order to distinguish adsorption from the effects of the hydrological processes. 308 slug tests were performed to characterize the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity at the site. Using the hydraulic conductivity dataset, a three-dimensional transport model successfully reproduced the migration of a chloride plume. In this way, the uncertainties due to hydrological factors were minimized. NOM was then injected in a second tracer test. A two-site adsorption model was used to describe NOM transport. Adsorption on the first site of the model was described by a linear equilibrium isotherm, with adsorption on the second site being described by a linear time-dependent (first order kinetic) reaction. Modeling results indicated that the time-dependent process dominated the adsorption of NOM, with a fast attachment and slow detachment rates.

40|$|A special {{approach}} for numerical modeling of contaminant transport in fractured rock, {{as a natural}} migration barrier for waste respositories, is presented. The rock matrix and the fractures are simulated with specific transport formations and coupled in a single modell. The capacity of the rock matrix to accumulate contaminants is taken into consideration by a discrete simulation of matrix diffusion. Thus, the natural process of retardation due to matrix diffusion can be better simulated as by a standard introduction of an empirical parameter into the transport equation. The thesis consists of two parts. The first summarizes the basic processes of groundwater flow and transport. It addresses geogenic and antropogenic substances and their origin. Different transport phenomena and their mathematical formulations are derived. In the second part, a so called 'brush model' for groundwater simulation in fractured rock is developed. The 'brush handle' is discretized by 2 D finite elements. Advective-dispersive transport with groundwater flow in the fracture is considered. In this 'britles of the brush' the contaminant diffuses into 1 D finite elements perpendicular to the fractures. The approach is calibrated with results from <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> multi-tracer tests in the fractured claystone of the former toxic waste disposal site, Muenchehagen. In addition results of diffusion laboratory experiments are considered. The model validation was performed with an independent data set and a history-matching of the current situation at the site was carried out. Two different predictive scenarios with several parameter variations are presented. The study leads {{to the conclusion that}} the effect of matrix diffusion is an important property of fractured mudstone. This has to be taken into account for assessing waste repository performance in addition to the hydraulic properties of the natural migration barrier. (orig.)

40|$|Geothermal field {{characterization}} {{and heat}} tracer experiments often rely on scarce temperature data collected in boreholes. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) {{have the potential}} to provide spatial information on temperature changes in the subsurface. In this contribution, we show how DTS and ERT have been used to investigate the heterogeneity of a heterogeneous aquifer during a heat tracing experiment under <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> conditions. Optic fibers were installed in the heat injection well and in two piezometers intersecting the main flow directions at 8 m from the injection well. These piezometers were also equipped with ERT. The DTS measurement in the injection well clearly shows the two-layer nature of the aquifer. After the end of injection, the temperature in the bottom part of the well decreases faster than in the upper part due to the higher water fluxes. Those results are confirmed by DTS measurements in natural flow conditions during a heating wire test. DTS and ERT in the cross-panel both show the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the aquifer. Temperatures only increase significantly in the bottom part of the aquifer where advection is predominant. However, strong differences are observed laterally. ERT additionally shows that the hot plume is divided in two main flow paths, which is confirmed by direct temperature measurements. The comparison of DTS and ERT shows that one of the well is suffering from water mixing. Indeed, temperature from DTS are homogeneous over the whole tichkness of the aquifer, whereas ERT temperature, less affected by local variations, are varying. Our study demonstrate the value of spatially distributed measurements for the monitoring of heat tracer experiment and highligths the issue of multilevel sampling. The detailed temperature measurements can be subsequently used in hydrogeological model to better estimates heat flow and transport parameters. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A <b>forced</b> <b>gradient</b> tracer {{experiment}} {{indicated a}} rapid transport of a solute tracer, chloride, through a 13 -m thick fractured till - silty sand lens system to an underlying sandy aquifer in Ringe, Denmark. Chloride {{was applied to}} a 4 Ã— 4. 8 m 2 area on the ground surface and chloride breakthrough was monitored in horizontal filters at depths of 2. 5 m (till), 4 m (till), 5. 5 m (silty sand lens), and 20 - 20. 5 m (sandy aquifer). This paper {{is an extension of}} the research undertaken by Sidle et al. (Water Resources Research, 34 (1998) 2515) and focuses only on the chloride breakthrough data from the silty sand lens (embedded in the till) and the sandy aquifer, and on the scale dependency of saturated hydraulic conductivity tests. The rapid chloride transport shows that the fracture and macropore flow is significant in the non-weathered till between the silty sand lens and the sandy aquifer. The first arrival of chloride in the sandy aquifer occurred 8 days after the start of the tracer injection and the "peak concentration" was reached after 3 weeks. In addition, slug tests, free flow tests, and large-scale infiltration tests were conducted to assess the spatial variability of the hydraulic characteristics of the interconnected aquitard/silty sand lens system and the underlying aquifer. The large-scale infiltration tests and the free flow tests yielded substantially higher K values than the slug tests, where the slug tests represented a small-scale sampling volume and only a localized fracture network. The infiltration tests captured the decrease in bulk K from the uppermost, bioturbated till to the underlying fracture-dominated till. K values varied in the till with depth by up to 3 orders of magnitude from 1 Ã— 10 - 7 to 1 Ã— 10 - 4 m s- 1 with the highest permeabilities in the uppermost 2. 5 m. The high permeabilities explain the fast breakthrough of the solute in the underlying aquifer. The present study indicates that at high flow rates diffusive exchange of solute tracer mass did not significantly influence the solute transport, particularly in the non-weathered till.

The nanomembrane is fabricated from stoichiometric silicon nitride metallized with gold.
