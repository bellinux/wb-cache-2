2500|$|In 1994, the United States Supreme Court {{decided the}} case of Simmons v. South Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court held {{in this case that}} where a capital defendant's future {{dangerousness}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue,</b> and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process requires that the jury be informed of the defendant's parole ineligibility. The state of South Carolina had changed its sentencing laws in the succeeding years to include the actual possibility of parole in absence of the death penalty, after sentencing questions were answered by the jury.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} Opinion of the Court, which {{reversed}} {{the decision of}} the South Carolina Supreme Court, finding in favor of Shafer. She wrote that [...] "whenever future dangerousness <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole." [...] She continued with this line of thinking, explaining [...] "t is only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment whether to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that Simmons comes into play, a stage at which South Carolina law provides no third choice, no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole." [...] Therefore, South Carolina's actions violated Shafer's Due Process rights, and the case was sent back for renewed sentencing determinations.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Mental Events" [...] (1970) Davidson {{advanced}} {{a form of}} token identity {{theory about}} the mind: token mental events are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was {{that it did not}} seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing that the sky is blue or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain. [...] Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating types (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to types of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything more than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position anomalous monism: monism, because it claims that only one thing <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from a-, [...] "not," [...] and omalos, [...] "regular") because mental and physical event types could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions).|$|E
2500|$|Indiana Jones is {{essentially}} the archetype for the field of archaeology, individuals who are actively involved in this field {{are influenced by the}} ideas put forward in the films and any other associated media. Indiana Jones is still a highly debated topic among archaeologists, whether the influence of these films is positive or negative has yet to be determined. The argument for these films having a negative influence states that it reflects poorly on the field, one prominent individual with this opinion is Anne Pyburn. Pyburn described the influence of Indiana Jones as being one that is elitist and sexist, she {{went on to say that}} the Indiana Jones films have caused new discoveries in the field of archaeology to become oversimplified and overhyped in an attempt to gain public interest which negatively influences archaeology as a whole. Eric Powell, an editor with the magazine Archaeology, was quoted saying [...] "O.K., fine, the movie romanticizes what we do," [...] continuing on to say that [...] "Indy may be a horrible archeologist, but he’s a great diplomat for archeology. I think we'll see a spike in kids who want to become archeologists." [...] In an article written by Kevin McGeoughs, an associate professor of archaeology, he describes the original archaeological criticism of the film as missing the point of the film. Going on to say that the various critiques of poor excavation techniques used were a plot feature to make the film more enjoyable and that in doing so it is not trying to push an agenda. He finished by saying, [...] "dramatic interest is what <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue,</b> and it is unlikely that film will change in order to promote and foster better archaeological techniques".|$|E

60|$|Nothing, therefore, {{is really}} in question, or ever has been, but the {{differences}} between class incomes. Already there is economic equality between captains, and economic equality between cabin boys. What <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> still is whether there shall be economic equality between captains and cabin boys. What would Jesus have said? Presumably {{he would have said}} that if your only object is to produce a captain and a cabin boy for the purpose of transferring you from Liverpool to New York, or to manoeuvre a fleet and carry powder from the magazine to the gun, then you need give no more than a shilling to the cabin boy for every pound you give to the more expensively trained captain. But if in addition to this you desire to allow the two human souls which are inseparable from the captain and the cabin boy, and which alone differentiate them from the donkey-engine, to develop all their possibilities, then you may find the cabin boy costing rather more than the captain, because cabin boy's work does not do so much for the soul as captain's work. Consequently you will have to give him {{at least as much as}} the captain unless you definitely wish him to be a lower creature, in which case the sooner you are hanged as an abortionist the better.

60|$|This is {{the real}} case against that modern society that is symbolised by such art and architecture. It {{is not that it}} is toppling, but that it is top-heavy. It is not that it is vulgar, but rather that it is not popular. In other words, the {{democratic}} ideal of countries like America, while it is still generally sincere and sometimes intense, <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> with another tendency, an industrial progress which is of all things on earth the most undemocratic. America is not alone in possessing the industrialism, but she is alone in emphasising the ideal that strives with industrialism. Industrial capitalism and ideal democracy are everywhere in controversy; but perhaps only here are they in conflict. France has a democratic ideal; but France is not industrial. England and Germany are industrial; but England and Germany are not really democratic. Of course when I speak here of industrialism I speak of great industrial areas; there is, as will be noted later, another side to all these countries; there is in America itself not only a great deal of agricultural society, but a great deal of agricultural equality; just as there are still peasants in Germany and may some day again be peasants in England. But {{the point is that the}} ideal and its enemy the reality are here crushed very close to each other in the high, narrow city; and that the sky-scraper is truly named because its top, towering in such insolence, is scraping the stars off the American sky, the very heaven of the American spirit.|$|E
60|$|Equally idle {{with the}} claim that the Union party is foreclosed from now dealing with the Rebel States as seceded, because four years ago it {{declared}} that they had no right to secede, is the assertion that the object of the war was proclaimed to be for the restoration of the Union and the Constitution as they were. Even were we to admit that 1861 is the same thing as 1866, the question comes back again to precisely the point that <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> between the President and Congress, namely, What is the wisest way of restoring the Union? for which both profess themselves equally anxious. As for the Constitution, we cannot have that as it was, but only as its framers hoped it would be, with its one weak and wicked element excluded. But as to Union, are we in favor of a Union in form or in fact? of a Union on the map and in our national style merely, or one of ideas, interests, and aspirations? If we cannot have the latter, the former is a delusion and a snare; and the strength of the nation would be continually called away from prosperous toil to be wasted in holding a wolf by the ears, which would still be a wolf, and known by all our enemies for such, though we called heaven and earth to witness, in no matter how many messages or resolves, that the innocent creature was a lamb. That somebody has a right to dictate some kind of terms is admitted by Mr. Johnson's own repeated action in the matter; but who that somebody should be, whether a single man, of whose discretion even his own partisans are daily becoming more doubtful, or the immediate representatives of that large majority of the States and of the people who {{for the last five years}} have been forced against their will to represent and to be the United States, is certainly too grave an affair to be settled by that single man himself.|$|E

60|$|There {{is another}} and a {{stronger}} reason still, why a criminal judge {{is a bad}} witness in favour of the punishment of Death. He is a chief actor in the terrible drama of a trial, where the life or death of a fellow creature <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue.</b> No one who has seen such a trial can fail to know, or can ever forget, its intense interest. I care not how painful this interest is to the good, wise judge upon the bench. I admit its painful nature, and the judge's goodness and wisdom to the fullest extent--but I submit that his prominent share in the excitement of such a trial, and the dread mystery involved, {{has a tendency to}} bewilder and confuse the judge upon the general subject of that penalty. I know the solemn pause before the verdict, the bush and stifling of the fever in the court, the solitary figure brought back to the bar, and standing there, observed of all the outstretched heads and gleaming eyes, to be next minute stricken dead as one may say, among them. I know the thrill that goes round when the black cap is put on, and how there will be shrieks among the women, and a taking out of some one in a swoon; and, when the judge's faltering voice delivers sentence, how awfully the prisoner and he confront each other; two mere men, destined one day, however far removed from one another at this time, to stand alike as suppliants at the bar of God. I know all this, I can imagine what the office of the judge costs in this execution of it; but I say that in these strong sensations he is lost, and is unable to abstract the penalty as a preventive or example, from an experience of it, and from associations surrounding it, which are and can be, only his, and his alone.|$|E
6000|$|... (M39) The {{same night}} at a banquet in Liverpool, and two days later at Manchester, he {{advanced}} to high imperial ground. He told them how, after an experience now becoming long, the one standing pain to the political man in England {{is a sense of}} the inequality of his best exertions to the arduous duty of government and legislation. England had undertaken responsibilities of empire such as never before lay on the shoulders or the minds of men. We governed distant millions many times outnumbering ourselves. We were responsible for the welfare of forty or forty-five separate states. Again, what other nation was charged with the same responsibility in the exercise of its moral influence abroad, in the example it is called upon to set, in the sympathy it must feel with the cause of right and justice and constitutional freedom wherever that cause <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>issue?</b> As for our fellow subjects abroad, we had given them practical freedom. It was our duty to abstain as far as may be from interference with their affairs, to afford them the shelter and protection of the empire, {{and at the same time}} to impress upon them that there is no grosser mistake in politics than to suppose you can separate the blessings and benefits of freedom from its burdens. In other words, the colonies should pay their own way, and if the old dream of making their interests subservient to those of the mother country had passed away, it was just as little reasonable that the mother country should bear charges that in equity belonged to them, and all the more if the colonies set up against the industry and productions of England the mischiefs and obstructions of an exploded protective system. On foreign policy he enforced the principles that, after all, had given to Europe forty years of peace, and to England forty years of diplomatic authority and pre-eminence. “It is impossible that to a country like England the affairs of foreign nations can ever be indifferent. It is impossible that England, in my opinion, ever should forswear the interest she must naturally feel in the cause of truth, of justice, of order, and of good government.” The final word was an admonition against “political lethargy.” For the first time, I think, he put into the forefront the tormenting question that was to haunt him to the end. “They could not look at Ireland,” he told them, “and say that the state of feeling there was for the honour and the advantage of the united kingdom.” ...|$|E
60|$|The first question, to be decided, {{when we talk}} of the Church's {{being in}} danger from any {{particular}} measure, is, whether the danger to the Church is a public evil: for to {{those who think that}} the national Church Establishment is itself a national grievance, to desire them to forward or to resist any measure, upon account of its conducing to the safety of the Church or averting its danger, would be to the last degree absurd. If you have reason to think thus of it, take the reformation instantly into your own hands, whilst you are yet cool, and can do it in measure and proportion, and not under the influence of election tests and popular fury. But here I assume that by far the greater number of those who compose the House are of opinion that this national Church Establishment is a great national benefit, a great public blessing, and that its existence or its non-existence of course is a thing by no means indifferent to the public welfare: then to them its danger or its safety must enter deeply into every question which has a relation to it. It is not because ungrounded alarms have been given that there never can exist a real danger: perhaps the worst effect of an ungrounded alarm is to make people insensible to the approach of a real peril. Quakerism is strict, methodical, in its nature highly aristocratical, and so regular that it has brought the whole community to the condition of one family; but it does not actually interfere with the government.

These are the principles violently and fanatically held and pursued,--taught to their children, who are sworn at the altar like Hannibal. The war is with the Establishment itself,--no quarter, no compromise. As a party, they are infinitely mischievous: see the declarations of Priestley and Price,--declarations, you will say, of hot men. Likely enough: but who are the cool men who have disclaimed them? Not one,--no, not one. Which of them has ever told you that they do not mean to destroy the Church, if ever it should be in their power? Which of them has told you that this would not be the first and favorite use of any power they should get? Not one,--no, not one. Declarations of hot men! The danger is thence, that they are under the conduct of hot men: falsos in amore odia non fingere.|$|E
