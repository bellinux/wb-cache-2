5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund. The antagonism was largely caused by Edward's preference {{for his new}} favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed {{to get along with}} the new administration, and in 1330 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> planning a new rebellion, and executed.|$|E
5|$|He {{was placed}} on injured reserve but made {{headlines}} in early November when he got into a shouting match with GM Bobby Beathard {{and one of the}} coaches, resulting in a fine, a suspension without pay and an apology by Leaf (four weeks later). During his suspension, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> on video playing flag football at a San Diego park, a violation of his contract according to Charger management.|$|E
5|$|The first {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} escape the prison was made on April 27, 1936 by Joseph Bowers, who was assigned the duty of burning trash at the incinerator. He tried to escape during duty hours by scaling a chain link fence {{at the edge of}} the island. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in this act and refused orders of the correctional officer located at the West Road guard tower to come down he was shot.

5|$|Vanderbilt met Virginia for {{the first}} time since 1898. It also won {{for the first}} time, 13–0. Ammie Sikes scored first, after runs of 35 and 28 yards by Lew Hardage paved the way. A 30-yard forward pass from Hardage to Enoch Brown got the second touchdown. In the last period, Sikes broke loose, down to the 5-yard line when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> from behind by Buck Mayer.|$|E
5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
5|$|Because of Bangladesh's meagre batting performance, the Australian innings began {{before lunch}} and opener Adam Gilchrist scored a {{typically}} quick-fire 18 before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> behind from Mortaza. Hayden (46) and Ponting then got valuable batting practice as {{they shared a}} 74-run partnership. Ponting was eventually bowled by Rafique for 29. Damien Martyn's stay at the crease was cut short, in his first International match since breaking his finger in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he faced just one ball before Australia won by eight wickets with more than 27 overs to spare. Along with the wicket of Ponting, Rafique conceded just seven runs in five overs.|$|E

5|$|Schwend {{amassed a}} fortune from Operation Bernhard. He was {{captured}} by American forces in June 1945, who tried to use him to assist in setting up a counterintelligence network in Germany, the Gehlen Organization. After <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> trying to defraud the network, he fled to Peru. Although he periodically acted as an informant for Peruvian intelligence, {{he was arrested for}} currency smuggling and selling state secrets. After a two-year prison sentence, he was deported to West Germany where he was tried for a wartime murder in 1979; he was given a suspended sentence for manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|Significant clashes {{from this}} period {{included}} the siege of Kijevo, where over a thousand people were besieged in the inner Dalmatian village of Kijevo, and the Borovo Selo killings, where Croatian policemen engaged Serb paramilitaries in the eastern Slavonian village of Borovo and suffered twelve casualties. Violence gripped eastern Slavonian villages: in Tovarnik, a Croat policeman was killed by Serb paramilitaries on 2 May, while in Sotin, a Serb civilian was killed on 5 May when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in a crossfire between Serb and Croat paramilitaries. On 6 May, the 1991 protest in Split against the siege of Kijevo at the Navy Command in Split resulted {{in the death of}} a Yugoslav People's Army soldier.|$|E

As soon as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught,</b> his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking to take back the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{completed}} A Short History of the Confederate States of America in October 1889. On November 6, he left Beauvoir {{to visit}} his plantation at Brierfield. While in New Orleans, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in a sleety rain, and on the steamboat trip upriver, he had a severe cold; on November 13 he left Brierfield to return to New Orleans. Varina Davis, who had taken another boat to Brierfield, met him on the river, and he finally received some medical care; two doctors came aboard further south and found he had acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. They arrived in New Orleans three days later, and {{he was taken to}} the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Davis remained in bed but was stable for the next two weeks; however, he took {{a turn for the worse}} in early December. Just when he appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and with his hand in Varina's.|$|E
