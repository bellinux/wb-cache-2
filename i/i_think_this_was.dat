500|$|Ironically, {{the least}} self-confident {{performer}} {{in the film}} {{was one of the}} few professional actors: Vladimir Pucholt, who played the pianist. According to Forman: [...] "This great actor, who had tremendous artistic intuition, completely mistrusted his talent. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> because he had a very rationalist disposition and could never see, much less measure, the result of his acting. 'Was it good, Mr. Forman?” he asked me after every perfect shot. 'It was excellent!' 'Really?' 'Really.' He never believed me and all of us loved him.|$|E
500|$|Three years prior, in 2011, Raonic had set a {{personal}} goal {{of reaching the}} year-end ATP Finals, where only the top eight players earned a spot. Heading into the last ATP 1000 event of 2014, the Paris Masters, Raonic trailed Ferrer for the eighth spot, and needed a deep run to surpass him. He beat Sock and Roberto Bautista Agut {{to set up a}} quarterfinals match against world No. 2 Federer, who had beaten him in all six previous meetings. Needing a win to avoid being eliminated from contention for the ATP Finals, Raonic won in straight sets. His victory was hailed as [...] "a career-defining win." [...] In the post-match interview, Raonic was asked to rank this victory in his career. He replied: [...] "Considering all the circumstances around it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the biggest win for me." [...] He went on to beat world No. 5 Berdych in the semifinals to earn a spot in the second ATP 1000 final of his career. He lost to Djokovic in the final, but secured his place in the 2014 ATP Finals. He is the first Canadian to reach the ATP Finals, and the first player born in the 1990s to do so. Anticlimactically, Raonic withdrew from the tournament due to a leg-muscle tear prior to his match against Nishikori, after losses to Federer and Murray.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh! Look at Me Now", [...] "Dolores", [...] "Everything Happens to Me" [...] and [...] "This Love of Mine" [...] in 1941; [...] "Just as Though You Were There", [...] "Take Me" [...] and [...] "There Are Such Things" [...] in 1942; and [...] "It Started All Over Again", [...] "In the Blue of Evening" [...] and [...] "It's Always You" [...] in 1943. As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E

2500|$|Following {{this early}} {{attempt at a}} major long novel, DeLillo ended the decade with two shorter works. Players (1977), {{originally}} conceived as being [...] "based on {{what could be called}} the intimacy of language. What people who live together really sound like," [...] concerned the lives of a young yuppie couple as the husband gets involved with a cell of domestic terrorists. Its 1978 successor, Running Dog (1978), written in a brief four-month streak of writing, was a thriller concerning numerous individuals hunting down a celluloid reel of Hitler's sexual exploits. Of Running Dog, DeLillo remarked in his Rolling Stone interview that [...] "What I was really getting at in Running Dog was a sense of the terrible acquisitiveness in which we live, coupled with a final indifference to the object. After all the mad attempts to acquire the thing, everyone suddenly decides that, well, maybe we really don't care about this so much anyway. This was something I felt characterized our lives at the time the book was written, in the mid to late seventies. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> part of American consciousness then." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (<b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E
