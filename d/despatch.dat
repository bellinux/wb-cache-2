5|$|Despite these improvements, {{a second}} {{invasion}} {{by the former}} Katangan gendarmerie, known as Shaba II in May–June 1978, was only dispersed with the <b>despatch</b> of the French 2e régiment étranger de parachutistes and a battalion of the Belgian Paracommando Regiment. Kamanyola Division units collapsed almost immediately. French units fought the Battle of Kolwezi to recapture the town from the FLNC. The U.S. provided logistical assistance.|$|E

After his death he was revered as a saint, and had a shrine in St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} battle, the aged Howe retired to his cabin and Curtis was given {{responsibility}} for the flagship and consequently the fleet over the next day. Exactly how much of what transpired was Curtis's fault has never been established, but {{in a series of}} unusual decisions the British failed to pursue the defeated French fleet, allowing many battered French ships to escape. Even more controversially, a <b>despatch</b> was sent to the Admiralty concerning the action which praised certain officers and excluded others. The awards presented to the captains who had served at the battle were given based on the praise each captain received in this report, and those omitted were excluded from the medal celebrating the victory and other honours. Although Howe had ultimate responsibility for the <b>despatch,</b> many blamed Curtis for this slight and he was rumoured to have taken the decision to abandon pursuit and subsequently penned the report himself in Howe's name.|$|E

5|$|While Bonaparte was sailing to Malta, the Royal Navy re-entered the Mediterranean for {{the first}} time in more than a year. Alarmed by reports of French {{preparations}} on the Mediterranean coast, Lord Spencer at the Admiralty sent a message to Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the Tagus River, to <b>despatch</b> a squadron to investigate. This squadron, consisting of three ships of the line and three frigates, was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{wanted to}} join the war effort in August 1914 as a <b>despatch</b> rider, but his {{critically}} ill mother managed {{to persuade him to}} stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.|$|E
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to <b>despatch</b> raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1810 the French Navy made their first serious effort to contest British {{operations}} in the Adriatic, with the <b>despatch</b> of Bernard Dubourdieu from Toulon in Favorite. Dubourdieu {{was considered one of}} the more successful frigate commanders in the French Navy, and he collected the French and Italian forces scattered across the Adriatic into a squadron that significantly outnumbered Hoste's forces. Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's movements and maintained a careful watch on the French-led squadron in its base at Ancona.|$|E

He was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon, but rejoined his unit fifteen days later. On 20 May, Shout was mentioned in the <b>despatch</b> of General Sir Ian Hamilton, General Officer Commanding the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, in recognition of his efforts from the landing on 25 April to 5 May. He was promoted to captain on 29 July.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 <b>despatch</b> did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have {{had an effect on}} the outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the <b>despatch</b> of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} British {{deployment}} into the Adriatic came in May 1808, when the frigate HMS Unite under Captain Patrick Campbell arrived off Venice. During May, Campbell severely disrupted French and Italian shipping off the busiest Adriatic seaport and captured three ships sent against {{him by the}} Italian Navy. The French response to these depredations was to <b>despatch</b> the small frigate Var to Venice, an action which {{had little effect on}} British operations. British activity in the Adriatic was however curtailed during the year by the British war with the Ottoman Empire, which absorbed the scant British naval resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that were already on order but held up for lack of shipping or priority.

Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition.

After a visit to the Old Soldier's Home and a reception at Virginia Hall, the party returned north to Fortress Monroe, where they witnessed a review, and then proceeded to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

By November Tzuktok' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month García once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Ursúa was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the <b>despatch</b> of reinforcements along the Camino Real to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers. An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers met up with García at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the Camino Real towards the San Pedro River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{restrictions}} that the Defence Act (1903) placed upon deploying units of the Citizens Force overseas, following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service. This force {{was known as the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Initially, the AIF was to consist of only one infantry division, but following the <b>despatch</b> of the 1st Division in late 1914 further units were raised and these were eventually organised to form the 2nd Division. As part of the 2nd Division, the 27th Battalion was formed on 16 March 1915 at Ascot Park Camp, Adelaide, from recruits drawn mainly from South Australia, who had originally been allocated to the 24th Battalion. After a period of basic training, the battalion embarked for the Middle East on the troopship HMAT A2 Geelong on 31 May 1915, arriving there on 6 July.|$|E
5|$|No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No.3AD) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 16March 1942. It {{came under the}} control of No.5 (Maintenance) Group.

On establishment, No.3AD's main purpose was the assembly and <b>despatch</b> of combat aircraft manufactured in the United States. In its first six weeks of operation, it assembled 123 Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters and a dozen Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The depot was also responsible for the inspection of RAAF CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons. A further role was salvaging damaged aircraft from units in the local area, and despatching them to No.5 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, for repair.|$|E
