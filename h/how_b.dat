Once released into the aquatic environment, zoospores travel less than 2 cm within 24 hours before they encyst.

Abiotic factors such as temperature, pH level, and nutrient levels affect the success of B. dendrobatidis zoospores. The fungus zoospores can survive within a temperature range of 4-25 °C and a pH range of 6-7.|$|E

Balancing selection may act upon ospC or a nearby sequence to maintain the genetic variety of B. burgdorferi. Balancing selection is the process by which multiple versions of a gene are kept within the gene pool at unexpectedly high frequencies. Two major models that control the selection balance of B.burgdorferi is negative frequency-dependent selection and multiple-niche polymorphism. These models may explain <b>how</b> <b>B.</b> burgdorferi have diversified, and how selection may have affected the distribution of the B. burgdorferi variants, or the variation of specific traits of the species, in certain environments.|$|E

Hospitality businesses are gravitating toward things like social media, in an effort to reach a larger customer base on a more socially interactive level, infused with technology, as a means to boost business. This study examined {{the extent to which the}} Bed and Breakfasts (B&B) sector of the industry uses social media tools (particularly Facebook and Twitter) and whether or not using them had any effect on <b>how</b> <b>Bed</b> and Breakfast websites appeared on the three major search engines. The study also aimed to find the difference in <b>how</b> <b>Bed</b> and Breakfasts ranked across the three major search engines (Bing, Google and Yahoo). The study revealed that although social media has become extremely popular in marketing efforts for many hospitality businesses, there was no direct relationship between Bed and Breakfasts using social media in marketing efforts and <b>how</b> the <b>Bed</b> and Breakfasts ranked on search engines. It was shown however that having a strong online presence and using social media can help Bed and Breakfasts boost their marketing efforts, and business.

50|$|Syrphid {{flies in}} Patagonia and the Southern parts of Chile (Aneriophora aureorufa) seem to use B. dahlbomii as a Batesian Mimicry template. A. aureorufa thus, resembles/mimics {{certain aspects of}} B. dahlbomii {{morphology}} and behavior. In particular, B. dahlbomii and A. aureorufa have similar color and size, and are sometimes difficult to distinguish when observed in the wild because of similar flight motion patterns. The fact that such marked similarities exists illustrates how A. aureorufa morphology must have evolved rapidly, as B. dahlbomii speciation only occurred approximately 7.5 million years ago. The mimicry demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>B.</b> dahlmbomii has a competitive advantage in avoiding predation that A. aureorufa lacks (A.auerorufa mimics B. dahlbomii to falsely “steal” this competitive advantage and increase fitness).|$|E

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} implicates {{the disease}} chytridiomycosis, {{caused by the}} fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, in global amphibian declines and extinctions. While the virulence of this disease has been clearly demonstrated, there is, as yet, no mechanistic explanation for <b>how</b> <b>B.</b> dendrobatidis kills amphibians. To investigate the pathology of chytridiomycosis, blood samples were collected from uninfected, aclinically infected and clinically diseased amphibians and analyzed {{for a wide range}} of biochemical and hematological parameters. Here, we show that green tree frogs Litoria caerulea with severe chytridiomycosis had reduced plasma osmolality, sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride concentrations. Stable plasma albumin, hematocrit and urea levels indicated that hydration status was unaffected, signifying depletion of electrolytes from circulation rather than dilution due to increased water uptake. We suggest that B. dendrobatidis kills amphibians by disrupting normal epidermal functioning, leading to osmotic imbalance through loss of electrolytes. Determining <b>how</b> <b>B.</b> dendrobatidis kills amphibians is fundamental to understanding the host– pathogen relationship and thus the population declines attributed to B. dendrobatidis. Understanding the mechanisms of mortality may also explain interspecific variation in susceptibility to chytridiomycosis...|$|E
