5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> latex. The <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E

5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm of <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of white hamster: dark <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> eared <b>and</b> black eyed. All three are completely white. The dark eared variety first appeared in 1952 and has red eyes which darken as the animal ages. Black eyed whites have flesh coloured ears. Flesh eared whites, often described as albinos, were first mentioned in the National Hamster Council Journal in 1956. As the name suggests, Flesh Eared Whites have <b>flesh</b> ears <b>and</b> pink eyes.|$|R

5|$|Tales of supernatural beings {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or {{flesh of the}} living {{have been found in}} nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. The term vampire did not exist in ancient times. Blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E

5|$|Hydnellum peckii {{is similar}} in appearance, but has an acrid taste, and clamp {{connections}} in its hyphae. Hydnellum spongiosipes is readily confused with H.ferrugineum, and several authors have historically considered the two species to be the same; molecular studies, however, indicate that the two fungi are closely related, but distinct. In contrast with H.ferrugineum, H.spongiosipes has a darker cap when young, darker <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> occurs in deciduous woods. Old fruit bodies of H.ferrugineum can be confused with those of Hydnellum concrescens.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, other {{similarly}} green-capped species {{collected by}} mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills {{of the genus}} Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre, now regarded as hazardous owing {{to a series of}} restaurant poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R.aeruginea, and R.virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> the lack of both volva and ring. Other similar species include A.subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A.arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north {{at least as far as}} central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.|$|E
5|$|John James Audubon {{reported}} that the American white ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh {{has been described as}} appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus Eudocimus have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus is {{classified}} in the section Dapetes of the genus Lactarius. This section, which also includes other popular edible species such as L.deliciosus, and the less popular L.deterrimus, is characterized by mushrooms with orange or red latex that often impart a greenish stain on the <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> gills, an often sticky cap, and association with conifers. The specific epithet sanguifluus {{is derived from the}} Latin words sanguis ("blood") and fluus ("flowing").|$|E

During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequences shows that C.vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly-amyloid <b>flesh</b> <b>and</b> thick-walled cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E
5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of <b>flesh,</b> <b>and</b> suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|Some isopod {{groups have}} evolved a {{parasitic}} lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish.
