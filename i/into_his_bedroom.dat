She declines, but slips <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> and makes love {{to him that}} night before leaving early the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest elects {{to go for a}} run. He decides to keep running across the country several times, over three and a half years, {{becoming}} famous in the process.|$|E
5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him {{in the event of an}} American invasion.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian {{newspaper}} al-Ayyam {{reported that}} Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds {{at his home}} in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret service. Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, Taher Jalil Habbush, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.|$|E

60|$|The good-natured and thoughtless young Templar readily acquiesced, {{and led the}} way <b>into</b> <b>his</b> little <b>bedroom,</b> where, from bandboxes, portmanteaus, mail-trunks, not forgetting an old walnut-tree wardrobe, {{he began}} to select the {{articles}} which he thought best suited effectually to disguise his guest in venturing into the lawless and turbulent society of Alsatia.|$|R
5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E

However Grant mistakenly swallows a wish-granting gemstone needed for the device, believing it to be medicine, effectively being granted his wish to be a superhero. Abandoning the device, the Doctor makes Grant promise to not use his new superpowers before he leaves.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 Robert Fisk {{obtained}} a report written in September 2002, for Saddam Hussein's [...] "presidency intelligence office," [...] by Iraq's [...] "Special Intelligence Unit M4." [...] The report {{said that the}} Iraqis had been interrogating Abu Nidal in his home as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt, and indirectly for the United States. It {{said he had been}} asked by the Kuwaitis to find links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Just before being moved to a more secure location, Abu Nidal asked to be allowed to change his clothing, went <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> and shot himself, the report said. He was buried on 29 August 2002 in al-Karakh's Islamic cemetery in Baghdad, in a grave marked M7.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} week of November, strange noises awaken Wendy, and Danny runs <b>into</b> <b>his</b> parents' <b>bedroom</b> in a panic. Jack checks the {{elevator}} and then the ballroom, where he momentarily hears people. He sees a dog mask and a large croquet mallet. Shaken, Jack composes himself before returning to the quarters to reassure Wendy. Wendy still believes that they should leave the hotel.|$|R
60|$|He {{peered through}} the window, to see on floor and table ample {{evidence}} of recent packing. That gave check to a creeping blankness which was benumbing Pan. He went on to look <b>into</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>bedroom.</b> The bed {{looked as if it}} had been used during the night and had not been made up. Perhaps his mother and Lucy had gone into Marco to purchase necessities.|$|R
60|$|On the Sunday {{afternoon}} Captain Cuttwater {{asked him}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>bedroom,</b> {{and told him}} with a solemn, serious manner {{that he had a}} communication of importance to make to him. Alaric followed the captain into the well-known room in which Norman used to sleep, wondering what could be the nature of Uncle Bat's important communication. It might, probably, be some tidings of Sir Jib Boom.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{generated}} {{interest in}} the program's music and was regarded as [...] "the show to be heard on". Michael Peck from TV Guide said that he received a large quantity of mail that inquired about the song [...] "Into Dust" [...] by Mazzy Star, which played when Ryan carried Marissa <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Other featured music was The All-American Rejects' 2003 hit, [...] "Swing, Swing", and [...] "Hands Up" [...] by The Black Eyed Peas from their 2003 multi-platinum album, Elephunk. Among Schwartz's favorite musical moments from the show was Joseph Arthur's [...] "Honey and the Moon", which Schwartz claimed helped him write the pilot. The title track [...] "California" [...] introduced the band Phantom Planet into the mainstream.|$|E
500|$|Lamb started exhibiting violent {{traits of}} his own from an early age. Nosanchuk writes that the young boy lured his cousins <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom,</b> locked them in a closet and {{threatened}} them. On one occasion he followed through with these threats and beat one of his cousins so badly that medical attention was required at a local hospital. [...] "I remember once," [...] said Greg Sweet, a childhood friend, [...] "when he was about seven years old, he held a knife to a smaller kid and made him eat dog faeces". Lamb first attended Colbourne School in Tecumseh, where Collins later said {{he appeared to be}} normal. School staff agreed, later telling the Windsor Star that he rarely got into trouble, and was capable, but unable to concentrate for extended periods.|$|E
500|$|On March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt {{went to the}} Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest {{before his}} {{anticipated}} appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of}} my head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom.</b> The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). At 3:35pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, “so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, [...] "Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House".|$|E
60|$|Curtis took Winters <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>bedroom</b> and put its toilet {{articles}} at his service and left him. As the sheriff came {{out into the}} Captain's library five minutes later, it was plain he had washed away {{a large part of}} his ferocity; his hair, plastered down smooth, represented the change in his mental condition--his quills were laid. He was, in fact, fairly meek.|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} {{which she was}} {{supposed}} to arrive, she does not come. And so, crestfallen and love sick, Chris goes to bed. The next morning Jenny arrives, and after having tea on the porch they go <b>into</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>bedroom</b> and make love. He is a virgin, while she is much more experienced, and he notices she has a tattoo of a butterfly above her left breast (hence the title).|$|R
500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E
500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family {{back into the living room}} and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E
50|$|The final prank of each {{show was}} the Big Stitch Up! One popular prank {{involved}} tricking a boy <b>into</b> believing <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> would be transformed by a DIY TV show whilst {{he was at}} school. When he returned home, {{it was revealed that}} <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> had actually been made to look like a garden, complete with a gnome and water feature. Another involved giving a Saturday worker at a hairdresser a 'day from hell' at work, with customers' hair catching fire and mirrors smashing in front of her. When it was revealed to the victim that it had all been a prank, he or she would receive a Stitch Up! trophy.|$|R
60|$|We left consternation {{behind us}} when after {{the return of}} the unwilling Armadale we carried the Colonel <b>into</b> <b>his</b> great <b>bedroom</b> where he lay {{breathing}} stertorously while Foster remained to assist his sister. Then the murmurs broke out as I returned, and each man looked at his neighbor in dismay, until there was once more stillness when dressed in some clinging white fabric Grace stood with a stern, cold face in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|When {{the noise}} of the cannonading was over, Mrs. O'Dowd issued out of Amelia's room into the parlour adjoining, where Jos sate with two emptied flasks, and courage entirely gone. Once or twice he had ventured <b>into</b> <b>his</b> sister's <b>bedroom,</b> looking very much alarmed, and as if he would say something. But the Major's wife kept her place, and he went away without disburthening himself of his speech. He was ashamed to tell her that he wanted to fly.|$|R
2500|$|Alex: The novel's [...] protagonist {{and leader}} among his droogs. He often refers {{to himself as}} [...] "Your Humble Narrator". Having coaxed two ten-year-old girls <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom,</b> Alex refers to himself as [...] "Alexander the Large" [...] while raping them; this was later the basis for Alex's claimed surname DeLarge in the 1971 film.|$|E
2500|$|After {{eating lunch}} at a McDonald's {{restaurant}} in the Clairemont neighborhood of San Diego, the Hubertys returned home. Shortly thereafter, he walked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> as his wife lay relaxing upon the bed; he leaned toward her and said, [...] "I want to kiss you goodbye." [...] Etna asked him where he was going, to which he replied he was [...] "going hunting humans".|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} heading back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> studio was [...] "Voodoo Ray", played {{first at the}} Hacienda in 1988 and then the {{underground}} clubs before entering the UK Singles Chart a year later. It was the first acid house track produced in the UK, and released on a small Merseyside independent label (Rham! Records) based in Wallasey. [...] "Voodoo Ray" [...] entered the UK record chart in 1989 rising to number 12. It was also the best selling independently released single of that year.|$|E
6000|$|Winton {{went first}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> daughter's <b>bedroom,</b> {{and gazed at}} its emptied silken order, its deserted silver mirror, {{twisting}} viciously at his little moustache. Then, in his sanctum, he sat down before the fire, without turning up the light. Anyone looking in, would have thought he was asleep; but the drowsy influence of that deep chair and cosy fire had drawn {{him back into the}} long-ago. What unhappy chance had made him pass HER house to-day! ...|$|R
60|$|Anthony Harding {{turned and}} leaped {{up the narrow}} {{stairway}} {{to the second floor}} four steps at a time. He hadn't gone upstairs in that fashion in forty years. Without even pausing to rap he burst <b>into</b> <b>his</b> daughter's <b>bedroom.</b> It was empty. The bed was unruffled. It had not been slept in. With a moan the man turned back and ran hastily to the other rooms upon the second floor--Barbara was nowhere to be found. Then he hastened downstairs to the two men awaiting him.|$|R
60|$|Holmes {{said little}} more, but {{the picture of}} the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were {{continually}} fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me back <b>into</b> the banqueting-hall, <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> candle in <b>his</b> hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Soilih, Abdallah's presidency {{was marked by}} authoritarian rule and increased adherence to traditional Islam and the country was renamed the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros (République Fédérale Islamique des Comores; جمهورية القمر الإتحادية الإسلامية). Abdallah continued as president until 1989 when, fearing a probable coup d'état, he signed a decree ordering the Presidential Guard, led by Bob Denard, to disarm the armed forces. Shortly after {{the signing of the}} decree, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an antitank missile was launched <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> and killed him. [...] Although Denard was also injured, it is suspected that Abdallah's killer was a soldier under his command.|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} police, Taylor {{eventually}} admitted kidnapping Tiernan. His explanation {{was that he}} had not visited Haughley Gill for many years, but by chance had been there on the afternoon that Tiernan went missing. He said that she had walked past him and on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered her head with his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>bedroom</b> and onto the bed where, during a struggle, she had fallen off the bed, striking her head on the floor. He said that he had then picked her up by the scarf around her neck, at which point she had died, and claimed that her death was an accident. He said he had panicked and hidden her body in Lindley Woods.|$|E

When he awakes on Christmas morning, the little boy jumps out of bed, runs straight past a large pile of presents at the bottom of his bed and heads for the wardrobe.

60|$|He {{took up his}} candle once more, {{kissed the}} {{portrait}} in the broken frame with intense fervour a dozen times over, and then went up gloomily <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>bedroom.</b> There he {{did not attempt to}} undress, but merely pulled off his boots, lay down in his clothes upon the bed, and hastily blew out the candle. For a long time he lay tossing and turning in unspeakable terror; but at last, after perhaps two hours or so, he fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamed a hideous nightmare, in which somebody or other in shadowy outlines was trying perpetually to tear him away by main force from poor pale and weeping Hetty.|$|R

He runs <b>into</b> <b>his</b> parents' <b>bedroom,</b> confused and frightened; they reassure {{him that he was}} just having a bad dream, telling him to go back to sleep. Having returned to his bed, more wind and loud thunder is heard. David then climbs out of bed again, goes to his window, and witnesses the very same flying saucer of his dream slowly descending into the sandpit; the screen then holds on young David, who says [...] "Gee whizz", and then dissolves to the film's [...] "The End" [...] title card, as the film's ethereal music reaches its crescendo in coda with the final fade-out.|$|R
