40|$|Background: Three {{epidemic}} {{waves of}} influenza A(H 7 N 9) (hereafter 'H 7 N 9 ') human cases have occurred between March 2013 and July 2015 in China. However, the underlying transmission mechanism remains unclear. Our main {{objective is to}} use mathematical models to study how seasonality, secular changes and environmental transmission {{play a role in}} the spread of H 7 N 9 in China. Methods: Data on human cases and chicken cases of H 7 N 9 infection were downloaded from the EMPRES-i Global Animal Disease Information System. We modelled on chicken-to-chicken transmission, assuming a constant ratio of 10 - 6 human case per chicken case, and compared the model fit with the observed human cases. We developed three different modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible models: (i) a non-periodic transmission rate model with an <b>environmental</b> <b>class,</b> (ii) a non-periodic transmission rate model without an <b>environmental</b> <b>class,</b> and (iii) a periodic transmission rate model with an <b>environmental</b> <b>class.</b> We then estimated the key epidemiological parameters and compared the model fit using Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion. Results: Our results showed that a non-periodic transmission rate model with an <b>environmental</b> <b>class</b> provided the best model fit to the observed human cases in China during the study period. The estimated parameter values were within biologically plausible ranges. Conclusions: This study highlighted the importance of considering secular changes and environmental transmission in the modelling of human H 7 N 9 cases. Secular changes were most likely due to control measures such as Live Poultry Markets closures that were implemented during the initial phase of the outbreaks in China. Our results suggested that environmental transmission via viral shedding of infected chickens had contributed to the spread of H 7 N 9 human cases in China. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|E

40|$|DNA sequencing, phylogenetic and mapping {{studies suggest}} that the class 1 {{integron}} found in pathogens arose when one member of the diverse family of <b>environmental</b> <b>class</b> 1 integrons became embedded into a Tn 402 transposon. However, the timing of this event and the selective forces that first fixed the newly formed element in a bacterial lineage are still unknown. Biocides have a longer use in clinical practice than antibiotics, and a qac (quaternary ammonium compound) resistance gene, or remnant thereof, is a normal feature of class 1 integrons recovered from clinical isolates. Consequently, {{it is possible that the}} initial selective advantage was conferred by resistance to biocides, mediated by qac. Here, we show that diverse qac gene cassettes are a dominant feature of cassette arrays from <b>environmental</b> <b>class</b> 1 integrons, and that they occur in the absence of any antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. They are present in arrays that are dynamic, acquiring and rearranging gene cassettes within the arrays. The abundance of qac gene cassettes makes them a likely candidate for participation in the original insertion into Tn 402, and as a source of a readily selectable phenotype. More broadly, the increasing use of qac and other biocides at the present time seems likely to promote the fixation of further novel genetic elements, with unpredictable and potentially adverse consequences for human health and agriculture. 7 page(s...|$|E
