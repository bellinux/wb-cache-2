40|$|We {{developed}} a habitat suitability index (HSI) model {{to understand and}} identify the optimal habitat and potential fishing grounds for neon f lying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Remote sensing data, including sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea surface height, and chlorophyll-a concentrations, as well as <b>fishery</b> <b>data</b> from Chinese mainland squid f leets in the main fishing ground (150 – 165 °E longitude) from August to October, from 1999 to 2004, were used. The HSI model was validated by using <b>fishery</b> <b>data</b> from 2005. The arithmetic mean modeling with three of the environmental variables—sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, and chlorophyll- a concentrations—was defined as the most parsimonious HSI model. In 2005, monthly HSI values > 0. 6 coincided with productive fishing grounds and high fishing effort from August to October. This result implies that the model can reliably predict potential f ishing grounds for O. bartramii. Because spatially explicit <b>fisheries</b> and environmental <b>data</b> are becoming readily available, it is feasible to develop a dynamic, near real-time habitat model for improving the process of identifying potential fishing areas for and optimal habitats of neon flying squid...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>{{fisheries}}</b> <b>data</b> has great {{impacts on the}} quality of stock assessment, and thus fisheries management. In this paper, using a case study I evaluate the impacts of two types of error, biased error and atypical error, that can negatively affect the quality of <b>fisheries</b> <b>data</b> in stock assessment. These errors are commonly associated with <b>fisheries</b> <b>data,</b> and assumptions on their sources and statistical properties can have great impacts on the outcome of stock assessment. Although the sources and statistical properties of these errors differed, both of them could result in errors in stock assessment if estimation methods are not appropriate. Different statistical approaches used in fitting models differ in their robustness with respect to errors of different statistical properties in data. This study showed the importance of evaluating the quality of input data and the possibility of developing an approach that is robust to errors in data. Considering the likelihood of <b>fisheries</b> <b>data</b> being affected by errors of different statistical properties, I suggest that the robustness of a stock assessment be evaluated with respect to data quality...|$|E
