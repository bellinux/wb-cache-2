In 1982, Lane stated that sentences for rape should include immediate prison time, except in the most exceptional circumstances, which was taken as an implied rebuke for a Judge who had attracted controversy for fining a rapist £2,000 and saying that the victim was [...] "guilty of {{a great deal of}} contributory negligence". Lane made it clear he rejected the general concept that victims of rape could have given their attackers an excuse. Much later in his career, Lane was responsible for a judgment in the case of R v R which for the first time held that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife, overturning the <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> at common law that a wife consented to sex with her husband.|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Presumptions have an {{important}} role in antitrust jurisprudence. This article suggests that a careful formulation of the relevant presumptions and associated evidentiary rebuttal burdens can provide the “enquiry meet for the case” across a large array of narrow categories of conduct confronted in antitrust to create a type of “meta” rule of reason. The article begins this project by using decision theory to analyze the types and properties of antitrust presumptions and evidentiary rebuttal burdens and the relationship between them. Depending on the category of conduct and market structure conditions, antitrust presumptions lie along a continuum from conclusive (irrebuttable) anticompetitive, to rebuttable anticompetitive, to competitively neutral, and on to rebuttable procompetitive and conclusive (<b>irrebuttable)</b> procompetitive <b>presumptions.</b> A key source of these presumptions is the likely competitive effects inferred from market conditions. Other sources are policy-based [...] deterrence policy concerns and overarching policies involving the goals and premises of antitrust jurisprudence. Rebuttal evidence can either undermine the facts on which the presumptions are based or can provide other evidence to offset the competitive effects likely implied by the presumption. The evidentiary burden to rebut a presumption depends on the strength of the presumption and the availability and reliability of further case-specific evidence. These twin determinants can be combined and understood through the lens of Bayesian decision theory to explain how “the quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. ” The stronger the presumption and less reliable the case-specific evidence in signaling whether the conduct is anticompetitive versus procompetitive, the more difficult it will be for the disfavored party to satisfy the evidentiary burden to rebut the presumption. The evidentiary rebuttal burden generally is a burden of production, but also can involve the burden of persuasion, as with the original Philadelphia National Bank structural presumption, or typical procompetitive presumptions. If a presumption is rebutted with sufficient offsetting evidence to avoid an initial judgment, the presumption generally continues to carry some weakened weight in the post-rebuttal phase of the decision process. That is, a thumb remains on the scale. However, if the presumption is undermined, it is discredited and it carries no weight in the post-rebuttal decision process. The article uses this methodology to analyze various antitrust presumptions. It also analyzes the, burden-shifting rule of reason and suggests that the elements should not be rigidly sequenced in the decision process. The article also begins the project of reviewing, revising and refining existing antitrust presumptions with proposed revisions and refinements in a number of areas. The article invites other commentators to join the project by criticizing these proposals and suggesting others. These presumptions then could be applied by appellate courts and relied upon by lower court, litigants and business planners...|$|R

50|$|It then {{considered}} the congressional purpose underlying § 6 of the Control Act, {{noting that the}} legislation in question flowed from the congressional desire to protect national security which it held was obviously and unarguably within the Congress' Constitutional power. But it concluded that the legislation was indiscriminate due to an absence of criteria linking the bare fact of membership in a Communist organization to the individual's knowledge, activity or commitment. The provision swept within its prohibition both knowing and unknowing members, citing Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183: 'Indiscriminate classification of innocent with knowing activity must fall as an assertion of arbitrary power.' The <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of Section 6 that individuals {{who are members of}} the specified organizations will, if given passports, engage in activities inimical to the security of the United States also rendered irrelevant the member's degree of activity in the organization and his commitment to its purpose, citing Schware v.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{policy in}} the operation of a legal system is that ignorantia juris non excusat (ignorance of the law is no excuse). It would completely undermine the enforcement of any law if the person potentially at fault was able to raise as a successful defence that he or she had not been aware of the particular law. For this reason, all the main legislatures publish their laws freely whether in hard copy or on the Internet, while others offer them for sale to the public at affordable prices. Because everyone is entitled to access the laws as they affect their personal lives, all adults are assumed responsible enough to research the law before they act. If they fail to do so, they can hardly complain if their acts prove unlawful, no matter how transiently they may be within the jurisdiction. The only exception to this rule excuses those of reduced capacity, whether as infants or through mental illness (for example, see the principle of doli incapax which raises an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> in criminal law that an infant is incapable of committing a crime).|$|E

App. 1st Cir. 7/14/98), 718 So.2d 521, in an en banc determination, with Judge Kuhn writing, the First Circuit {{ruled that}} the {{employment}} of police officer did not automatically imply bias of officer, so as to preclude him from serving on jury. On review, the Supreme Court expressly overruling the broad pronouncement of its earlier decision in State v. Simmons, 390 So.2d 1317, which had held “an actively employed criminal deputy sheriff is not a competent criminal juror.” In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court noted, “Law enforcement officers are sworn to uphold {{the laws of the}} state, which laws include the provision of a fair trial to each and every defendant. If a law enforcement officer testifies under oath during voir dire that he can be a fair and impartial juror, the trial judge has the discretion to determine whether that officer is speaking the truth. The disqualification of all law enforcement officers from service on a jury disregards whether or not the judge, whose rulings on challenges for cause are given great deference in all other instances, accepts the officer as a fair and impartial juror. We find that such a disqualification amounts to an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of untrustworthiness in law enforcement officers and is an affront to police officers in this state.” Thus, the First Circuit’s determination was affirmed.

5000|$|The Court of Appeal in R v Claydon (2005) EWCA Crim 2817 has {{repeated}} this criticism. Claydon had {{sexually abused}} the thirteen-year-old son of {{his partner in}} the 1980s, and was tried twenty years later on an indictment containing counts of sexual offences, including two counts of incitement to commit buggery. At that time, there was an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> that a boy {{under the age of}} fourteen years was incapable of sexual intercourse (applying R v Waite (1892) 2 QBD 600-601 and R v Williams 1893 1 QB 320-321). It was argued by the Crown that, although the boy could not in law have committed the act incited, it was nevertheless quite possible for the defendant to incite him. Having considered R v Whitehouse and R v Pickford, the Court of Appeal felt obliged to reject that argument. As Laws J said in Pickford, [...] "it is a necessary element of the element of incitement that the person incited must be capable which he meant capable {{as a matter of law}} of committing the primary crime." [...] The Court agreed because the focus of the offence of inciting is solely on the acts and intention of the inciter while the intention of the person incited are not relevant when considering whether the offence of incitement has been committed. It further endorsed the views of Smith and Hogan (10th Edition at p 295) who criticised the decision in Curr on the basis that [...] "...the real question should not have been not whether the women actually had the knowledge, but whether D believed they had." [...] Furthermore, Smith (1994) said that [...] "the court has confused the mens rea of incitement with the mens rea of the offence incited".|$|E
5000|$|The {{court will}} have little {{difficulty}} in establishing mens rea if there is actual evidencefor instance, if the accused made an admissible admission. This would satisfy a subjective test. But {{a significant proportion of}} those accused of crimes make no such admissions. Hence, some degree of objectivity must be brought to bear as the basis upon which to impute the necessary component(s). It is always reasonable to assume that people of ordinary intelligence are aware of their physical surroundings and of the ordinary laws of cause and effect (see causation). Thus, when a person plans what to do and what not to do, he will understand the range of likely outcomes from given behaviour on a sliding scale from [...] "inevitable" [...] to [...] "probable" [...] to [...] "possible" [...] to [...] "improbable". The more an outcome shades towards the [...] "inevitable" [...] end of the scale, {{the more likely it is}} that the accused both foresaw and desired it, and, therefore, the safer it is to impute intention. If there is clear subjective evidence that the accused did not have foresight, but a reasonable person would have, the hybrid test may find criminal negligence. In terms of the burden of proof, the requirement is that a jury must have a high degree of certainty before convicting, defined as [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] in the United States and [...] "sure" [...] in the United Kingdom. It is this reasoning that justifies the defenses of infancy, and of lack of mental capacity under the M'Naghten Rules, an alternate common law rule (e.g., Durham test), and one of various statutes defining mental illness as an excuse. Moreover, if there is an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of doli incapax - that is, that the accused did not have sufficient understanding of the nature and quality of his actionsthen the requisite mens rea is absent no matter what degree of probability might otherwise have been present. For these purposes, therefore, where the relevant statutes are silent and it is for the common law to form the basis of potential liability, the reasonable person must be endowed with the same intellectual and physical qualities as the accused, and the test must be whether an accused with these specific attributes would have had the requisite foresight and desire.|$|E

40|$|In Re P (Adoption: Unmarried Couple) [2008] UKHL 38, [2008] 2 FLR 1084 the House of Lords {{held that}} a bar on {{adoption}} by unmarried couples is unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 (ECHR). In R v Secretary of State for Health and Kent County Council, ex p B [1999] 1 FLR 656, the High Court found that a bar on fostering by convicted sex offenders is lawful. In what follows, I argue that the reasoning in Re P applies mutatis mutandis to individuals {{such as those in}} ex p B prevented from adopting or fostering under vetting and barring schemes, the most prominent being the scheme introduced by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. I first consider various ways in which such individuals could bring themselves within the grounds protected by Article 14, and I argue that 'sex offender' itself could be a protected status, because sex offenders have the personal characteristic of 'risk'. I next analyse whether the bar on adoption and fostering, and vetting and barring schemes in their entirety, would fall within the ambit of a substantive Article of the ECHR, and I conclude that the whole Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act scheme would come within the scope of Article 8. Finally, I consider whether the bar on adoption and fostering by risky individuals is objectively justified, and I conclude that the argument that convinced the House of Lords in Re P applies equally in this context: it is impermissible to turn a reasonable generalisation into an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> for individual cases, given the duty to treat {{the best interests of the}} child as paramount...|$|E
40|$|International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace 2 ̆ 6 Agricultural Implement Workers of America v. State of Michigan (UAW) is {{the most}} recent {{interpretation}} of a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s evidentiary burden under a Title VII claim of sex-based wage discrimination. UAW held that job evaluation studies showing pay differentials between female and male dominated jobs of equal worth are insufficient to prove intentional discrimination. The court 2 ̆ 7 s holding was not required by previous case law and serves to make sex-based wage discrimination claims more difficult to prove than other Title VII claims. A plaintiff bringing a sex-based wage discrimination claim can no longer create an inference of intent; the plaintiff must prove intent. This Note examines those arguments addressing the issue of intent and analyzes {{the effect of the}} court 2 ̆ 7 s holding. First, the Note introduces the UAW case, its facts, and the arguments related to intent that the court relied on. Second, this Note analyzes the court 2 ̆ 7 s justifications for holding job evaluations insufficient to prove discrimination. The Note focuses on the court 2 ̆ 7 s erroneous interpretation of previous discrimination cases involving statistical evidence, the court 2 ̆ 7 s unprecedented and unwise decision that employers should be able to rely on the market to set wages, and the court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to consider traditional considerations in allocating the burden of proof. The Note then addresses the court 2 ̆ 7 s illogical concerns about imposing a wage scale on employers. The Note concludes that the UAW decision effectively denies employees their Title VII claims by disproportionately increasing the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s burden in these cases. Finally, the Note suggests that shifting the burden of proof to the employer would permit employees to bring claims and still protect the employer 2 ̆ 7 s interests. A model for this allocation is presented along with a discussion as to how this shift would address valid concerns raised by the court in UAW, including the employer 2 ̆ 7 s disincentive to conduct job evaluation studies if the studies could be used to create an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of discrimination...|$|E
40|$|Actual genetic ties do {{not always}} establish, or even help to establish, legal {{paternity}} of children born of consensual sex, that is, male parental rights and/or duties as {{of the time of}} birth. Paternity status, typically governed by state law, is often dependent upon the marital status of the mothers, or the nonsex acts of men preconception, prebirth, or shortly after birth. For example, husbands of mothers are often deemed parents at birth because genetic ties are presumed. Thus, for nonmarital children born to certain married women, legal paternity is not founded on actual genetic ties. Similarly, actual male genetic ties may not lead to paternity when children are born of sex to unmarried women. Again preconception, prebirth or at birth conduct may be important. The 1983 United States Supreme Court decision in Lehr v. Robertson recognizes that American states can require natural fathers, at least in the adoption setting, to do more than prove genetic ties in order to acquire paternity. When such fathers do enough, they acquire “substantial” federal constitutional childrearing interests so that any proposed adoption requires their consent. When such fathers do not do enough, Lehr allows states to deny them legal parentage. Lehr does forbid states from omitting too many natural fathers from governmental schemes for eliminating parental interests. And Lehr does not forbid a state, at least within adoption, from designating legal paternity for a nonmarital child in a man with no genetic ties. Many American states, in fact, say that genetic ties alone are an insufficient basis for legal paternity. And, within adoption, and often elsewhere, states recognize childrearing interests in nonmarital children for certain nongenetic fathers. The U. S. Supreme Court has said little since Lehr about male parentage under law for nonmarital children born of sex. It has, however, spoken on legal paternity for children of married mothers whose husbands are not the genetic fathers, a different breed of nonmarital children. In Michael H. v. Gerald D. in 1989, the court recognized that an American state could create an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of genetic ties in a husband for a child born during marriage where the marriage remains intact after birth and the married couple chooses to raise the child. After reviewing Lehr and Michael H., we find the Lehr guidelines have not been properly followed in and outside of adoption, including safe haven and custody/visitation settings. We also review American paternity laws in child support, torts and inheritance settings where male childrearing is not always at issue. Along the way we explore the possible expansion of Lehr’s childrearing opportunity interests in children born of sex to those uninvolved in sex. We conclude that Lehr rights should be expanded to natural fathers outside adoption and to certain nongenetic parents, including both women and men...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} for public universities to impose durational residency requirements on students for tuition purposes. Of course, out-of-state students {{complain about the}} practice, which usually involves higher tuition rates for at least {{their first year of}} study, but interestingly, very few scholars have directly addressed the constitutional implications of durational residency requirements in the tuition context. There is no surprise in that, however. An intellectually honest analysis of the practice reveals some real questions about its constitutionality, but the academic community relies upon the economic benefits of the practice, at least in part, to maintain fiscal integrity. Self-interest is a powerful restraint. Naturally, a number of law students have challenged the practice by writing notes or articles in other law reviews, but it seems that their conclusions have not been taken seriously, as nothing has changed. Nor is there much case law challenging durational residency requirements for tuition purposes; university students (and their parents) seem to have accepted the practice as the norm, and cases brought by those who have challenged it are often decided based on a very narrow set of facts (and thus are limited to those facts). Though courts have dealt with durational residency requirements in many contexts, often finding them unconstitutional, they have refused to extend their holdings to the tuition context, and the United States Supreme Court has never directly addressed the issue. However, since the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Saenz v. Roe, the constitutionality of durational residency requirements in any context, including for tuition purposes, has become even more suspect. If ever there was a time to challenge the practice, it is now. The most effective strike would be made by a 2 ̆ 2 perfect 2 ̆ 2 plaintiffan unquestionably bona fide resident of a state-against a public university of a state that maintains an extremely strict policy of residency classification denying the plaintiff the benefit of in-state tuition because of an <b>irrebuttable</b> <b>presumption</b> of nonresident status. Were such an attack to be decided on purely legal grounds, the perfect plaintiff would almost certainly be victorious. Indeed, there are few, if any, legal doctrines or justifications that allow a state to classify its citizens differently for different purposes. Constitutional law also prohibits a state from creating a barrier to a United States citizen 2 ̆ 7 s right to travel or from violating a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s due process rights by irrebuttably presuming his nonresident status. Nevertheless, practical and political considerations probably preclude a perfect victory and perhaps any victory at all. For illustrative purposes, Part II will present background concerning Nebraska law and the University of Nebraska system. Part II will also describe the efforts of one perfect plaintiff—me—to obtain instate tuition not by 2 ̆ 2 gaming the system 2 ̆ 2 as many students do, but instead by unquestionably establishing a bona fide residence in Nebraska. Finally, Part II will discuss the history and development of the right to travel and some of the landmark tuition cases that have helped {{set the stage for the}} present battle. Understanding the history and development of the law in those areas is vitally important to understanding Part III. Using Nebraska as a model, Part III will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the legal arguments against durational residency requirements for tuition purposes, which, as already mentioned, include violations of the right to travel and due process. Part III will also discuss why those legal arguments, despite their potency, will probably fail due to practical and political considerations. Finally, Part IV will conclude with a few ideas on how to bridge the divide between the law and reality, thereby avoiding the situation where student residents feel that they are strangers in their own land...|$|E
