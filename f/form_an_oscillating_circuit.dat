40|$|Patients with {{implanted}} stents {{were often}} (approx. 30 %) {{faced with the}} restenosis. By now no alternative to clinical examination is known to get a quick diagnosis for the actual state of possible and probable in-stentrestenosis. At Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart a simple method to measure and to determine the restenosis degree was invented and implemented. The Proof of principle {{was conducted on the}} experimental rig on an artery model. The approach is based on an inductive coupling between the external detection unit and implanted sensors. Two passive sensors were integrated in a stent and consist of a capacitive pressure sensor and an air-coil. Connected they <b>form</b> <b>an</b> <b>oscillating</b> <b>circuit,</b> the resonance frequency of which functionally depends on the local pressure. The extra-corporal detection unit generates an alternating magnetic field by 35 MHz. The spreading pulse wave changes the resonance frequency of the passive oscillating circuits inside the vessel. The short resonance inside the sensor circuit crosses the frequency of the externally applied field and shifts the impedance measured at the excitation coil. As the distance between the two sensors is known the PWV can be determined. The stiffer or the narrower a vessel is the higher is the PWV. A model based approach determines out of the PWV signal the restenosis degree inside the implanted stent. All further measurements are referenced to the first initial value done after the stent implantation. This approach is robust and has mean cross dependences because no absolute pressure measurement is required...|$|E
40|$|In case of {{vascular}} weakness or thrombosis stents are implanted and brace vessels {{from the}} inside to assure the proper blood flow. A widespread method to monitor the state of blood vessels {{in terms of their}} stiffness and diameter is to measure the pulse wave velocity (PWV). The stiffer or the narrower a vessel is the higher is the pulse wave velocity. At present no diagnosis method exists to determine the state of the implanted stent directly and non-invasive. In case of a reasonable suspicion catheterization for precise diagnosis is required. The new approach developed at Fraunhofer IPA allows measuring the PWV locally, so it can be applied in shorter intervals. This approach is based on inductive coupling. It consists of two passive units integrated into the stent and an extra-corporal detection unit. The passive units consist of a capacitive pressure sensor and an air-coil. They <b>form</b> <b>an</b> <b>oscillating</b> <b>circuit,</b> the resonance frequency of which functionally depends on the local blood pressure.

The short resonance leads to a shift in the impedance measured at the excitation coil. As the distance between the two sensors is known the PWV can be determined...|$|E

These identical daughter payloads contain sensitive structures which are exposed to the atmosphere. This structure consists of a grid, which surrounds an ion collector that is connected to a electrometer. The collector has a negative potential, the measured current at an electrometer is proportional to the ion density measurements. The grid is on plasma potential and retards the fast ions. At the same time a debye sheath evolves around the grid. The grid and the debye sheath builds a capacitor which is part of <b>a</b> <b>oscillating</b> <b>circuit.</b> Measuring the frequency of this circuit provides a relative measure of the electron density. An acceleration sensor inside each payload can be used to derive neutral gas density profiles from the Navier-Stokes equation. These neutral density profiles can be used to investigate possible correlations with the plasma densites. A GPS receiver on each subpayload provides in-situ horizontal information of all three physical quantities (electron, ion and neutral density) that hasn't been available in this scientific field before.

Compared with an unclamped amplifier, the noise figures for small signals are slightly improved due to the suppression of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the noise figure level is still considerably high due to the double-pass scheme and unoptimised splicing between a depressed cladding EDF and a standard single mode fiber.

40|$|Active Twist Rotor Blades for {{helicopter}} main rotors {{have been}} developed for the use in secondary control such as higher harmonic control (HHC) and individual blade control (IBC). The basic principle of such blades is the implementation of piezoelectric actuators into the blades causing the blades to twist. At the DLR such types of active twist blades have been designed for quite some years. Several model scale blades have been manufactured to demonstrate the feasibility of such systems. This paper presents a new set of rotor blades (4 m diameter) which is designed to go into a wind tunnel experiment within the ”STAR” consortium. In this paper it is discussed, what kind of other applications for such blades - equipped with piezoceramic actuators - can be considered. Besides the capability to twist at frequencies of 1 through 6 /rev, there is always the option of statically changing the pretwist of the blade, which will influence the figure of merrit. The idea is to use blade integrated actuators as part of electromechanical absorbers has been discussed recently. Using certain electrical networks, the structural behavior of the rotor blade can be significantly influenced. The effectiveness of such systems was experimentally investigated using a twist blade. In this paper results of a rotating blade with aerodynamic damping is shown for the first time. Different types of shunt networks have been investigated as presented before: At first <b>an</b> <b>oscillating</b> <b>circuit</b> was established coupling the capacitive piezoelectric actuators with an inductivity. If the setup is tuned right, this results in a significant decrease of the amplitues of a single frequency, e. g. torsional eigenfrequencies. In a next step a virtual ”negative capacity” was used to dissipate the vibrating energy in the electrical circuit. Such an element shows the same amplitude response as the capacity, but the phase is shifted by 180 deg compared to a ”regular capacity”. The advantage of this method is the effectiveness over a broad frequency range. That way several modes can be influenced at the same time. Finally, a first evaluation of the influence of these measures on the vibration level of a complete rotor was carried out...|$|R
