This simple, low cost and reliable mixer utilizes the large quantity of helium to provide stoichiometric combustor cooling, extend the throttling limits and enhance the combustion stability margin.

40|$|Two {{prototype}} bismuth propellant feed {{systems were}} constructed and operated {{in conjunction with}} a propellant vaporizer. One system provided bismuth to a vaporizer using <b>gas</b> <b>pressurization</b> but did not include a means to measure the flow rate. The second system incorporated an electromagnetic pump to provide fine control of the hydrostatic pressure and a new type of in-line flow sensor that was developed for accurate, real-time measurement of the mass flow rate. High-temperature material compatibility was a driving design requirement for the pump and flow sensor, leading to the selection of Macor for the main body of both components. Posttest inspections of both components revealed no degradation of the material. The <b>gas</b> <b>pressurization</b> system demonstrated continuous pressure control over a range from zero to 200 torr. In separate proof-of-concept experiments, the electromagnetic pump produced a linear pressure rise as a function of current that compared favorably with theoretical pump pressure predictions, producing a pressure rise of 10 kPa at 30 A. Preliminary flow sensor operation indicated a bismuth flow rate of 6 mg/s with an uncertainty of plus or minus 6 %.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to accurately predict the gas pressure, gas and solid temperature, as well as the amount of O-ring erosion inside the space shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) joints {{in the event of a}} leak path. The scenarios considered are typically hot combustion <b>gas</b> rapid <b>pressurization</b> events of small volumes through narrow and restricted flow paths. The ideal method for this prediction is a transient three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation with a computational domain including both combustion gas and surrounding solid regions. However, this has not yet been demonstrated to be economical for this application due to the enormous amount of CPU time and memory resulting from the relatively long fill time as well as the large pressure and temperature rising rate. Consequently, all CFD applications in RSRM joints so far are steady-state simulations with solid regions being excluded from the computational domain by assuming either a constant wall temperature or no heat transfer between the hot combustion gas and cool solid walls...|$|R

40|$|The {{propellant}} tanks used {{in liquid}} rockets require <b>pressurization</b> <b>gases</b> {{in order to}} maintain tank pressure while the tanks are being drained during engine operation. The <b>pressurization</b> <b>gas,</b> which is typically much warmer than the relatively cold propellants in the tank, must be introduced into the empty ullage space {{at the top of the}} tank. The purpose of the diffuser is to control the flow of the gas into the tank in order to prevent direct impingement of the gas on the liquid surface and/or the tank walls. If the diffuser did not perform those tasks, the warm gas can create excess heat transfer causing an increase in the amount of pressurization mass required. Typical diffusers are long vertical cylinders that create a large exit area in order to minimize gas velocities. However, long vertical cylinders limit the amount of liquid that can be loaded into the tank in order not to have the liquid surface near the diffuser. A design goal for a pressurization diffuser is to create uniform flow in order to prevent jets that can impact the liquid surface and/or tank walls. The purpose of the task was to create a diffuser design that had a lower vertical profile (in order to be able to raise the liquid surface) while still maintaining uniform flow...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Rainfall-triggered collapses of hot lava domes are {{described}} {{relative to the}} fluid overpressurization that accompanies the infiltration of rainfall into the carapace. Similar rainfall-triggered modes of failure are apparent for both hemispherical (endogenous) and lobate (exogenous) domes. Failure modes for these disparate geometries are linked by the necessary incursion of rainfall into the hot dome and the resulting impeded drainage of interior gas pressures – either self-generated by the vaporizing infiltration front, or the impeded drainage of interior pressurized gases. Limit equilibrium models are developed to assess the stability of idealized hemispherical or lobate domes, with driving forces generated by interior gas overpressures. For endogenous domes, shallow failures may develop {{in the absence of}} <b>gas</b> <b>pressurization</b> from the core, but observed deep-seated failures require that the free escape of conduit gases be impeded. For exogenous domes, failure is driven {{to the base of the}} lobe by the desire to maximize overpressures...|$|E

Gas hydrate in the studied core samples was found by observation to have developed in sediment pores, and the distribution of hydrate saturation in the cores imply that gas hydrate had experienced stepwise dissociation before it was stabilized by either liquid nitrogen or pressurizing gas. The gas hydrates were determined to be structure Type I hydrate with hydration numbers of approximately 6. 1 by instrumentation methods such as powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and solid state 13 C NMR. The hydrate gas composition was predominantly methane, and isotopic analysis showed that the methane was of thermogenic origin (mean d 13 C 48. 6 & and dD 248 & for sample HYLN 7).

Alternatively, if pressure is applied by an elastic garment vs. pneumatic garment to produce mechanical counter pressure (MCP), several advantages are possible. In this study, we investigate local microcirculatory and other effects produced with and without a prototype MCP glove and sleeve during exposure to varying levels of vacuum. METHODS: The entire arms of eight male volunteers were studied at normal ambient pressure and during 5 min exposures to - 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg with and without the MCP glove and sleeve. Pressure distribution, skin microvascular flow, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: The MCP glove and sleeve generated over 200 mm Hg on the middle finger, dorsum of the hand, and the wrist. However, pressure was significantly lower on the forearm and the upper arm. Without the glove and sleeve, only two of eight subjects tolerated - 100 mm Hg. Also, no subject tolerated - 150 mm Hg. However, subjects tolerated all vacuum pressures wearing the glove and sleeve. Skin microvascular flow and temperature remained within control values with the glove and sleeve at a chamber pressure of - 150 mm Hg. DISCUSSION: The MCP glove and sleeve counteracts adverse effects of vacuum exposures due to lower pressure differentials.
