40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study to what extent dying patients are aware <b>of</b> the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> death, whether such awareness is associated with patient characteristics, symptoms and acceptance of dying, and whether medical records and nurses' and family caregivers' views on patients' awareness of dying agree. Methods: Nurses and family caregivers of 475 deceased patients from three different care settings in the southwest Netherlands were requested to fill out questionnaires. The two groups were asked whether a patient had been aware <b>of</b> the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> death. Also, medical records were screened for statements indicating that the patient had been informed <b>of</b> the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> death. Results: Nurses completed questionnaires about 472 patients, family caregivers about 280 patients (response 59 %). According to the medical records, 51 % of patients had been aware <b>of</b> the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> death; according to nurses, 58 %; according to family caregivers, 62 %. Patients who, according to their family caregiver, had been aware <b>of</b> the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> death were significantly more often in peace with dying and felt more often that life had been worth living. Inter-rater agreement on patients' awareness of dying was fair (Cohen's kappa = 0. 23 - 0. 31). Conclusions: Being aware of dying is associated with acceptance of dying, which supports the idea that open communication in the dying phase can contribute {{to the quality of the}} dying process. However, views on whether or not patients are aware <b>of</b> the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> death diverge between different caregivers. This suggests that communication in the dying phase of patients is open for improvement...|$|R

A fundamental component of these signs is a signal-word panel {{located at the}} top of the sign. Certain colors and signal words in this panel are intended to convey information about a hazard, including likelihood <b>of</b> harm and <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> the threat. The purpose of this study was to determine if young adults without prior training on safety signs associate signal words and color with likelihood <b>of</b> harm and <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> the threat. The sample population consisted of 59 college students. Subject rated their impressions of ten signs using ordered rating scales. Results indicated that both signal word and color had highly significant effects on ratings for both likelihood <b>of</b> harm and <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> the threat...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{has three}} parts. Part I {{will discuss the}} {{existing}} legal framework established by the UN Charter governing the use of force. It questions whether this structure has succeeded in regulating state practice, and describes both the proposed reforms and the new international environment that prompted them. Part II criticizes the reforms 2 ̆ 7 response {{to the rise of}} rogue nations and international terrorism by emphasizing the legal doctrine <b>of</b> <b>imminence</b> and a recentralization of power in the UN Security Council. It argues that the concept <b>of</b> <b>imminence</b> does not make sense, and should be replaced by a cost-benefit analysis of expected harm. Part III addresses whether the reforms successfully grapple with contemporary international problems from the perspective of global welfare analysis. It argues that enforcing peace and security by eliminating rogue nations, pursuing terrorists, or ending human rights disasters supplies an international public good, and that UN reforms will suppress, rather than increase, the amount of needed intervention. Perversely, the UN reforms will have the effect of retarding international cooperation to solve the very problems they seek to prevent...|$|R

40|$|Defensive {{reactions}} need to {{be quick}} and appropriate to ensure survival. So, {{it is crucial that}} threats trigger immediate action upon detection, {{even in the absence of}} awareness. Also, the form of such action should be appropriate to the <b>imminence</b> <b>of</b> the threat. Thus, attention should be guided by signals <b>of</b> increasing threat <b>imminence.</b> We examined whether subliminally presented threat stimuli provoke automatic avoidance tendencies and whether threat cues’ distance change and threat potential determine attention allocation. Following fear conditioning, participants performed an approach-avoidance task with subliminally presented conditioned threat and safety stimuli and an attentional bias task with approaching versus distancing signals of threat and safety. Pre-attentive processing of threat cues resulted in approach rather than avoidance tendencies; attention was captured preferentially by signals <b>of</b> increasing threat <b>imminence.</b> The results support the importance <b>of</b> threat <b>imminence</b> and extend findings of previous research on pre-attentive influences on defensive responding. status: publishe...|$|R
