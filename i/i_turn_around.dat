This portion of the composition consists of eight-bar [...] "A" [...] sections and twelve-bar [...] "B" [...] sections, structured in an A-B-A-B pattern. The alap's lack of a distinct time signature is contrasted with a temporal reference in the lyrics to the opening verse: [...] "Each day just goes so fast / <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around,</b> it's past". Throughout, the vocal line avoids the melodic embellishment typical of khyal, apart {{from the use of}} melisma over the last line in each of the A sections. In keeping with the minimal harmonic movement of Indian music, the composition's only deviation from its I chord of C is a series of implied VII chord changes, which occur in the B sections.|$|E
