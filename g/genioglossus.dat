5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the <b>genioglossus</b> muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected <b>genioglossus</b> muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right <b>genioglossus</b> muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>genioglossus</b> {{is one of}} the paired {{extrinsic}} {{muscles of}} the tongue. The <b>genioglossus</b> is the major muscle responsible for protruding (or sticking out) the tongue.|$|E
50|$|This {{membrane}} receives, in front, some of {{the fibers}} of the <b>Genioglossi.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{anterior}} tongue is, at its apex (or tip), {{thin and}} narrow, it is directed forward against the lingual {{surfaces of the}} lower incisor teeth. The posterior part is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the hyoglossi and <b>genioglossi</b> muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis by three glossoepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the mucous membrane. It also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.|$|R

25|$|<b>Genioglossus</b> advancement, {{in which}} {{a small portion of}} the lower jaw that {{attaches}} to the tongue is moved forward, to pull the tongue away from the back of the airway.|$|E
25|$|The <b>genioglossus</b> is {{innervated by}} the {{hypoglossal}} nerve, as are all {{muscles of the}} tongue except for the palatoglossus. Blood is supplied to the sublingual branch of the lingual artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery.|$|E
25|$|The four {{extrinsic}} muscles {{originate from}} bone and {{extend to the}} tongue. They are the <b>genioglossus,</b> the hyoglossus (often including the chondroglossus) the styloglossus, and the palatoglossus. Their main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion, retraction, and side-to-side movement.|$|E
500|$|At a {{point at}} the level of the angle of the mandible, the {{hypoglossal}} nerve emerges from behind the [...] posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It then loops around a branch of the occipital artery and travels forward into the region beneath the mandible. The hypoglossal nerve moves forward deep to the hyoglossus and stylohyoid muscles and lingual nerve. It continues deep to the <b>genioglossus</b> muscle and continues forward to the tip of the tongue. It distributes branches to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscle of the tongue innervates as it passes in this direction, and supplies several muscles (hyoglossus, <b>genioglossus</b> and styloglossus) that it passes.|$|E
500|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve provides motor {{control of the}} extrinsic muscles of the tongue: <b>genioglossus,</b> hyoglossus, styloglossus, and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. These represent all muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle. [...] The {{hypoglossal nerve}} is of a general somatic efferent (GSE) type.|$|E
2500|$|Contraction of the <b>genioglossus</b> stabilizes and enlarges {{the portion}} of the upper airway that is most {{vulnerable}} to collapse. Relaxation of the <b>genioglossus</b> and geniohyoideus muscles, especially during REM sleep, is implicated in obstructive sleep apnea. Given this connection, the mandible can be pulled forward to maximise the airway space, and prevent the tongue from sinking backwards under anaesthesia and obstructing the airway.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>genioglossus</b> {{arises from}} the {{mandible}} and protrudes the tongue. It {{is also known as}} the tongue's [...] "safety muscle" [...] since it is the only muscle that propels the tongue forward.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Genioglossus</b> is the fan-shaped {{extrinsic}} tongue muscle {{that forms}} {{the majority of the}} body of the tongue. Its arises from the mental spine of the mandible and its insertions are the hyoid bone and the bottom of the tongue.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>genioglossus</b> {{is often}} used as a proxy to test the {{function}} of the hypoglossal nerve, by asking a patient to stick out their tongue. Peripheral damage to the hypoglossal nerve can result in deviation of the tongue to the damaged side.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{mandible}} fractures {{are usually}} the result of blunt force trauma to the head and face, other injuries {{need to be considered}} before the mandible fracture. [...] First and foremost is compromise of the airway. [...] While rare, bilateral mandible fractures that are unstable can cause the tongue to fall back and block the airway. [...] Fractures such as a symphyseal or bilateral parasymphyseal may lead to mobility of the central portion of the mandible where <b>genioglossus</b> attaches, and allow the tongue to fall backwards and block the airway. In larger fractures, or those from high velocity injuries, soft tissue swelling can block the airway.|$|E

5000|$|Hyo-mandibular {{advancement}} {{along with}} <b>genioglossus</b> advancement was originally described by in 1984. [...] Published clinical experience with hyoid suspension {{can be summarized}} into three different approaches to the hyoid suspension procedure: hyo-mandibular suspension, hyo-thyroid suspension, and <b>genioglossus</b> advancement and hyoid myotomy.|$|E
50|$|Tongue muscles (<b>genioglossus,</b> geniohyoid and others) are {{attached}} to the lower jaw below the teeth. During a <b>genioglossus</b> advancement procedure, the surgeon cuts a small window or bone cut in the front part of the lower jaw (mandible) {{at the level of the}} geniotubercle where the <b>genioglossus</b> muscle attaches. This piece of bone, along with the attachment for the tongue (genial tubercle) is pulled forward and subsequently secured to the lower jaw, usually with a single screw or with a plate and screws.|$|E
50|$|In <b>genioglossus</b> {{advancement}} and hyoid myotomy (GAHM), a <b>genioglossus</b> advancement {{is performed}} {{at the same time}} as either a hyo-mandibular or hyo-thyroid suspension. Potential complications and side effects from the procedure include lip and chin hypoanesthesia, seromas, edema, transient dysphagia and aspiration, and surgical site infection.|$|E

50|$|According to Horton et al., {{diagnosis}} of ankyloglossia may be difficult; {{it is not}} always apparent by looking at the underside of the tongue, but is often dependent on the range of movement permitted by the <b>genioglossus</b> muscles. For infants, passively elevating the tongue tip with a tongue depressor may reveal the problem. For older children, making the tongue move to its maximum range will demonstrate the tongue tip restriction. In addition, palpation of <b>genioglossus</b> {{on the underside of the}} tongue will aid in confirming the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{surgeons}} often perform maxillomandibular advancement surgery {{simultaneously with}} <b>genioglossus</b> advancement (tongue advancement). The <b>genioglossus</b> advancement pulls the tongue forward {{to decrease the}} amount of tongue blockage during sleep. MMA {{is one of the}} most effective surgical treatments for sleep apnea, with a high success rate. Nonetheless, the procedure is often used after other forms of treatment have failed (nasal surgeries, tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tongue reduction surgeries). There is a longer recovery when compared to other sleep apnea surgeries, since the bones of the face have to heal into their new position.|$|E
