40|$|Friction is an {{inevitable}} nonlinear phenomenon existing in servomechanisms. Friction errors often affect their motion and contour accuracies during the reverse motion.

40|$|Abstract — For control {{applications}} involving small displacements and velocities, <b>friction</b> {{modeling and}} <b>compensation</b> {{can be very}} important, especially around velocity reversal. We previously described single-state friction models {{that are based on}} elastoplastic presliding, something that reduces drift while preserving the favorable properties of existing models (e. g., dissipativity) and that provide a comparable match to experimental data. In this paper, for this class of models, discrete estimation for <b>friction</b> force <b>compensation</b> is derived. The estimator uses only position and velocity (not force) measurements and integrates over space rather than time, yielding a discrete-time implementation that is robust to issues of sample size and sensor noise, reliably renders static friction and is computationally efficient for real-time implementation.

In particular, the phenomena of stiction and presliding displacement (motion during sticking) can play pivotal roles. In this paper, it is shown that existing single-state-variable friction models possess either stiction or presliding displacement.

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 160 - 166) This research {{involved the}} design of a position control system, based on a new method of observer-adaptive <b>friction</b> <b>compensation,</b> for a fuel valve that controls the flow of gas in large turbines. This fuel valve is operated by a Permanent Magnet Synchronous (PMS) motor, which is attached to the gear box and coupling joint. These unsatisfactory position response problems that occur at start-up and during operation when the pressure difference (p) across the valve, and consequently the friction, is the greatest includes the following: high overshoots, high steady-state error, and limit-cycle exhibition during steady-state conditions. The deficiency of the linear-based control system of the PMS motor to compensate for the nonlinearity of the system, such as friction effect and flexibility of the coupling joint, is the major source of problems with this fuel valve.
