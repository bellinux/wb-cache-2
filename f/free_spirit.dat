5|$|In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger {{argued that}} the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will {{experience}} a rebirth of the innocence enjoyed by Adam and Eve before their fall. In his book The Millennium of Hieronymus Bosch, Fränger wrote that Bosch {{was a member of}} the heretical sect known as the Adamiteswho were also known as the Homines intelligentia and Brethren and Sisters of the <b>Free</b> <b>Spirit.</b> This radical group, active in the area of the Rhine and the Netherlands, strove for a form of spirituality immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.|$|E
5|$|Chizuru, nicknamed Chii-chan, {{is a tall}} {{girl who}} first appears as a classmate of Shuichi when they both enter junior high school. She is Momoko's {{childhood}} friend, and has a stylish demeanor, highlighted by her stature and long hair, which captivates both Shuichi and Yoshino when they first meet her. Chizuru {{is described as a}} <b>free</b> <b>spirit,</b> someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often outrageous things which surprise those around her; she frequently acts without thinking, and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone's friend, though Saori strongly dislikes her impulsiveness. Chizuru joins the girls' basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's <b>free</b> <b>spirit</b> and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a <b>free</b> <b>spirit</b> {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E
25|$|Maria Pavlovna's {{wedding to}} Prince William {{took place at}} Tsarskoe Selo in 1908, and then, she had {{departed}} for Sweden with her husband. Elizabeth Feodorovna stayed on for time at Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo as guests of the Emperor and the Empress. It was during this period that Dmitri began to form a close bond with Nicholas II, looking upon him as a surrogate father. He would join on him on his daily walks and seek {{to spend as much}} time with him as possible. Nicholas, in turn, treated Dmitri very kindly. He seems to have loved the young man's <b>free</b> <b>spirit</b> and sense of humor, a welcome diversion from the stresses of his daily life. Dmitri wrote several letters to his sister during his stay with Nicholas and Alexandra, describing how much he was enjoying himself there.|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{discussed the}} more complex psychological causes of Brandon's murder. Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder, and whether {{it was due to}} transphobia or homophobia: [...] "Ultimately in Boys , the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism, the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage." [...] Ebert called the film a [...] "sad song about a <b>free</b> <b>spirit</b> who tried to fly a little too close to the flame".|$|E

[...] After the tribe converges in slow-motion toward the stage, through the audience, they begin their celebration as children of the Age of Aquarius ("Aquarius").

She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so {{to meet her}} was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E

Because Highlander: The Series was an international co-production, the producers cast a French-speaking actor to play Tessa. Producer Gary Goodman explained that they wanted someone [...] "...that would be appealing on a television screen... {{in the sense that you}} were comfortable with her accent and her character".

5000|$|Importantly, Nietzsche {{attacks the}} false spirits {{who are the}} host of self-describing 'unbelievers' of modern times who claim to reject {{religious}} deception as scholars and philosophers and yet retain the traditional beliefs in good and evil, and truth. Nietzsche compares the genuine <b>free</b> <b>spirits</b> with the Assassins: [...] "When the Christian crusaders in the Orient came across that invincible order of Assassins - that order of <b>free</b> <b>spirits</b> par excellence whose lowest order received, through some channel or other, a hint about that symbol and spell reserved for the uppermost echelons alone, as their secret: [...] "nothing is true, everything is permitted". Now that was freedom of the spirit, with that, belief in truth itself was renounced." ...|$|R
500|$|Lemon's 26-year-old son, Jerry, {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in the fall of 1978, 10 days after Lemon won the World Series. The following season with the Yankees at 34–31, Lemon was fired in June by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin, but he remained with the organization as he had a contract through the 1982 season. Speaking of Martin, Lemon said, [...] "He's a very likeable guy, a <b>free</b> <b>spirit.</b> Where maybe I keep things inside, he lets them come out. There's nothing wrong with that." [...] The Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East (89–71). Lemon worked as a scout for the Yankees and received [...] "several offers" [...] from other teams to serve as manager. One offer came in 1979 from the Indians, but Lemon refused it as well as the others.|$|E
500|$|The editor's {{introduction}} of the 1874 memoir of Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke states that no individual church was preeminent in the Booth household during her childhood. Booth's mother was Episcopalian, and his father {{was described as a}} <b>free</b> <b>spirit</b> who was open to the great teachings of all religions. On January 23, 1853, the 14-year-old Booth was baptized at St. Timothy's Protestant Episcopal Church. The Booth family had traditionally been Episcopalian. Clergyman Charles Chiniquy stated that Booth was a convert to Roman Catholicism later in life. Historian Constance Head also declared that Booth was of this religion. She wrote the paper [...] "Insights on John Wilkes Booth from His Sister Asia's Correspondence" [...] (1982) published in the Lincoln Herald, in which she quotes from a letter of Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke, in which she wrote that her brother was a Roman Catholic.
