40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the issue whether developing countries forego chances in world manufactured markets by protecting <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> against market entry of new suppliers. By scanning the empirical literature on effective rates of protection (ERP), {{the evidence is}} supportive. Yet, it seems more the indirect effect via expanding the service sector in total through liberalization and deregulation than the direct effect of lowering ERP in intermediate service industries for downstream manufacturing industries which is relevant. Developed countries {{on the other hand}} enjoy a much lower level of protection in important <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> like banking and telecom and thus these industries can be instrumental to help downstream manufacturing industries in adjustment and restructuring. It is argued that especially in the EU competition in <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> will further rise due to various EU-policy rooted factors. As a result, protection rates of services in individual EU countries will converge. This paper presents a theoretical model of the labor market in which these effects can be analyzed. We then calibrate the model with respect to the German labor market to shed light on the relative strengths of these effects and thereby assess the degree to which low-wage subsidies encourage or discourage employmentTrade Liberalization, Services, Effective Rates of Protection...|$|E

Trade in <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> improves the quality of consumer services enormously in the periphery, but may reduce the quality at the centre. Trade in <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> also has a dramatic impact on skilled workers' wages in the periphery, both relative to unskilled workers in their own region and relative to skilled workers at the centre and leads to a more equal distribution of income both between the centre and the periphery and within the periphery...|$|E

3000|$|... fJust {{as there}} have been {{numerous}} attempts to define ‘services,’ there are equally numerous attempts to classify them, reflecting the great heterogeneity hiding behind this general label. It is particularly useful to make a distinction between consumer (or final) services and producer (or <b>intermediate)</b> <b>services.</b> Producer services are <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> provided to goods or other service producers. Their definition and demarcation is based on a function-based classification of services that was initially proposed by Greenfield (1966) and further developed by Browning and Singelmann (1975). However, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between producer services and consumer services; activities such as banking or transport services not only fulfill intermediate demand but also meet the needs of final consumers, even though they may emphasize the provision of services to one group or another (see for example Marshall et al. (1988)).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} research on efficiency gains for Russia from WTO membership concludes that service trade liberalization especially through allowing foreign suppliers {{to invest in}} Russian service industries promises the largest gains. This points to sizable efficiency deficits in the Russian service sector. This paper departs from the question whether both the Russian sectoral protection structure and the effective rates of protection (ERPs) differ from structures and rates in benchmark countries if tax equivalents for <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> are taken into account. The result is that almost all Russian service industries get effectively taxed and not protected once not only tax equivalents of intermediate goods but also those of <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> are included in ERP calculation. Variance among industries and peak taxes in service industries are significantly higher than in a median emerging country taken as benchmark. These findings support the key role of <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> liberalization {{for the expansion of}} a viable Russian service sector. Results from comparing Russian effective rates of protection with those of the EU accession countries Bulgaria and Romania are not inclusive. Tax levels of the two accession countries are also high and variant and thus cannot serve as a proxy for the “economic distance of Russia to Brussels”. Lessons for European Neighborhood Policy point to the requirement for the EU to liberalize bilateral service trade (through mode 3 supply: commercial presence) on a quid pro quo base: without opening EU markets for Russian companies in specific services (i. e., energy distribution), Russia will probably not open its service sector for EU suppliers more than is required in order to comply with minimum WTO accession prerequisites.
