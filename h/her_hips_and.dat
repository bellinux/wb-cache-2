500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "it's a little {{surprising}} that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't {{make the mistake of}} thinking this video is by any means straightforward— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red." [...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way of}} chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes." [...] He also compared Knowles' look to Page, as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video, calling it avant-garde and naughty.|$|E

50|$|In June 1993, Visser {{suffered}} a jogging accident in New York's Central Park {{in which she}} broke <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> skidded face-first across the pavement. She required surgery on <b>her</b> face <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> in 2006 she required an artificial hip replacement.|$|R

2500|$|Powell worked side by {{side with}} Fred Astaire and Peter Lawford in Royal Wedding (1951), when she was brought in to replace June Allyson, who had become pregnant, and then Judy Garland, who dropped out due to illness. According to film {{historian}} Robert Osborne, in a six-minute scene in the movie, Powell and Astaire match witty banter, sing, and dance in a performance that showcases the actress's energy and talent. [...] "We can also see her comic ability, in that number ," [...] Osborne said. [...] "She's hilarious—chewing gum, swinging <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> acting like a 'tough broad.' It's too bad MGM didn't capitalize more on her comedic side." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{changes in}} season two {{included}} a slight redesign (again by Donald Lee Feld, still credited as [...] "Donfeld") of Wonder Woman's uniform. The bustier was more flexible, featured less gold metal in the eagle wings {{in favor of}} red cloth background, and was cut lower to highlight Carter's décolletage and cleavage. The star-spangled bottoms were cut higher in the thighs, {{with the number of}} stars reduced, stopping below <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> rearranged in a more symmetrical starburst pattern. [...] The bracelets changed from dull silver-grey to bright gold, and were noticeably smaller and thinner. Her tiara, appearing unchanged when on Wonder Woman's head, would flatten to become a boomerang, and its ruby star functioned as a communications link to Paradise Island and her mother the queen.|$|E
2500|$|As Jordan, Price was {{famed for}} her surgically {{enhanced}} breasts. At 19 {{she had the}} first in a succession of breast-enhancement surgeries, increasing her natural 32B to a 32FF. Unhappy with her breasts from an early age and despite her family's objections, she went ahead with the procedure because she felt that, as a glamour model, she did not look [...] "as sexy or [...] womanly" [...] as other models. She has since had many enhancements, as well as reductions, on her breasts in addition to later having liposuction on <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> thighs, fat implanted into her lips to boost her pout, and a nose job. She told a reporter, [...] "Some people may be famous for creating a pencil sharpener. I'm famous for my tits." [...] Price was later barred from Page Three in The Sun with their adoption of a policy to only use [...] "all natural" [...] models.|$|E
50|$|On Thanksgiving Day in 1980, Lancefield broke <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> was {{not able}} to fully regain her mobility. She died the {{following}} year in 1981 at the age of 86.|$|R

60|$|Bostil's sister came in {{from the}} kitchen. She was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face. She had her hands on <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter.|$|E
60|$|Kells {{held the}} coat {{for her and}} she slipped into it. She seemed lost. It was long, coming way below <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> {{for the first time}} in days she felt she was Joan Randle again.|$|E
5000|$|Silver Spoon {{was a big}} {{chestnut}} filly {{with four}} white stockings, standing 16 hands one inch tall, and weighing 1,135 pounds. As a foal, she injured <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> forever after walked with a pronounced hesitation or [...] "hitch" [...] in her gait.|$|R

60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now {{put her hands on}} <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and,</b> like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, now we'll go home," [...] {{said the}} elder of the two, resting her {{knuckles}} upon <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> {{looking at their}} goings-on as a whole.

60|$|When he thus spoke we were come {{opposite}} a small, rude dwelling situate in {{one corner}} of a pasture wherein even a sheep would have found it difficult to satisfy its hunger, and in the door of this building stood a motherly looking old woman, her hands on <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> her eyes fixed on us in curiosity, as I fancied.|$|E
25|$|On November 27, 2002, Gabor was a {{front seat}} {{passenger}} {{in an automobile}} crash on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, from which she remained partially paralyzed and reliant on a wheelchair for mobility.

25|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his portraits, and his sitters {{including}} {{some of the most important}} men and women of his time.

Emmet's hand is on <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> she looks over her shoulder at the audience.|$|R
50|$|Jacqueline - Jacqueline {{is easy to}} {{spot with}} <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> savvy {{personality}} {{and is on the}} cutting edge of fashion. As Millicent's sneaky and competitive rival designer, she doesn't want to be trendy; she wants to start the trends herself and will do anything to get ahead. But eventually, she is reformed and blends in like Millicent, and apologizes for her behavior.|$|R
60|$|She {{was white}} to the lips, {{white as the}} gown which fell in {{straight}} heavy folds from <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> which Stoutenburg was still clutching with convulsive fingers. Alone her white figure detached itself from the darkness around. The wretched man as he looked up could see her small pale head, the stiff collar that rose above her shoulders, her embroidered corslet, and the row of pearls round her neck.|$|E
60|$|Bertha was clad {{in black}} also--a close-fitting, high-necked gown {{which made her}} fair skin shine like fire-flushed ivory, and her big serious eyes and vivid lips {{completed}} the charm of her singular beauty. Her bosom had {{lost some of its}} girlish flatness, but the lines of <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> thighs still resembled those of a boy, and the pose of her head was like that of an athlete.|$|E
6000|$|The {{waitress}} {{was instantly}} back with soup, {{and a collection}} of china gathered by a man of much travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha. She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch Mr. Boltwood's sleeve, brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips, picked for a while, gave it up, put her hands on <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> addressed Claire: ...|$|E
5000|$|Sarah was a semi-invalid for {{the last}} fifteen years of her life, after {{fracturing}} <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> arm in an accident at Linden Hall. [...] When Sarah died in 1936, a memorial service themed “The Ministry of Woman” was held at the Philip G. Cochran Memorial United Methodist Church. The service featured ministers speaking about female Biblical figures and about Sarah's life.|$|R
60|$|One night Smoke {{was awakened}} by a sound of struggling. Distinctly he heard a gasping and {{strangling}} from where McCan slept. Kicking the fire into flame, by its light he saw Labiskwee, her hands at the Irishman's throat and forcing from his mouth a chunk of partly chewed meat. Even as Smoke saw this, her hand went to <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> flashed with the sheath-knife in it.|$|R
60|$|At {{this change}} in his voice, Wolf lifted his head quickly, and still more quickly {{got to his feet}} when the man and woman shook hands. He sprang up on his hind legs, resting his fore paws on <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> at the same time licking Skiff Miller's hand. When the latter shook hands with Walt, Wolf {{repeated}} his act, resting his weight on Walt and licking both men's hands.|$|R
6000|$|True enough--I faint even as I {{write it}} in the living {{presence}} of that terrible recollection--she was shrivelling up; the golden snake that had encircled her gracious form slipped over <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> to the ground; smaller and smaller she grew; her skin changed colour, and {{in place of the}} perfect whiteness of its lustre it turned dirty brown and yellow, like an piece of withered parchment. She felt at her head: the delicate hand was nothing but a claw now, a human talon like that of a badly-preserved Egyptian mummy, and then she seemed to realise what kind of change was passing over her, and she shrieked--ah, she shrieked!--she rolled upon the floor and shrieked! ...|$|E
6000|$|And then {{faster and}} faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out {{in the air and}} then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, {{cracking}} his whip and shouting [...] "Hi!--hi!" [...] and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.|$|E
60|$|An {{old man was}} dozing in a great hooded {{chair in}} the hall. He lit a candle {{in the office and}} went before them to the stairs. They {{followed}} him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.|$|E

50|$|In December 2008, Jean sent Terry a postcard, {{telling him}} she'd split {{with her boyfriend}} Mohammed and asking if he and T.J. wanted to join her for Christmas. While they were with Jean, a small taxi ran into <b>her,</b> {{bruising}} <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> breaking <b>her</b> leg, so Terry and T.J. extended their stay. On 21 January 2011, T.J. is sent to live with Jean in Morocco permanently after Terry is killed in an arson attack.|$|R
50|$|Despite her retirement, Glass then {{served on}} the federal Loyalty Review Board, based in Washington, D.C., and {{traveled}} to hearings throughout the country until 1953. She was an active Democrat, and also was an actress in local theater productions in Charlottesville. At age 74, she interrupted her retirement to serve as temporary principal of Stuart Hall School in Staunton, Virginia after Nan Powell Hodges broke <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> asked for emergency assistance.|$|R
