5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age <b>in</b> <b>women</b> than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke <b>in</b> <b>women</b> under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke <b>in</b> <b>women</b> exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher <b>in</b> <b>women</b> than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype {{is more common in}} people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more common <b>in</b> <b>women,</b> and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common <b>in</b> <b>women</b> than in men. In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the menstrual cycle {{is about the same}} length in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days <b>in</b> <b>women</b> aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days <b>in</b> <b>women</b> aged 40–44).|$|E

5|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} or spotting <b>in</b> <b>women</b> {{after menopause}} occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma, occurring in {{two-thirds of all}} cases.

5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association <b>in</b> <b>women.</b> The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common <b>in</b> <b>women</b> than men. <b>In</b> <b>women,</b> {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression <b>in</b> <b>women</b> have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less <b>in</b> <b>women</b> than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust <b>in</b> <b>women,</b> he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths <b>in</b> <b>women</b> in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots. Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended <b>in</b> <b>women</b> over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done <b>in</b> <b>women</b> with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function <b>in</b> <b>women</b> with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{are either}} {{directly}} caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. The strength {{of the link between}} obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases <b>in</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility <b>in</b> <b>women.</b> Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} <b>in</b> <b>women</b> {{during two}} {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. <b>In</b> <b>women</b> suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
