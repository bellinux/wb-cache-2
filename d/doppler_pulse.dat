40|$|SUMMARY Meteor {{storms and}} showers are now {{considered}} as poten-tial hazard {{in the space}} environment. Radar observations of meteors has an advantage of a much higher sensitivity over optical observations. The MU radar of Kyoto University, Japan has a unique capability of very fast beam steerability {{as well as a}} high sensitivity to the echoes from ionization around the meteors. We developed a special observation scheme which enables us to determine the orbit of individual meteors. The direction of the target is determined by comparing the echo intensity at three adjacent beams. The <b>Doppler</b> <b>pulse</b> compression technique is applied to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the echoes from the very fast target, and also to determine the range accurately. The developed scheme was applied to the observa-tion made during the Leonid meteor storm on November 18, 1998 (JST). Estimated orbital distribution seems to suggest that the very weak meteors detected by the MU radar are dominated by sporadic meteors rather than the stream meteors associated with the Leonids storm. key words: meteor observation, MU radar, orbit determination, <b>Doppler</b> <b>pulse</b> compression, space environmen...|$|E

We investigated myocardial perfusion using real-time quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography with concurrent assessment of macrovascular and microvascular endothelial damage/dysfunction in patients with previous malignant hypertension (but now in stable phase), who were compared with patients with treated “high-risk ” hypertension (hypertension) and healthy controls. We measured flow (hyperemia) -mediated dilation and response to glyceryl trinitrate of brachial artery (ultrasound), microvascular (forearm) response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (laser <b>Doppler),</b> <b>pulse</b> wave velocity, circulating endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells in 15 patients with malignant hypertension, 40 matched patients with hypertension, and 40 healthy controls.

40|$|Hepatic artery {{thrombosis}} after liver transplantation is {{a devastating}} event requiring emergency retransplantation in most patients. Early clinical signs are often nonspecific. Before duplex sonography (combined real-time and pulsed Doppler) capability was acquired in October 1984, 76 % of all transplants in this institution referred for angiography with a clinical suspicion of hepatic artery thrombosis had patent arteries. In {{an effort to}} reduce the number of negative angiograms, CT, real-time sonography, and pulsed Doppler have been evaluated as screening examinations to determine which patients need angiography. Of 14 patients with focal inhomogeneity of the liver architecture detected by CT and/or real-time sonography, 12 (86 %) had hepatic artery thrombosis, one had slow arterial flow with hepatic necrosis, and one had a biloma with a patent hepatic artery. In 29 patients undergoing duplex sonography of the hepatic artery, six (21 %) had absence of a Doppler arterial pulse. All six had abnormal angiograms: Four had thrombosis, one had a significant stenosis, and one had slow flow with biopsy-proven ischemia.

40|$|SUMMARY In {{order to}} assess the {{possible}} impacts of meteors with spacecraft, which is among major hazard in the space environment, {{it is essential to}} establish an accurate statistics of their mass and velocity. We developed a radar-optical combined system for detecting faint meteors con-sisting of a powerful VHF Doppler radar and an ICCD video camera. The <b>Doppler</b> <b>pulse</b> compression scheme is used to enhance the S/N ratio of the radar echoes with very large Doppler shifts, as well as to determine their range with a resolution of 200 m. A very high sensitivity of more than 14 magnitude and 9 magnitude for radar and optical sensors, respectively, has been obtained. Instantaneous direction of meteor body observed by the radar is determined with the interferometry technique. We examined the optimum way of the receiving antenna arrangements, and also of the signal processing. Its absolute accuracy was confirmed by the optical observations with background stars as a reference. By combining the impinging velocity of meteor bodies derived by the radar with the absolute visual magnitude de-termined by the video camera simultaneously, the mass of each meteor body was estimated. The developed observation system will be used to create a valuable data base of the mass and velocity information of faint meteors, on which very little is known so far. The data base is expected to {{play a vital role in}} our understanding of the space environment needed for designing large space structures. key words: meteor observation, MU radar, ICCD video camera, sensor fusion, space environment 1...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate those factors associated with popliteal artery injury that influence amputation, with emphasis placed on those that the surgeon can control. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Generally accepted factors impacting amputation after popliteal artery injury include blunt trauma, prolonged ischemic times, musculoskeletal injuries, and venous disruption. Amputation ultimately results from microvascular thrombosis and subsequent tissue necrosis, predisposed by the paucity of collaterals around the knee. METHODS: Patients with popliteal artery injuries over the 10 -year period ending November 1995 were identified from the trauma registry. Preoperative (demographics, mechanism and severity of injury, vascular examination, ischemic times) and operative (methods of arterial repair, venous repair-ligation, anticoagulation-thrombolytic therapy, fasciotomy) variables were studied. Severity of extremity injury was quantitated by the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS). Amputations were classified as primary (no attempt at vascular repair) or secondary (after vascular repair). After univariate analysis, logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors for limb loss. RESULTS: One hundred two patients were identified; 88 (86 %) were males and 14 (14 %) were females. Forty injuries resulted from blunt and 62 from penetrating trauma. There were 25 amputations (25 %; 11 primary and 14 secondary). Patients with totally ischemic extremities (no palpable or <b>Doppler</b> <b>pulse)</b> more likely were to be amputated (31 % vs. 13 %; p < 0. 04). All requiring primary amputations had severe soft tissue injury and three had posterior tibial nerve transection; the average MESS was 7. 6. Logistic regression analysis identified independent factors associated with secondary amputation: blunt injury (p = 0. 06), vein injury (p = 0. 06), MESS (p = 0. 0001), heparin-urokinase therapy (p = 0. 05). There were no complications with either heparin or urokinase. CONCLUSIONS: Minimizing ischemia {{is an important factor in}} maximizing limb salvage. Severity of limb injury, as measured by the MESS, is highly predictive of amputation. Intraoperative use of systemic heparin or local urokinase or both was the only directly controllable factor associated with limb salvage. The authors recommend the use of these agents to maximize limb salvage in association with repair of popliteal artery injuries...|$|E

40|$|Spectral Doppler {{ultrasound}} imaging allows visualizing blood flow by estimating its velocity distribution over time. Duplex ultrasound is a modality {{in which an}} ultrasound system is used for displaying simultaneously both B-mode images and spectral Doppler data. In B-mode imaging short wide-band pulses are used to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in the images. In contrast, for <b>Doppler</b> imaging, narrow-band <b>pulses</b> are preferred in order to attain increased spectral resolution. Thus, the acquisition time must be shared between the two sequences. In this work, we propose a non-uniform slow-time transmission scheme for spectral Doppler, based on nested arrays, which reduces the number of pulses needed for accurate spectrum recovery. We derive the minimal number of Doppler emissions needed, using this approach, for perfect reconstruction of the blood spectrum in a noise-free environment. Next, we provide two spectrum recovery techniques which achieve this minimal number. The first method performs efficient recovery based on the fast Fourier transform. The second allows for continuous recovery of the Doppler frequencies, thus avoiding off-grid error leakage, {{at the expense of}} increased complexity. The performance of the techniques is evaluated using realistic Field II simulations, showing accurate estimation of the blood velocity spectrum using only 12 % of the transmissions. The time gained, where no <b>Doppler</b> <b>pulses</b> are sent, can be used to enable the display of both blood velocities and high quality B-mode images at a high frame rate...|$|R
