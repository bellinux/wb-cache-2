For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people.

Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals.

The objectives of this study are (1) to identify the clinical presenting features of T 2 DM in Thai children and adolescents, and (2) to identify evidence of feature of metabolic syndrome in these affected. We analyzed 26 T 2 DM patients who were treated by Pediatric endocri-nologists in our hospital. The study showed that their mean ages (+SD) at diagnosis was 12. 1 + 2. 3 years, all were obese and 96 % had acanthosis nigricans. Fifty three percents (53 %) presented with clinical signs and symptoms which included DKA (19. 2 %), clinical triad of polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss (15. 4 %), only polyuria, polydip-sia (11. 5 %) and abnormal menstruation (7 %).

5|$|The main {{documentary}} {{source for}} the kings of the Crovan dynasty is the Chronicle of Mann, the only contemporary indigenous narrative-source concerning these men. The source itself survives {{in the form of}} a fourteenth-century Latin manuscript, which is in turn a copy of a chronicle probably first commissioned and composed during the reign of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265). About <b>fifteen</b> <b>percent</b> of the chronicle is devoted to the strife between the half-brothers, and much of the rest of this source deals with the after-effects of the conflict. Although the chronicle's account of the half-brothers' struggle appears to be somewhat neutral, its treatment of their descendants is clearly slanted in favour of Óláfr's sons. In fact, it was only during the reign of Óláfr's son Magnús, that the former's sons finally overcame Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's descendants once and for all. The chronicle, therefore, may have been composed to further legitimise king's descended from Óláfr. In consequence, even the chronicle's claim that Óláfr's father had chosen him as his successor may be suspect. Whatever the case, the chronicle is the main historical {{source for the}} life of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{behavior}} of hydrogen atoms in boron films, {{which is one}} of candidate materials of the first wall of fusion devices, has been studied. Boron films were deposited on the whole inner surface of a liner, which acts as a large test piece with a surface area of 7000 cm^ 2. Hydrogen absorption behavior was investigated with the glow discharge in hydrogen. After a strong absorption into the near surface region, hydrogen atoms were slowly and continuously absorbed for 10 hours without saturation. A helium glow discharge was carried out after the hydrogen discharge to investigate hydrogen desorption by the He ion bombardment. <b>Fifteen</b> <b>percents</b> of the absorbed H atoms were desorbed. The strong absorption was observed at the initial phase of the hydrogen discharge after the He discharge due to the evacuation of the H atoms from the surface during the He discharge. The number of absorbed hydrogen atoms was larger than one desorbed during the He discharge, which indicates that hydrogen atoms accumulate in the film when the H_ 2 and He discharges are repeated alternately. The slow absorption is due to migration of hydrogen atoms deeper into the film enhanced by the ion bombardment. Depth profile measurements with elastic recoil detection (ERD) give a consistent result. Most of the retained hydrogen atoms were released by heating up to 400 degree C. A possibility of the boron films as a protection wall of tritium permeation is suggested. A calculation based on a simple model was discussed with the experimental results. A recombination coefficient was obtained through the calculation of the transient release of the H atoms just after the H_ 2 discharge. The time behavior at the initial phase of the He discharge was reproduced fairly well by assuming a smaller cross-section for ion induced detrapping. ...|$|R
