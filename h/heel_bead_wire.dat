30|$|Tire {{has gone}} through many stages of evolution, since it was {{developed}} first time about 100  years ago. In the beginning, solid rubber tires were used mostly for bicycles and horse-driven carts. First, John Dunlop made a tire which consist a tube mounted on a spoked rim. Then, in 20 th century {{with the arrival of}} motor vehicles, the use of pneumatic tires was started. The manufacturing process of tires begins with selection of rubber as well as other raw materials including special oils, carbon black, etc. These various raw materials are shaped with a homogenized unique mixture of black color with the help of gum. The mixing process is controlled by the computerized systems to insure uniformity of the raw materials. Furthermore, this mixture is processed into the sidewall, treads, or other parts of the tire. The tire <b>bead</b> <b>wire</b> is used as a reinforcement inside the polymer material of the tire. <b>Bead</b> <b>wire</b> is made up of high carbon steel and the main function of bead is to grasp the tire on the rim. The <b>bead</b> <b>wire</b> of functional tire can work at pressures of 30 – 35 psi (Palit et al. 2015). <b>Bead</b> <b>wires</b> help to transfer the load of vehicle to the tire through the rim. Due to the increase demand of tires, maintaining the quality and reliable performance becomes priority. In addition, there is need for maintaining the quality in the era of technological advancements in design of pneumatic tires.|$|R

40|$|Issue: Tire {{recycling}} processes {{designed to}} reduce the rubber to small particle sizes result in the liberation of steel and fiber components of the tire. Generally, both the steel and the fiber are considered contaminants to the rubber particles {{and need to be}} removed to increase the value of the rubber. Scrap tires contain approximately 70 % rubber, 15 % steel, and 15 % fiber by weight. These percentages vary {{depending on the type of}} scrap tire. Best Practice: In general the best practice for the removal of both fiber and rubber is to remove the material as early in the process as possible. Steel tends to have an adverse effect on equipment longevity and the fiber tends to limit throughput of rubber through the process. Fiber, as it passes further through the system, becomes shortened to the extent that it becomes more difficult to remove from the rubber using commercially available equipment. Steel Removal. It is best to remove truck tire beads before any size reduction is done. Truck tire beads are extremely difficult to shred and cause significant equipment wear. Some operations choose to shred truck tires without removing the bead. Passenger tire <b>bead</b> <b>wire</b> is much easier to process and a cost/benefit analysis is required to determine if the benefits of removing the bead prior to size reduction outweigh the costs.
