25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This <b>grating</b> <b>pattern</b> is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the effect}} of a spatial context or {{temporal}} context, the perceived orientation of a test line or <b>grating</b> <b>pattern</b> can appear tilted away from its physical orientation. The tilt illusion (TI) is the phenomenon that the perceived orientation of a test line or grating is altered by the presence of surrounding lines or grating with a different orientation (spatial context; see Fig.1). And the tilt aftereffect (TAE) is the phenomenon that the perceived orientation is changed after prolonged inspection of another oriented line or grating (temporal context; see Fig.2).|$|E
50|$|Marrella {{itself is}} a small animal, 2 cm or less in length. The head shield has two pairs of long {{rearward}} spikes. On {{the underside of the}} head are two pairs of antennae, one long and sweeping, the second shorter and stouter. Marrella has a body composed of 24-26 body segments, each with a pair of branched appendages. The lower branch of each appendage is a leg for walking, while the upper branch is a long, feathery gill. There is a tiny, button-like telson {{at the end of the}} thorax. It is unclear how the unmineralized head and spines were stiffened. Marrella has too many antennae, too few cephalic legs, and too few segments per leg to be a trilobite. It lacks the three pairs of legs behind the mouth that are characteristic of crustacea. The legs are also quite different from those of crustaceans. The identification of a diffraction <b>grating</b> <b>pattern</b> on well-preserved Marrella specimens proves that it would have harboured an iridescent sheen—and thus would have appeared colourful. Dark stains are often present at the posterior regions of specimens, probably representing extruded waste matter.|$|E

30|$|As the {{evanescent}} {{waves from}} the object transmit through a nanopatterned superlens, the near-field {{image and the}} <b>grating</b> <b>pattern</b> are overlapped, generating a moiré pattern, an interference pattern created when two periodic or quasi-periodic patterns are superimposed [77, 78]. The spatial frequency of the moiré pattern {{is equal to the}} difference of the frequency of the evanescent wave and the <b>grating</b> <b>pattern.</b> Even if either the evanescent waves or the grating is not resolvable due to diffraction limit, the moiré pattern can be resolved if it has lower wavevector than the spatial resolution. Therefore, the near-field image can be numerically reconstructed by analyzing moiré fringes as long as the <b>grating</b> <b>pattern</b> is known [79]. Since period of the <b>grating</b> <b>pattern</b> is limited only by fabrication, not by diffraction, super-resolution which had been impossible before was realized [76].|$|E

The author developed a method of measuring grating acuity that corresponded to the maximum resolvable frequency for rectanglar spatial <b>grating</b> <b>patterns</b> with the constant contrast. This grating acuity reflects the linear response of high frequency spatial vision, and the method was applied {{for the evaluation of}} visual fatigue.

This thesis characterizes the {{minimum resolvable feature}} size and process latitude of Conformable Contact Lithography. Beginning with a review of current lithographic patterning techniques, choice of Conformable Contract Lithography as an exposure technique is discussed. A design for a trilayer stack that optimizes optical properties is established using experimental and simulated reflectance data to choose appropriate stack film thicknesses. The simulated process latitude is constructed using electromagnetic simulations of <b>grating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Image analysis of experimentally-exposed diffraction <b>grating</b> <b>patterns</b> is described and used to characterize the effect of exposure dose on printed linewidth. The resulting simulated and experimental process latitudes for printed gratings are presented for masks utilizing protruding chrome lines and embedded chrome lines. Experimental and simulated reflectance for single-layer and bilayer film stacks are compared to yield an optimized trilayer stack design of 225 nm of anti-reflection-coating chemically separated from the resist by 70 nm of evaporated silicon oxide. This design results in less than 1. 5 % back-reflection from the oxide into the resist for 10 % film thickness variation. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are optimized by comparing higher variable-resolution, more realistic simulations to more efficient, lower variable-resolution simulations. Building on the trilayer stack and optimal simulation specification, simulated exposures of diffraction gratings are analyzed assuming a clipping model of development. Exposures of dense <b>grating</b> <b>patterns</b> with two geometries are performed on trilayer-stack-coated silicon wafers {{for a range of}} doses. (cont.) Transferred <b>grating</b> <b>patterns</b> are analyzed to establish the effect of exposure dose on printed linewidth. A 5 % experimental process latitude is achieved at a printed linewidth tolerance of ± 15 % for the embedded chrome mask exposures and of 25 % for the protruding chrome mask exposures. Within the resist, contrast is higher at smaller gratings using the embedded mask. by Corey Patrick Fucetola. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Across experiments aftereffect duration was greatest when adapting motion and test pattern both were presented with zero disparity and in the plane of fixation.

Both age groups could discriminate a set of components in square-wave-phase (fundamental 0. 18 c/deg) from components of the same amplitude combined in random phase. However, these compounds differ in peak-to-trough contrast, which infants of both ages could discriminate even for a constant waveform. When contrast was randomized from presentation to presentation, the older group still demonstrated discrimination, implying that they were sensitive to the pattern differences, but the younger group did not. The younger group also failed to demonstrate discrimination between the two waveforms when they were of fixed, matched, peak-to-trough contrast, indicating that the previous absence of discrimination was not simply due to distraction by the contrast variations. We conclude that 1 -month-olds are insensitive to the configuration of these compound <b>grating</b> <b>patterns</b> even when they are capable of detecting their components.
