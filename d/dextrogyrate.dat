40|$|It {{has long}} been a {{research}} hotspot to diagnose atlanto-axial disorder by observing the shape and motions of atlanto-axial joints. The basis for correlative studies is to ascertain the normal anatomic features of atlanto-axial joints. In our study, 33 normal subjects were examined for atlanto-axial joints, by three-dimensional CT (3 D-CT) in functional positions (neutral, left and right rotary position). The contraposition between superior and inferior articular facets of lateral atlanto-axial joints (AFLAJ), including its shape and type, the width of rotational facets displacement (RFD), head's rotational angle (HRA) and rotational angle at C 1 - 2 (RAC(1 - 2)) were observed and measured on 3 D-CT images. In neutral position, a complete contraposition of AFLAJ was found in 25 subjects as well as a basic contraposition in 8. In rotary position, the width of RFD was between 6. 16 and 8. 68 mm, the angle of HRA was between 30. 2 degrees and 45. 8 degrees, and RAC(1 - 2) between 26. 7 degrees and 38. 9 degrees. There is no significant difference in RFD, HRA or RAC(1 - 2) (P > 0. 05) in between levorotatory and <b>dextrogyrate</b> orientation, and there is a positive correlation between RFD and RAC(1 - 2) (r = 0. 5078, P < 0. 05). Our study results show that the contraposition of AFLAJ can be clearly displayed by 3 D-CT, and complete or basic contraposition in neutral position and symmetry RFD, HRA and RAC(1 - 2) in rotary position, are the normal anatomic features of atlanto-axial joints...|$|E
