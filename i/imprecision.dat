5|$|In Shahîd's judgment, the <b>imprecision</b> and unemphatic tone of Eusebius' passage at 6.34 is {{the major}} cause {{of the lack of}} {{scholarly}} consensus on Philip's Christianity. To Shahîd, Eusebius' wording choice is a reflection of his own lack of enthusiasm for Philip's Christianity, which is in turn a reflection of the special position Constantine held in his regards and in his written work. A number of scholars, following E. Schwartz, believe the later editions of Eusebius' Historia to have been extensively revised to adapt to the deterioration of Licinius in the public memory (and official damnatio memoriae) after Constantine deposed and executed him in 324–25. Passages of the Historia incompatible with Licinius' denigration were suppressed, and an account of the last years of his life was replaced with a summary of the Council of Nicaea. Shahîd suggests that, in addition to these anti-Licinian deletions, Eusebius also edited out favorable notices on Philip to better glorify Constantine's achievement.|$|E

5|$|The {{family had}} reached a {{significant}} position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter's members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda's father, Vornic David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery. Proud of this tradition, it was her who insisted for her son {{to pursue a career}} in the Church. According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836. The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei). The <b>imprecision</b> also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor how many children they had together. At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as Nică, a hypocorism formed from Ion, or more formally as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru", occasionally Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei).|$|E

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{conversion}} (ADC) {{and uncertainties}} in modeling the plant dynamics {{are the main}} sources of <b>imprecisions</b> in the design cycle of model-based controllers. These implementation and model uncertainties should be addressed {{in the early stages}} of the controller design, otherwise they could lead to failure in the controller performance and consequently increase the time and cost required for completing the controller verification and validation (V&V) with more iterative loops. In this paper, a new control approach is developed based on a nonlinear discrete sliding mode controller (DSMC) formulation to mitigate the ADC <b>imprecisions</b> and model uncertainties. To this end, a DSMC design is developed against implementation <b>imprecisions</b> by incorporating the knowledge of ADC uncertainties on control inputs via an online uncertainty prediction and propagation mechanism. Next, a generic online adaptive law will be derived to compensate for the impact of an unknown parameter in the controller equations that is assumed to represent the model uncertainty. The final proposed controller is an integrated adaptive DSMC with robustness to implementation and model uncertainties that includes (i) an online ADC uncertainty mechanism, and (ii) an online adaptation law. The proposed adaptive control approach is evaluated on a nonlinear automotive engine control problem in real-time using a processor-in-the-loop (PIL) setup with an actual electronic control unit (ECU). The results reveal that the proposed adaptive control technique removes the uncertainty in the model fast, and significantly improves the robustness of the controllers to ADC <b>imprecisions.</b> This provides up to 60 % improvement in the performance of the controller under implementation and model uncertainties compared to a baseline DSMC, in which there are no incorporated ADC <b>imprecisions.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, ASME 2016 Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC...|$|R

High frequency oscillations due to chattering phenomena and sensitivity to data sampling <b>imprecisions</b> limit the digital implementation of conventional first order continuous-time SMC. Higher order discrete SMC is an effective solution to reduce the chattering during the controller software implementation, and also overcome <b>imprecisions</b> due to data sampling. In this paper, a new adaptive second order discrete sliding mode control (DSMC) formulation is presented to mitigate data sampling <b>imprecisions</b> and uncertainties within the modeled plant's dynamics. The adaptation mechanism is derived based on a Lyapunov stability argument which guarantees asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The proposed controller is designed and tested on a highly nonlinear combustion engine tracking control problem. The simulation test results show that the second order DSMC can improve the tracking performance up to 80 % compared to a first order DSMC under sampling and model uncertainties.

25|$|However, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to reliably define the territories of these groups due to the <b>imprecision</b> of the ancient geographical sources.

It is likely that, when Greco-Roman sources refer to conflicts with the Costoboci, Carpi or Goths, they are referring to coalitions of different groups under the currently hegemonic tribe. Given the Carpi's repeated raids South of the Danube and clashes with the Romans during the 3rd century, it is likely by ca. 230, the Carpi had extended their hegemony over eastern Wallachia, previously dominated by the Roxolani.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, {{developments}} in mathematics and the study of statics led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on the most stable form for these structures: the catenary curve. Robert Hooke, who first articulated that a thin arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. Wren's structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century. The ribs in Guarino Guarini's San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as catenary arches. The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with him. He also established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter-Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists. Because of the <b>imprecision</b> of oval domes in the Rococo period, drums were problematic and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives.|$|E

25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by <b>imprecision,</b> the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent {{in the nature of the}} resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Nijmegen (1678) and {{the earlier}} Treaty of Westphalia (1648) {{provided}} Louis XIV with {{the justification for}} the Reunions. These treaties had awarded France territorial gains, {{but because of the}} vagaries of the language (as with most treaties of the period) they were notoriously imprecise and self-contradictory, and never specified exact boundary lines. This <b>imprecision</b> often led to differing interpretations of the text resulting in long-standing disputes over the frontier zones – one gained a town or area and its 'dependencies', but it was often unclear what these dependencies were. The machinery needed to determine these territorial ambiguities was already in place through the medium of the Parlements at Metz (technically the only 'Chamber of Reunion'), Besançon, and a superior court at Breisach, dealing respectively with Lorraine, Franche-Comté, and Alsace. Unsurprisingly, these courts usually found in Louis XIV's favour. By 1680 the disputed County of Montbéliard (lying between Franche-Comté and Alsace) had been separated from the Duchy of Württemberg, and by August, Louis XIV had secured the whole of Alsace with the exception of Strasbourg. The Chamber of Reunion of Metz soon laid claims to land around the Three Bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and most of the Spanish Duchy of Luxembourg. The fortress of Luxembourg itself was subsequently blockaded with the intention of it becoming part of Louis XIV's defensible frontier.|$|E
