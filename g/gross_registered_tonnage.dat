50|$|<b>Gross</b> <b>register</b> <b>tonnage</b> (GRT) {{represents}} the total internal volume of a vessel, where one register ton {{is equal to}} a volume of 100 cubic feet (2.83168 m3), a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2,800 kg or 2.8 tonnes. The definition (and calculation) of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship's hold may be assessed for bulk grain (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for bales (omitting the spaces into which bulk, but not baled cargo, would spill). If V stands for the total internal volume in m3, then the GRT equals V / 2.83168, so for a ship of 10,000 m3 total internal volume, the <b>gross</b> <b>register</b> <b>tonnage</b> is 10,000 / 2.83168 = 3531.47 GRT. <b>Gross</b> <b>register</b> <b>tonnage</b> was replaced by gross tonnage in 1994 under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969, {{and is no longer}} a widely used term in the industry.|$|R
