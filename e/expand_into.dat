5|$|Butlin's funfair and {{amusement}} park business continued to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the post-war period. In 1938 he gained the sole contract to supply amusements to the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow {{and after the}} war, he continued to open {{amusement park}}s {{such as the one}} at Sheerness.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E

5|$|A {{party can}} <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> an alliance, {{with up to}} three parties combined, {{with a total of}} 18 players. Alliances are {{necessary}} to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, nation or territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item).|$|E
5|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} crop and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a diverticulum, or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E
5|$|The network {{began to}} <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> New Zealand in 1997, when {{a number of}} {{licences}} were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $3.6 million. Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting on 30 August 1998, with a nightly local news program in both Waikato and Christchurch. Prime also expanded into Argentina with {{the purchase of the}} Canal 9 network.|$|E

5|$|After also {{suffering}} financial {{losses and}} ownership struggles, the Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated {{the team to}} Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's attempts to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the southern United States. Initially replacing the Thrashers in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division, {{as part of a}} realignment to four divisions, the Jets were moved to the Western Conference's Central Division before the 2013–14 season. The Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were then assigned to the Eastern Conference's Atlantic and Metropolitan divisions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|All Star Pro-Wrestling was {{announced}} in January 1999 as part of Square's desire to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> more diverse game genres on the PlayStation 2 than their usual role-playing games. While DreamFactory developed most of Square's previous fighting games (namely Tobal No. 1, Tobal 2, and Ehrgeiz), Square decided to develop a wrestling game internally as Dream Factory was already working on The Bouncer, another Square title. The game was produced by Yusuke Hirata of Parasite Eve 2 fame, head of Square's Osaka-based fifth production team. The score, which was never released in album form, consists mostly of rock music and was composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Kenichiro Fukui, and Kumi Tanioka.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and {{to make it easier to}} <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E
50|$|Sekisui House (Sekisui Hausu) {{is one of}} Japan's largest homebuilders. It {{was founded}} in 1960 and is {{headquartered}} in Osaka.

5|$|Carlton Hill's {{pattern of}} {{development}} {{was defined by}} the long-established structure of land ownership around Brighton, whereby land was divided into long, narrow strips with many different owners. This encouraged the development of terraced housing—the predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and high-density rebuilding in the mid-20th century. This work introduced more open space and varied land uses: Brighton Art College was able to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the area, and American Express opened a large, visually dominant headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E

5|$|Máel Sechnaill died in 862, and his {{territory}} in Meath was split between two rulers, Lorcán mac Cathail and Conchobar mac Donnchada. Amlaíb and Ímar, now joined in Ireland by their younger brother Auisle, {{sought to make}} use of this change to extend their influence in the lands of the Southern Uí Néill. In 863 the three brothers raided Brega in alliance with Lorcán, and the following year Amlaíb drowned Conchobar at Clonard Abbey. Muirecán mac Diarmata, overking of the Uí Dúnchada, was killed by Vikings in 863, probably by Amlaíb and his kin trying to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> Leinster.|$|E
5|$|The new {{business}} model required additional capital. To this end, {{the company was}} sold to Banner Productions in 1965, with Gottschalk remaining as president. Panavision would soon <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> markets beyond Hollywood, eventually including New York, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. Kinney National Company bought out Banner in 1968 and took over Warner Bros.-Seven Arts the following year, eventually renaming itself Warner Communications due to a financial scandal. Kinney/Warner's financial resources made possible a massive expansion in Panavision's inventory, as well as substantial leaps in research and development.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for the league to enter the American market was discussed in 1987 when operators of the defunct United States Football League approached the CFL about merging the two leagues. The league showed little interest at the time, but as it continued its decline, the CFL reevaluated its position. In 1992, the CFL {{announced that it would}} <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the United States. The Sacramento Gold Miners joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup. The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 (with one team folding), but the initiative failed in most markets, and by 1996, the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada.|$|E

5000|$|Mormons also enslaved Indian {{prisoners of}} war. As they began <b>expanding</b> <b>into</b> Indian territory, they often had {{conflicts}} with the local residents. After <b>expanding</b> <b>into</b> Utah Valley, Young issued the extermination order against the Timpanogos, resulting in the Battle at Fort Utah, where many Timpanogos {{women and children were}} taken into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery. [...] After <b>expanding</b> <b>into</b> Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, {{the company}} built new {{factories}} and work also began on another new head office.

5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
5|$|Adamson {{continued}} the company's plans to <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> new markets such as universities, gas stations, airports and sports arenas {{with the intention}} of looking into new channels of distribution. Over the next year and a half he worked on a series of initiatives to strengthen the company; in a back to basics campaign, he oversaw a streamlining Burger King's menu and worked to improve and strengthen relations with franchisees. His changes were credited with a 28 percent increase in sales in BK's fiscal year 1995 and same store sales that were up 6 percent. He left in early 1995 when Denny's made him an offer to take the reins of the competitor; he left the company credited with fixing the deficiencies left by Gibbons and was temporarily replaced with David Nash. He was elevated to Chairman in July, with Robert Lowes as CEO. Lowes became chairman in November.|$|E
