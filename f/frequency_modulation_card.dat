Optimizing utilization of air conditioners and considering load response characteristics and customer comfort, the frequency adjustment model is a quadratic function model between the trigger temperature of the air conditioner compressor, and frequency variation is provided, which can be used to regulate the trigger temperature of the air conditioner when the micro-grid frequency rises and falls. This frequency adjustment model combines a primary <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> method and a secondary <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> method of the energy storage system, in order to optimize the frequency of a micro-grid.

40|$|Abstract—Different from {{traditional}} Fourier analysis, a signal can be decomposed into amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> components. The speech processing strategy in most modern cochlear implants only extracts and encodes amplitude modulation {{in a limited}} number of frequency bands. While amplitude modulation encoding has allowed cochlear implant users to achieve good speech recognition in quiet, their performance in noise is severely compromised. Here, we propose a novel speech processing strategy that encodes both amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> in order to improve cochlear implant performance in noise. By removing the center frequency from the subband signals and additionally limiting the frequency modulation’s range and rate, the present strategy transforms the fast-varying temporal fine structure into a slowly varying <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> signal. As a first step, we evaluated the potential contribution of additional <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> to speech recognition in noise via acoustic simulations of the cochlear implant. We found that while amplitude modulation from {{a limited number of}} spectral bands is sufficient to support speech recognition in quiet, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> is needed to support speech recognition in noise. In particular, improvement by as much as 71 percentage points was observed for sentence recognition {{in the presence of a}} competing voice. The present result strongly suggests that <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> be extracted and encoded to improve cochlear implant performance in realistic listening situations.

40|$|Abstract We {{exploit the}} impact of exact <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> on {{transition}} time of steering nuclear spin states from a theoretical point of view. 1 -stage and 2 -stage Frequency-Amplitude-Phase modulation (FAPM) algorithms are proposed in contrast with 1 -stage and 3 -stage Amplitude-Phase modulation (APM) algorithms. The sufficient conditions are further presented for tran-siting nuclear spin states within the specified time by these four modulation algorithms. It is demonstrated that transition time performance can be signif-icantly improved if exact <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> is available. It is exemplified that the transition time scale with <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> is about 1 / 4 of that without <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation.</b> It is also revealed in this research that the hy-brid scheme of 1 -stage FAPM and APM algorithms is better than all the four modulation algorithms.
