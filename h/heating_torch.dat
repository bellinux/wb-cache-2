40|$|Coupled fibers are {{successfully}} fabricated by injecting {{hydrogen flow}} at 1 bar and <b>heating</b> <b>torch</b> flame {{in the range}} of 800 - 1350 C. During the fusion process some optical parameters are not clear due to vary. For empirical and theoretical calculation, coupling coefficient and refractive index have been estimated from experimental result of coupling ratio distribution from 1 % until 75 %. The change in structural and geometrical of fibers affects normalized frequency even for single mode fiber. Coupling ratio as the function of coupling coefficient and separation of fiber axis also changes the normalized frequency at coupling region. The normalized frequency is derived from the radius, the wavelength and the refractive index parameters. Parametric variations are performed on the left and right hand side of the coupling region. At the center of the coupling region, coupling length splits the power to another fiber where the normalized frequency is assumed to be constant. A partial power is modeled and derived using normalized frequency (V), normalized lateral phase constant (u), and normalized lateral attenuation constant, (w) through the second form of modified Bessel function of the l order, which obeys the normal mode, LP 01 and normalized propagation constant (b). Total power is maintained constant in order to comply with the energy conservation law. The partial power gradient affected by V, u and w are integrated along z direction coupling region. The model is solved over the pulling length {{in the range of}} 7500 - 9500 Î¼m for 1 -D where the radial and angle directions were ignored for a scalar magnitude. The core radius of fiber significantly affects normalized frequency and power partially at coupling region rather than wavelength and refractive index of core and cladding. This model can be compared to application of power transmission and reflection of coupled fibers in industrial application...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} better HEPA filter materials, {{especially}} those able to withstand higher temperatures as experienced in fire conditions. In order to test these materials our team built a Mini High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) that can rapidly, efficiently, and inexpensively test a large number of new and innovative materials for HEPA filter components. MHTTU test results will be used to down select the most promising materials for HEPA filter components (e. g., media, sealants, gaskets) for full scale testing in the HTTU. There are already some pieces of equipment that exist {{in other parts of the}} country that produce similar effects, but do not fulfil our specific needs of 1300 °F air at the low flow rates of 1. 25 - 12 ACFM. Our attempts to source heaters were iterative due to the difficult nature of finding items that fulfilled both extreme specifications. The design decided upon pre-testing involved using two individually operating heaters, one for each end of flow regime. After initial testing, the immersion heater, originally intended solely for the low range of flows proved better able to handle our complete range than the higher flow <b>heat</b> <b>torch.</b> With the current design, we were only able to reach a temperature of 1116 F, but we were able to meet all of our other specifications, including flow rates, warm up time, and differential pressure drop across the test section.

5000|$|Preformed {{thermoplastic}} pavement markings (sometime called [...] "tape", {{but not to}} {{be confused}} with preformed polymer tape) are thermoplastic cut into the final shapes by the manufacturers and ready to position onto an asphalt or concrete pavement surface. Preformed thermoplastics are put into place on the road surface and applied using a propane <b>heat</b> <b>torch.</b> Some models require heating the road surface prior to the placement of the preformed thermoplastics. These markings are used primarily because of their durability and cost-effective service life. Since the plastics are melted into the surface, they are not easily damaged by the snowplows.

The most common applications of preformed thermoplastic pavement markings are found at intersections as transverse markings such as stop lines, legends, crosswalks, arrows, bike lane symbols, and accessibility symbols.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} {{to carry out}} the {{elemental}} determination of metals in bioethanol through ICP-OES has been developed. The procedure is based on the use of a <b>heated</b> <b>torch</b> integrated sample introduction system (hTISIS) to directly introduce the vaporized sample into the plasma. Two injection modes (continuous liquid aspiration and air-segmented flow injection analysis) have been evaluated. In a first step, the matrix effects caused by several ethanol–water mixtures were removed by operating the hTISIS at 400 °C in segmented injection. Meanwhile, the results also proved that the system could be operated in continuous mode at 200 °C with the complete interference removal. Finally, twenty-eight real samples with bioethanol contents between 55 % and 100 % were analyzed with the methods previously developed. Regarding validation, recoveries from 80 % to 120 % were obtained for 18 analytes and the concentrations found with the proposed method were in agreement with those encountered with a preconcentration method, taken as a reference procedure. Limits of detection went from 3 ng mL− 1 for manganese to about 500 ng mL− 1 for calcium. This allowed to quantify Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn in segmented flow injection and Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn in continuous sample aspiration mode in bioethanol samples.

40|$|A <b>heated</b> <b>Torch</b> Integrated Sample Introduction System (hTISIS) {{has been}} applied to the {{analysis}} of petroleum products and biofuels through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Three elements have been determined because of their importance in the petroleum industry: V, Ni and Mn. Sample injection has been accomplished by means of the introduction of a low sample volume (2. 5 μl) into an air carrier stream. A peak has been thus obtained. Two sets of samples have been selected: five solvents (xylene, kerosene, nonane, undecane and hexadecane) and five real samples (biodiesel, diesel, kerosene, superethanol and gasoline). The chamber temperature has been varied when introducing either solvents or real samples. In both cases it has been found that sensitivity peaked at 110 °C heating temperature. However, non-spectral interferences caused by differences in the matrix composition became less severe as this variable was increased and they were virtually eliminated at temperatures of 150 °C (alkanes) and 200 °C (real samples). When comparing with a default spray chamber (i. e., conical chamber with an impact bead) 3 to 6 times lower LODs were obtained. At 150 °C, this parameter has taken values of approximately 80 ng l− 1 for V and Ni to 140 ng l− 1 for Mn. At 200 °C heating temperature it has been possible to carry out accurate ICP-MS determinations by applying external calibration. Additional advantages of the present approach were that no oxygen was required to avoid soot deposition at the sampler cone and that nickel, instead of platinum cones, was used...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} performing Sr isotope ratio measurements at 15 μL min- 1 (continuous flow, for 300 μL large samples) by multi-collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry using a <b>heated</b> <b>torch</b> integrated spray chamber (TISIS) was possible {{at the same level}} of uncertainty as for measurements at 200 μL min- 1 (using a mini-cyclonic chamber). The objective of the current work was to achieve the same performance when working below 10 μL min- 1, and to further reduce the sample consumption to no more than 100 μL. The TISIS was modified to allow the additional introduction of a sheathing gas flow, and a semi-automated system was developed using syringe pumps and multi-ports valves for the sample delivery. The influence of the liquid flow rate, of the combinations of gas flow rates and of the temperature of the TISIS on different figures of merit was studied, and the relative combined uncertainty (k= 2) on measurement results was estimated for the method validation. The signal stability was brought to less than 5 % relative standard deviation at sample flow rates as low as 5 μL min- 1. 7 μL min- 1 was indentified as a threshold below which the exponential model used to correct for mass discrimination effects cannot be applied without the need to account for a relative bias of more than 200 parts per million, 'ppm' (500 'ppm' at 5 μL min- 1). The best compromise corresponded to 9 μL min- 1 when heating the spray chamber walls at 65 ºC. It required 2. 6 times less analyte overall compared to the results at 15 μL min- 1, the repeatability on the 87 Sr+/ 86 Sr+ ratio measured in the SRM 987 was around 40 'ppm' (and around 20 ‘ppm’ after internal correction with the 88 Sr+/ 86 Sr+ ratio, from the application of the exponential model), and relative combined uncertainties (k= 2) on stand-alone results were around 180 ‘ppm’ at maximum. This method may be particularly useful for samples only available in small sizes and/or not allowing any dilution, and will depend in particular on the analyte mass fraction and the target uncertainty of the application.
