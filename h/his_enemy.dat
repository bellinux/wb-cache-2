Hill <b>his</b> <b>enemy.</b> Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.|$|E

5|$|Lucullus was {{astonished}} upon hearing {{this in the}} year 70, {{and he began to}} prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia.

5|$|After Groenlo was secured, Mondragón marched {{south to}} Rheinberg {{to cover the}} town from a Dutch attack. He encamped his army near Wesel, at Dinslaken, while Maurice {{followed}} him and took up positions at Bislich, both armies being separated by the Lippe river. The Spanish position was strong; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe {{and a range of}} moorland hills called Testerburg. For several weeks both armies looked at each other, often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage. As time passed, the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp. Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondragón's foraging convoy aiming to lure him into a general action in which he could destroy the Spanish army. Mondragón also hoped to lure <b>his</b> <b>enemy</b> into a trap.|$|E
5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up facing <b>his</b> <b>enemy,</b> instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E

5|$|Orhan, the Ottoman Turkish {{prince of}} Bithynia {{was married to}} Theodora, {{daughter}} of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. The Greek clergy believed that the marriage of a Christian princess and a prominent Muslim would increase the region's power. Orhan already had several other wives, and although Theodora was permitted to keep her religion, she was required {{to spend the rest}} of her life in an Islamic harem. Kantakouzenos hoped that Orhan would become his ally in any future wars, but Orhan, like his fellow Turks, became <b>his</b> <b>enemy</b> in the Genoese war. As part of the alliance, the Ottoman prince was permitted to sell the Christians he had captured at Constantinople as slaves in the public market.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{original}} negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military {{campaign against the}} Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, signing a truce with <b>his</b> <b>enemy</b> Sultan Mesud I. This was done so that Manuel {{would be free to}} concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the First Crusade and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on Constantinople. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but they were restrained by Louis.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{returned}} from Poland and defeated the invaders with Polish assistance at Cătlăbuga Lake in November. He again confronted the Ottomans at Șcheia in March 1486, {{but could not}} recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă. He narrowly escaped with his life, reportedly after being helped by the Aprod Purice, whom tradition identifies as patriarch of the Movilești family. Historian Vasile Mărculeț agrees with Ottoman sources in noting that that Șcheia was not a military victory for Moldavia, but overall a relative success for <b>his</b> <b>enemy,</b> Skender Pasha. Moldavians reported winning the day only because they narrowly avoided disaster; and because Hronoda, recognized a voivode by dissenting boyars, was captured and beheaded. In the end, Stephen signed a three-year truce with the Porte, promising to pay the yearly tribute to the Sultan.|$|E
