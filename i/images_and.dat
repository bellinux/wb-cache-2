40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{multimodal}} convolutional neural networks (m-CNNs) for matching <b>image</b> <b>and</b> sentence. Our m-CNN provides an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures to exploit image representation, word composition, and the matching {{relations between the}} two modalities. More specifically, it consists of one image CNN encoding the <b>image</b> content, <b>and</b> one matching CNN learning the joint representation of <b>image</b> <b>and</b> sentence. The matching CNN composes words to different semantic fragments and learns the inter-modal relations between <b>image</b> <b>and</b> the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the matching relations between <b>image</b> <b>and</b> sentence. Experimental results on benchmark databases of bidirectional <b>image</b> <b>and</b> sentence retrieval demonstrate that the proposed m-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary for <b>image</b> <b>and</b> sentence matching. Specifically, our proposed m-CNNs for bidirectional <b>image</b> <b>and</b> sentence retrieval on Flickr 30 K and Microsoft COCO databases achieve the state-of-the-art performances.

40|$|The current {{research}} on relationship management primarily focuses on enhancing customer relationships through image or reputation in organisations. The resource-based theory portrays <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation as important intangible {{resources that are}} derived from combinations of internal investments and external appraisals. With this in mind, the role of <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation in value creation needs to be carefully delineated. In non-profit settings, stronger <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation are likely associated with higher quality of goods and services, better delivery of those goods and services, improved management of donations and funds, and improved outcomes (e. g., higher capability {{to make a difference}} in societies). Following a critical analysis of current literature with relevant examples, this paper argues that <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation are the keystones of non-profit organisations’ differentiation strategy. The resource-based theory suggests that resource factors represent a stronger explanation of differences in firm performance. Organisations are more likely to grow and develop higher performance potential if more resources are invested in <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation. By integrating several disparate resources, <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation as intangible resources can become more difficult to imitate and provide a more sustainable source of competitive advantage in organisations. Thus both <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation are likely influential elements that assist non-profit organisations in developing and managing relationships with external stakeholders, and thereby aid organisations in attracting important resources such as donations and volunteer support. The study findings contribute to the more general understanding of <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation from a relationship management perspective in the non-profit context. Thus, the paper adds a new dimension to the body of literature by arguing that <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation can be utilised as relationship management tools in non-profit organisations. However, <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation are external to organisations and volatile in nature. Non-profit managers must strategically develop relationship management activities in their organisations, with <b>image</b> <b>and</b> reputation being central...|$|R
