25|$|The diesel {{version of}} the TRAXX {{platform}} was introduced with the 2E {{version of the}} TRAXX platform. In the diesel version, the fuel tank occupies the same space as the transformer in the electric versions, centrally and below the main <b>frame</b> <b>members.</b> Installed motor power is 2.2MW. The diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives share the same driver cabin and control desk, body, bogies, and drive system. The maximum tractive effort is slight reduced by 30kN to 270kN due to the lower power of the diesel engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is obviously a replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 2001 and {{produced}} until 2017,the VRSC muscle bike family bears {{little resemblance to}} Harley's more traditional lineup. Competing against Japanese and American muscle bikes in the upcoming muscle bike/power cruiser segment, the [...] "V-Rod" [...] makes use of an engine developed jointly with Porsche that, {{for the first time}} in Harley history, incorporates overhead cams and liquid cooling. The V-Rod is visually distinctive, easily identified by the 60-degree V-Twin engine, the radiator and the hydroformed <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> that support the round-topped air cleaner cover. The VRSC platform was also used for factory drag-racing motorcycles.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeep box-type beams, {{consisting}} of <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> and sheathings, {{are sensitive to}} shear deformations and hence appropriate refined theories or complicated magnification factors are needed {{to be used to}} obtain accurate results. For sheathings or webs between the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> that are weak in shear, additional shear deformations occur corresponding to the relative axial displacement between the <b>framing</b> <b>members.</b> These sandwich -type or partial interaction-type of in-plane shear behaviour between the <b>framing</b> <b>members,</b> needs to be taken into account, especially when the web shear stiffness is very low. The composite box-type beam treated here is composed of three <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> with sheathings on both sides. To incorporate effects of the sheathings shear deformations between the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> on the deflection, the sheathings, here called web interlayers, are modelled as shear media with equivalent slip moduli corresponding to a partially interacting composite beam model. Governing equilibrium equations of the model are obtained using the minimum total potential energy principle and solved explicitly. The obtained results are compared with those based on different conventional beam theories and 3 -D finite element (FE) simulations. It is shown that the model is capable of predicting accurately the deflection {{for a wide range of}} geometry and property parameters. It is demonstrated that the deflection of such deep box-type beams can be expressed as the summation of three different effects, namely bending deformations, conventional shear deformations in the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> and sheathings, and additional in-plane shear deformations or shear slips of the weak web causing relative axial displacements between the <b>framing</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R
50|$|The display {{consists}} of an LED display apparatus including multiple LED display modules, an inner <b>frame</b> <b>member,</b> and a supporting unit. The LED display module has an array of light emitting diodes mounted thereon, and a longitudinal axis. The inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> is disposed to confine the LED display module therein, and has a size sufficient to permit movement of the LED display module in opposite directions of the longitudinal axis. The supporting unit mounts the LED display module in the inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> such that the LED display module is movable {{back and forth in}} the inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> along the longitudinal axis. As the drum spins, the system controls the lighting of each pixel at a precise location to produce a visible image.|$|R

2500|$|Despite these similarities, a {{spokesman}} from Honda R Americas stated that 50% of the Honda Pilot's chassis components {{had to be}} changed or strengthened {{for use in the}} second generation Ridgeline. [...] The C-pillar and rear sub-frame mounts had to be strengthened as well giving the second generation Ridgeline 28% more torsional rigidity over the first generation Ridgeline. [...] According to one of the Ridgeline’s body development engineers, [...] "Utilizing fully boxed <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> for the body sides and rear tailgate frame, the truss-style rear inner construction contributes to the new Ridgeline’s more conventional three-box design profile allowing for the elimination of the buttress-style body structure" [...] of the first generation Ridgeline.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elementary}} {{mechanical components}} of a machine are termed machine elements. [...] These elements consist of three basic types (i) structural components such as <b>frame</b> <b>members,</b> bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and lubricants, (ii) mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and (iii) control components such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers. [...] While generally {{not considered to be}} a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers {{are an important part of}} a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical {{components of a}} machine and its users.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, women's bicycle frames had a {{top tube}} that {{connected}} {{in the middle}} of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a step-through frame or as an open frame, allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the mixte, which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a [...] "women's" [...] bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.|$|E

50|$|Resistance to {{lateral forces}} is {{provided}} primarily by rigid frame action - that is, {{by the development}} of bending moment and shear force in the <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> and joints. By virtue of the rigid beam-column connections, a moment frame cannot displace laterally without bending the beams or columns depending on the geometry of the connection. The bending rigidity and strength of the <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is therefore the primary source of lateral stiffness and strength for the entire frame.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} major {{issues that are}} at risk from a chimney fire event. There is of course the danger of burning debris being {{expelled}} {{from the top of}} the chimney that could ignite other portions of the structure, but the major cause of damage is where the heat of the chimney fire will pass through the masonry materials and overheat nearby combustibles. Even though codes and standards require a specific clearance of the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> from the masonry materials, often this is not found in actual construction. Many fires reported as chimney fires, are actually structure fires ignited by the overheating of the <b>framing</b> <b>members.</b> These structure fires can be traced to the normal use of the fireplace or sealed combustion chamber.|$|R
