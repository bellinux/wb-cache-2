2500|$|Be this as <b>it</b> <b>may,</b> <b>very</b> few {{examples}} of exact solutions modeling isolated and rotating objects in general relativity are presently known. [...] In fact, the list of useful solutions presently consists of the Neugebauer-Meinel dust (which models a rigidly rotating thin (finite radius) disk of dust surrounded by an asymptotically flat vacuum region) and a few variants. [...] In particular, there is no known perfect fluid source which can be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior, {{as one would expect}} in order to create the simplest possible model of a rotating star. [...] This is surprising because of the plenitude of fluid interiors which match to Schwarzschild vacuum exteriors.|$|E

[...] Kevin Hoskins suggests [...] "They do not disappoint... <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>very</b> well be the best Disciple work to date, and is certainly one of the best albums I have heard all year." [...] Mark Rice forecasts [...] "There is very little to dislike about Attack,... nothing to get upset about." [...] Scott Fryberger contends [...] "Disciple's label tenure may be a little jolted by Attack, but this is still mostly an album for that particular fanbase".

It's better for me, personally, {{to have that kind of}} role, especially on that kind of show that's geared towards teenagers.

2500|$|Slant Magazine writer Jeremy Winograd called Skeleton Tree [...] "Cave's darkest, most emotionally devastating work to date" [...] {{and said}} that {{although}} it [...] "may not be Cave's most accessible album, owing both to the experimental nature {{of much of the}} music and the fact that its level of emotional rawness makes it a legitimately uncomfortable listen in places, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>very</b> well be his best"; Wingrod rated the album four-and-a-half-out-of-five stars. Clash gave Skeleton Tree a nine-out-of-ten rating, with reviewer Josh Gray praising Cave and Ellis' songwriting and arrangements and summarising the album as [...] "a stark, beautiful rendering of deep, profound pain." [...] Paula Mejia wrote in Paste that [...] "Skeleton Tree strips down embellishments and brings to the forefront sinister bass lines and a synthesizer that will widen the tear in your heart a little more with every note"; Mejia concluded that [...] "there's something to be said about Skeleton Tree and its starkness, which is as familiar as life and death, an elegy, and a hell of a thing to forget", rating the album nine out of ten. Pitchfork gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating and selected it as the week's [...] "Best New Music"; [...] "I Need You" [...] was also selected as the week's [...] "Best New Track" [...] and was described as [...] "the stirring core of the Bad Seeds' devastating new album." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{secondary}} education, Dominic {{had to go}} {{to another}} school and it was decided that he would go to the County School at Castelnuovo, three miles (5km) from his home. (Castelnuovo d' Asti, now Castelnuovo John Bosco, was the birthplace of another contemporary of John Bosco, Joseph Cafasso, also a saint. He was four years the senior of John Bosco, and was Bosco's mentor and advisor.) [...] Now ten years old, Dominic walked daily to and from school. In his biography of Dominic Savio, John Bosco records how a local farmer once asked Dominic, on a hot sunny day, if he was not tired from walking, and received the reply: [...] "Nothing seems tiresome or painful when you are working for a master who pays well." [...] Don Bosco also notes that Dominic refused to go swimming with his friends since Dominic considered that in such a situation, it would be [...] "also easy to offend God", he believed that on a previous occasion his friends behaved in, what was to him, a vulgar manner. In his biography Bosco records that Fr. Allora, the head of this school, {{had this to say about}} Dominic: [...] "...Hence <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>very</b> well be said that he was Savio (wise), not only in name, but in fact, viz., in his studies, in piety, in conversation and his dealing with others, and in all his actions. ..." ...|$|E
