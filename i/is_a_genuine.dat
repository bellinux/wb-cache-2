The area surrounding Nuka-World includes: Bradberton, a town built to house park employees, the defunct Nuka-World power plant, Grandchester, a haunted mansion and tourist attraction, and the Nuka-World scrapyard containing a UFO-themed carnival ride which the Hubologists are convinced <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> spaceship.|$|E

The phenomenon has been active throughout human history, and seems to masquerade in various forms to different cultures. In his opinion, the intelligence behind the phenomenon attempts social manipulation by using deception on the humans with whom they interact.|$|E

25|$|Biphobia is aversion toward {{bisexuality}} {{and toward}} bisexual {{people as a}} social group or as individuals. It can {{take the form of}} denial that bisexuality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate biphobia, and it is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people.|$|E

25|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species has {{two main}} points to make. The {{first is that}} {{speciation}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> problem that must {{be explained by the}} theory of evolution. In nature, {{there is not a single}} population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point is that all the variations can be explained by the principles of genetics.|$|E
25|$|A right-arm fast-medium bowler {{capable of}} {{generating}} good pace with late swing, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> strike bowler. Although he {{was prone to}} leaking runs in his earlier career, of late he has used vast county experience to be economical in death overs. He often bowls the reverse-swinging yorker in one day and T20 cricket and has good control over changes of pace, though he sometimes can be expensive. Rana is also a useful attacking lower-order batsman with 5 first-class centuries and many fifties, including a score of 95 in 57 balls in a T20 game which lifted his team Sialkot Stallions to the tournament final. He left playing cricket {{due to personal reasons}} during 1995–1999.|$|E

500|$|Todd was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} short-lived role, but Howarth's portrayal of the character inspired notable fan reaction, which prompted the creators to layer Todd's personality and showcase him regularly within the series. Michael Malone, Todd's creator, said fleshing out the character reminded him of what he loved about soap operas, adding, [...] "The story-telling <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> collaboration, not just among writers but by the actors." [...] Malone felt he could not take full credit for the development of Todd from Marty Saybrooke's gang rapist to what he later became, and also noted Howarth's impact: ...|$|E
500|$|Kang's {{theory was}} {{supported}} by several subsequent Chinese scholars in the late 19th century, but was contradicted by {{a large number of}} 20th-century studies that examined it from many different perspectives. [...] In the early 1930s, the French Sinologist Henri Maspero performed a detailed textual study of the issue, concluding the Han dynasty forgery theory to be untenable. The Swedish Sinologist Bernhard Karlgren, based on a series of linguistic and philological analyses he carried out in the 1920s, concluded that the Zuo zhuan <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> ancient text [...] "probably to be dated between 468 and 300BC." [...] While Liu's hypothesis that the Zuo zhuan was not originally an Annals commentary has been generally accepted, Kang's theory of Liu Xin forging the Zuo zhuan is now considered discredited.|$|E

Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, [...] "You will see how there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E

500|$|Featured {{alongside}} the anachronism in The Battle of Alexander at Issus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>genuine</b> lack of historicity. Altdorfer demonstrates minimal hesitance in neglecting the painting's historical integrity {{for the sake}} of its heroic style, in spite of the pains he took to research the battle. That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear, and the relative positioning of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded. According to art critic Rose-Marie Hagen, [...] "The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him, when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition." [...] Hagen also notes the historically baseless inclusion of women on the battlefield, attributing it to Altdorfer's [...] "passion for invention" [...] and saying they [...] "look like German courtly ladies, dressed for a hunting party" [...] in their feathered toques.|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode, one which was [...] "neither awful nor amazing", but set up promising storylines for the season ahead. He felt there were no stand out musical performances, but commented, [...] "it gave the season some emotional grounding [...] It showed us a Glee that's not working double-time to give us everything we want all at once, and that's pretty much what I want from it." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that, with [...] "Audition", Glee had become formulaic, and asserted that [...] "Glee fanatics won't be disappointed. The rest of us are." ...|$|E
500|$|Bicycling was {{the latest}} craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and {{performed}} tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. [...] A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled underfoot, made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State John Hay, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote [...] "he {{met me at the}} [...] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time.
