Many of the other dairy CAFOs in the region could achieve higher net income under the restrictions if they reduce feed costs by better utilizing manure and expanding <b>homegrown</b> <b>feed</b> production.

40|$|We {{estimate}} that EPA's CAFO final rule on manure application would have different impacts on dairy {{farms in the}} region, assuming that the farms would maintain the same herd size and same crop production practices. Some farms in the region {{would be able to}} comply it on their current land base, but other would need to lease additional land for land application of manure. Less than 30 percent of those affected farms would have a lower farm income. Most of these affected farms could have no income reduction or a higher income as a result of reduced feed cost from expanding <b>homegrown</b> <b>feed</b> production.

Key Words: dairy farms, land application, manure regulations Livestock industries in the U. S. have undergone dramatic structural change in recent years. Technical innovations, changes in production system and specialization have led to an expansion of large concentrated livestock operations. The environmental effects of waste management practices from those large concentrated livestock feeding operations are an increasing source of public concern (Litke; Innes; Metcalif; Kaplan, Johansson, and Peters). In response to this concern, EPA (1999) proposed changes to the current National Pollutant Discharge Eliminatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the operation of the Queensland Dairy Accounting Scheme (QDAS) and the results and analysis of the 2003 - 04 data. QDAS is a voluntary scheme providing dairy farmers with an analysis of their dairy business. Key indictors measure performance and the results are then compared against benchmarks and personal targets. Analysis of data has shown that the profit drivers on the most profitable farms in QDAS, are production per cow, herd size, use of <b>homegrown</b> <b>feeds</b> and use of nitrogen fertiliser.

40|$|Sampling {{is the key}} to {{accurate}} feed {{analyses and}} properly balancing livestock rations. Here 2 ̆ 7 s how to do it. Accurate feed analyses are needed to balance livestock rations, correctly price hay, formulate least cost supplements, and efficiently allocate <b>homegrown</b> <b>feeds</b> to the proper class of livestock. Sampling is the most important factor affecting accuracy of feed analyses. The feed value of most forages varies. Therefore, test forages routinely to determine their best and most economical use. With adequate forage testing, you can develop an accurate forage inventory which allows you to efficiently allocate higher quality forage to high-producing livestock and poorer quality forage to animals at lower levels of production. Because forages are more difficult to sample than grains, this guide emphasizes sampling of hay and silage...|$|R
40|$|A whole-farm dairy {{model was}} {{developed}} and evaluated. The DairyWise model is an empirical model that simulated technical, environmental, and financial processes on a dairy farm. The central component is the FeedSupply model that balanced the herd requirements, as generated by the DairyHerd model, and the supply of <b>homegrown</b> <b>feeds,</b> as generated by the crop models for grassland and corn silage. The output of the FeedSupply model was used as input for several technical, environmental, and economic submodels. The submodels simulated a range of farm aspects such as nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, nitrate leaching, ammonia emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and a financial farm budget. The final output was a farm plan describing all material and nutrient flows and the consequences {{on the environment and}} economy. Evaluation of DairyWise was performed with 2 data sets consisting of 29 dairy farms. The evaluation showed that DairyWise was able to simulate gross margin, concentrate intake, nitrogen surplus, nitrate concentration in ground water, and crop yields. The variance accounted for ranged from 37 to 84 %, and the mean differences between modeled and observed values varied between ¿ 5 to + 3 % per set of farms. We conclude that DairyWise is a powerful tool for integrated scenario development and evaluation for scientists, policy makers, extension workers, teachers and farmer...|$|R
40|$|Most {{dairy farms}} in Wisconsin {{continue}} to follow a fairly generalized formula of how to produce milk. Cows and replacement heifers are fed primarily <b>homegrown</b> <b>feed</b> from crop rotations comprising alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), oats (Avena spp.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.). Protein and mineral supplements are purchased to compliment dairy diets. However, the dairy industry is undergoing rapid change to remain economically viable. Many farms are expanding herd size and increasing the importation of feed. Greater livestock numbers on a fixed land base has increased the risk of soil nutrient buildup and environmental pollution. Recently passed federal legislation (USDA-NRCS, 2001) aims to reduce soil phosphorus (P) buildup, loss and pollution from animal operations by controlling manure management. The application of manure to cropland is becoming increasingly regulated based {{on a combination of}} manure P content, soil test P level, crop P requirements and a field’s risk to lose runoff P to surface water. At present, many dairy farms {{would not be able to}} comply with these P-based regulations. Many dairy farmers have done a good job of following the long-held recommendation to build soil test P to plant optimum levels, and many farms were establishe...|$|E
40|$|Dairy milk {{production}} in Moc Chau contributes {{to improve the}} welfare of farm households. It generates daily income for farmers, provides a highly nutritious food for people, create employment opportunities for the society. Although it brings a rather high income for farmers, their lives are very hard, and their living standard is quite low. This study aims to apply a monitoring system in farms to assist farmers improving their performance. Six field trips were carried out to help dairy farmers to monitor their farms and collect economic and technical data in 2010 - 2012 in Moc Chau. The main findings are: stocking rate, milk yield and income were rather high but varied largely from this farm to others. Cost control in farm was not good thus dairy margin was not high. Purchased feed cost was too high. <b>Homegrown</b> <b>feed</b> accounted for {{a small part of}} cost but produced large amount of milk while purchased feed dominated a very large proportion of cost but produced less milk quantity. Most of the farmers followed the objective of increasing {{milk production}} but did not pay attention to the quality of herd and milk; did not make an optimal decision. Experience, land area, and herd size were the major factors that increased economic performance in farms. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|By the intensifying of the {{livestock}} production with specialised and larger farm units {{the role of}} grassland has been reduced. The change in EU policy from a production-oriented marked to a marked where the choice of crop is linked to its added value; grassland {{has an opportunity to}} come back. However, the aim for research and farming practice within grassland management should be seen in this new context. The paper reviews different production and management systems, mainly stressed on grazing systems, within intensive dairy farming and aspects of feeding and quality of herbage in order to propose areas of special interest seen in the new context. Farming systems based on <b>homegrown</b> <b>feed,</b> as organic farming and systems based on legumes, need to be further developed. The more experimental research has to be initiated by system-identified problems. It is proposed to work more with supplementary feed in relation to effect of season and also synchronisation of N and carbohydrate degradation in the rumen in relation to milk response and N efficiency. Further, work with time-restricted systems should be highlighted in order to maintain a high pasture intake and reduce the excretion of nitrogen at pasture. Interaction between grassland management and new technology, like automatic milking, will be important in order to keep a high proportion of the dairy cows at pasture...|$|E
40|$|The {{sponsorship}} of the School Feeding Programme in Kenya is through the World Food Programme (WFP) initiatives. The WFP’s new five-year development program (2009 - 2013) has emphasized the need to hand the program over to the Government after 28 years of assistance (WFP, 2008). In an effort to transition away from WFP assistance and create a more sustainable and locally integrated program, the Ministry of Education began implementing a <b>Homegrown</b> School <b>Feeding</b> Program (HGSFP) in July of 2009 (Espejo 2009). To retain momentum of school going initiated by the NARC government in 2002 which resulted in mass enrollment to primary schools by Kenyan children, hence sustainability {{was one of the}} key factors of this enrollment, the feeding programme, has to be addressed by all stakeholders. The general objective {{of this study was to}} assess the sustainability of school feeding programme in Kenya after WFP exit. It explored the challenges of Community participation. A descriptive study design was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data and adopted deliberate sampling technique. A likert scale of 1 = strongly-disagree to 5 = strongly-agree was used to rate community participation. The mean rating after analysis was 3. 51 meaning with community participation sustainability would be achieved. Key words...|$|R
40|$|Good {{management}} of the pregnant heifer is crucial to ensure that she is well grown and healthy and calves down easily before joining the milking herd. This study collected primary data on all aspects of heifer management on 101 UK farms during heifer pregnancy from conception to calving including farm factors and associated costs of system inputs. A cost analysis workbook was developed {{to calculate the cost}} of rearing per heifer for each of the study farms. Associations between cost of rearing and farms factors were determined using linear regression and analysis of variance. Heifers had a mean age of conception of 509 d (range 365 - 700 d) and an age at first calving of 784 d (range 639 - 973 d). The mean total cost of rearing during pregnancy was £ 450. 36 (range £ 153. 11 to £ 784. 00) with a mean daily cost of £ 1. 64 (range £ 0. 56 to £ 2. 86). The inputs contributing the most to cost were feed (32. 7 %), labour (23. 8 %) and slurry disposal (11. 2 %). Total purchased and <b>homegrown</b> <b>feed</b> and grazing contributed between 25. 5 % and 65. 4 % of total costs with a mean contribution of 43. 6 %. The cost of rearing was lowest in spring calving herds and highest in all year round calving herds with intermediate values in autumn and multi block calving herds. The main variables influencing the cost were the number of days spent at grass, age at first calving, calving pattern, breed, herd size and region. Each extra day in age at first calving increased the mean cost of rearing during pregnancy by £ 0. 33 /d whereas every extra day at grass reduced the cost by £ 1. 75 /d. falsePublished onlin...|$|E
