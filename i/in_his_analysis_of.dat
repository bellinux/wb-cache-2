5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} writes {{of why he}} has stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are {{a response to the}} infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi was, {{at least}} initially, much {{taken with the}} {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the new art movement, Apollinaire makes a {{distinction}} between four different types of Cubism; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive.

The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.|$|E

A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> medieval {{political}} theology, The King’s Two Bodies, Ernst Kantorowicz describes medieval kings as containing two bodies: a body natural, {{and a body}} politic. The {{theme of}} the king's two bodies is pertinent throughout Richard II, from the exile of Bolingbroke to the deposition of King Richard II. The body natural is a mortal body, subject to all the weaknesses of mortal human beings. On the other hand, the body politic is a spiritual body which cannot be affected by mortal infirmities such as disease and old age. These two bodies form one indivisible unit, with the body politic superior to the body natural.|$|E

Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.|$|E
25|$|The Nash {{equilibrium}} {{was named}} after American mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr. A version of the Nash equilibrium concept was first known {{to be used in}} 1838 by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his theory of oligopoly. In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of best response dynamics <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the stability of equilibrium. However, Nash's definition of equilibrium is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient equilibrium, since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the equilibrium being generated.|$|E

Berque's linguistic versatility is made apparent here in his translations of Arabic poetry from the classical period to the present, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the varieties of spoken and written Arabic. He was an accomplished Arabist, perfecting several Arabic dialects of both the Maghreb and the Middle East.

He once said in an interview that since childhood he had tried fervently 'to synthesise the cultures of the northern shore of the Mediterranean with those of its southern shore'.|$|E

500|$|In {{this work}} the [...] "sacred concertos" [...] fulfil {{the role of}} the antiphons which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services.

In some versions of Monteverdi's Vespers (for example, those of Denis Stevens) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although John Whenham <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.|$|E
