40|$|A <b>double</b> <b>length</b> hash {{function}} is a 2 n-bit {{hash function}} {{based on an}} n-bit compression function. To increase the security level, designs of good <b>double</b> <b>length</b> hash functions are important. In this paper we construct a class of maximally secure <b>double</b> <b>length</b> hash functions in random oracle model based on some good permutations. This class contains recently proposed <b>double</b> <b>length</b> hash functions [16, 25]. We also propose an efficient <b>double</b> <b>length</b> hash function and study its security level in the random oracle model. We prove that any attack algorithm in the random oracle model needs Ω(2 n /(s 2 n s)) time complexity, where s is some parameter related to {{the rate of the}} hash function. Thus there is a trade-off between the efficiency and security. We use the notion of computable message [29] to make the security analysis of proposed hash functions. We also see that the security analysis of hash functions based on random permutations and hash functions based on random functions are very much related. ...|$|R

The first DLR tests for spatial lag dependence while the second DLR tests for spatial error dependence. Both artificial regressions utilize only least squares residuals of the restricted model and are therefore easy to compute. These tests are illustrated using two simple examples. In addition, Monte Carlo experiments are performed to study the small sample performance of these tests. As expected, these DLR tests have similar performance to their corresponding LM counterparts. <b>Double</b> <b>length</b> regressions, Spatial dependence, Lagrange multiplier, JEL Classification: C 12, C 21, R 15,...|$|R

50|$|The {{stop was}} {{originally}} proposed {{to consist of}} three <b>double</b> <b>length</b> (90 metre) platforms, {{with one of the}} platforms to only be used during special events - the roadway being open to general traffic at other times. This third platform was removed in the project's Submissions Report, with a crossover {{to the north of the}} stop provided instead. The Report also proposed diverting most general traffic via Randle Street and converting the section of Chalmers Street opposite the station into a pedestrian/traffic shared zone. As a result of the December 2014 decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run <b>double</b> <b>length</b> trams during special events at Moore Park were abandoned. Consequently, the Modifications Report reduced the platform length from 90 metres to 75 metres. The third platform was reinstated in an urban design plan released in 2017. This report also proposed closing Chalmers Street to through traffic.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{new measurement}} methods for explicit determination of complex permittivity. For the first time, these methods combine the explicit algorithm with a simplified yet accurate error-correction technique. The combination {{is made possible}} by the use of one sample of single length and another of <b>double</b> <b>length.</b> For low-loss materials, one of the methods is valid for any sample length and independent of sample positions, but needs a prior estimate of the permittivity, while the other requires no such estimate, but avoidance of the single length being multiples of half-wavelength in the sample, For high-loss materials, both methods may need the estimate, Advantages of each method can be taken if both methods are used simultaneously. Experimental results from the proposed methods show excellent agreement with those from a recent iterative method. Errors arising from small deviations from the <b>double</b> <b>length</b> are also analyzed and presented. The validity, explicitness, and simple error-correction capability make the new methods very useful. status: publishe...|$|R
