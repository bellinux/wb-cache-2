5000|$|LVDS was {{introduced}} in 1994, and has become popular in products such as LCD-TVs, automotive infotainment systems, industrial cameras and machine vision, notebook and tablet computers, and communications systems. The typical applications are high-speed video, graphics, video camera data transfers, and general purpose computer buses. Early on, the notebook and LCD vendors commonly used the term LVDS instead of FPD-Link when referring to their application, and the term LVDS has mistakenly become synonymous with Flat Panel <b>Display</b> <b>Link</b> in the video-display engineering vocabulary.|$|E
50|$|Core Video {{provides}} both a buffering {{model and}} a playback synchronization solution within its processing pipeline. A video source provides a decompressed data stream to be rendered as images within a visual context in Quartz 2D. Core Video {{can be thought}} of as the link between this video source and its display context. Rendered images can be further processed by Core Image before being composed into a final scene with Quartz Compositor. As part of the composition process, Core Video maintains a frame buffer, keeping a pool of rendered, composed frames ready for playback. To ensure smooth playback, Core Video uses a high-priority thread to maintain its frame buffer. This <b>display</b> <b>link</b> runs independently from the application which invokes video playback, and it compensates for different display refresh rates and latency.|$|E
50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{application for}} LVDS was in notebook computers transmitting video data from graphics processing units {{to the flat}} panel displays using the Flat Panel <b>Display</b> <b>Link</b> by National Semiconductor. The first FPD-Link chipset reduced a 21-bit wide video interface plus the clock down to only 4 differential pairs (8 wires), which enabled it to easily fit through the hinge between the display and the notebook {{and take advantage of}} LVDS's low-noise characteristics and fast data rate. FPD-Link became the de facto open standard for this notebook application in the late 1990s and is still the dominant display interface today in notebook and tablet computers. This is the reason IC vendors such as Texas Instruments, Maxim, Fairchild, and Thine produce their versions of the FPD-Link chipset.|$|E

40|$|In an emergency, {{people need}} to be able to report and find {{relevant}} information quickly. Fulfilling these information needs is the design goal of E-SOS: Emergency Situation Overview and Synthesis, a research project in progress. E-SOS will consist of (1) a website where users can report information, (2) web services that find and synthesize related information from multiple sources, and (3) interface tools that visualize and <b>display</b> <b>links</b> to this information. In this paper we describe three of these services and tools: the topic, geographic, and information space awareness tools. When a user writes a report, the topic awareness tool will execute a federated search and <b>display</b> <b>links</b> to related information. The information space awareness tool will highlight these links in a visualization of the information space. If the user refers to a location, the geographic awareness tool will focus a map on this location and display topic-related icons...|$|R

40|$|IntoNow is {{a mobile}} {{application}} {{that provides a}} secondscreen experience to television viewers. IntoNow uses the microphone of the companion device to sample the audio coming from the TV set, and compares it against a database of TV shows {{in order to identify}} the program being watched. The system we demonstrate is activated by IntoNow for specific types of shows. It retrieves information related to the program the user is watching by using closed captions, which are provided by each broadcasting network along the TV signal. It then matches the stream of closed captions in real-time against multiple sources of content. More specifically, during news programs it <b>displays</b> <b>links</b> to online news articles and the profiles of people and organizations in the news, and during music shows it <b>displays</b> <b>links</b> to songs. The matching models are machine-learned from editorial judgments, and tuned to achieve approximately 90 % precision.

50|$|A human-edited {{directory}} {{is created}} and maintained by editors who add links {{based on the}} policies particular to that directory.Human-edited directories are often targeted by SEOs {{on the basis that}} links from reputable sources will improve rankings in the major search engines.

Many human-edited directories, including DMOZ, World Wide Web Virtual Library, JoeAnt, Business.com and Jasmine Directory, are edited by volunteers, who are often experts in particular categories.

Chinese government and Chinese industry sources stated that Baidu received a license from Beijing, which allows the search engine to become a full-fledged news website.

40|$|Routing in {{telecommunication}} networks {{rely on the}} definition of performance indicators called routing metrics. Popular routing metrics are the route throughput, end-to-end delay and jitter. However, in a delay tolerant network <b>displaying</b> <b>link</b> disruptions, these metrics may be questionable. This contribution proposes six metrics for characterising routes in a delay tolerant network. These metrics are: route lifetime, end-to-end delay, capacity, synchronicity and simultaneousness. Some of these metrics are borrowed (and possibly adapted) from classical networks, others are new. Each metric is formalised and examplified by showing how {{the use of these}} metrics helps to compute routes which are adequate for applications that may be deployed over delay tolerant networks...|$|R
