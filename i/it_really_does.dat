In 1909, Kanō {{incorporated}} the Kodokan, and endowed it with ¥10,000 (then about U.S. $4,700). The reason, said Japan Times on 30 March 1913, was [...] "so that this wonderful institution might be able to reconstruct, for that is what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does,</b> the moral and physical nature of the Japanese youth, without its founder's personal attention." ...|$|E

[...] "I didn't call it Bat Out of Hell II just to identify with the first record. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> feel like an extension of that... It was a chance {{to go back to that}} world and explore it deeper. It always seemed incomplete because I conceived it like a film, and what would you do without Die Hard 2?" [...] Meat Loaf himself was more succinct. He told an interview at the time, [...] "We called it Bat Out of Hell II 'cos that would help it sell shitloads." ...|$|E
500|$|Kristina Wilson, {{associate}} professor in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts at Worcester's Clark University, asked people on campus what they thought of Turtle Boy. One person replied [...] "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to bestiality." [...] Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray [...] "innocence, joy, and rebirth," [...] and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how well you can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." [...] Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: [...] "It's unfortunate, because <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> look like something untoward is going on." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual recent {{research}} and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they [...] "drilled out the eyeball and sculpt it open and [...] {{through a series of}} molds." [...] Stanley stated that [...] "it's really cool to see the head because <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out." [...] The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a [...] "photon gun"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun {{was based on}} real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used [...] "a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location," [...] which they then used to [...] "take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen graded {{the episode}} with an A-, praising the opening as [...] "quite good" [...] and believing the tie between Walter and his past {{research}} [...] "changes the game" [...] ("Having Walter be, in a way, {{the source of}} the current disturbance suddenly made everything that much more important"). Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic to get out of her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, [...] "Now this is science fiction! I was absolutely thrilled by this week's episode". She elaborated by praising Olivia's [...] "B story" [...] about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of [...] "cold-blooded" [...] villains, and believed [...] "the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted [...] "Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> feel like the end of a chapter. What started as the 'wacky science project of the week' builds to an episode that feels like a mini season finale." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, describing it as [...] "gleefully grim". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode represented the series coming into its own, noting that [...] "Millennium, after weeks of hinting at possibilities without delivering much of anything, has finally started to give a real sense that yes, {{there is a lot}} of bad news happening, and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> make a twisted kind of sense". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that it shared similar themes with the direction the series would take in its second season. Gibron described the episode as [...] "spooky and somewhat surreal", adding that [...] "the entire installment [...] crackles with possibilities". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] four stars out of five, describing it as being [...] "surprising, intriguing, moody and pretentious". Shearman compared the episode thematically to Mann's earlier script for [...] "The Judge", and noted that while the story [...] "doesn't make for an especially comprehensible yarn, it does produce an episode that is genuinely uneasy viewing".|$|E

500|$|Fraser McAlpine of the BBC stated, [...] "'Love Story' is a {{stunning}} pop song and, because <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> tell a love story, it's heart-warming and draws the listener into the exciting and romantic fairytale world." [...] However, she felt Swift's vocal performance was not incredible, but was passionate {{to complement the}} song's sentiments. McAlpine resumed by stating that [...] "Love Story", although obvious, a bit dramatic, and probably targeted towards younger audiences, was just lovely and that Swift proved herself a true princess of pop with the song. Chris Neal of Country Weekly called [...] "Love Story" [...] an [...] "ebullient first hit." [...] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard magazine gave the single a favorable review and called it an [...] "enchanting offering". Price noted that [...] "Love Story" [...] demonstrates one of Swift's appeals, her writing and singing of age-appropriate material that can be both relatable to her audience and others. As a result, she predicted the song would have much commercial success in the country music industry. Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian described the song to be fueled by a [...] "joyous rush" [...] that, according to him, was later replicated by Swift's own single [...] "Mine" [...] (2010). Taste of Country listed the song at number 17 on its list of greatest country songs of all time.|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a saying}} that goes [...] "a short piece {{requires}} three months , {{and a long}} piece requires three years". In actual practice, it needn't be that long to dapu a piece, but suggests that the player will have not only memorised the piece off by heart, but also have their fingering, rhythm and timing corrected.

2500|$|Mixed {{reviews of}} the album have focused on its change in style from {{previous}} Opeth albums. Uncut magazine wrote, [...] "On Heritage, [...] jettisoning practically all trace of heavy whatsoever". Similarly, Kerrang! magazine wrote, [...] "It's an album that succeeds {{on its own terms}} but if <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> mark the effective end of Opeth as a metal band, that will remain our loss". In a negative review for Drowned in Sound, Patrick Smith wrote, [...] "Åkerfeldt should be praised for breaking free of an often repetitive genre – there's nothing wrong with radical reinvention. But this departure didn't need to be quite so lacklustre".|$|E

[...] In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80. [...] These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does.</b> However, some research indicates that while socioeconomic measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of sociometric status (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, {{above and beyond the}} effects of extroversion and other factors.|$|E

He offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems (such as land) {{out of a sense}} of a culture or society's sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong. He felt the security and prosperity resulting from [...] "mechanization" [...] now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there, however, he also wrote, [...] "Theoretically, the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer's chains, but whether <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> is debatable." ...|$|E

And, of course, once you excite the chassis the door panels start rattling and squeaking. Whereas the other cars feel taut and solid, this one's like a big go-kart with a plastic body on it." [...] He severely criticized the old racing technology: [...] "It's not even '60s technology, from a frame point of view, it's '50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe. It's only got local frames to hold the bulkhead to the dash, attach the front suspension, rear suspension and rollbar.

Contributing editor of The Quarterly Conversation Elizabeth Wadell reviewed the book, and commented, [...] "these articles almost unanimously engage". Wadell lamented that the profile of Karl Lagerfeld by Vanessa Grigoriadis seemed lighter fare compared {{to the rest of the}} articles in the book, [...] "Though it is cleverly written, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> seem to be, well, all style." [...] Wadell recommented the book for readers, and observed, [...] "You can skip a lot of articles in a magazine and still feel that you 'got through' the whole thing; a book isn't over till it's over. So how then, should we read the Best American Magazine Articles? Out of order, I'd say, skipping at least one article, but keeping it to read again." [...] Colin Murphy reviewed the book for The Irish Times, and wrote favorably of the piece by Christopher Hitchens on Agent Orange. Murphy also wrote positively of the book as a whole, and his review concluded, [...] "the best in this volume stands with the best anywhere, essays with the compulsive readability of a good novel, but the immediacy and moral power of good journalism." ...|$|E

[...] Of the controls, he wrote [...] "it doesn't feel as {{rewarding}} or [...] "realistic" [...] as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're suggesting what should happen and then hoping it does." [...] He was also critical of the graphics; [...] "its visuals are simply poor for a next-generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>does</b> look like you're playing a PS2 game in HD." [...] He concluded [...] "the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA {{has done a great}} job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [...] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect."
