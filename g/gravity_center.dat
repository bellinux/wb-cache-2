40|$|Analysing spatiotemporal {{distribution}} {{patterns and}} its dynamics of different industries {{can help us}} learn the macro-level developing trends of those industries, and in turn provides references for industrial spatial planning. However, the analysis process is challenging task which requires an easy-to-understand information presentation mechanism and a powerful computational technology to support the visual analytics of big data on the fly. Due to this reason, this research proposes a web-based framework to enable such a visual analytics requirement. The framework uses standard deviational ellipse (SDE) and shifting route of <b>gravity</b> <b>centers</b> to show the spatial distribution and yearly developing trends of different enterprise types according to their industry categories. The calculation of <b>gravity</b> <b>centers</b> and ellipses is paralleled using Apache Spark to accelerate the processing. In the experiments, we use the enterprise registration dataset in Mainland China from year 1960 to 2015 that contains fine-grain location information (i. e., coordinates of each individual enterprise) to demonstrate the feasibility of this framework. The experiment result shows that the developed visual analytics method is helpful to understand the multi-level patterns and developing trends of different industries in China. Moreover, the proposed framework {{can be used to}} analyse any nature and social spatiotemporal point process with large data volume, such as crime and disease...|$|R

With vessels built larger and larger in the future, hull transfigurations and other factors, which influence the quality of shafting alignment, must be considered to avoid the similar shafting accidents, when the calculated models of shafting alignment are built...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 A new, fully {{automated}} summarization algorithm of MPEG compressed videos {{is designed to}} address the challenge of content based video retrieval.
