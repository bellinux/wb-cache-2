5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether REITs <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> changes in short-term and long-term interest rates. REITs <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> changes in the long-term interest rates in 1973 - 1979, but in 1980 - 1985, REITs <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> changes in both short-term and long-term rates. These sources of interest-rate sensitivity were also found to be different for equity and mortgage REITs.

5|$|B. sceptrum is principally {{used in the}} {{cut flower}} industry, with the {{immature}} spikes being commonly sold in florists around Australia. It is occasionally grown in gardens as its bright flower spikes are prominent, but requires a Mediterranean (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to germinate. A dwarf form is in cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when inspecting the skin and can only be seen with a microscope. There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> hormonal influences.

5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposePollen allergy is {{believed}} to be less common in East Asia, Latin America, and tropical areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the role of pollen allergy in Taiwan. MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis were enrolled. All subjects received a 30 -item skin test panel that included perennial allergens (house dust mix, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, dog epithelium, cat hairs, cockroach mix, and Candida albicans) and pollen allergens (acacia, pine mix, eucalyptus, beefwood, juniper mix, willow, mulberry mix, pepper tree, cedar, Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, ragweed mix, Timothy grass, spiny pigweed, cocklebur, sage mix, sheep sorrel, dog fennel, pigweed mix, English plantain, castor bean, alfalfa, and dandelion). ResultsA total of 419 patients were recruited. A total of 313 (74. 7 %) had a positive skin test. A total of 288 patients (68. 7 %) <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens, and 11 8 patients (28. 2 %) <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> pollen allergens. However, 93 pollen-sensitive patients <b>were</b> also <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens, and only 25 <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> pollen allergens alone. The most common allergens were D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust mix, and cockroach, but the most common pollen allergens were spiny pigweed, Johnson grass, and sheep sorrel. All nasal symptoms tended to be more severe in patients who <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens than in those who <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> pollen allergens alone.

5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E
