5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because there was a real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and <b>e-mails</b> <b>to</b> Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Will Burton (Gaelan Connell) is a music enthusiast and a David Bowie fan {{with a hint}} of {{rock and}} roll and boy next door. Throughout the movie, Will writes journal-like <b>e-mails</b> <b>to</b> Bowie every day, {{although}} Bowie never answers. When Will's mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow) finds a new job, he switches to a new school, which he is eager to do since he was bullied at his previous one. During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl who says her name is written Sa5m but pronounced Sam, the 5 is silent (Vanessa Hudgens). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends but, shortly after, he is sought after by another girl named Charlotte Barnes (Aly Michalka). One afternoon, Charlotte asks Will to join her in an after-school day-care center. When she starts inviting him to hang out with her, the teenager is stunned—as is his single mother Karen. Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/ska band. Her goal is apparently to take revenge on her egocentric musician ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatley (Scott Porter) during Bandslam.|$|E

25|$|On April 17, Christie enacted two {{recommendations}} of the Mastro report. He eliminated the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, which had been headed by Bridget Kelly. He named Patrick E. Hobbs, dean of Seton Hall University School of Law, Christie's alma mater, as a part-time ombudsman to address complaints about misconduct, enhance ethics training and accountability, and improve electronic communications in the governor's office.

25|$|E-mail {{was first}} invented for CTSS and similar time sharing {{systems of the}} era in the mid-1960s. At first, e-mail was {{possible}} only between different accounts on the same computer (typically a mainframe). ARPANET allowed different computers {{to be connected to}} allow <b>e-mails</b> <b>to</b> be relayed from computer to computer, with the first ARPANET e-mail being sent in 1971. Multics also pioneered instant messaging between computer users in the mid-1970s. With the growth of the Internet, e-mail began to be possible between any two computers with access to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|There are {{instances}} where {{the use of}} a PHR would be beneficial to patients and may, therefore, override privacy concerns. Stage 1 of meaningful use of certified EHR systems requires that practices provide at least 50 percent of their patients with a copy of their health records upon request. While this can be accomplished through a patient portal, this function can also be part of a larger system such as Kaiser Permanente's My Health Manager—a PHR that is integrated into the health system's patient portal. By June 2012, 3.9 million Kaiser members were enrolled in this program. For the first half of 2012, members viewed 2.5 million lab results, sent 1 million <b>e-mails</b> <b>to</b> physicians, and scheduled 230,000 appointments monthly, demonstrating ease of use and convenience.|$|E

25|$|The {{release of}} an email cache related to {{intelligence}} research organisation Stratfor was leaked by WikiLeaks on 27 February 2012. It revealed that Dow Chemical had engaged Stratfor {{to spy on}} the public and personal lives of activists involved in the Bhopal disaster, including the Yes Men. <b>E-mails</b> <b>to</b> Dow representatives from hired security analysts list the YouTube videos liked, Twitter and Facebook posts made and the public appearances of these activists. Journalists, film-makers and authors who were investigating Bhopal and covering the issue of ongoing contamination, such as Jack Laurenson and Max Carlson, were also placed under surveillance. Stratfor released a statement condemning the revelation by Wikileaks while neither confirming nor denying {{the accuracy of the}} reports, and would only state that it had acted within the bounds of the law. Dow Chemical also refrained to comment on the matter.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular Internet-related {{technologies}} to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style. E-mail is rapidly replacing traditional letter-writing because of its convenience, speed and spontaneity. It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using <b>e-mails</b> <b>to</b> send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.|$|E

500|$|The Power of Nightmares {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 86% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, {{with an average}} score of 8.1/10, based upon a sample of seven reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 78, based on six reviews. Entertainment Weekly described the film as [...] "a fluid cinematic essay, rooted in painstakingly assembled evidence, that heightens and cleanses your perceptions" [...] while Variety called it [...] "a superb, eye-opening and often absurdly funny deconstruction of the myths and realities of global terrorism." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle had an equally enthusiastic view of the film and likened it to [...] "a brilliant piece in the Atlantic Monthly that's (thankfully) come to cinematic life." [...] The New York Times had a more skeptical review, unimpressed by efforts to compare attacks on Bill Clinton by American conservatives with Islamist revolutionary activities, claiming (in a review by literary and film critic A. O. Scott) that, [...] "its understanding of politics, geo- and national, can seem curiously thin."

40|$|The rate {{at which}} people use SMS {{messages}} is increasing at so fast a pace that they may exceed the {{rate at which}} E-mails are transmitted through the internet in the nearest future. <b>E-mail</b> <b>to</b> SMS is also becoming increasingly popular due to the mobility provided by new ubiquitous systems. Unfortunately present method for sending <b>E-mail</b> <b>to</b> SMS using available software does not allow for flexibility since proprietary software used for this purpose are not made available to subscribers. It has therefore become imperative to develop open freeware software that can be made available to users interested in tailoring the software functionalities to suit their purpose. We developed a web-based gateway system that for sending <b>E-mail</b> <b>to</b> SMS. Bulk SMS was purchased and HTTP is employed as middleware. The system works by receiving E-mails through SMTP server and the POP 3 / IMAP for onward transmission to the MAIL-BOX. The software automatically receives the mail; compare the E-mail address with those already stored in a database. If the address exists, the SMTP server passed the parsed <b>E-mail</b> <b>to...</b>|$|R
