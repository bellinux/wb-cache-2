50|$|In 1966 Dr. Bower {{realized}} that if the gate electrode was defined first, {{it would be possible}} not only to minimize the parasitic capacitances between gate and source and drain, but it would also make them insensitive to misalignment. He proposed a method in which the aluminum gate electrode itself was used as a mask to define the source and drain regions of the transistor. However, since aluminum could not withstand the high temperature required for the conventional doping of the source and drain junctions, Dr. Bower proposed to use ion implantation, a new <b>doping</b> <b>technique</b> still in development at Hughes Aircraft, his employer, and not yet available at other labs. While Bower’s idea was conceptually sound, in practice it did not work, because it was impossible to adequately passivate the transistors, and repair the radiation damage done to the silicon crystal structure by the ion implantation, since these two operations would have required temperatures in excess of the ones survivable by the aluminum gate. Thus his invention provided a proof of principle, but no commercial integrated circuit was ever produced with Bower’s method. A more refractory gate material was needed.|$|E

Here, we report a chloride molecular <b>doping</b> <b>technique</b> which greatly reduces the contact resistance (Rc) in the few-layer WS 2 and MoS 2. After doping, the Rc of WS 2 and MoS 2 have been decreased to 0. 7 kohm*um and 0. 5 kohm*um, respectively.
