40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{results of the}} pattern developed by a mixture of two types of grains in a triangular rotating tumbler operating in the avalanche regime. At the centroid of the triangular tumbler an <b>invariant</b> <b>zone</b> appears where the grains do not move relative to the tumbler. We characterize this <b>invariant</b> <b>zone</b> by its normalized area, A_i, and its circularity index {{as a function of}} the normalized filling area A. We find a critical filling area so that only for A>A_c invariant zones are obtained. These zones scale as A_i∼ (A-A_c) ^ 2 near A_c. We have obtained a maximum in the circularity index for A≈ 0. 8, for which the shape of the <b>invariant</b> <b>zone</b> is closer to a circular one. The {{experimental results}} are reproduced by a simple model which, based on the surface position, accounts for all the possible straight lines within the triangle that satisfy the condition of constant A. We have obtained an analytic expression for the contour of the <b>invariant</b> <b>zone.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{alternative}} formalism for calculating the maximally localized Wannier functions in crystalline solids, obtaining an expression which is extremely simple and general. In particular, our scheme is exactly <b>invariant</b> under Brillouin <b>zone</b> folding, {{and therefore it}} extends trivially to the Gamma-point case. We study the convergence properties of the Wannier functions, their quadratic spread and centers as obtained by our simplified technique. We show how this convergence can be drastically improved by a simple and inexpensive ``refinement'' step, which allows for very efficient and accurate calculations of the polarization in zero external field.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel sound source {{separation}} principle particularly {{suitable for the}} biomimicry silicon microphone [1][2]. Convention-ally, sound source separation has been performed by a wavelength-sized array of pressure-sensitive microphones. But it requires long observation in-terval and much computational cost due to the learning scheme of the algorithm, necessity for sta-tistical properties of sound, subband decomposi-tion or FFT, and so on. While, in our biomimicry microphone, tiny gimbal supported diaphragm de-tects sound pressure and its spatial gradients si-multaneously. We show that their weighted sum-mation generates null sensitivity <b>zones</b> <b>invariant</b> to the sound frequency, which enables us to ex-clude noise sources with high temporal resolution without distorting the target sound. We theoret-ically describe the principle and conrm the e-ciency by some experiments...|$|R
40|$|Long term {{durability}} of osseointegrated implants depends on bone adaptation to {{stress and strain}} occurring in proximity of the prosthesis. Mechanical overloading, as well as disuse, may reduce the stability of implants by provoking bone resorption. However, an appropriate mechanical environment can improve integration. Several {{studies have focused on}} the definition of numerical methods to predict bone peri-implant adaptation to the mechanical environment. Existing adaptation models differ notably in the type of mechanical variable adopted as stimulus but also in the bounds and shape of the adaptation rate equation. However, a general comparison of the different approaches on a common benchmark case is still missing and general guidelines to determine physically sound parameters still need to be developed. This current work addresses these themes in two steps. Firstly, the histograms of effective stress, strain and strain energy density are compared for rat tibiae in physiological (homeostatic) conditions. According to the Mechanostat, the ideal stimulus should present a clearly defined, position and tissue <b>invariant</b> lazy <b>zone</b> in homeostatic conditions. Our results highlight that only the octahedral shear strain presents this characteristic and can thus be considered the optimal choice for implementation of a continuum level bone adaptation model. Secondly, critical modeling parameters such as lazy zone bounds, type of rate equation and bone overloading response are classified depending on their influence on the numerical predictions of bone adaptation. Guidelines are proposed to establish the dominant model parameters based on experimental and simulated data...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a video {{watermarking}} {{scheme is}} proposed to embed the watermarking with the depth sequences {{of the respective}} video frames for multi-view video plus depth (MVD) based 3 D video sequences. To make the scheme invariant to 3 D-HEVC compression attack, motion compensated temporal filtering (MCTF) is done over the video sequences to find motion-coherent connected pixels. Scale- invariant feature transform (SIFT) is done on the temporally filtered frame to make the proposed method view <b>invariant.</b> Moreover, embedding <b>zone</b> for watermarking has been selected {{in such a way}} that no watermark can be inserted in the foreground object to avoid perceptible artefacts. Also, a novel watermark embedding policy is used to insert the watermark with the depth of the 3 D video to resist the view synthesis as well as video compression attack and temporal scalable attack on the depth sequences. A comprehensive set of experiments is carried out to justify the robustness of the proposed scheme...|$|R
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of single-layer graphene are modeled from perspectives ranging from density functional theory (DFT) to finite element-based large-deformation continuum mechanics of membranes and their mechanical interactions with substrates and indentors. A novel hyperelastic constitutive formulation for the membrane response of graphene is based on joint invariants of the log strain measure and the 6 th-order structure tensor comprising the C 6 v symmetry group of unstretched planar graphene; the resulting formulation leads to simple functional forms that accurately capture the constitutive response inferred from current and prior DFT simulations up to “large” elastic strain, along with transparent assessments of the eventual loss of strong elipticity. DFT perturbation methods provide phonon dispersion relations for the three acoustic and three optical phonons of a two-atom primitive cell in both reference and deformed configurations. Related symmetry-based coordinates are used to interpolate phonon dispersion relations over deformed <b>invariant</b> Brillouin <b>zones,</b> providing independent insights into the stability of deformed graphene with respect to both long wavelength elastic instabilities as well as soft modes having zero frequency at a nonzero wavevector. Mechanical interaction of graphene with substrates such as amorphous silica or contacting diamond nanoindentor tips occurs primarily through van der Waals interactions, which were quantified through interface traction/separation relations fit {{to a number of}} types of available experimental data, including self-tensioning of suspended membranes, blister delamination, and pull-in of pressurized membranes, with the resulting continuum finite elment simulations being in good agreement with experimental observations. Finite element simulations of the nanoindentation of suspended graphene membrane are generally in agreement with prior work by Kysar and coworkers, but the author offers new insights based on DFT and MD studies that may better explain the processes leading to final tearing failure beneath a diamond nanoindenter...|$|R
40|$|In de Broglie {{geometry}} the Hilbert space, {{where the}} Hamilton operator acts, is decomposed into <b>invariant</b> subspaces, alias <b>zones,</b> which are separately investigated both from mathematical and physical points of views. The points are non-existing objects on a zone. They rather appear as wave packets (point spreads) there. This implies that also the particles {{living in a}} zone are extended ones. Rigorous mathematics shows that quantities appearing as infinities on the total Hilbert space are finite ones on the zonal setting. It {{is well known that}} the appearance of infinities in the quantum theory is ultimately due to contradictory concepts such as the point mass and/or point charge. De Broglie geometry ostracizes these infinities by throwing out the point concept and compelling the particles to spread out all over the whole space. Since these zonal particles can locally interact with the magnetic field present in the AB-solenoid, this model gives a relativistically satisfactory explanation for the Aharanov Bohm effect. The zones are constructed with particular vector potentials. General vector potentials do not define zonal decomposition, thus the zonal structure is not a gaugeinvariant concept. The zones attribute physical meaning to the potential by which the...|$|R
40|$|International audience[1] DEMETER (Detection of Electromagnetic Emissions Transmitted From Earthquake Regions) was a three-axis {{stabilized}} Earth-pointing spacecraft {{launched on}} 29 June 2004 into a low-altitude (710 km) polar and circular orbit that was subsequently lowered to 650 km {{until the end}} of the mission in December 2010. DEMETER measured electromagnetic waves all around the Earth, except in the auroral <b>zones</b> (<b>invariant</b> latitude > 65 °). The frequency range for the electric field was from DC up to 3. 5 MHz, and for the magnetic field, it was from a few hertz up to 20 kHz. At its altitude, the phenomena observed on the E field and B field spectrograms recorded during nighttime by the satellite in the very low frequency range are mainly dominated by whistlers. In a first step, the more intense whistlers have been searched. They correspond to the most powerful lightning strokes occurring below DEMETER. Then, it is shown that this intense lightning activity is able to perturb the electron and ion densities at the satellite altitude (up to 133 %) during nighttime. These intense lightning strokes are generally associated with transient luminous events, and one event with many sprites recorded on 17 November 2006 above Europe is reported. Examining the charged particle precipitation, it is shown that this density enhancement in the high ionosphere can be related to the energetic particle precipitation induced by the strong whistlers emitted during a long-duration thunderstorm activity at the same location.
