40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effect on the S. N. F. {{percentage}} of milk of three types of rations, namely, heavy concentrates, heavy <b>dry</b> <b>roughage</b> and heavy succulent rations, when these were feel throughout the lactation period. The total digestible nutrients and the protein intakes of the three rations were in excess of the maintenance and production requirements of the cows in the groups. These nutrients were somewhat less {{in the case of the}} heavy <b>dry</b> <b>roughage</b> and heavy succulent rations than in the heavy concentrate ration. The results obtained reveal that: (a) when a heavy concentrate ration was fed the S. N. F. percentage of the milk followed the ordinary trend with the advance of stage of lactation, (b) when heavy <b>dry</b> <b>roughage</b> and heavy succulent rations were given, there appears to have been a depressing effect on the S. N. F. percentage. The milk production of the cows on the heavy concentrate ration did not drop as fast as the productions of those on the heavy <b>dry</b> <b>roughage</b> and heavy succulent rations. On the other hand the B. F. percentage of the cows on the former ration did not increase to the same extent as that of the cows on the latter two rations, but this was probably due to the slower decline in milk production of the former.

Materials and Methods: Primary {{data was collected}} through specially structured proforma by personal interview method from the horse owners of Hanumangarh (50), Churu (42), Jhunjhunu (30) and Jalore (40) districts of Rajasthan, India. Results: The district (Churu and Jhunjhunu) is mostly rain fed, Hanumangarh is canal-irrigated whereas Jalore is tube well irrigated. Majority of respondents engaged in horse rearing were of other backward class (OBC) & general category. Literacy (%) among the horse owners was more than 80 % in Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts, whereas {{it was less than}} 50 % in Churu and Jalore districts. Majority of the respondents were maintaining other livestock along with the horses. The average <b>dry</b> <b>roughages</b> provided were 4. 82 ± 0. 22, 8. 143 ± 0. 348, 5. 267 ± 0. 69 and 6. 105 ± 0. 196 kg per horse in Hanumangarh, Churu, Jhunjhunu and Jalore, respectively.

It was observed that horse owners were providing green fodder, <b>dry</b> <b>roughages</b> and concentrate depending up on the availability/production of these items in that region. Majority of horse owners were allowing covering of estrus mares between 3 rd and 5 th day of estrus. Paucity of quality stallions for covering the mares was observed throughout the area surveyed. The respondents had to pay between Rs. 1100 /- to 5100 /- as covering fee with no guarantee of conception. Most of mares were rebred during foal heat and majority of the respondents were not aware about the symptoms of estrus mare. Vaccination, insurance and use of disinfectants were not adopted in the study indicating the least awareness among the horse owners about the importance of vaccination, insurance and disinfectants.

Although, database based taxonomic profiling provides snapshots of the metagenome architecture, their reliability needs to be validated through more accurate methods. Here, we performed qPCR based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in the liquid and solid fraction of the rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to green or <b>dry</b> <b>roughages</b> and compared with the MG-RAST based annotation of the metagenomes sequences of 16 S r-DNA amplicons and high throughput shotgun sequencing. Animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio {{in the proportion of}} 50 : 50, 75 : 25 and 100 : 00, respectively for six weeks. At the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 3  h post feeding. qPCR revealed that the relative abundance of Prevotella bryantii was higher, followed by the two cellulolytic bacteria Fibrobacter succinogens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens that accounted up to 1.33 % and 0.78 % of the total rumen bacteria, respectively. While, Selenomonas ruminantium and archaea Methanomicrobiales were lower in microbial population in the rumen of buffalo. There was no statistically significant difference between the enumerations shown by qPCR and analysis of the shotgun sequencing data by MG-RAST except for Prevotella. These results indicate the variations in abundance of different microbial species in buffalo rumen under varied feeding regimes as well as in different fractions of rumen liquor, i.e. solid and the liquid. The results also present the reliability of shotgun sequencing to describe metagenome and analysis/annotation by MG-RAST.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} were tested for their efficiency in extracting adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) from strained rumen fluid (SRF). Extraction with 0. 6 N H 2 SO 4, using {{a modification of}} the procedure described by Lee et al. (1971), was the most efficient and was better suited for extracting particulate samples. Neutralized extracts could not be stored frozen before assaying for ATP because large losses were incurred. The inclusion of internal standards was necessary to correct for incomplete recovery of ATP. The ATP concentration in rumen contents from a cow receiving a ration of <b>dried</b> <b>roughage</b> (mainly alfalfa hay) ranged from 31 to 56 μg of ATP per g of contents. Approximately 75 % of the ATP {{was associated with the}} particulate material. The ATP was primarily of microbial origin, since only traces of ATP were present in the feed and none was found in “cell-free” rumen fluid. Fractionation of the bacterial and protozoal populations in SRF resulted in the isolation of an enriched protozoal fraction with a 10 -fold higher ATP concentration than that of the separated rumen bacteria. The ATP pool sizes of nine functionally important rumen bacteria during the exponential phase of growth ranged from 1. 1 to 17. 6 μg of ATP per mg of dry weight. This information indicates that using ATP as a measure of microbial biomass in rumen contents must be done with caution because of possible variations in the efficiency of extraction of ATP from rumen contents and differences in the concentration of ATP in rumen microbes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Deficiency of macro and micro-minerals in the ration {{of dairy}} cows {{adversely}} affects growth, milk production and reproduction efficiency. It {{is essential to}} examine mineral concentrations in feeds offered to dairy cows in practical farms. Methods Two villages from each taluka were selected at random for taking representative samples of feeds, forages and hair. Within the village, help was sought from village milk producers and district animal husbandry officer for identification of 4 to 5 farmers and collection of representative samples. All the samples were processed and analyzed for chemical composition as well as major macro and micro-minerals, using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer. Results Ca content in wheat straw (0. 29 %), crushed maize (0. 02 %) and wheat bran (0. 12 %) {{was found to be}} below the critical level (0. 30 %). The P content in concentrate ingredients was high (0. 26 – 0. 96 %), but low in <b>dry</b> <b>roughages</b> (0. 06 – 0. 12 %). Cereal straws (0. 14 %) and grains (0. 12 %) were deficient in Mg. Feeds and forages were found to be adequate in K (1. 50 %). Cereals straws were found to be deficient in S (0. 11 %). Greens were good source of Cu (12. 02  ppm). Wheat straw was found to be low in Zn (18  ppm), but high in Mn (225  ppm) and Fe (509  ppm). Local grasses and azolla green were found to be rich source of Co (> 1. 00  ppm). Se (0. 63  ppm) was present in appreciable quantities in most of the feedstuffs. Conclusions From the present study, it was apparent that the feeds and forages available in the state of Jharkhand may not meet the requirements for Ca, P, Mg, Cu, Zn and Co in order to sustain a milk production of ~ 10  kg/day. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement these deficient minerals through area specific mineral mixture in the ration of dairy cows for improving productivity and reproduction efficiency...|$|R

Adjustment of roughage intake for differences in metabolic body weight changed the heritability to 0. 19. Feed efficiency was calculated as gross feed efficiency and as residual feed intake (RFI). RFI is feed intake-adjusted for maintenance and daily gain and reflects differences between animals in efficiency of using energy. The heritability estimate was 0. 18 for gross feed efficiency and 0. 22 for RFI.

Low rumen pH values have been recorded for cows grazing these pastures even when supplemented {{with low levels of}} concentrate. The rumen environment and extent of rumination may therefore be sub-optimal. Supplementation of the pasture with <b>dry</b> <b>roughage</b> may improve rumination, the rumen environment and therefore also milk production performance. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine if strategic supplementation of lucerne hay will improve milk production, milk composition and the rumen environment of cows grazing high quality kikuyu/ryegrass during spring and receiving low levels of concentrate. Forty eight high producing Jersey cows were blocked and randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: control (no supplemental roughage), supplementation of 1. 0 kg lucerne hay and supplementation of 2. 0 kg lucerne hay after morning milking. Cows received 5 kg of dairy concentrate per day during milking. Cows grazed as one group and pasture was allocated to ensure a post grazing height of 10 - 12 on the rising plate meter (5 - 6 cm). The average post grazing pasture height for the experimental period was 10. 83 ± 1. 68 (n= 73) on the RPM (5. 42 cm). There were no differences (P > 0. 10) between the treatments for 4 % fat corrected milk production, which were 22. 2 kg/d for the control, and 22. 5 kg/d and 22. 9 kg/d for the 1 kg and 2 kg lucerne treatments respectively. Milk fat and protein percentage was not affected (P > 0. 10) by supplementation of lucerne hay. The milk lactose content of cows receiving the control and 1 kg lucerne hay treatments were higher (P 0. 10) between treatments in overall mean pH, measured with either the logging systems or with the portable pH meters averaging 6. 18 and 6. 11 for cows receiving the control and the 2 kg lucerne treatment respectively. The mean rumen NH 3 -N did not differ (P > 0. 10) between treatments. The mean concentration of acetic acid and the total VFA concentration was higher (P 0. 10) between treatments in the DM or NDF disappearance of ryegrass after 24 hours. Supplementation of lucerne hay to cows grazing well managed kikuyu-ryegrass pasture during spring did not improve milk production, milk composition, rumen pH or in situ NDF disappearance of ryegrass Results suggest that cows grazing kikuyu/ryegrass pastures supplemented with low levels of concentrate consume sufficient eNDF to maintain a favourable rumen environment and normal milk composition.

Twenty-four young Nellore bulls with 321 ± 23 kg initial body weight, at 22 months of age, were used in a completely randomized experimental design with treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement and six replicates. Dry matter intake (21. 71 g/kg of body weight), average daily gain (1. 46 kg/day), and cold carcass weight (232. 59 kg) were not changed by proportion of sugarcane or BMB level. The proportions of sugarcane and BMB levels did not change the apparent digestibility of the diets, except the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber, which was lower in the diet associating the lowest levels of sugarcane and BMB. Increasing proportions of sugarcane reduced subcutaneous fat thickness from 2. 89 to 1. 91 mm. Carcass commercial primal cuts were not affected by variation factors. Inclusion of babassu mesocarp bran enables the use of larger proportions of sugarcane as a result of the increased digestibility of the fiber fraction of feedlot cattle diets without changing the performance and main carcass traits of these animals...|$|R

A total of 160 dairy cattle holding households were selected by systematic random sampling technique. The study employed multiple methods of data analysis including descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, T-test and qualitative analysis. Majority of the urban dairy farmers depend on hay, crop residues and concentrates for feeding their dairy cattle. Whereas, the peri-urban dairy farmers rely on <b>dry</b> and green <b>roughages</b> but less on concentrate feeds. In the urban areas, pipe water was the most common water source for the dairy cattle whereas, in the peri-urban areas, the use of river was very high. Significantly (P< 0. 05) better watering frequency was observed in urban than peri-urban areas. Access to veterinary services was significantly (P< 0. 05) better in urban areas than the peri-urban areas. About 44 % of the peri-urban dairy farmers trek their dairy cattle more than 6 km in searching veterinary services. Waste management was relatively problematic in urban areas (36. 25 %) as compared to the peri-urban areas (13. 75 %). There is also promising urban-peri-urban linkage in dairy product and by-product supply.

This paper focuses on the genetic parameters for feed intake, production, and efficiency of lactating heifers. Measurements of feed intake, body weight and production were taken on 360 heifers during the first 105 days of lactation. The heifers were progeny of 38 sires; 125 of the heifers also had measurements on their dam. Heifers were fed a diet of 6 kg of concentrates and roughage ad libitum. Genetic parameters were estimated by REML fitting an animal model using a derivative-free algorithm. Heritability for <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter intake was 0. 46.

Though statistically higher (P<. 05), no biologically significant levels of lactate were found for either DRC or WSC. This study indicates that adding roughage or feeding WSC vs DRC reduces the propensity for subacute acidosis...|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{protocol}} {{for the national}} inventory estimates the methane emission of the average Dutch dairy cow based on a Tier 3 approach. A dynamic, mechanistic model is used to represent the enteric fermentation processes, using annual national statistics on feed intake and feed composition as model inputs. Dutch dairy rations are based mainly on roughage (3 / 4 of dry matter ingested) with {{a high proportion of}} grass products (2 / 3 of <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter). Between 1990 and 2008, there were continuous increases in dry matter intake, milk production and enteric methane emission. Methane emission ranged from 111 to 129 kg/cow/year, and from 17. 6 to 15. 4 g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk. The present study indicates that uncertainties in the feed intake level and the proportion and composition of grass products contribute to the variation in predicted methane emission. In addition, internal model equations also greatly contribute to the uncertainty (representation of rumen acidity and yield of volatile fatty acids). The greatest part of the uncertainty in the methane emission factor (kg methane/cow/year) is determined by the uncertainty in the feed intake and stoichiometry of volatile fatty acid production, while the greatest part of the uncertainty in the methane conversion factor (methane energy as % of gross energy intake) is determined by the stoichiometry of volatile fatty acid production in combination with the acidity of rumen digesta. Although the applicability of national statistics as model inputs can be investigated relatively easily in follow-up studies, physiological research with dairy cattle will be required to fully validate the current internal model equations...|$|R
40|$|Four, rumen fistulated cattle were {{randomly}} assigned according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The experiment was to study effects of crude saponins and condensed tannins in mangosteen peel on rumen microorganisms and fermentation, microbial protein synthesis and nutrient digestibility in cattle. The dietary treatments were as follows: T 1 = Control (without Mangosteen peel supplementation, MSP); T 2 = 50 g DM of MSP/hd/d; T 3 = 100 g DM of MSP/hd/d; T 4 = 150 g DM of MSP/hd/d with urea-treated rice straw (UTS) fed ad libitum. <b>Roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter intakes in terms of kg/d and %BW were slightly higher in 100 gDM/hd/d supplemented cattle. Apparent digestibilities (%) of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF were similar among treatments. The values of ruminal temperature, pH, NH 3 -N and BUN were not significantly affected by MSP supplementation. However, MSP supplementation increased bacterial population, and was highest at 150 gDM /hd /d supplementation. The protozoal population was significantly decreased while fungal zoospore populations were not changed, and were highest at the 100 gDM/hd/d supplementation group. However, lower values of TVFAs and C 2 /C 3, and higher proportions of C 3 were found at 100 gDM/hd/d of MSP supplemented than in the control group. In addition, microbial nitrogen supply, efficiency of rumen microbial protein synthesis and P /E ratio tended to be higher in MSP supplemented groups and were highest at 100 gDM /hd /d MSP supplementation. These results suggest that MSP supplementation at 100 - 150 gDM/hd/d {{could be used as}} a dietary source to manipulate rumen ecology thus improving rumen fermentation and potential productivity in cattle...|$|R
40|$|Selection {{applied to}} populations of dairy cattle has {{produced}} a genetic increase in milk production. This will be increased further in the Netherlands {{by the introduction of}} Holstein Friesians. In general the high yielding cow is not capable of taking in enough nutrients to meet the requirements for maintenance and milk production. However the knowledge of the variation in feed intake between animals is limited. It requires detailed observations on each cow. The variation in feed intake and production characteristics has been studied mostly on feeding regimes with concentrates fed according to milk production. Both characteristics were confounded in that situation. However, feeding systems with concentrates independent of the milk yield, e. g., a fixed concentrate level for all the individuals, and ad libitum roughage shows a variation in milk yield dependenton the variation in roughage intake, mobilization or deposition of body reserves and/or utilization of nutrients. At present decisions were taken in selection programs m the desirable characteristics of the dairy cow over 10 or 12 years. The present selection is based on performance on a high concentrate level. Enviromnental circumstances such as nutrient supply (roughage/concentrates) may be changed and the mechanisms for regulating the feed intake may vary according to its digestibility. In addition, the import of semen of Holstein Friesians is increasing in the Netherlands. The Dutch Friesians and the Holstein Friesians show a genetic difference for milk production and the subpopulations were selected in different enviromnental circumstances. Reports of the importance of a genotype-ration interaction with different dairy breeds in temperate zones were not found in the literature. This study describes the variation in feed intake (energy and roughage) and production characteristics (milk production and composition, and live weight) for two subpopulations dependent on the ration. The importance of the genotyperation interaction for these characteristics was also tested. These objectives were studied in an experiment over two successive lactations (experiments I and II) and in the dry period between these two experiments. The two subpopulations were characterized as Dutch Friesian (DF) and the crosses between Holstein- and Dutch Friesians (HF). In the first experiment the cows were in their second or later lactation. The analysis of the preceding lactation and the lactation as heifers (concentrates fed according to milk yield) resulted in a contrast between subpopulations of - 974 (15. 2 %) and - 813 kg (14. 0 %) respectively. The rations contained ad libitum roughage (experiment I - hay; dry period and experiment II - grass silage) and the amount of concentrates was independent of the milk production and restricted to the treatment. A low (Roughage group) and a high concentrate level (Concentrate group) were used in the two experiments. The concentrates were allocated over the lactation in three fixed steps (figure 3. 1) and the total concentrate intake per lactation for the roughage and concentrate groups was approximately 570 and 2310 kg respectively. During the dry period all cows were offered ad libitum roughage and, in the last 6 weeks before calving, 1 kg concentrates per day. The carry-over effects from the first to the second experiment were studied on a ration change for all the individuals (roughage to concentrate group and the reverse). Full lactation data were analysed from 91 cows in the first experiment and these were allocated over the four genotype-ration groups: DF- Roughage 23, DF-Concentrate 22, HF-Roughage 23 and HF-Concentrate 23. The total number in the second experiment and the dry period was 64 (DF- Roughage 16, DF-Concentrate 18, HF-Roughage 17 and HF-Concentrate 13). Energy and roughage intake. The energy intake was calculated on the roughage and concentrate intake. The <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter intake was recorded for individual cows on four successive days every 3 or 4 weeks during the lactation and every 2 weeks during the <b>dry</b> period. The <b>roughage</b> offered was analysed weekly for in-vitro digestibility and composition. The concentrate intake was determined daily and the estimated feeding value was 940 VEM kg - 1 (1 VEM = 6. 904 k net energy). The maximum average energy intake for the roughage and concentrate groups was 14631 and 18988 VEM d - 1 . The energy intake of the roughage groups in the first and second experiments was approximately 3372 (21 %) and 4269 VEM d - 1 (27 %) lower than that of the concentrate groups. The carry-over effect was shown in the second experiment but the ration effect of the first experiment was not significant during the <b>dry</b> period. The <b>roughage</b> groups had a longer time and level of underfeeding during the first experiment in comparison with the concentrate groups. A feeding regime with the same concentrate level for all the individuals during the dry period did not indicate compensation by a higher roughage intake. The contrast between rations (Roughage-Concentrate) for <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter intake in the first and second experiments was 2. 9 (22 %) (overall mean: 11. 7) and 2. 1 kg d - 1 (17 %) (overall mean: 11. 5) respectively. These results showed that the rations produced different nutritional environments. The genotype effect was significant (P ≤ 0. 05) only at the end of both experiments and the contrasts between DF and HF groups for energy intake in the first and second experiments were - 408 (3 %) and - 516 VEM d - 1 (3 %) respectively. The contrasts for the <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter intake were - 0. 5 (4 %) and - 0. 6 kg d - 1 (5 %) respectively. The interaction between genotype and ration was not significant (P> 0. 05) during the two experiments and the dry period. The coefficient of variation (adjusted for number of lactation, season and days open) for <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter intake during the two experiments was approximately 7 % with the lowest values in the mid stage of lactation. This stage had also the highest repeatabilities between the experiments (+ 0. 49 - + 0. 74 for the four genotype-ration groups). Milk production and components. The milk production and composition for each cow were determined once a week. The adjusted coefficient of variation for total milk yield (app. 10 %) was lower in the first experiment than in the preceding lactation (app. 14 %) (table 5. 1). The contrasts between the two subpopulations were also smaller. In the first experiment this contrast was 594 kg (10. 1 %) (overall mean: 5596) and in the second 407 kg (7. 2 %) (overall mean: 5416) in favour of the HF group. The HF group showed a higher persistency in production during the experiments. However the smaller peak yield contrast combined with greater persistency was still not sufficient to reach the differences expected between genotypes in total yield. The allocation of the concentrates over the cows (dependent or independent of milk production) in feeding systems with ad libitum roughage has an influence on the coefficient of variation in total milk yield. The expression of the differences between subpopulations in total milk yield and the phenotypic variation was smaller in a system of a fixed concentrate level for individuals independent of the milk yield. The genotype contrasts (DF-HF) (10 g kg - 1 d - 1 ) in the two experiments were, for milk fat, + 0. 21 and + 0. 32 respectively and for milk protein, + 0. 08 and + 0. 05. These results caused the contrasts for the milk energy equivalence (FPCM = (0. 349 + 0. 107 Milk Fat percentage + 0. 067 Milk Protein percentage) x Milk Yield) to be smaller than for milk yield (7. 7 % and 3. 7 %). The ration had a clear effect on the milk yield and fat protein corrected milk yield (FPCM) in the two experiments (app. 20 % - 1250 kg). As a result of the difference in milk fat to milk protein ratio between the rations during the lactation the contrasts for FPCM were smaller in the early stage of the lactation compared with the milk production, but at the end the position was reversed. The average components over the total lactation were not significantly (P> 0. 05) affected by the ration. A carry-over effect for milk yield was shown {{at the beginning of the}} second experiment but it was compensated at the end (table 5. 2). The genotype-ration interaction was not significant (P> 0. 05) for the total lactation milk production characteristics and generally also during the lactation. Live weight change. The live weight of the individuals during the first experiment was accurately fitted by a model with the following parameters: level, time of minimum live weight during the lactation, maximum live weight losses and a pregnancy parameter. The maximum live weight losses (including variation per group) was clearly influenced by the ration (DF- Roughage - 71 kg, DF-Concentrate - 41 kg, HF-Roughage - 64 kg, HF-Concentrate - 50 kg). The cows on the low concentrate level had a greater live weight loss and for a longer time of the lactation than the cows on the high concentrate level. The live weight level and the maximum losses were more highly correlated for the roughage groups than for the concentrate groups (Roughage: - 0. 79 and - 0. 57; Concentrate: - 0. 22 and - 0. 38). A carry-over effect was clearly shown in the second experiment. The live weight change in weeks 1 - 12 in the two experiments were, for the roughage groups, - 66 and - 71 kg respectively and for the concentrate groups - 37 and - 16 kg. Differences between ration groups at the end of the first experiment were not compensated in the dry period. The effect of the genotype and the interaction between genotype and ration were small and not significant (P> 0. 05) during the experiments. Difference between energy intake and requirement. This characteristic was based on the energy intake and the requirements for maintenance and milk production. A deficiency in energy existed at the beginning of the lactation. The energy equilibrium in the first experiment was reached between weeks 6 and 9 and weeks 9 and 12 for the concentrate and roughage rations respectively. The second experiment showed a carry-over effect for the time of reaching energy equilibrium. The energy deficiency resulted in a high ratio of FPCM yield to energy input at the beginning of the lactation and the lack had to be compensated by the mobilization of body reserves. No close relationship between live weight losses and the difference between energy intake and requirement was observed. This was in accordance with the literature. Relationships between production characteristics. The analysis of the relations between characteristics was confined to energy supply and demand processes namely fat protein corrected milk, live weight, live weight change and energy intake. The coefficients of correlation and a multiple regression analysis with (FPCM as dependent variable were calculated within a genotype-ration group. The general relation between live weight, (FPCM and energy intake during the lactation in the first experiment per genotype-ration group was presented in figure 4. 19. These curves were based on a model with the parameters mentioned in the section on live weight change. The roughage groups showed a closer relation between FPCM yield and energy intake than the concentrate groups (correlation coefficients total lactation: + 0. 78 and + 0. 58). The relation between live weight change and FPCM also showed a. difference between the rations but the values of the concentrate groups were higher than those of the roughage groups. In summary the relations were more dependent on the ration than on the genotype. The concentrate level and the allocation of concentrates to individuals have an influence on the relationships. Knowledge of the genetic parameters is only available for systems of feeding concentrates according to milk yield. Parameter estimates on different feeding systems and the relationships between characteristics of the performance test of the young bull and his lactating daughers are necessary for predicting the response to selection in different environments. In addition to these analyses the coefficients of correlation between these charachteristics and the ratio FPCM to energy intake (efficiency) were presented in the discussion. The efficiency was highly correlated with FPCM (a tendency for a ration difference) but the values for efficiency and energy intake were low. However, the economic importance of the energy intake is in the exchange between roughage and concentrates. This was illustrated by two price ratios per net energy from roughage and concentrates. The same prices for both sources showed a difference between milk production returns and feed costs per cow in favour of the high concentrate ration. A price ratio of 1 : 2 (roughage : concentrates) resulted in the reverse ranking of the two rations...|$|R
40|$|Equations for {{predicting}} the meat, fat and bone proportions in beef carcasses using the European Union carcass classification scores for conformation and fatness, and hindquarter composition were developed and their accuracy {{was tested using}} data from 662 cattle. The animals included bulls, steers and heifers, and comprised of Holstein–Friesian, early- and late-maturing breeds x Holstein–Friesian, early-maturing X early-maturing, late-maturing X early-maturing and genotypes with 0. 75 or greater late-maturing ancestry. Bulls, heifers and steers were slaughtered at 15, 20 and 24 months of age, respectively. The diet offered before slaughter includes grass silage only, grass or maize silage plus supplementary concentrates, or concentrates offered ad libitum plus 1 kg of <b>roughage</b> <b>dry</b> matter per head daily. Following the slaughter, carcasses were classified mechanically for conformation and fatness (scale 1 to 15), and {{the right side of}} each carcass was dissected into meat, fat and bone. Carcass conformation score ranged from 4. 7 to 14. 4, 5. 4 to 10. 9 and 2. 0 to 12. 0 for bulls, heifers and steers, respectively; the corresponding ranges for fat score were 2. 7 to 11. 5, 3. 2 to 11. 3 and 2. 8 to 13. 3. Prediction equations for carcass meat, fat and bone proportions were developed using multiple regression, with carcass conformation and fat score both included as continuous independent variables. In a separate series of analyses, the independent variable in the model was the proportion of the trait under investigation (meat, fat or bone) in the hindquarter. In both analyses, interactions between the independent variables and gender were tested. The predictive ability of the developed equations was assed using cross-validation on all 662 animals. Carcass classification scores accounted for 0. 73, 0. 67 and 0. 71 of the total variation in carcass meat, fat and bone proportions, respectively, across all 662 animals. The corresponding values using hindquarter meat, fat and bone in the model were 0. 93, 0. 87 and 0. 89, respectively. The bias of the prediction equations when applied across all animals was not different from zero, but bias did exist among some of the genotypes of animals present. In conclusion, carcass classification scores and hindquarter composition are accurate and efficient predictors of carcass meat, fat and bone proportions. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of eucalyptus (E. Camaldulensis) crude oils (EuO) supplementation on voluntary feed intake and rumen fermentation characteristics in swamp buffaloes. Four rumen fistulated swamp buffaloes, body weight (BW) of 420 ± 15. 0 kg, were randomly assigned according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. The dietary treatments were untreated rice straw (RS) without EuO (T 1) and with EuO (T 2) supplementation, and 3 % urea-treated rice straw (UTRS) without EuO (T 3) and with EuO (T 4) supplementation. The EuO was supplemented at 2 mL/h/d in respective treatment. Experimental animals were kept in individual pens and concentrate mixture was offered at 3 g/kg BW while roughage was fed ad libitum. Total <b>dry</b> matter and <b>roughage</b> intake, and apparent digestibilites of organic matter and neutral detergent fiber were improved (p 0. 05) affected by either roughage sources or EuO supplementation. However, buffaloes fed UTRS had higher ruminal ammonia nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen as compared with RS. Total volatile fatty acid and butyrate proportion were similar among treatments, whereas acetate was decreased and propionate molar proportion was increased by EuO supplementation. Feeding UTRS resulted in lower acetate and higher propionate concentration compared to RS. Moreover, supplementation of EuO reduced methane production especially in UTRS treatment. Protozoa populations were reduced by EuO supplementation while fungi zoospores remained the same. Total, amylolytic and cellulolytic bacterial populations were increased (p< 0. 01) by UTRS; However, EuO supplementation did not affect viable bacteria. Nitrogen intake and in feces were found higher in buffaloes fed UTRS. A positive nitrogen balance (absorption and retention) was in buffaloes fed UTRS. Supplementation of EuO did not affect nitrogen utilization. Both allantoin excretion and absorption and microbial nitrogen supply were increased by UTRS whereas efficiency of microbial protein synthesis was similar in all treatments. Findings of present study suggested that EuO {{could be used as a}} feed additive to modify the rumen fermentation in reducing methane production both in RS and UTRS. Feeding UTRS could improve feed intake and efficiency of rumen fermentation in swamp buffaloes. However, more research is warranted to determine the effect of EuO supplementation in production animals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationships between methane (CH 4) emission and fatty acids, volatile metabolites (V) and non-volatile metabolites (NV) in milk of dairy cows. Data from an experiment with 32 multiparous dairy cows and four diets were used. All diets had a roughage : concentrate ratio of 80 : 20 based on <b>dry</b> matter (DM). <b>Roughage</b> consisted of either 1000 g/kg DM grass silage (GS), 1000 g/kg DM maize silage (MS), or a mixture of both silages (667 g/kg DM GS and 333 g/kg DM MS; 333 g/kg DM GS and 677 g/kg DM MS). Methane emission was measured in climate respiration chambers and expressed as production (g/day), yield (g/kg dry matter intake; DMI) and intensity (g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk; FPCM). Milk was sampled during the same days and analysed for fatty acids by gas chromatography, for V by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and for NV by nuclear magnetic resonance. Several models were obtained using a stepwise selection of (1) milk fatty acids (MFA), V or NV alone, and (2) the combination of MFA, V and NV, based on the minimum Akaike’s information criterion statistic. Dry matter intake was 16. 8 ± 1. 23 kg/day, FPCM yield was 25. 0 ± 3. 14 kg/day, CH 4 production was 406 ± 37. 0 g/day, CH 4 yield was 24. 1 ± 1. 87 g/kg DMI and CH 4 intensity was 16. 4 ± 1. 91 g/kg FPCM. The observed CH 4 emissions were compared with the CH 4 emissions predicted by the obtained models, based on concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) analysis. The best models with MFA alone predicted CH 4 production, yield and intensity with a CCC of 0. 80, 0. 71 and 0. 69, respectively. The best models combining {{the three types of}} metabolites included MFA and NV for CH 4 production and CH 4 yield, whereas for CH 4 intensity MFA, NV and V were all included. These models predicted CH 4 production, yield and intensity better with a higher CCC of 0. 92, 0. 78 and 0. 93, respectively, and with increased accuracy (C b) and precision (r). The results indicate that MFA alone have moderate to good potential to estimate CH 4 emission, and furthermore that including V (CH 4 intensity only) and NV increases the CH 4 emission prediction potential. This holds particularly for the prediction model for CH 4 intensity...|$|R
