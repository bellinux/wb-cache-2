40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which {{institutional}} changes accompanying the transformative period from nationalism to interim self-government impact Palestinian women and their political struggles. The intention is to distinguish between categories of “woman” and “nationalist” in discussions about citizenship during the transition to “self-rule”. The main question I address is, what are the gendered implications of statebuilding and citizenship in Palestinian society? To answer this question, I rely predominantly upon issues and debates from material published by grassroots women’s organisations, including <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> <b>centres</b> and advocacy groups, along with interviews of organised women. Recent changes have had a differential impact on Palestinian men and women because of the penetration of long-standing networks of patriarchal power in the statebuilding process. They have also had a differential impact on Palestinian women depending upon their location on the political spectrum, i. e. as independents or as members of groups which support or oppose the PNA. The construction of citizenship is informed by experiences and discourses of national liberation, so I will begin by exploring the concept of gender in Palestinian nationalism, and then proceed to a discussion of women, statebuilding and citizenship in the Palestinian context...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effects of <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> programs, as perceived by teachers and principals, upon student control in selected secondary schools. The specific intention of collecting this data was to provide educators with useful information to help formulate ideas relative to <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> programs and student control. After the review of related literature on <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> and student control in secondary schools, a teacher questionnaire and a principal interview guide were developed for four schools located in the Northeast and Upper Wabash Study Councils of Ball State University. Also, Burris Laboratory School of Ball State University was included in the research because of the extensive <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> program conducted there, One hundred and thirty teachers responded to the questionnaire and five principals were interviewed. The study was designed to obtain teacher-principal perception of factors which influence <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> and student control. The data were analyzed and conclusions drawn from these perceptions to show the effects <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> had on student control. The questionnaire instrument developed for this study included six major categories and thirty-five specific questions. The six categories for teacher perception consisted of the following: (1) unscheduled time, (2) self-discipline, (3) decision making, (4) attendance, (5) interest in school activities, and (6) respect for school. A final item allowed the respondents to answer' an open-ended question pertaining to personal observations. The principal interview guide included ten open-ended questions covering the following topics: (1) positive aspects of <b>independent</b> <b>study,</b> (2) negative aspects of <b>independent</b> <b>study,</b> (3) direct effects of <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> of student control, (4) personal feelings concerning <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> as it relates to student control, (5) student rejective behavior while pursuing <b>independent</b> <b>study,</b> (6) student aggressive behavior while pursuing <b>independent</b> <b>study,</b> (7) student withdrawal behavior while pursuing <b>independent</b> <b>study,</b> and (8) student evasive behavior while pursuing <b>independent</b> <b>study.</b> Major findings of the research included the following: 1. <b>Independent</b> <b>study</b> programs were consistently perceived as having positively affected school attendance. General attendance was seen as good, while class cutting and truancy were indicated as being low. 2. The teachers indicated that students spent too much time roaming and talking in the hallways and wasting time in the student lounge. Principals agreed that time was misused by pupils roaming the hallways and groups congregating during free time. 3. The research data indicated that both teachers and principals perceived students to generally have poor selfdiscipline while participating in <b>independent</b> <b>study.</b> Peer group pressure was perceived to often cause student control problems and teachers believed more rules and regulations were needed for control purposes. Principals indicated poor selfdiscipline involved a minority of the students. 4. The teachers and principals perceived students as often making unwise decisions while pursuing <b>independent</b> <b>study.</b> It is their judgment that the younger students and the less academically talented students were not responsible enough to make the personal decisions necessary in <b>independent</b> <b>study.</b> 5. Teachers indicated that there was a tendency for student interest in subject matter to be high. Principals felt that student interest toward academic pursuits were greater under <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> programs. 6. Teachers indicated a feeling that student disrespect for authority was high. Principals indicated a feeling that better relationships existed between students and school staff. Student fighting and incorrigibility were not perceived as problems, although there was an indication that some vandalism did occur during student <b>independent</b> <b>study</b> time. Thesis (D.
