5|$|The {{band has}} also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly {{fill in for}} a show or two. Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled {{his way through the}} show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.|$|E

They do not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the members of team ALICE.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} claims that Sonboly {{deliberately}} targeted people of Turkish or Arab origin, groups he apparently felt had picked on him at school. The state government {{said that the}} victims were not chosen in any way and Sonboly did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them. Police {{thought it was a}} coincidence that all of the fatalities were of immigrant backgrounds, as the McDonald's near the shopping mall was patronised by the children of migrants.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|At school, Julia starts {{shouting}} at Miranda for letting Annemarie drink soda and eat sandwiches, saying that because Annemarie is epileptic {{she has to}} eat a special diet. Miranda explains that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> that. Colin is later hanging out with Sal. Colin then asks Miranda {{if she wants to}} hang out. Miranda declines saying that her mom is sick. Later on, someone taps on her door which scares her because she doesn't know anyone that knocks like that. She looks though the peep hole [...] and sees Colin. She opens the door and he looks at her then kisses her. She then kisses him back. Colin smiles and then runs off.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot of kind of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E
2500|$|The South Florida Sun-Sentinels book {{reviewer}} Chauncey Mabe {{says that}} it was wrong for Rowling to disclose Dumbledore's sexual orientation. Mabe was clear that this was not due to Dumbledore's being gay, but to his own objections to authors continuing to talk about their books after they are written. He called for Rowling to [...] "please be quiet, please" [...] in [...] "public gatherings", which is contrary to the massive popularity of Rowling's book talks and her fans' thirst for more information about characters in the Harry Potter books. Mabe notes that 1,000 children attended the [...] "reading" [...] before they were given autographed books. Robin Berkowitz, Sun-Sentinel Entertainment Editor says of Rowling's comments, and other revelations she might make about her characters [...] "We don't need to <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them to appreciate the books fully," [...] "Don't ask, don't spell" [...] a reference to the U.S. military's former policy on homosexuality, Don't ask, don't tell. These sentiments are mirrored by Jeffrey Weiss in his article, [...] "Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up", published in the Dallas Morning News.|$|E
