A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available.

They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are <b>dockable</b> and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging.|$|E
25|$|Geometric matching/ shape {{complementarity}} methods {{describe the}} protein and ligand {{as a set}} of features that make them <b>dockable.</b> These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptor’s molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligand’s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands {{in a matter of seconds}} and actually figure out whether they can bind at the protein’s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.|$|E

50|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging.

If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are <b>dockable</b> and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany of the {{modeling}} {{targets in the}} blind CASP- 11 /CAPRI- 30 experiment were protein homo-dimers and homo-tetramers. Here, we perform a retrospective docking-based analysis of the perfectly symmetrical CAPRI Round 30 targets whose crystal structures have been published. Starting from the CASP “stage- 2 ” fold prediction models, we show that using our recently developed “SAM” polar Fourier symmetry docking algorithm combined with NAMD energy minimization often gives acceptable or better 3 D models of the target complexes. We also use SAM to analyze {{the overall quality of}} all CASP structural models for the selected targets from a docking-based perspective. We demonstrate that docking only CASP “center” structures for the selected targets provides a fruitful and economical docking strategy. Furthermore, our results show that many of the CASP models are <b>dockable</b> {{in the sense that they}} can lead to acceptable or better models of symmetrical complexes. Even though SAM is very fast, using docking and NAMD energy minimization to pull out acceptable docking models from a large ensemble of docked CASP models is computationally expensive. Nonetheless, thanks to our SAM docking algorithm, we expect that applying our docking protocol on a modern computer cluster will give us the ability to routinely model 3 D structures of symmetrical protein complexes from CASP-quality models...|$|E
40|$|IIn December of 2006, TPI {{responded to}} two RFP's from NIOSH seeking {{technical}} proposals {{to design and}} build novel respirators {{for use in the}} mining industry. One RFP sought a <b>dockable,</b> self-contained, self-rescuer (SCSR) to allow for extended respiratory protection during mine escape, and the other was for a hybrid mine escape respirator incorporating both air-purifying, and self-contained types of respirators, also for the purpose of extending the time available for escaping miners to receive respiratory protection. TPI recognized a commonality in the two RFPs and responded to both with designs that could be produced independently, but which shared several fundamental features. In evaluating TPI's responses to the RFPs, NIOSH recognized a benefit in the shared design features and awarded one contract for TPI to pursue both concepts resulting in one conceptual product referred to as the dockable/hybrid SCSR. This SCSR would be configured to allow any suitably equipped breathing device (CO Filter Self Rescuer or another SCSR) to connect (dock) to the base unit and to allow the user to switch between them without 'breaking seal. ' This <b>dockable</b> unit would retain the capacity to accept multiple changes of O 2 supply or filters over an extended period as the useful life of any individual add-on unit is expended. As the project developed it resulted {{in the development of a}} new carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered Self-Rescuer (FSR) to dock to the SCSR and a small electronic sensor, the Breathing Air Monitor (BAM), to alert the user to certain hazards in the local ambient air: Self Contained Self Rescuer (SCSR). The TPI SCSR is a 60 -min compressed O 2 rebreather that protects the user from all adverse breathing conditions. TPI uses Micropore's Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) catalyst to absorb the retained CO 2. TPI's SCSR is supplied with a docking valve that allows users to change out nearly spent devices with fresh devices without breaking seal or having to hold their breath. Carbon Monoxide Filter Self-Rescuer (CO FSR). TPI also developed, via a supply agreement with 3 M Company, a carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered Self-Rescuer (FSR) that uses a proprietary precious metal catalyst providing 8 hours of protection. TPI's CO FSR can be supplied with a flanged fitting that docks to TPM's SCSR or it can be supplied with a mouthbit for use as a self-contained device for CO protection alone. Breathing Air Monitor (BAM). Finally TPI developed, in cooperation with the Kohler-Bright Star Company, a Breathing Air Monitor (BAM) that would give the user an indication of when it is necessary to use the SCSR because of an oxygen deficient environment and when it safe to use just the CO filter (normal O 2 but high CO) or if is safe to not use either. This warning system will avoid the user expending the breathing device unnecessarily (e. g. the atmosphere is still breathable). The resultant technology is a module containing the sensors, electronics, PC board and alarms that fits on the miner's cap lamp battery, between the body and top cap. By the end of this contract TPI had demonstrated prototypes of all three products. The project did not result in certified devices by the completion of the contract but TPI has negotiated licensing agreements for these three products and they are being prepared for certification submission by the licensee.

Through the use of a 12 -phase system all the vertical resolutions of the SMPTE 274 M and SMPTE 296 M standards are possible. Under software control (Dynamic Pixel Management ™) these pixels are pre-arranged, at the CCD, into image cells. The image diagonal (11 mm) is independent of spatial resolution and therefore the same for all scanning formats.

40|$|What {{will happen}} after the International Space Station’s {{operational}} lifetime ends? How could a future crewed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) platform look like with the lessons learnt from the ISS experience in mind? How could a future role share be organized and what use cases and applications could a future platform offer? What is the longterm big picture for future human LEO activities? These questions are currently under {{investigation in the}} course of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) “Post-ISS” activities. A very promising answer is proposed by the Orbital Hub concept which has been developed by DLR’s System Analysis Space Segment department in Bremen together with scientists, international space industry and recently together with international institutions using DLR’s Concurrent Engineering Facility. The concept consists of a small modular crewed part called Base Platform and a <b>dockable,</b> serviceable, but uncrewed experiment platform referred to as Free Flyer. One major advantage of such a scenario is the decoupling of the habitat and the payload platform leading to higher flexibility, reduced attitude and pointing restrictions as well as less security concerns. The single modules of the Orbital Hub have been designed under the premise of modularity and each with their own dedicated functionalities and responsibilities. Therefore, they could also be used as building blocks for different platform concepts together with modules from other international partners and re-used ISS parts to serve for diverse mission objectives and political requirements. In the long-term, the DLR vision is to have the Orbital Hub as a central node of a platform cluster building up an environment for resource sharing, exchange and collaboration in LEO, referred to as “Space City”. The present paper gives an overview about the technical design, development progress and ongoing activities around this concept including e. g. joint studies with international partners.
