50|$|<b>Handles</b> may be {{straight}} or bent. Straight <b>handles</b> make the pushing angle easier to adjust and snow throwing easier {{compared to a}} bent <b>handle.</b> Long <b>handles</b> enable the user to leverage their weight for pushing snow, but shorter <b>handles</b> make tossing snow easier. Plastic and fiberglass <b>handles</b> are lightweight, while wood <b>handles</b> are heavy. Metal <b>handles</b> conduct heat away from the hands more readily than other kinds of <b>handles,</b> so they feel colder.|$|R
40|$|Instrumented <b>handles</b> or dynamometers {{are widely}} used to measure hand forces and/or the biodynamic {{response}} of hand-arm system. To study hand-transmitted vibration exposure, six generations of instrument <b>handles</b> were constructed or initially developed by researchers in ECTB/HELD/NIOSH. This presentation provided a summary of these <b>handles.</b> Their basic characteristics, limitations, and usefulness are described, which may help their appropriate applications and further improvements. Six Designs of Instrumented <b>Handles</b> <b>Handle</b> 1 : The conceptual design is recommended in ISO 10819 (1996) 1 for glove test. The grip force is measured by detecting bending strains on a measuring beam in the <b>handle.</b> A special <b>handle</b> fixture was designed to connect the <b>handle</b> to a shaker. Except the screws, the <b>handle</b> and fixture were made from aluminum. <b>Handle</b> 2 : The design {{is based on the}} principle of shear strain measurement. 2 - 3 Both grip and push forces can be measured simultaneously using this <b>handle.</b> This <b>handle</b> was directly designed for a simulated vibrating tool. <b>Handle</b> 3 : This design is basically composed of a <b>handle</b> base, a measuring cap, and two charge-based sensors (Kistler 9212) sandwiched between the base and cap. The <b>handle</b> was also made from aluminum. The fixture for <b>Handle</b> 1 was also used with this <b>handle.</b> This generation of <b>handle</b> has three different <b>handle</b> diameters (30, 40, and 50 mm). 4 <b>Handle</b> 4 : This design is an improvement from <b>Handle</b> 3. The <b>handle</b> fixture was totally redesigned and it was much stiffer than the previous one. The aluminum measuring cap was replaced with a magnesium cap. <b>Handle</b> 5 : The basic structure of this <b>handle</b> is the same as that for <b>Handle</b> 3. However, the piezoelectric sensors were replaced with two strain gage based sensors (Interface SML- 50). <b>Handle</b> 6 : This <b>handle</b> includes two measuring caps, four piezoelectric sensors, and a <b>handle</b> centre base. The <b>handle</b> fixture was the same as that with <b>Handle</b> 4. Methods for <b>Handle</b> Examinations The static and dynamic characterizations were performed using the methods reported by Dong et al. 5 - 6 Results and Discussion <b>Handle</b> 1 : The static force measurement depended on the hand grip location on the <b>handle.</b> Its natural frequency was less than 200 Hz. 5, 6 Because the transmissibility of gloves may not vary significantly with the applied grip force, this <b>handle</b> may be acceptable for glove test. However, the force measurements with this <b>handle</b> may not be reliable. <b>Handle</b> 2 : The static force measured with this <b>handle</b> was insensitive to the hand acting location. However, when the <b>handle</b> was vibrating, the force signals could be totally distorted. For this reason, it was not used for vibration studies...|$|R

5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was <b>handled</b> by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI.

Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, character designs were <b>handled</b> by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy.

50|$|Implementation of the <b>Handle</b> System {{consists}} of Local <b>Handle</b> Services, {{each of which}} is made up of one or more sites that provide the servers that store specific <b>handles.</b> The Global <b>Handle</b> Registry is a unique Local <b>Handle</b> Service which stores information on the prefixes (also known as naming authorities) within the <b>Handle</b> System and can be queried to find out where specific <b>handles</b> are stored on other Local <b>Handle</b> Services within this distributed system.|$|R
50|$|The {{interoperable}} {{network of}} distributed <b>handle</b> resolver servers (also {{known as the}} Proxy Server System) are linked through a Global Resolver (which is one logical entity though physically decentralised and mirrored).

40|$|Background: The {{shape of}} laparoscopic {{instrument}} <b>handles</b> can cause physical discomfort. This {{problem may be}} ascribed {{to a lack of}} standards for instrument design. In this study, new ergonomic requirements for the design of laparoscopic dissection forceps were created. Three representative <b>handles</b> (a Karl Storz [click-line] scissors <b>handle,</b> an Access Plus scissors <b>handle,</b> and an Aesculap cylindrical <b>handle)</b> currently available on the market were evaluated according to the new list of ergonomic criteria. Materials and Methods: The <b>handles</b> were subjectively (questionnaire) and objectively (video analyses) tested in order to find out whether the new requirements are valid for the evaluation and design of instrument <b>handles.</b> Results: The outcome of the subjective and objective tests matched the predictions by the new criteria list. New criteria were introduced (neutral wrist excursions), and existing general criteria were specified (e. g., a minimal contact area of 10 mm). Significant differences were found among the three <b>handles.</b> The Storz <b>handle</b> met 8 of the 10 requirements, the Access <b>handle</b> met 5, and the Aesculap <b>handle</b> met only 4. Conclusions: The new list of ergonomic requirements is a valid tool to determine the ergonomic value of a <b>handle</b> for laparoscopic dissecting tasks. It gains its strength from its specialized character. Significant differences were found among the three tested <b>handles.</b> Cylindrical <b>handles</b> were inferior to scissors <b>handles.</b> Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{response}} {{describes the}} rate at which a predator consumes prey. <b>Handling</b> time, duration that a predator spends on a captured prey for the consumption, is one of the parameters of many functional response models. Although models typically assume that <b>handling</b> time is static, most empirical studies that directly quantified the relationship between <b>handling</b> time and prey density show that <b>handling</b> time decreases with prey density. In this study, I compare a community model that employs density-dependent <b>handling</b> time and a model with static <b>handling</b> time for their responses to enrichment. The density-dependent <b>handling</b> time is derived by assuming that predators adjust <b>handling</b> time to maximize their fitness. I show that the model with adaptive <b>handling</b> time is more robust to enrichment than the model with static <b>handling</b> time at realistic parameter values. Although community response to enrichment is used as an illustrative example, density-dependent <b>handling</b> time is a common empirical observation and would have general implications to ecological dynamics...|$|R
