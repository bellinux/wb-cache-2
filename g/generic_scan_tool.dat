40|$|Nowadays {{traditional}} traffic {{simulation models}} {{are becoming more}} complex and more detailed. Often policy questions do not require this level of details and needs faster answers than can be reach with traditional models. Of course traditional traffic simulation models are necessary for the evaluations of transportation alternatives. It is relevant to have next to these complex models, simpler models, such as quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools.</b> With quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> the effect of measurements/alternatives of infrastructure related projects in the strategic and tactical phase can be calculated. Among other things, there is need for quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> for the acceleration of the reconnaissance phase in the “Meerjarenprogramma Infrastructuur, Ruimte en Transport” (MIRT) projects. According to the Projectdirectie Sneller & Beter there are at this moment no suitable quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> for the MIRTprojects. From these findings the central problem follows that in current practice there is need for suitable quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives. In this thesis {{the objective is to}} develop a suitable quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives. To develop a suitable quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool,</b> first the application and requirements of quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> needs to be specified. Policy questions in the phase of mind setting and in the reconnaissance phase can be answered with quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools.</b> The application of quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> is at a high level of time, space and travel behaviour simplification. The policy questions can be mostly answered by the calculation of measures focussed at spatial planning, price policy, mobility management, public transport and the changing and extending of infrastructure. These measures require certain output. Quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> should provide at least information about mobility effects and a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> distinct from other tools and detailed models by also provide the economic, environmental and safety effects. One of the requirements of a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> is that it should fit the application. These and other requirements can be divided in functional, performance, quality, output and input requirements and wishes. A quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> differs from detailed models by the short computation time (performance requirement) and the low effort of the end users according to the interviewees. Low effort requires easy applicability and simple input. Other functional requirements are that quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> should at least determine the direct behavioural changes of a measure and be able to assess different alternatives. The quality requirements are transparency, fitting logical transportation relations, no conflicts with traffic flow theory and visualisation reliability of the output. The output should fit logical transport relations and should not be in contradiction with traffic flow theory. Also a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> should visualize the reliability of the output, because otherwise the tool will be used by the customers like the model can make accurate predictions. One of the output requirements is that a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> requires a clear visualisation, so a tool can be used easily. Further more simple input and wide support for the input is required. Next to this requirement, the desires of quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> are the connection with existing models and not only calculated the effect on mobility, but also other traffic related effects, such as environmental, economic and safety effects. Developing a new quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> requires the overview of the existing quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> to know the additional value of a new quick <b>scan</b> tool/method. Seventeen <b>tools</b> in the Netherlands and the United States are investigated. All the tools were in conflict with at least one requirement. The ScenarioVerkenner, Quick filter, Fast Simple Model and eventually also the Mobiliteitsscan are tools that meet almost all the requirements except visualisation of the reliability of the output. A new quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> should provide inside in the reliability of the output. The calculation of the measures for mobility management are hard to determine with the existing quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools.</b> Also from the existing quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools,</b> it could conclude that no tool at this moment can calculate reliable travel times and because of this economic effects. Besides a tool that provides insight in mobility, environment, economy and safety is more likely to succeed, because the calculation of other traffic related effects is a large advantage of a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> compared to detailed models. Also the high level of time, space and behaviour simplification is often missing in the existing quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools.</b> In a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> methods are used to meet the requirements of a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool.</b> The methods can simplify the data of time, space and travel behaviour. Time simplification can be done by choosing some time periods or taking the sum of multiple time periods. For the spatial simplification, zone simplification, route, link and node simplification can be used. Simplification exists of the simplification, selection or reduction of data or model elements. Also Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFD) can show the network performance. The MFD is a graph that reflects the outflow of a network compared to the accumulation. Simplified methods can be used to model the travel behaviour; trip generation, modal split, period of day and route assignment. Next to the simplification techniques some other methods can be used in quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools,</b> such as the incremental approach, elasticities, rules of thumps and demand and supply curves. With the incremental approach only the difference between the new situation and the reference scenario will be calculated without using an integral new equilibrium calculation. Another option is to calculated only the effects on roads with a certain traffic condition, such as congested roads. Elasticities and rules of thumb could make assumptions and so less calculation have to be made during the usage of a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool.</b> With demand and supply curves the equilibrium between price and demand can be calculated. From the application, requirements, existing tools opportunities and methods for the development of quick <b>scan</b> <b>tools</b> or method for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives follow. The high level of simplification can be reached by corridor models. Corridor models are models in which cities/regions are visualized by dots and vectors represent the flows between the dots. A corridor model requires simple input. Another opportunity that will decrease the computation time enormously is spatial simplification based on traffic states. This innovative method offers the chance to develop a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> that meets the requirements. In this research the method of spatial simplification based on traffic states is developed. With this method the effect of measures that affects the total network or measures that effects changes in a specific area can be calculated. For the calculation of the measures that affects the total network, only the effect of the measure on the amount of trips is required. This can be determined by elasticities. The method works with an approximation of traffic assignment by interpolation between the traffic flows on a link for two assignments. When using the tool the choice can be made to simulate only certain traffic states. With this link categorization the high level of simplification can be reached. For the measures that affect a specific area, on forehand the advisor needs to define this area and assign the traffic from and to the area, so the distribution is known. With interpolation the effect of the measures in the area will be determined. A disadvantage of the method is that measures that affect certain links cannot be calculated, because this requires a new equilibrium. The developed method meets the requirements. The method can be used under conditions for spatial planning, pricing policy, mobility management and the improvements of public transport. A disadvantage of the method is that it requires a detailed underlying model, so it could not be used when little data is available. The model is assessed for spatial planning and pricing policy in the Nationaal Verkeers Model 2. 0 (NVM 2. 0). The categorization is divided in congested links, critical links or insignificant links. The computation time is less than ten seconds for the calculation of the congested links and 30 seconds for all the links instead of 5000 seconds with the traditional assignment. So the computation time is short and the calculation of only the congested links can be used when visiting a customer and direct results are required. When an advisor is writing a report in the office, the calculation of the other links can also be interesting, but the high level of simplification will be reached by the link categorisation. Certainly the implementation in a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> will require some extra time to visualize the results. For the implementation of the method in a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool,</b> some recommendations are made. To calculate also the travel times correctly, another model than the NVM 2. 0, should be used. STAQ, the static assignment model of Goudappel Coffeng BV with the calculation of the effect of congestion and spillback, can be used. For a complete suitable quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> the effect of all the measures should be calculated. The calculation of the effect on the link loads can be calculated with the same scripts as for spatial planning and pricing policy. The used linear function works in the NVM 2. 0. It could be that another function will fit better the reality. So by the implementation in STAQ, the recommendation is to investigate this function. Also the opportunities for the calculation of measures that affects a certain link should be investigated. Overall the method of spatial simplification based on traffic condition with interpolation is a good basis of a suitable quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is gaining {{importance in the}} water sector. The evaluation of environmental impacts in the water sector asks for a holistic approach, in which all relevant factors are taken into account. Drinking water company Oasen is developing such a holistic model, named the Water Sustainability Diagram (WSD). This model evaluates the environmental impacts resulting from activities of Oasen. In order to evaluate all environmental impacts in the water cycle, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) should be included. For that reason, {{the aim of this}} research is to develop a quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> that is able to evaluate the environmental impacts of WWTPs while meeting Oasen’s preconditions: (I) the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> is made in Microsoft Excel, (II) gathering of data and setting the input of the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> can be done in one day and (III) the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> should score the impacts based on indices from zero to five. Consulting review papers and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are the starting point for identifying relevant environmental impacts and corresponding indicators. Complementary expert consultancy was conducted. The identified environmental impacts that the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> evaluates are: (I) climate change, (II) receiving water quality, (III) local nuisance and (IV) various impacts based on life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The corresponding indicators are (I) CO 2 -eq. emission, (II) Water Pollution Index (WPL), (III) local nuisance and (IV) ReCipe scores based on chemical use. To assess whether the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> can produce truthful results while meeting all of Oasen’s preconditions, four case studies are modelled: WWTPs Kralingseveer, Ammerstol, Soest and Amersfoort. Only WWTPs Kralingseveer and Ammerstol could be fully evaluated, but only some minor adjustments in evaluating the environmental impacts in sludge treatment are required to ensure all existing WWTPs could be evaluated. The quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> largely meets Oasen’s preconditions, yet a definitive scoring system has not been developed for the CO 2 -eq. and ReCipe scores. Although a full validation of the results was not possible, due to the structure and calculations in the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> it is expected that the environmental impacts are evaluated truthfully when the input data is reliable. However, in the evaluation of direct N 2 O emission, which can be a considerable part of the total CO 2 -eq. emission, uncertainty remains. No scientifically sound method for evaluating N 2 O emission has been identified, therefore it is recommended to further research for this. The quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool’s</b> value is questionable for non-existing WWTPs, because estimation of input parameters will most likely cost a considerable amount of time and decrease its reliability compared with actual data. This applies especially because the parameters in the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> are modelled as if being independent from each other, while in reality they are at least partly (co) dependent. The emergence of new technologies or future changes in WWTPs will therefore be difficult to evaluate with the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool.</b> Two other drawbacks are, firstly, the lack of expertise Oasen has on WWTPs, which makes them fully dependent on collaboration with others (e. g. water boards) and, secondly, the arbitrariness of the local nuisance and half of its magnitude is most likely not distinguishable between case studies. In conclusion, although that the quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> is in itself not (completely) new for science, especially in the evaluation of impacts on climate change and ReCipe scores, it is a tailor-made quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool</b> that evaluates the most important environmental impacts of WWTPs in a quick manner. It can be fully integrated into the WSD with only few adjustments, yet Oasen {{should be aware of the}} quick <b>scan</b> <b>tool’s</b> limitations...|$|R
