40|$|The {{major goal}} of this {{document}} is to evaluate {{the current status of}} molecular genetics research in species of domestic animals. In 2000, FAO made public a list of recommended microsatellite markers for cattle, chickens, sheep and swine. These lists were carefully assembled and are intended to serve as the foundation for future studies in <b>genetic</b> <b>distancing</b> among breeds. By including a standard list of microsatellite loci in the roster of markers chosen for a given study, the possibility of combining results later in meta-analyses is created. The information contained in this manuscript is complementary to other documents produced for the ITWG. <b>Genetic</b> <b>distancing</b> between some of the world breeds that have been catalogued at DAD-I...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{measures}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> between populations, which {{have been used in}} anthropology and historical linguistics, can be used in economics. What does the correlation between <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> and economic variables mean? Using the measure of <b>genetic</b> <b>distance,</b> a newly-collected database on transport costs, as well as more refined measures of geography within Europe, we show that i) geography explains both <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> and transportation costs between European countries, and ii) <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> does not explain economic outcomes once we control for geography.

The largest intra-specific distance was smaller than the distance of inter-specific, which could use as a parameter to distinguish S. obtusifolia from S. occidentalis.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel sampling method for obtaining core collections, entitled <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> sampling. The method incorporates information about distances between individual accessions into a random sampling procedure.

Sample sizes are determined automatically; they depend on the distances between accessions within strata. The method is applied to the collection of cultivated lettuce of the Centre for Genetic Resources, the Netherlands.

25|$|Although it {{is simple}} to define <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> {{as a measure}} of genetic divergence, there are several {{different}} statistical measures that have been proposed.

In this note, we show how Mantel tests can be used to test hypotheses about <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> and avoid problems with multivariate data representation.

40|$|The {{patterning}} of {{allele frequency}} variability among 18 local groups of Gainj and Kalam speakers of highland Papua New Guinea is investigated using new <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> methods. The <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> proposed here are obtained by decomposing Sewall Wright's coefficient FST into {{a set of}} coefficients corresponding to all pairs of population subdivisions. Two statistical methods are given to estimate these quantities. One method provides estimates weighted by sample sizes, while the other method does not use sample size weighting. Both methods correct for the within-individual and between-individual-within-groups sums of squares. <b>Genetic</b> <b>distances</b> among the Gainj and Kalam subdivisions are analyzed with respect to demographic, geographic, and linguistic variables. We find that a demographic feature, group size, has the greatest demonstrable association with the patterning of <b>genetic</b> <b>distances.</b> The pattern of geographic distances among groups displays a weak congruence with the pattern of <b>genetic</b> <b>distances,</b> and the association of genetic and linguistic diversity is very low. An effect of differences in group size on <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> is not surprising, from basic theoretical considerations, but <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> have not often been analyzed with respect to these variables in the past. The lack of correspondence between <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> and linguistic and geographic differences is an unusual feature that distinguishes the Gainj and Kalam from most other tribal populations...|$|R

Benefits of such <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> calculations are illustrated by an analysis of standard DNA fingerprints of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in San Francisco collected during the period 1991 - 1997. Graphical representation of <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> can assist in determining if the disappearance of a specific pattern in a community is due to interruption of transmission or ongoing evolution of the microorganism's fingerprint. <b>Genetic</b> <b>distances</b> can also compensate for varying information content derived by DNA fingerprints of contrasting pattern complexity.

Among 97 observed bands, 69 showed polymorphism and were used for establishing <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> based on the Nei coefficient between parents. A UPGMA dendrogram and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis based on Nei <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> clearly clustered each group, confirming the variation at a molecular level.

Several formulae have been proposed for the estimation of the <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> between populations using gene frequency data. Nei�s D {{has been the most}} widely used <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> measure in different research programs. But the selection of a suitable measure to estimate <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> between real-world human populations is a very difficult task. The present study was undertaken to estimate the <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> between Barak Valley Muslims (BVM) and other twenty four nations with the ABO blood group gene frequency data using seven different formulae, as well as to estimate the correlation coefficients between distance measures and to work out the regression equations. Seven <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> measures namely Nei�s D, Nei�s Nm, La, Nei�s Da, Dc, Re and Nei�s Ne were calculated between BVM and other 24 nations. Correlation coefficients of Nei�s D with other measures were determined to find out which other <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> measures were similar to Nei�s D. Linear regression equations of Nei�s D with other distance measures were determined. Nei�s D showed a highly significant (p= 0. 01) positive correlation with Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord distance Dc (0. 90), Reynolds Re (0. 90), Nei�s Da (0. 74) and Nei�s Ne (0. 63) but a negative correlation with Nei�s Nm and La.

These simulations showed that loci with high mutation rates produce estimates of <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> with lower coefficients of variation than loci with lower mutation rates – without requiring larger sample sizes from each population. In addition, the rate at which increasing sample sizes decreases the {{coefficient of}} variation of estimates of <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> was shown to be approxi-mately determined by the value of FST between the populations being sampled.

When geographic and <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> were treated as independent variables in multiple correlation analyses, they accounted for about half the variance in levels of ethological isolation. When <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> is held constant, the remaining relationship between ethological isolation and geographic distance is still statistically significant.

Three components of progeny fitness (assessed as progeny flowering frequency, berry set and pollen sterility) were strongly correlated with parental <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> in both intra- and interspecific crosses.   By increasing parental <b>genetic</b> <b>distance,</b> flowering frequency and berry set consistently decreased while pollen sterility increased.   Therefore, outbreeding depression has strongly affected all three components of progeny fitness.   Marked outbreeding depression was evident on flowering frequency and berry set at very short <b>genetic</b> <b>distances</b> between subspecies, and even within subspecies at forma levels, while it was not evident in pollen sterility of progeny at short <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> within subspecies. Highly male sterile plants were found among progeny from crosses within F. vesca ssp.

The <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> between the families Engraulidae and Terapontidae was 26. 48 % which was found higher than the <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> calculated within the family of Engraulidae (9. 11 %). This clearly showed that when organisms from distantly placed families are taken, the <b>genetic</b> <b>distance</b> increases. In the present study some phylogeographical signal was apparent in the data. In the neighbor-joining tree for all 10 sequences, two major groups were apparent: clade A comprising of Terapon jarbua and clade B comprising of Stolephorus species.
