5|$|Though relegation to the Third Division {{meant the}} club was no longer bound by the Taylor Report's 1994 <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> to all-seater, new owner David Sullivan {{continued}} the £4.5million development as planned. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished, helped by fans who took home a significant proportion as souvenirs, the land was cleared – the rubbish tip beneath the Kop which had earned the club £800 in 1906 (£ at 1994 prices) cost £250,000 to decontaminate – and {{by the start of}} the new season, 7,000 seats in the Tilton Road Stand were ready for use. On completion of the Kop Stand, the stadium was formally re-opened in November 1994 by Baroness Trumpington, representing the Department of National Heritage, who unveiled a commemorative plaque and presented a cheque for £2.5million on behalf of the Football Trust; the ceremony was followed by a friendly match against Aston Villa, attended by a crowd of 20,000. Planning permission for an all-seater Railway Stand was granted in March 1995, but work was delayed by a dispute over land owned by Railtrack and the stand opened only in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|The last {{home game}} of the 1984-85 {{promotion}} season, against Leeds United, was marred by rioting, culminating {{in the death of}} a boy when a wall collapsed on him; this was on the same day as the Bradford City stadium fire, and the events at St Andrew's were included in the remit of Mr Justice Popplewell's inquiry into safety at sports grounds. In response to this and the later Taylor Report, the capacity of St Andrew's was cut to 26,000, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern standards. Club chairman David Gold recalled his first visit in March 1993: It was a shock. I had a picture in my mind of what I was expecting, but it was in such a state of disrepair that it was hard to comprehend ... Only two-thirds of the bulbs on the floodlights were working and the Football League had threatened action if we didn't do something to improve the lights. It was raining. It was a dour game. It was dark. It was dull. There were people standing in the rain looking extremely uncomfortable and unhappy. This First Division club was penniless and near to extinction. There were corrugated-iron fences round the ground and it looked as though it hadn't seen a lick of paint since Birmingham reached the FA Cup Final in 1956.

50|$|Digital {{television}} technology emerged recently. Although some {{television stations}} have begun broadcasting digital signals, {{it is not}} yet widespread as in the United States. The Government of South Korea set December 31, 2012 as the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> digital <b>conversion</b> in South Korea. From 2013, South Korea will convert from the analogue broadcasting to the digital broadcasting.(This date coincides with the United Kingdom conversion date.) According to DTV Korea, the rate of digital TV sets in use is about 60% (2010).|$|R
25|$|In May 2007, the CRTC set August 31, 2011 as the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> digital <b>conversion</b> in Canada. This is {{approximately}} {{two years later}} than the cutoff date in the United States. The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country, and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.|$|R
5000|$|In 1909, English {{units were}} also made legal within the Empire of Japan. Following World War I, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce {{established}} a Committee for Weights and Measures and Industrial Standards, part of whose remit {{was to investigate}} which of Japan's three legal systems should be adopted. Upon its advice, the Imperial Diet established the metric system as Japan's legal standard, effective 1 July 1924, with use of the other systems permitted as a transitional measure. The government and [...] "leading industries" [...] were to convert within the next decade, with others following in the decade after that. Public education—at the time compulsory through primary school—began to teach the metric system. Governmental agencies and the Japanese Weights and Measures Association undertook a gradual course of education and conversion but opposition became vehemently outspoken in the early 1930s. Nationalists decried the [...] "foreign" [...] system as harmful to Japanese pride, language, and culture, as well as restrictive to international trade. In 1933, the government pushed the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> the <b>conversion</b> of {{the first group of}} industries to 1939; {{the rest of the country}} was given until 1954. Emboldened, the nationalists succeeded in having an Investigating Committee for Weights and Measures Systems established. In 1938, it advised that the government should continue to employ the [...] "Shaku-Kan" [...] system alongside the metric one. The next year, the imperial ordinance concerning the transition to the metric system was formally revised, indefinitely exempting real estate and historical objects and treasures from any need <b>for</b> metric <b>conversion.</b> The <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> compulsory <b>conversion</b> in all other fields was moved back to 31 December 1958.|$|R
