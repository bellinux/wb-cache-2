5|$|At {{its first}} screening, {{the film was}} well {{received}} by critics and the public, and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela.

5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently overruled the editor, and announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt.|$|E

Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2003, the {{mutilated}} body of fourteen-year old schoolgirl Jodi Jones {{was discovered}} in woodland near her home in Easthouses, Scotland. The injuries sustained by Jones closely resembled those of actress Elizabeth Short, who was murdered in 1947 and was popularly referred to by media as the Black Dahlia. Jones' boyfriend, then-fifteen year old Luke Mitchell, was arrested on suspicion of her murder ten months later. During a search of his home, detectives confiscated a copy of The Golden Age of Grotesque containing the short film Doppelherz. It was purchased two days after Jones' death. A ten-minute <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> the film, {{as well as several}} paintings by Manson depicting the Black Dahlia's mutilated body, were presented as evidence during the trial.|$|E

50|$|Oribasius's major works, {{written at}} the behest of Julian, are two {{collections}} of <b>excerpts</b> <b>from</b> the writings of earlier medical scholars, a collection of <b>excerpts</b> <b>from</b> Galen and the Medical Collections (Ἰατρικαὶ Συναγωγαί, Iatrikai Synagogai; Latin: Collectiones medicae, a massive compilation of <b>excerpts</b> <b>from</b> other medical writers of the ancient world. The first of these works is entirely lost, and only 25 of the 70 (or 72) books of the Collectiones survive. This work preserves a number of <b>excerpts</b> <b>from</b> older writers whose writings have otherwise been lost, and has thus been valuable to modern scholars. The earliest known description of a string figure, presented as the surgical sling Plinthios Brokhos by Greek physician Heraklas, is among the preserved material.|$|R

5|$|The only extant {{pieces of}} the Consolatio are fragments, of which seven were {{preserved}} by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Divinarum Institutionum (The Divine Institutes). In the work, Lactantius used the <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> the Consolatio both {{to point out the}} futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity, without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but also applauded Cicero for paralleling—albeit coincidentally—what the Bible says at times. However, the quotes preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by Cicero himself, of which two sections were quoted by him in his Tusculanae Disputationes.|$|E
5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an <b>excerpt</b> <b>from</b> his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, depicting executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo. Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burn it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.|$|E
