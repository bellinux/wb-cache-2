40|$|An {{inkjet printer}} {{containing}} a substantially closed <b>ink</b> <b>duct</b> and a transducer {{used to generate}} a pressure wave in the duct, wherein the transducer comprises a first part and, separate from the first part, a second part whereby, by actuation of the transducer, the first part manifests a first deformation {{and the second part}} simultaneously manifests a second deformation actually opposed to the first deformation, such that a pressure wave is generated in the <b>ink</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|E
30|$|Fresh squids (24 h after capture) were {{purchased}} {{from a local}} market in Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand and transported in ice using a squid/ice ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) to the Department of Food Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, within 30 min. Upon arrival, ink sac was separated from the squid by cutting the <b>ink</b> <b>duct,</b> and the ink was squeezed out. The squid ink was diluted tenfold using cold deionized water (4 °C). Thereafter, it was subjected to centrifugation at 18, 000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C using a refrigerated centrifuge (Allegra 25 R centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The supernatant obtained {{was referred to as}} 'melanin-free ink; MFI’. MFI was subjected to analyses.|$|E
40|$|An ink jetprinting device {{includes}} {{a pressure chamber}} formed by a plurality of wall segments, a first aperture extending through a wall segment and communicating with an ink jet orifice and a second aperture extending through a wall segment and communicating with an <b>ink</b> supply <b>duct.</b> The pressure chamber is arranged to contain an ink composition including a carrier composition and a composition including at least one functional component. The plurality of wall segments are at least partly coated with a coating layer of a coating compound having a stronger interaction {{with at least one}} component of the carrier composition relative to the composition including the at least one functional component. A method for manufacturing such an ink-jet printing device is disclosed...|$|R
