40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for {{phytosanitary}} inspections of certain plants and plant products imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions of interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest EU importer of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination of interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> supports application of reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> into the EU. Accounting for possible economic impacts of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in determining the frequencies of reduced checks may help optimize the current syste...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms</b> in the root zone of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) was examined by biotesting. For this investigation three locations along the sandy shoreline of The Netherlands were chosen: Voorne, Texel, and Schouwen. At all three locations <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> were detected in sand from stable dunes, {{as well as}} in sand from mobile dunes (degenerated and vigorous A. arenaria, respectively). In beach sand, however, no <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> occurred. Since A. arenaria shows vigorous growth only when it is buried regularly by windblown sand from the beach, it is concluded that this sand deposition enables the plants to escape from <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms.</b> Ammophila arenaria and Calammophila baltica (purple or hybrid marram grass) from the Voorne location were grown outdoors in containers filled with sand from the beach, the mobile dunes, and the stable dunes, and sterilized sand from the stable dunes. Biomass production of both species was highest in sterilized sand from the stable dune, followed by (in descending order) beach sand, sand from the mobile dune, and unsterilized sand from the stable dune. As compared with A. arenaria, however, growth of C. baltica was reduced less and without mortality of cuttings. Degree of growth reduction by <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms</b> could not be related to numbers of plant parasitic nematodes. Key words: Ammophila arenaria, Calammophila baltica, coastal sand dunes, succession, <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{the effect}} of {{modified}} bentonite on removing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in ballast water was discussed using HDTMA+ modified bentonite as flocculating material, and Alexandrium tamarense, Nitzchia closterium, and Photobacterium phosphoreum as the objects of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms,</b> and also through an observation of the reaction mechanism between HDTMA+ and bentonite with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The result showed {{that there was an}} effective combination of HDTMA+ with bentonite, and the modified organic bentonite possessed a powerful ability to remove <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> The removal rate against Alexandrium tamarense within 24 h was greater than 85 % if the dosage of the organic bentonite was 0. 03 g/L; the removal rate against Nitzchia closterium was approximate to 80 % if the dosage was 0. 06 g/L; the luminous intensity could not be displayed by luminescent bacteria under the condition of concentration 0. 30 g/L, and also the original soil with modification did not shown a significant removal effect under the same dosage. Therefore, it was concluded that the conditions such as aging time, organic bentonite’s particle size, and HDTMA+ dosage were the important factors affecting the harmful biological removal efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} glucosinolates in plant protection. The Brassicaceae, which are cultivated worldwide, use glucosinolates and their decomposition products to defend themselves against attacks by <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> The glucosinolate content varies among individual plant species, plant organs and developmental stages. The glucosinolate content in plants is also affected by biotic and abiotic factors, while the type or quantity of glucosinolate determines the susceptibility of the plants to insect pests. These facts can pose a problem when implementing this knowledge in cultivation of the Brassicaceae, especially in regions with moderate climates where Brassicaceae crops are exposed to attacks by {{a large number of}} <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> Under these circumstances, it is essential to research new, or to improve the existing environmentally acceptable methods of protecting Brassicaceae plants against economically important pests...|$|R

Also, {{as more and more}} citizens are nowadays travelling to distant destinations, there is an increased risk of unintentionally importing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> and invasive species. Governments respond to increased phytosanitary risks by imposing trade-restricting measures. However, they are under increasing pressure of the private sector and the World Trade Organization to justify costly and trade-restricting phytosanitary policies. On the other side, current phytosanitary policies are required to account for impacts on the environment.

40|$|Barley {{is one of}} the {{economically}} important crops. Its production is primarilly used as fodder barley and also in brewery and food industry. Particularly the part of its production intended for malt production must be of high quality. There are some important factors which can influence the quality of the crops, such as <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> – diseases, pests and weed. In order to regulate the occurence of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms,</b> agricultural measures are taken in the integrated protection system and resistant variants and pesticides are used. The higher the demand on the production quality, the bigger is the volume and the spectrum of pesticides used. The increasing extent of pesticide use also poses a risk for internal production quality and the environment. This fact makes it necessary to monitor unfavourable influences, including the contents of the pesticide residues in barley.
