500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E
2500|$|Former FBI agent Ali Soufan {{mentioned}} {{in his book}} The Black Banners that Ayman al-Zawahiri is suspected of being behind the assassination. Azzam's son-in-law, Abdullah Anas, accused the Egyptian Islamic Jihad of killing his father-in-law for issuing a fatwa that [...] "once the Russian were ejected from Afghanistan, {{it would not be}} permissible <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, Stevens {{admitted}} to Exclaim! Magazine, {{in regard to}} the fact that he recently called his fifty-state project a joke, that [...] "I don't really have as much faith in my work as I used to, but I think that's healthy. I think it's allowed me to be less precious about how I work and write. And maybe it's okay <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it less seriously." ...|$|E

6000|$|He spoke thickly: [...] "I'm much obliged, Mrs. Joyce. I'm {{grateful}} for what you've done <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> but <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her money or yours now would be--would be dishonest. I can't let you feed us any longer--we've got {{to fight this}} out alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I took {{sides with}} the women, because I {{am a woman}} myself," [...] she answered, {{speaking}} at length with decision, as if determined to bring matters to a head at once. [...] "It is natural <b>for</b> <b>us</b> all <b>to</b> <b>take</b> sides with our kind." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{was put on}} {{specifically}} <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the message}} to the world that Pol Pot has been denounced. They had reported on their radio, on June 19, that Pol Pot had been purged. No one believed them. After five years of lying over their radio, there was no reason anyone should take what they say credibly. It was clear to them that they needed an independent, credible witness to show what was happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Einziger noted, [...] "It {{just seems}} like a very {{appropriate}} name for the album because we've been {{in the spirit of}} taking risk, stepping up and making a leap. For us, it's a very common theme <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> chances, to do things differently. There's something exciting and equally scary about that idea. Now we've nothing left to lose, really. We've kind of accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish as a band; at this point we're just living our dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, Delta Air Lines was {{interested}} in it to replace its Boeing 767-300ER. In the 250-300-seat market, CIT Group believes an A330neo enables profitability on shorter ranges where the longer-range A350 and Boeing 787 aren't optimized. Steve Mason, CIT vice president for aircraft analysis, said [...] "The A350-800 is not as efficient as they'd like". Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and CEO of Air Lease Corp., said, “We don't believe it is rational <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the A350-800 and the A330neo [...] I don't see the A350-800 surviving if they do the A330neo”.|$|E

2500|$|On the 5 December 2013 a {{statement}} on the official Grinspoon website announced that the band would be going on hiatus. A section of the statement reads: [...] "Thanks to all our families, friends, and especially our fans for the support over the last 18 years – it's been a wild ride to say the least. We are still a band of brothers but it's time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a break and recharge the batteries. We're excited to see what our future holds…adios amigos, it's been a blast!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{argued that}} tax {{policy should be}} used to promote energy conservation. When his {{lieutenant}} governor supported a temporary suspension of the state gasoline tax to provide consumers some relief during a period of especially high gasoline prices in 2006, Romney rejected the proposal, arguing that maintaining the tax would help encourage energy conservation: “I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m not sure there will be the right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline.... I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> is to find ways to find fuel conservation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{government}} controlled all committees, genuine public discourse was thus concluded and the [...] "New Order" [...] status-quo of dwifungsi, {{the unity of}} Golkar and ABRI, and the preeminence of Pancasila were re-asserted. In his Independence Day speech the same August, Suharto reiterated that [...] "The one and only way <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> is to implement development... we must all {{be able to maintain}} dynamic regional stability." [...] Suharto later revoked the critics' travel privileges, and forbade newspapers from printing their pictures or quoting them. Members of the group were unable to obtain bank loans and contracts. Suharto remarked: [...] "I didn't like what the so-called Petition of Fifty did. I didn't like their methods, even more so because they called themselves patriots".|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very dull {{without you}} both," [...] Millicent said. [...] "I was telling Mrs. Cunningham that I {{thought it would}} be a good thing, when you got back, <b>for</b> <b>us</b> two <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a run up to town for a week, just to let you see how dull the place is when two of us are away. You are looking quite serious, uncle. Is {{anything}} the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--all day. Keeping you {{company in}} your solitude. How can we {{understand}} anything," [...] she went on, [...] "without really seeing {{that this is}} what they must like to think I do for you?--just as, quite as comfortably, you do it for me. The thing is <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them as they are." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Marino, [...] "by 1966, Westmoreland {{had begun}} to {{consider}} Khe Sanh {{as part of a}} larger strategy". With a view to eventually gaining approval for an advance through Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he determined that [...] "it was absolutely essential to hold the base", and he gave the order <b>for</b> <b>US</b> Marines <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up positions around Khe Sanh. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) subsequently began planning for incursion into Laos, and in October, construction of an airfield at Khe Sanh was completed.|$|R
2500|$|Yu Fan {{considered}} bringing Wang Lang {{north to}} Guangling Commandery (廣陵郡; around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu) to evade Sun Ce, but Wang, {{who believed in}} stories about the immortal Wang Fangping (王方平), wanted {{to travel to the}} [...] "South Mountain" [...] and take shelter there. Yu Fan then accompanied Wang Lang as they escaped from Kuaiji by sea and headed south to Houguan County (候官縣; in present-day Fuzhou, Fujian). At Houguan, the county chief initially denied them entry, but agreed after being persuaded by Yu Fan. In Houguan, Wang Lang insisted on heading further south to Jiao Province to find the [...] "South Mountain", but Yu Fan objected, [...] "Those stories are nonsense. There is no South Mountain in Jiao Province <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> shelter." [...] Wang Lang told Yu Fan later, [...] "You have an elderly mother (to take care of). You can go back (to Kuaiji) now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The base {{had been}} a target for {{frequent}} mortar and rocket barrages since being set up in 2003, but Burbridge dismissed suggestions the British had been forced out of Amara while acknowledging the attacks had been {{one reason for the}} decision to withdraw, the second being that a static base did not fit with the new operation. [...] "Abu Naji was a bulls-eye {{in the middle of a}} dartboard. The attacks were a nuisance and were a contributing factor in our planning", to quit the base, he said, adding [...] "By no longer presenting a static target, we reduce the ability of the militias to strike us..We understand the militias in Maysan province are using this as an example that we have been pushed out of Abu Naji, but that is not true. It was very rare <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> casualties." [...] Burbridge stated that Iraqi security forces would now be responsible for day-to-day security in Maysan but stressed that the British had not yet handed over complete control to them.|$|E

50|$|Bell was the IRA's {{representative}} to Libya {{during the late}} 1970s and the early 1980s. Libya and the IRA had a common enemy, the British government. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was heavily criticised in Libya <b>for</b> allowing <b>US</b> planes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off from British air bases for raids on Libya {{in which more than}} seventy people were killed.|$|R
30|$|This {{leads to}} another sub-theme: {{learners}} {{are not responsible}} for assessing themselves and their peers. This is sort of belief which ELT students asserted. Some of them stated that since they are not proficient about doing self-assessment and peer-assessment “it is better <b>for</b> <b>us</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the risk and doing that.” This can be interpreted broadly as when students do not see themselves that much proficient in doing a part in their assessment they may feel {{there is no need for}} them to do something in that regard and put the responsibility, totally, on the shoulder of their instructors.|$|R
5000|$|These revelations and its ensuing media {{coverage}} have {{given rise to}} speculation and a number of conspiracy theories. Several high-ranking Turkish government officials have condemned the holding of this meeting as it considered the possibility of a Turkish intervention into Iraq. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced the contents of the Hudson scenario as [...] "crazy talk." [...] In a statement released via the Hudson website, Baran has asserted {{that the purpose of the}} meeting was [...] "to prevent the PKK from causing further strains in US-Turkey relations” and that those were present at the meeting [...] "stated clearly the need <b>for</b> the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> concrete action against the PKK." ...|$|R

[...] "If it had been {{possible}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> have <b>taken</b> from the Silver City any records, or sculptured figures, or plates of a historical nature, I might have succeeded in solving that which the student can speak of only as a mystery. Before the Conquest it was known as Maya--that is to say, the territory now called Yucatan, and the Chan Santa Cruz yet speak the Maya language. It is only certain that for many centuries there was here an important feudal monarchy, which doubtless arose after the Toltec overthrow of the very ancient kingdom of Xibalba." ...|$|R
25|$|The Choctaw {{coalesced}} as {{a people}} in the 17th century, and developed three distinct political and geographical divisions: eastern, western and southern. These different groups sometimes created distinct, independent alliances with nearby European powers. These included the French, based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana; the English of the Southeast, and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the American Revolution, most Choctaw supported the Thirteen Colonies' bid for independence from the British Crown. They never went to war against the United States but they were forcibly relocated in 1831-1833, {{as part of the}} Indian Removal, in order <b>for</b> the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over their land for development by European Americans.|$|R
500|$|Pierre Soulé, the <b>U.S.</b> Minister <b>to</b> Spain, {{resigned}} in December 1854 after {{being unable to}} negotiate the annexation of Cuba and angering the Spanish by drafting the Ostend Manifesto, which called <b>for</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Cuba by force. Pierce nominated Breckinridge to fill the vacancy, but did not tell him until just before the Senate's January 16 confirmation vote. After consulting Secretary of State William L. Marcy, Breckinridge concluded that the salary was insufficient and Soulé had so damaged Spanish relations {{that he would be}} unable to accomplish anything significant. In a February 8, 1855, letter to Pierce, he cited reasons [...] "of a private and domestic nature" [...] for declining the nomination. On March 17, 1855, he announced he would retire from the House.|$|R
