40|$|Wide {{band gap}} II-VI {{semiconductor}} nanostructures have been extensively studied {{according to their}} great potentials for optoelectronic applications, while <b>heterojunctions</b> are fundamental elements for modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. Subsequently, {{a great deal of}} achievements in construction and optoelectronic applications of <b>heterojunctions</b> based on II-VI compound semiconductor one-dimensional nanostructures have been obtained in the past decade. Herein, we present a review of a series of progress in this field. First, construction strategies towards different types of <b>heterojunctions</b> are reviewed, including core-shell <b>heterojunctions,</b> one-dimensional axial <b>heterojunctions,</b> crossed nanowires <b>heterojunctions,</b> and one-dimensional nanostructure/thin film or Si substrate <b>heterojunctions.</b> Secondly, optoelectronic applications of these constructed <b>heterojunctions,</b> such as photodetectors, solar cells, light emitting diodes, junction field effect transistors, etc., are discussed briefly.

Low operation frequencies of such <b>heterojunctions</b> {{are the result}} of violations offast ion transport conditions in molecular-thin double electric layer on the <b>heterojunctions.</b> The major approach to nanoionics of advanced superionic conductors is to retain the concentration and potential barrier heights to mobileion jumps on functional <b>heterojunctions</b> at the level of those in the volume. Nanoionic supercapacitors should be devices with fast ion transport in double electric layer and record high capacity-frequency characteristics.|$|R
25|$|In {{a quantum}} cascade laser, the {{difference}} between quantum well energy levels {{is used for the}} laser transition instead of the bandgap. This enables laser action at relatively long wavelengths, which can be tuned simply by altering the thickness of the layer. They are <b>heterojunction</b> lasers.|$|E
25|$|Band-gap {{engineering}} {{is the process}} of controlling or altering the band gap of a material by controlling the composition of certain semiconductor alloys, such as GaAlAs, InGaAs, and InAlAs. It is also possible to construct layered materials with alternating compositions by techniques like molecular-beam epitaxy. These methods are exploited in the design of <b>heterojunction</b> bipolar transistors (HBTs), laser diodes and solar cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) {{was invented by}} Herbert Nelson of RCA Laboratories. By {{layering}} the highest quality crystals of varying compositions, it enabled the demonstration {{of the highest quality}} <b>heterojunction</b> semiconductor laser materials for many years. LPE was adopted by all the leading laboratories, worldwide and used for many years. It was finally supplanted in the 1970s by molecular beam epitaxy and organometallic chemical vapor deposition.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{a study of}} the {{electrical}} properties of <b>heterojunctions</b> between rf sputtered amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) thin films and n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates is reported. The current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics, as well as the temperature dependence of the current of a-SiC/c-Si(n) <b>heterojunctions</b> were measured. The I-V characteristics of a-SiC/ c-Si(n) <b>heterojunctions</b> exhibit poor rectification properties, with a high reverse current, at higher temperatures (T > 250 K), whereas good rectification properties are obtained at lower temperatures (T < 250 K). It was found that the a-SiC/c-Si(n) <b>heterojunctions</b> are isotype, suggesting that-the conductivity of a-SiC is n-type. The temperature dependence of the current (from 185 K to 320 K) showed that the majority carriers of c-Si(n) (i. e. electrons) are transported from c-Si(n) to a-SiC mainly by the thermionic emission mechanism, or by the drift-diffusion mechanism. From C-V measurements of a-SiC/c-Si(n) <b>heterojunctions</b> the electron affinity of a-SiC was found to be X 1 = 4. 20 ± 0. 04 eV.

25|$|The first <b>heterojunction</b> diode lasers were single-heterojunction lasers. These lasers {{utilized}} aluminum {{gallium arsenide}} p-type injectors situated over n-type gallium arsenide layers grown on the substrate by LPE. An admixture of aluminum replaced gallium in the semiconductor crystal {{and raised the}} bandgap of the p-type injector over that of the n-type layers beneath. It worked; the 300 K threshold currents went down by 10× to 10,000 amperes per square centimeter. Unfortunately, this was still not in the needed range and these single-heterostructure diode lasers did not function in continuous wave operation at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterojunction</b> {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Ferroelectric {{resistive}} switching {{effects have}} attracted lots of research interests, since the polarization reversal {{is based on}} purely electronic mechanism, which does not induce a chemical alteration and is an intrinsically fast phenomenon [1, 2]. Ferroelectric resistive switching effects have been observed in ferroelectric <b>heterojunctions</b> sandwiched by two metal or semiconductor electrodes [3 – 5]. Lots of interesting behaviors have been observed in ferroelectric/semiconductor <b>heterojunctions.</b> For example, a greatly enhanced tunneling electroresistance is observed in BaTiO 3 (BTO)/(001)Nb:SrTiO 3 (NSTO) [4, 5] and MoS 2 /BaTiO 3 /SrRuO 3 [6] <b>heterojunctions</b> since both the barrier height and width can be modulated by ferroelectric field effect. A coexistence of the bipolar resistive switching and negative differential resistance {{has been found in}} BaTiO 3 /(111)Nb:SrTiO 3 <b>heterojunctions</b> [7]. The optically controlled electroresistance and electrically controlled photovoltage were observed in Sm 0.1 Bi 0.9 FeO 3 /(001)Nb:SrTiO 3 <b>heterojunctions</b> [8]. A ferroelectric polarization-modulated band bending was observed in the BiFeO 3 /(100)NbSrTiO 3 heterointerface by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy [9]. A transition from the rectification effect to the bipolar resistive switching effect was observed in BaTiO 3 /ZnO <b>heterojunctions</b> [10].|$|R

The current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics of the pn <b>heterojunctions</b> were systematically investigated, through which the diode parameters, such as the turn-on voltage, forward-to-reverse current ratio, series resistance, ideality factor, and build-in voltage, were also determined. In particular, the pn <b>heterojunctions</b> presented a relatively good electrical rectifying behavior, with a forward-to-reverse current ratio up to 58 +/- 5 at +/- 2. 0 V. The relative permittivity and work function of the SnO films were measured to be 18. 8 +/- 1. 7 and 4. 3 eV, respectively.

25|$|The first diode lasers were {{homojunction}} diodes. That is, {{the material}} (and thus the bandgap) of the waveguide core layer {{and that of}} the surrounding clad layers, were identical. It was recognized that there was an opportunity, particularly afforded by the use of liquid phase epitaxy using aluminum gallium arsenide, to introduce heterojunctions. Heterostructures consist of layers of semiconductor crystal having varying bandgap and refractive index. Heterojunctions (formed from heterostructures) had been recognized by Herbert Kroemer, while working at RCA Laboratories in the mid-1950s, as having unique advantages for several types of electronic and optoelectronic devices including diode lasers.

As well as conductive properties, different materials may be chosen to aid charge injection at electrodes by providing a more gradual electronic profile, or block a charge from reaching the opposite electrode and being wasted. Many modern OLEDs incorporate a simple bilayer structure, consisting of a conductive layer and an emissive layer. [...] More recent developments in OLED architecture improves quantum efficiency (up to 19%) by using a graded <b>heterojunction.</b> In the graded <b>heterojunction</b> architecture, the composition of hole and electron-transport materials varies continuously within the emissive layer with a dopant emitter.
