Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> with him.|$|E

500|$|The English painter William Hogarth was the devoted {{owner of}} a series of Pugs. His 1745 self-portrait, which is now in London's Tate Gallery, {{includes}} his Pug, Trump. The Pug was also well known in Italy. In 1789, a Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal, [...] "The little Pug dog or Dutch mastiff has quitted London for Padua, I perceive. Every carriage <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> here has a Pug in it." [...] The popularity of the Pug continued to spread in France during the eighteenth century. Before her marriage to Napoleon Bonaparte, Joséphine had her Pug Fortune carry concealed messages to her family while she was confined at Les Carmes prison, it having alone been given visiting rights.|$|E

Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place {{as symbols of}} national resistance. At a social function in 1944, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery he thought Montgomery was after his job.

500|$|With Songs of Experience, Axelrod {{explored}} darker sounds, as {{the poems}} {{he had chosen}} dealt with {{the darker side of}} humanity. For [...] "The Human Abstract", he used ascending piano, bass, and percussion instruments to evoke the ghost described in Blake's poem. It is a bass-driven, funky song that juxtaposes augmented sevenths strummed on an electric guitar against an acoustic piano and muted horns. According to music critic Thom Jurek, [...] "The Divine Image" [...] and [...] "A Little Girl Lost" [...] elicit feelings of majesty and [...] "pastoral sadness", respectively. [...] "London" [...] was recorded by Axelrod as a tone poem to reflect Blake's opening stanza about the spiritual climate of London {{at the onset of the}} Industrial Revolution: [...] "I wander thro' each charted'd street / Near where the chart'd Thames does flow / And mark in every face <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> / Marks of weakness, marks of woe." ...|$|E
500|$|English law at {{the time}} {{provided}} that {{a large share of}} the loot was owed to the sovereign. When Queen Elizabeth discovered the extent of the theft, she sent Raleigh to reclaim her money and punish the looters. He swore, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> any of them coming up, if it be upon the wildest heath in all the way, I mean to strip them as naked as they were ever born, for Her Majesty has been robbed and that of the most rare things." [...] By the time Raleigh had restored order, a cargo estimated at half a million pounds nearly, almost half the wealth of the English treasury at the time and perhaps the second-largest treasure ever after the Ransom of Atahualpa, had been reduced to £140,000. [...] Still, ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure around the coast and up the River Thames to London. In all the expedition as a whole yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment.|$|E
500|$|Shays's Rebellion {{contributed to}} the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, instead of {{revising}} the Articles, created a new United States Constitution with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. [...] "I confess," [...] he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, [...] "as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. <b>I</b> <b>meet</b> with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States." [...] Adams was one of those derisively labeled [...] "Anti-Federalists" [...] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves [...] "Federalists". Adams was elected to the Massachusetts ratifying convention which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections. Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.|$|E
