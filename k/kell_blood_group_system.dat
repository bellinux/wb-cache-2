40|$|Alloimmunisation {{becomes a}} problem when {{serological}} discrepancies occur in matching antigens between donors and patients for blood transfusion. The rate of alloimmunisation has been increased especially in multiply transfused patients. <b>Blood</b> <b>group</b> genotyping (BGG) is a DNA-based assay that aids in reducing this situation. Currently, many platforms of BGG have become available, in which every technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. All these platforms lack the ability to identify novel alleles that might have an unknown clinical significance. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers identification of the unprecedented alleles due to its basis of sequence-based typing. Moreover, it provides an extreme high-throughput which {{may be able to}} screen many donors and patients in a single run. In this project, two approaches have been developed in generating sequencing libraries followed by sequencing on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome MachineTM platform (Ion PGMTM). The first approach was amplicon-based target selection using Ion AmpliseqTM Custom Panel, designated as Human Erythrocyte Antigens and Human Platelet Antigens Panel (HEA and HPA Panel). This panel assay screens 11 <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as 16 human platelet antigens. The outcome was extraordinary, in particular four novel alleles had been identified out of 28 samples, one in the RHCE gene 208 C>T (Arg 70 Trp) in exon 2 and three in the KEL gene. The first SNP was 331 G>A (Ala 111 Thr) in exon 4. The second SNP was 1907 C>T (Ala 636 Val) in exon 17 and the third SNP was 2165 T>C (Leu 722 Pro) in exon 19. However, some issues occurred regarding co-amplification of homologous genes. The second approach was a long-range polymerase chain reaction (LR-PCR) based approach. This method provided a high resolution assay by amplification of entire genes, including the non-coding area, of the <b>Kell</b> and Rh <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>systems.</b> The <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> was initially utilised as a model in order to apply the same approach on the Rh system. Most alleles encoding the antigens of the <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> especially the high prevalence ones, were identified. The Rh LR-PCR approach was carried out by amplification of the RHD and RHCE genes with seven amplicons. For five RhD-positive samples no mutations were observed within the coding areas. On the other hand, five serotyped weak D samples were genotyped as; two weak D type 1, two weak D type 2 and one DAR 3. 1 weak partial D 4. 0 (RHD*DAR 3. 01). Regarding the RHCE, the following antigens (C, c, E, c) were predicted properly from the sequencing data. Moreover, the RHCE*ceVS. 02 was identified. 64 and 39 intronic SNPs were identified in RHD and RHCE genes, respectively. The intronic SNPs assisted the genotyping process by identifying the haplotype of interest. Interestingly, the novel allele identified in the RHCE gene by the HEA and HPA Panel was confirmed to belong to the RHCE gene by the LR-PCR approach, indicating the panel misaligned it to the RHD gene. In conclusion, NGS paves the way to be an alternative substitution to the previous molecular techniques. It would supplant the conventional serology for typing blood for transfusion.

40|$|Introduction. Blood {{groups are}} {{inherited}} biological characteristics {{that do not}} change throughout life in healthy people. Blood groups represent antigens found {{on the surface of}} red blood cells. <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> consists of 31 antigens. Kell antigen (K) is present in 0. 2 % of the population (the rare blood group). Cellano antigen is present in more than 99 % (the high-frequency antigen). These antigens have a distinct ability to cause an immune response in the people after blood transfusion or pregnancy who, otherwise, did not have them before. Case Report. This paper presents a blood donor with a rare blood group, who was found to have an irregular antibody against red blood cells by indirect antiglobulin test. Further testing determined the specificity of antibody to be anti-Cellano. The detected antibody was found in high titers (1024) with erythrocyte phenotype Kell-Cellano+. The blood donor was found to have a rare blood group KellKell. This donor was excluded from further blood donation. It is difficult to find compatible blood for a person who has developed an antibody to the high-frequency antigen. The donor’s family members were tested and Cellano antigen was detected in her husband and child. A potential blood donor was not found among the family members. There was only one blood donor in the Register of blood donors who was compatible in the ABO and <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of anti-red blood cell antibodies (both allo-and autoantibodies) remains {{a major problem}} in thalassemia major patients. We studied the frequency of red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization and autoimmunization among thalassemia patients who received regular transfusions at our center and analyzed the factors, which may be responsible for {{development of}} these antibodies. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 319 multiply transfused patients with β-thalassemia major registered with thalassemia clinic at our institute. Clinical and transfusion records of all the patients were examined for age of patients, age at initiation of transfusion therapy, total number of blood units transfused, transfusion interval, status of splenectomy or other interventions. Alloantibody screening and identification was done using three cell and 11 cell panel (Diapanel, Bio-rad, Switzerland) respectively. To detect autoantibodies, autocontrol was carried out using polyspecific coombs (IgG + C 3 d) gel cards. Results: Eighteen patients out of total 319 patients (5. 64 %) developed alloantibodies and 90 (28. 2 %) developed autoantibodies. Nine out of 18 patients with alloantibodies also had autoantibodies. Age at first transfusion was significantly higher in alloimmunized than non-immunized patients (P = 0. 042). Out of 23 alloantibodies, 52. 17 % belonged to Rh blood group system (Anti-E = 17 %, Anti D = 13 %, Anti-C = 13 %, Anti-C w = 9 %), 35 % belonged to <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system,</b> 9 % of Kidd and 4 % of Xg blood group system. Conclusion: Alloimmunization was detected in 5. 64 % of multitransfused thalassemia patients. Rh and <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> antibodies accounted for more than 80 % of alloantibodies. This study re-emphasizes the need for RBC antigen typing before first transfusion and issue of antigen matched blood (at least for Rh and Kell antigen).

40|$|Two healthy {{men with}} McLeod syndrome, a rare X-linked {{recessive}} phenotype characterized by acanthocytosis and weakened {{red blood cell}} antigenicity in the <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system,</b> have been investigated. Both men showed raised blood creatine kinase levels, with myopathic EMG abnor-malities. Biopsies of the quadriceps muscle showed the features of an active myopathy {{although there was no}} clinical evidence of muscular abnormality. The combination of the association of membrane abnormalities in red blood cells and a myopathy in both McLeod phenotype and Duchenne muscular dystrophy suggests that these syndromes may be due to related genetic abnormalities. The genetic locus for McLeod phenotype is situated {{near the end of the}} short arm of the X chromosome. The locus for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is unknown but it has been postulated that it is also situated on the short arm of the X chromosome at Xp 21. The occurrence of a subclinical X-linked myopathy with acanthocytosis (McLeod phenotype) thus raises the possibility of a new approach to genetic investigations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and in the related milder forms of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The 22 antigens of the <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> {{are located}} on a red blood cell (RBC) {{membrane}} glycoprotein that shows sequence homology with a family of metalloendopeptidases.

Almost total absence of Kell antigens from the RBCs of a German man with no symptoms of neuroacanthocytosis could not {{be due to the}} Kell-null phenotype, Ko, because his RBCs had very weak expression of Kx antigen and his three children were Kp(a + b+). Kell antigens were normal on the RBCs of his son but weak on those of his two daughters. An Nla III restriction fragment-length polymorphism within the KEL gene showed the Kpa/Kpa genotype in the propositus. Sequencing of his XK gene showed a single base change within the donor splice consensus sequence of intron 2. A BsaAl restriction fragment-length polymorphism showed the mutation in both of his daughters but not in his son. The extreme depression of the Kell antigens of the propositus must be due to a combination of effects, ie, homozygosity for Kpa and deficiency of Kx protein, each of which is capable of causing some degree of weakening of Kell antigens...|$|E

40|$|Background: The KEL gene {{is highly}} polymorphic. It {{presents}} two major alleles, KEL 1 (K) and KEL 2 (k), but {{a variety of}} mutations give rise to weakened (Kmod phenotype) or lack (K 0 phenotype) of Kell antigen expression. Recently, the use of advanced DNA-based techniques has greatly increased {{our understanding of the}} <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system.</b> Study Design and Methods: Three blood samples that had shown discordant results between the serologic and molecular typing for k were investigated by DNA sequencing. Two of these samples were also subjected to studies of adsorption and elution. Results: After sequencing the whole KEL gene, we found three new missense mutations: c. 455 A>G (p. Tyr 152 Cys) at Exon 5, c. 2111 A>C (p. Pro 704 His) at Exon 19, and c. 1726 G>C (p. Gly 576 Arg) at Exon 16. So far, no known clinical implications are associated with these mutations. Further investigation by adsorption and elution methods has defined that c. 455 A>G and c. 1726 G>C resulted in K 0 phenotype, while c. 2111 A>C encoded a Kmod phenotype. Conclusion: Molecular investigation is an important complement to routine serologic analyses of Kell antigens. Discrepancies between genotype and phenotype may reveal the presence of Kmod or K 0 phenotypes. Our description of three new KEL alleles suggests a role for a wider diagnostic approach to typing of the Kell system. © 2014 AABB...|$|E

40|$|Background: The <b>Kell</b> <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> expresses {{high and}} low {{frequency}} antigens with the most important in relation to transfusion including the antithetic KEL 1 and KEL 2; KEL 3 and KEL 4; KEL 6 and KEL 7 antigens. Kell is a clinically relevant system, as it is highly immunogenic and anti-KEL antibodies are associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Although required in some situations, Kell antigen phenotyping is restricted due to technical limitations. In these cases, molecular approaches may be a solution. This study proposes three polymerase chain reaction genotyping protocols to analyze the single nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for six Kell antithetic antigens expressed in a Brazilian population. Methods: DNA was extracted from 800 blood donor samples and three polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism protocols were used to genotype the KEL* 1 /KEL* 2, KEL* 3 /KEL* 4 and KEL* 6 /KEL* 7 alleles. KEL* 3 /KEL* 4 and KEL* 6 /KEL* 7 genotyping was standardized using the NlalII and MnlI restriction enzymes and validated using sequencing. KEL* 1 /KEL* 2 genotyping was performed using a previously reported assay. Results: KEL genotyping was successfully implemented in the service; the following distribution of KEL alleles was obtained for a population from southeastern Brazil: KEL* 1 (22 %), KEL* 2 (97. 8 %), KEL* 3 (0. 69 %), KEL* 4 (99. 31 %), KEL* 6 (2. 69 %o) and KEL* 7 (9731 %o).

No significant difference was found for the allele frequencies among the four places for the two <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>systems.</b> The allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> and show East Asian affinity for the Tibetans...|$|R
40|$|ABO and Rh <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>systems</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} <b>blood</b> <b>grouping</b> <b>systems</b> from clinical aspect. Determination of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> is important for blood transfusion therapy, medico-legal purposes, organ transplantation, settlement of paternity disputes etc. Nearly 25 types of <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> are present. ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus may produce infertility or hemolytic disease of the new born, and persons of certain <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> have an increased susceptibility to peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. The purpose of this review is to summarize the concepts and origin of ABO and other <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> <b>systems</b> and Chemistry of <b>Blood</b> <b>group</b> specificity (Glycoproteins found in body fluids).

ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> and the D antigen of the Rhesus (Rh) <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> typing are routine prior to transfusion. Suggestions have been made that women of child bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or Kell1-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization, but this would strain the resources of blood transfusion services, and it is currently considered uneconomical to screen for these <b>blood</b> <b>groups.</b> HDFN can also be caused by antibodies {{to a variety of}} other <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>system</b> antigens, but <b>Kell</b> and Rh are the most frequently encountered.|$|R
