The mermithid absorbed {{each of these}} lipids from the incubation medium, the rate of uptake being greatest for glycerol monoolein. No lipase activity was detected in whole nematode homogenates or in the media in which the nematodes were incubated. It is suggested that the nematode transports complex lipid molecules across its outer cuticle intact. [AS]...|$|E
