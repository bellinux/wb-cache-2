40|$|Recent {{anatomical}} {{evidence that}} inhibitory interneurones receive approximately 10 times more synapses from mossy fibres than do principal neurones (Acsády et al. 1998) {{has led to}} the re-examination {{of the extent to which}} interneurones are involved in CA 3 network excitability. Although many of the anatomical and physiological properties of mossy fibre–CA 3 <b>interneurone</b> synapses have been previously described (Acsády et al. 1998; Tóth et al. 2000), an investigation into the quantal nature of transmission at this synapse has not yet been conducted. Here, we employed variance–mean (VM) analysis to compare the release probability, quantal size (q) and number of release sites (n) at mossy fibre target neurones in CA 3. At six of seven <b>interneurone</b> synapses in which a high concentration of Ca 2 + was experimentally imposed, the variance–mean relationship could be approximated by a parabola. Estimates of n were 1 – 2, and the weighted release probability in normal Ca 2 + conditions ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 51. At pyramidal cell synapses, the variance–mean relationship approximated a linear relationship, suggesting that release probability was significantly lower. The weighted quantal amplitude was similar at <b>interneurone</b> synapses and pyramidal cell synapses, although the variability in quantal amplitude was larger at <b>interneurone</b> synapses. Mossy fibre transmission at CA 3 <b>interneurone</b> synapses can be explained by a lower number of release sites, a broader range of release probabilities, and larger range of quantal amplitudes than at CA 3 pyramidal synapses. Finally, quantal events on to interneurones elicited spike transmission, owing in part to the more depolarized membrane potential than pyramidal cells. These results suggest that although mossy fibre synapses on to pyramidal cells are associated with a larger number of release sites per synapse, the higher connectivity, higher initial release probability, and larger relative impact per quantum on to CA 3 interneurones generate strong feedforward inhibition at physiological firing frequencies of dentate granule cells. Given the central role of CA 3 interneurones in mossy fibre synaptic transmission, these details of mossy fibre synaptic transmission should provide insight into CA 3 network dynamics under both physiological and pathophysiological circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} of the action of nitric oxide (NO) at the {{synaptic}} level on identified interneurones in local circuits that process mechanosensory signals. Here, we examine the action of NO in the terminal abdominal ganglion of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, where it has modulatory effects on the synaptic inputs of 17 identified ascending interneurones mediated by electrical stimulation of a sensory nerve. To analyse the role of NO in the processing of sensory signals, we bath-applied the NO donor SNAP, the NO scavenger PTIO, the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME, the NOS substrate l-arginine, a cyclic GMP (cGMP) analogue, 8 -Br-cGMP, and the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ. The effects of these chemicals on the synaptic inputs of the interneurones could {{be divided into two}} distinct classes. The NO donor SNAP enhanced the inputs to one class of <b>interneurone</b> (class 1) and depressed those to another (class 2). Neither the inactive isomer NAP nor degassed SNAP had any effect on the inputs to these same classes of <b>interneurone.</b> The NO scavenger PTIO caused the opposite effects to those of the NO donor SNAP, indicating that endogenous NO may have an action in local circuits. Preventing the synthesis of NO using l-NAME had the opposite effect to that of SNAP on each response class of <b>interneurone.</b> Increasing the synthesis of endogenous NO by applying l-arginine led to effects on both response classes of <b>interneurone</b> similar to those of SNAP. Taken together, these results suggested that NO was the active component in mediating the changes in amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Finally, the effects of 8 -Br-cGMP were {{similar to those of the}} NO donor, indicating the possible involvement of a NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase. This was confirmed by preventing the synthesis of cGMP by sGC using ODQ, which caused the opposite effects to those of 8 -Br-cGMP on the two response classes of <b>interneurone.</b> The results indicate that a NO [...] cGMP signal transduction pathway, in which NO regulates transmitter release from mechanosensory afferents onto intersegmental ascending interneurones, is probably present in the local circuits of the crayfish...|$|E

We tested the susceptibility of IPSPs and EPSPs evoked from group II afferents in contralateral motoneurones to presynaptic inhibition as an indicator of the relative contribution of dorsal horn <b>interneurones</b> to these PSPs, since the monosynaptic activation of dorsal horn <b>interneurones</b> is more weakly and more briefly depressed by presynaptic inhibition than is the monosynaptic activation of lamina VIII and other intermediate zone and ventral horn <b>interneurones.</b> While the earliest components of IPSPs and EPSPs evoked by group II afferents were abolished by conditioning stimulation of group II afferents, consistent with them being evoked disynaptically by commissural <b>interneurones,</b> trisynaptic components of these PSPs were only partly reduced and are therefore attributed to dorsal horn <b>interneurones.</b> The same conditioning stimuli depressed the disynaptic excitation of lamina VIII commissural <b>interneurones</b> by group II afferents much less effectively than they depressed monosynaptic excitation, indicating that dorsal horn <b>interneurones</b> contribute to this disynaptic excitation.

When direct actions of group II afferents in the intermediate zone were abolished by presynaptic inhibition, distinct later components of field potentials and delayed interneuronal responses were induced at latencies 0. 5 - 1 ms longer than those seen originally. Both the latency and a marked temporal facilitation define these later group II actions as being evoked disynaptically. Under the same conditions, single stimuli activated more than one half of dorsal horn <b>interneurones,</b> and the second and third stimuli activated all of these <b>interneurones.</b> Responses of dorsal horn <b>interneurones</b> preceded disynaptically evoked responses of intermediate zone <b>interneurones.</b> The study indicates that intermediate zone <b>interneurones</b> may be activated by group II afferents both directly and via dorsal horn <b>interneurones</b> and that synaptic actions of group II afferents upon these <b>interneurones,</b> and their subsequent actions upon motoneurones, may be modulated in parallel at the level of intermediate zone and dorsal horn <b>interneurones...</b>|$|R

Ascending intersegmental <b>interneurones</b> were stained intracellularly using the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow and the ganglia containing the stained <b>interneurones</b> subsequently processed for NADPHd activity.

Thus many ascending <b>interneurones</b> that process mechanosensory signals in the terminal ganglion may contain NOS, and are themselves likely sources of NO which is known to modulate their synaptic inputs. Three clear relationships emerged from our analysis between the effects of NO on the synaptic inputs of <b>interneurones,</b> their output properties and their staining for NADPH-diaphorase.

40|$|The quantal {{nature of}} {{transmitter}} release has been analysed at central inhibitory synapses in the leech nervous system between an <b>interneurone</b> (HN) and a motoneurone (HE) that regulate the heartbeat. 1. Ganglia were bathed in leech Ringer fluid containing 20 mM-Mg and 1. 8 mM-Ca and the membrane of the presynaptic HN <b>interneurone</b> was hyperpolarized by current injection. Under these conditions successive inhibitory potentials in the HE motoneurone, evoked by impulses in the HN <b>interneurone,</b> showed striking fluctuations in amplitude. 2. Assuming a Poisson {{distribution of the}} i. p. s. p. s and estimating the number of failures from the amplitude histograms of the observed responses, the mean size of the quantal unit was estimated as 0. 25 +/- 0. 015 mV (S. E. of mean, n = 26). When m, {{the mean number of}} quanta released per trial, was varied by changing the membrane potential of the presynaptic HN cell (Nicholls & Wallace, 1978), the experimentally observed amplitude distributions could be predicted by the Poisson theory. 3. An independent estimate of the unit size was obtained by noise analysis. A long subthreshold depolarizing pulse applied to the presynaptic HN <b>interneurone</b> evoked a sustained hyperpolarization of the HE motoneurone, apparently caused by an increase in the rate of on-going release of quanta by the HN cell terminals. From the mean change in membrane potential and the increase in variance, the size of the unit was calculated as 0. 21 +/- 0. 039 mV (S. E. of mean, n = 11). For ten pairs of cells an estimate of unit amplitude was made both from the Poisson analysis and the analysis of variance, again with good agreement. For these cells the estimated unit sizes were 0. 24 +/- 0. 023 mV (S. E. of mean, n = 10) from the failures and 0. 21 +/- 0. 043 m V (S. E. of mean, n = 10) from the noise. 4. A similar analysis was made of the inhibitory synaptic potentials evoked in one HN <b>interneurone</b> by stimulation of its contralateral homologue. Transmission again appeared to be qualtal; the mean unit amplitude from Poisson analysis was 0. 31 +/- 0. 022 mV (S. E. of mean, n = 19) and from the noise 0. 29 +/- 0. 027 mV (S. E. of mean, n = 3). 5. We conclude that transmitter is released from the terminals of the HN <b>interneurone</b> in quantal units that evoke miniature i. p. s. p. s of about 0. 25 mV in the post-synaptic cells.

In a sample of <b>interneurones,</b> all of which were interposed in pathways from the group I afferents of one group of muscles (triceps surae and plantaris), individual <b>interneurones</b> exhibited a wide variety of convergence patterns. Some <b>interneurones</b> were influenced by only a few types of afferent or descending fibre systems whereas others were influenced by many. Furthermore, various fibre systems excited and/or inhibited individual <b>interneurones</b> in different combinations. While there appeared to be too many patterns of convergence to allow any simple classification into a few distinct groups of <b>interneurones,</b> two possibilities were considered. One was that certain presynaptic fibre types influence individual <b>interneurones</b> in preferred combinations. The other was that they converge entirely at random.

Mechanisms underlying long-term changes at <b>interneurone</b> excitatory synapses, despite their importance, remain largely unknown. We use two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell recordings to determine the Ca 2 + signalling mechanisms linked specifically to group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR 1 α and mGluR 5) and their role in hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) in oriens/alveus (O/A) interneurones. We demonstrate that mGluR 1 α activation elicits dendritic Ca 2 + signals resulting from Ca 2 + influx via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores. By contrast, mGluR 5 activation produces dendritic Ca 2 + transients mediated exclusively by intracellular Ca 2 + release. Using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, we show mGluR 1 α-specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1 / 2) activation via Src in CA 1 hippocampus and, in particular, in O/A interneurones. Moreover, we find that mGluR 1 α/TRP Ca 2 + signals in <b>interneurone</b> dendrites are dependent on activation of the Src/ERK cascade. Finally, this mGluR 1 α-specific Ca 2 + signalling controls LTP at <b>interneurone</b> synapses since blocking either TRP channels or Src/ERK and intracellular Ca 2 + release prevents LTP induction.

40|$|The {{synaptic}} {{interactions among}} a group of cells in the leech C. N. S. that regulate the animal's heartbeat exhibit several remarkable features (Thompson & Stent, 1976 a, b, c). We have examined in detail the properties of the inhibitory synapse between two of these cells, the heart <b>interneurone</b> (HN cell) and the heart excitor motoneurone (HE cell). 1. Impulses in the presynaptic HN cell gave rise to monosynaptic i. p. s. p. s in the HE cell that were blocked by high concentrations of Mg and were reversed when the membrane potential of the post-synaptic motoneurone was hyperpolarized beyond [...] 75 m V or when Cl was injected into the cell body. These i. p. s. p. s were chemically mediated, and involved an increase in chloride conductance. 2. In contrast to chemical synapses between sensory and motor cells in the leech C. N. S., little facilitation or depression of transmission occurred when the HN cell was stimulated at frequencies of 0. 1 [...] 50 Hz. 3. Steady subthreshold depolarization of the presynaptic HN <b>interneurone</b> evoked a maintained hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic HE cell, indicating that currents injected into the HN cell body could spread to the terminals and cause continuous release of transmitter. 4. The size of the i. p. s. p. evoked in the HE motoneurone by an action potential in the HN <b>interneurone</b> varied with the resting membrane potential of the presynaptic cell. An impulse superimposed on a prolonged, subthreshold, depolarizing pulse produced a larger i. p. s. p.; conversely, prolonged hyperpolarization of the HN <b>interneurone</b> reduced the i. p. s. p. amplitude recorded in the HE cell. This effect was most obvious when the natural, rhythmical bursts of activity in the HN <b>interneurone</b> were interrupted by bathing the preparation in leech Ringer fluid containing elevated concentrations of Mg. Under these conditions a 10 mV depolarization of the HN cell increased the size of the i. p. s. p. in the HE cell approximately sixfold. Significant changes in i. p. s. p. amplitude occurred without any noticeable change in the amplitude and duration of the presynaptic action potential. With large presynaptic depolarizations, which produced the biggest i. p. s. p. s, there was some reduction in the amplitude and increase in the duration of the action potential. 5. Following a step depolarization of the presynaptic cell, the size of successive i. p. s. p. s increased with a time constant of about 1 sec. Upon repolarization the i. p. s. p. s decreased in amplitude to the original level. 6. stimulation of one HN cell also gives rise to an i. p. s. p. in its contralateral homologue (Thompson & Stent, 1976 c). Trains of i. p. s. p. s produced in this way hyperpolarized at HN cell {{to such an extent that}} the size of the synaptic potential it evoked in an HE cell was reduced. 7.

The components of the IPSPs recorded in motoneurones that were mediated by Ia inhibitory <b>interneurones</b> were identified by their depression following activation of Renshaw cells. Trisynaptic components of IPSPs of reticulospinal and vestibulospinal origin, and polysynaptic (but not trisynaptic) components of IPSPs from group II afferents were found to be depressed in the majority of the motoneurones, while disynaptic components, those due to direct actions of inhibitory commissural <b>interneurones,</b> were not depressed. These results indicate that the coordination of left and right hindlimb movements based on crossed inhibition from reticulospinal and vestibulospinal neurones, depends on the degree of activation of Ia inhibitory <b>interneurones</b> by muscle spindle afferents and on their inhibition by Renshaw cells.

Mutual facilitation and occlusion of actions evoked from the ipsilateral and contralateral PTs lead {{to the conclusion that the}} same midlumbar <b>interneurones</b> in pathways from group I or II muscle afferents may relay uncrossed and crossed PT actions...|$|R
40|$|A {{network of}} intra- and intersegmental {{synaptic}} connexions {{has been identified}} in the ventral nerve cord of the leech that links the set of oscillatory <b>interneurones</b> of the central swim oscillator to the motor neurones command-ing the swimming rhythm. Excitatory connexions lead from oscillatory <b>interneurones</b> to both excitatory and inhibitory motor neurones, whereas inhibitory connexions lead from oscillatory <b>interneurones</b> to only the inhibitory motor neurones. Connexions leading from a motor neurone back to the oscillatory <b>interneurones</b> were found in only one exceptional case, an inhibitory motor neurone previously known {{to have access to}} the central swim oscillator. This network of identified connexions can account reason-ably well for the mechanism by which the oscillatory <b>interneurones</b> drive their follower motor neurones into the phasic activity pattern characteristic of the swimming movement...|$|R

40|$|Current {{concepts}} of hippocampal circuitry assume {{a large population}} of excitatory principal neurones whose activity is largely governed by a network of local-circuit GABAergic interneurones. The diversity of hippocampal local-circuit neurones and their synaptic control over principal cell activity was investigated in vitro, in order to define their synaptic connections and functional roles. Single and dual intracellular recordings were made from local-circuit neurones and pyramidal cells in area CA 1 of the rat hippocampal slice. Interneurones were tentatively distinguished from pyramidal cells based on their firing {{as well as their}} membrane properties. Intracellular labelling of recorded cells with the marker biocytin revealed a diversity of cell types based on differential dendritic and axonal morphology and synaptic connections. The physiological data revealed that all types of <b>interneurone</b> tested evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells. The IPSPs had fast rise and decay kinetics and the ones tested pharmacologically, were mediated by GABA A receptors. Similarly, individual interneurones were also shown to innervate other local-circuit interneurones in addition to pyramidal cells, the evoked effects being qualitatively similar in both types of postsynaptic targets. The postsynaptic effect and functional role of one type of hippocampal <b>interneurone,</b> the basket cell, was investigated in greater detail. Basket cell-evoked IPSPs were reliable, but showed some frequency-dependent attenuation. Moreover, basket cell IPSPs were found to interact with intrinsic pyramidal cell conductances to elicit rebound depolarisations and facilitate action potential generation. More detailed investigation showed that basket and axo-axonic cells were particularly effective in entraining pyramidal cell firing and sub-threshold membrane potential oscillations. Through these powerfully tuned mechanisms, sub-types of local-circuit <b>interneurone</b> provide a powerful mechanism to synchronise the activity of pyramidal cells. These results demonstrate a remarkable diversity of GABAergic local-circuit neurones in the hippocampal CA 1 area and suggest that specific subtypes of cell mediate different functions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{relationship between}} the afferent projection and the dendrites of the interneurones was examined in the cercal-to-giant <b>interneurone</b> system of the cricket using intracellular recording and dye injection techniques. The physiology of the sensory neurones beneath the cercal filiform hairs was investigated by placing a recording pipette over {{the end of a}} cut hair and using movements of the pipette to characterize the directionality of the receptor. Most of the filiform receptors could be classified as belonging to one of four major types. Each type is sensitive to a different wind direction and is confined to particular regions of the cercus. The location of the terminal arborizations of each type of sensory cell was revealed by staining with cobalt chloride. Single cells were stained reliably by placing a dye-filled pipette over a cut hair. Each physiological receptor type arborizes in a different region of the central nervous system. Therefore the neuropile is functionally divided according to wind direction. The dendrites of three identified interneurones were examined {{in the context of this}} afferent projection. It was found that each of these neurones has dendrites in regions of neuropile corresponding to different wind directions. By searching for unitary synaptic potentials in identified interneurones, it was possible to show a strong correlation between anatomical overlap of primary afferent and <b>interneurone</b> and the existence of a synaptic connexion. Further, when there was no overlap, no synaptic potentials were seen. Therefore the over-all excitatory receptive field of an <b>interneurone</b> could be predicted by examining its dendritic structure. Each of the three identified interneurones examined in this study was found to have a directional response that matched the response predicted on the basis of its anatomy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Interneurones</b> {{interconnecting}} the {{two sides}} of the spinal cord (commissural <b>interneurones)</b> are critically important for interlimb coordination, but little is known about their organization. We have examined the inputs to commissural <b>interneurones</b> located in the midlumbar segments with projections to contralateral motor nuclei, aiming to determine whether they form distinct subpopulations. Based on intracellular records from 78 <b>interneurones,</b> two major non-overlapping subpopulations were identified: one monosynaptically excited by group II muscle afferents (n = 10), the other monosynaptically excited by reticulospinal neurones (n = 52). Monosynaptic input from group I muscle afferents and/or from vestibulospinal tract neurones was found in those with monosynaptic reticulospinal, but not group II input, and in a few other neurones (n = 6). Only disynaptic input from these sources was found in the remaining 10 <b>interneurones.</b> Disynaptic excitatory input from ipsilateral and contralateral muscle afferents and from descending tracts was distributed less selectively and might mediate coexcitation of <b>interneurones</b> with monosynaptic afferent or descending input. The dominant disynaptic and polysynaptic input was, however, inhibitory. IPSPs were evoked from the descending tracts in a high proportion of the commissural <b>interneurones</b> that were monosynaptically excited by group II afferents (55 %) and from group II afferents in a high proportion of the commissural <b>interneurones</b> that were monosynaptically excited by reticulospinal fibres (78 %). This distribution suggests that the two subpopulations are activated differentially, rather than being coactivated, in either centrally initiated movements or reflex adjustments. This would be consistent with the previous demonstration that noradrenaline differentially affects commissural neurones of the two subpopulations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Interneurones</b> {{receiving}} {{excitatory input}} from group II muscle afferents of hindlimb nerves and {{located in the}} lower-lumbar (L 6 -L 7) segments of the cat spinal cord were investigated using both extracellular and intracellular recording. The <b>interneurones</b> were located mainly in the lateral parts of laminae IV-VII, dorsal and lateral to the main region in which <b>interneurones</b> with input from group I muscle afferents are located. Almost half the sample of <b>interneurones</b> (38 of 76) were characterized by an ipsilateral ascending projection within the lateral funiculus to the L 4 level. The most powerful group II excitation was produced by afferents of the quadriceps and deep peroneal muscle nerves (which discharged 70 – 80 % of extracellularly recorded neurones) while group II afferents of tibialis posterior, posterior biceps-semitendinosus and gastrocnemius soleus were also highly effective (discharging 45 – 55 % of extracellularly recorded neurones). A proportion of intracellularly recorded group II EPSPs were monosynaptic. Seventy-five per cent of the extracellularly recorded <b>interneurones</b> were discharged by group II afferents {{of two or more}} muscle nerves and 43 % by afferents of three or more nerves. Group I muscle afferents evoked small EPSPs in over one-quarter of the intracellularly recorded <b>interneurones</b> and virtually all were strongly excited by cutaneous afferents. Evidence of excitatory input from joint, interosseous and group III muscle afferents was also observed. The properties of the <b>interneurones</b> are compared with those of others in the lumbosacral segments and the possibility that they may function as last-order premotor <b>interneurones</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase), {{maintains}} intracellular and extracellular {{concentrations of}} sodium and potassium by catalysing ATP. Three sodium pump α subunits, ATP 1 A 1, ATP 1 A 2 and ATP 1 A 3, {{are expressed in}} brain. We compared their role in pyramidal cells and a subset of <b>interneurones</b> in the subiculum. <b>Interneurones</b> were identified by their expression of GFP under the GAD- 65 promoter. We used the sensitivity to the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, to discriminate between different α subunit isoforms. GFP-positive <b>interneurones</b> were depolarized by nanomolar doses of ouabain, but higher concentrations were needed to depolarize pyramidal cells. Comparison of pump currents in these cells revealed a current sensitive to low doses of ouabain in <b>interneurones,</b> while micromolar doses of ouabain were needed to suppress the pump current in subicular pyramidal cells. As predicted, nanomolar doses of ouabain increased the frequency but not the amplitudes of IPSPs in pyramidal cells. Immunostaining confirmed a differential distribution of α-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase in subicular <b>interneurones</b> and pyramidal cells. In conclusion, {{these data suggest that}} while ATP 1 A 3 -isoforms regulate sodium and potassium homeostasis in subicular <b>interneurones,</b> ATP 1 A 1 -isoforms assume this function in pyramidal cells. This differential expression of sodium pump isoforms may contribute to differences in resting membrane potential of subicular <b>interneurones</b> and pyramidal cells...|$|R
40|$|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) {{patients}} frequently experience {{well formed}} recurrent complex visual hallucinations (RCVH). This {{is associated with}} reduced blood flow or hypometabolism on imaging of the primary visual cortex. To understand these associations in DLB we used pathological and biochemical analysis of the primary visual cortex to identify changes that could underpin RCVH. Alpha-synuclein or neurofibrillary tangle pathology in primary visual cortex was essentially absent. Neurone density or volume within the primary visual cortex in DLB was also unchanged using unbiased stereology. Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function. Calcium binding protein and GAD 65 / 67 immunohistochemistry showed preserved <b>interneurone</b> populations indicating possible <b>interneurone</b> dysfunction. This was demonstrated by loss of post synaptic GABA receptor markers including gephyrin, GABARAP, and Kif 5 A, indicating reduced GABAergic synaptic activity. Glutamatergic neuronal signalling was also altered with vesicular glutamate transporter protein and PSD- 95 expression being reduced. Changes to the primary visual cortex in DLB indicate that reduced GABAergic transmission may contribute to RCVH in DLB and treatment using targeted GABAergic modulation or similar approaches using glutamatergic modification may be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|The {{calling and}} {{courtship}} songs of 17 -year cicadas and of Say's cicadas differ {{both in the}} sound frequency spectrum and in temporal pattern. Multiunit recordings with hook electrodes from the whole auditory nerve show that the hearing organs are especially sensitive to transient stimuli occurring in natural sounds. Artificially produced clicks elicit bursts of spikes synchronized among various primary sensory fibres. These fibres respond to natural calling and courtship songs with a specificity dependent on carrier frequency, rhythm and transient content of the sound, following sound pulses (i. e. tymbal actions) up to repetition rates of 200 Hz. An ascending, plurisegmental <b>interneurone</b> was characterized by intracellular recording and simultaneously stained with cobalt. Its main arborization spatially overlaps the anterior part of the sensory auditory neuropile, and the axon was traced {{as far as the}} prothoracic ganglion. Direct input from primary auditory fibres was suggested by latency measurements. Intracellular recordings from such neurons in different species show distinct auditory input, with phasic-tonic spike responses to tones. In general, the <b>interneurone</b> response is more species-specific to calling than to courtship songs, and the preferential response to the conspecific calling song is based primarily upon sound frequency content...|$|E
40|$|The mature neocortex {{contains}} many different classes of GABAergic inhibitory interneurones, distributed, {{with some degree}} of selectivity, through six layers and through many different regions. Some of the events in the early lives of these neurones that may determine their ultimate destination, their maturation and their selective innervation of targets appropriate for each subtype, are discussed. Both time and place of birth influence the class of <b>interneurone</b> that an early post-mitotic interneuronal precursor will become, driven by the selective expression of different combinations of transcription factors in different regions of their birth-places in the ganglionic eminence and ventricular zone. The long distance migration of these precursors along tangential routes in marginal, subventricular and intermediate zones and their final radial movement, into the developing cortex, is regulated by chemical cues, both attractant and repellent. Once they arrive at their final destination, they must integrate into the developing circuitry. As they mature within the cortex, their axons grow and branch in highly specific patterns that may be partially determined by the genetic blueprint for each interneuronal class and partly by the environment in which they find themselves. Finally, as each <b>interneurone</b> class begins to form synapses with only certain postsynaptic targets, cell-cell recognition, most probably via protein-protein interactions across the synaptic cleft, facilitate the formation of appropriate synapses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough several {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the local GABAergic circuit in the rat hippocampus is functional very early in development, this result has not been yet completed by the investigation of the full dendritic and axonal arborization of the neonatal <b>interneurones.</b> In the present study, intracellular injection of biocytin was used to assess the branching pattern of <b>interneurones</b> in the hippocampal CA 3 region of rat between 2 and 6 days of age. Based on their dendritic morphology, the biocytin-filled <b>interneurones</b> were divided into four classes: bipolar, stellate, pyramidal-like and fusiform <b>interneurones.</b> About half of the biocytin-filled neonatal <b>interneurones</b> exhibited dendritic or somatic filopodial processes. The axonal arbors of the filled-interneurones were widely spread into the CA 3 region, and in four out of nine cases extended beyond the CA 3 region to branch into the CA 1 region. These results show that, despite immature features, the filopodial processes, the hippocampal <b>interneurones</b> are well developed early in development at a time when their target cells, the pyramidal neurones, are still developing. These observations are consistent with a trophic role that GABA may play early in development...|$|R

This study asked {{whether there is}} selective insertion of different a subunit [...] containing GABAA receptors at neocortical inhibitory synapses innervated by specific classes of <b>interneurones.</b> The benzodiazepine site pharmacology of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) elicited in neocortical pyramidal cells by 3 classes of <b>interneurones</b> was explored with dual whole-cell recordings in neocortical slices from juvenile rats (P 18 [...] 23). Fast IPSPs activated by multipolar <b>interneurones</b> with narrow spikes and nonadapting firing patterns were powerfully enhanced by the a 1 -preferring agonist zolpidem, suggesting mediation via larger proportion of a 1 GABAA receptors than those activated by multipolar, adapting <b>interneurones,</b> which were less strongly enhanced by zolpidem, but equally insensitive to the a 5 -selective inverse agonist IAalpha 5 (MSD, Essex, UK) suggesting mediation predominantly via a 2 / 3 GABAA receptors. In contrast, the IPSPs elicited by bitufted, dendrite-preferring <b>interneurones</b> were reduced by IAalpha 5 and by zinc and insensitive to zolpidem despite enhancement by the broad-spectrum agonist, diazepam. Thus insertion of GABAA receptors at synapses on neocortical pyramids is input-specific, with proximal inhibition employing a 1 and a 2 / 3 GABAA receptors and dendrite-preferring bitufted <b>interneurones</b> activating a 5 GABAA receptors...|$|R

Lesions of either the dorsal funiculi or of the lateral and ventral funiculi were made between L 4 and L 5 segments in two groups of cats.
