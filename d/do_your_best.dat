500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy. When you play against good teams you have to <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best.</b> I am not thinking about the past and that we won the Champions League." ...|$|E
500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E

500|$|... "The Cure" [...] {{was written}} after Gaga's {{performance}} at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Gaga worked with longtime collaborator DJ White Shadow (aka Paul Blair) for the track. He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as [...] "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the [...] "terrible stuff {{going on in the}} world right now, it's like when you're a creative person you <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> to try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." [...] Gaga and her team wanted to release the [...] "one-off" [...] single as soon as production was completed.|$|E
500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> in that situation and then move on".|$|E
500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best.</b> It's {{one of those things where}} the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

500|$|Less than an {{hour before}} the {{independence}} ceremony a Belgian officer arrived to request that Lumumba depart for parliament. Kasongo was disturbed by what Lumumba planned to say and told Kanza as he left, [...] "I'm counting on you to <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> to tone down that speech." [...] As Lumumba dressed, Kanza and one of the secretaries, André Mandi, read through as much of the speech as they could, replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper. Lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous {{with the rest of his}} government. Kanza and Mandi followed in the second car, making additional revisions to the speech. These were so extensive that both feared Lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks. Upon their arrival at the residence, Kanza and Mandi briefly explained their alterations to Lumumba. Greatly pleased with the result, Lumumba stated that he would read some parts of the speech verbatim, then improvise to respond to the atmosphere in the room as he saw fit. He made his own alterations to the script during the speeches given by Baudouin and Kasa-Vubu.|$|E
500|$|Nicole {{had a brief}} {{relationship}} with Penn Graham (Christian Clark) and after he was murdered, she discovered {{that she was pregnant}} with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best,</b> I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E

2500|$|Hill was a Peace Corps {{volunteer}} in Cameroon from 1974 to 1976. Hill credits {{his work with}} the Peace Corps for teaching him his first lessons in diplomacy. As a volunteer, Hill worked with credit unions and when he discovered that one board of directors had stolen 60 percent of their members' money, he reported on the malfeasance to their members, who promptly re-elected them because the board reflected carefully balanced tribal interests and it really did not matter to the members if the board directors ran a good credit union or not. Hill said the lesson was that [...] "When something's happened, it's happened for a reason and you <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> to understand that reason. But don't necessarily think you can change it." [...] Hill took the Foreign Service exam while he was serving as a Peace Corps {{volunteer in}} Cameroon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1883, Luther {{was sent}} to work as an intern for John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] Captain Pratt told Luther: “My boy, you are going away from us to work for this school.

[...] They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. [...] Now {{you are going to}} prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man. [...] If John Wanamaker gives you the job of blacking his shoes, see that you make them shine. [...] Then he will give you a better job.

2500|$|In 1917, it {{was decided}} to re-establish the liberal arts college, and on June 14, 1918, the Eastern Nazarene College was {{chartered}} with degree-granting authority in the state of Rhode Island, while secondary education would remain as the Eastern Nazarene Academy. Choosing a new name, however, would be difficult: the school was now a liberal arts college and a Nazarene institution. Candidates included: [...] "Northeastern Nazarene College", [...] "Bresee Memorial College", [...] "Nazarene College of the Northeast", and [...] "Nazarene College and Bresee Theological Institute". General Superintendent John W. Goodwin can be credited with the chosen name, as he wrote to Hiram F. Reynolds, also a general superintendent and a long-time supporter of the school: [...] "I know you will <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> for our New England College. I should be glad if they would change the name to the Eastern Nazarene College, or something like that. It would seem we must have a school there, although it moves along hard and slow." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best.</b> The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty.

Then he will give you a better job. If you are put into the office to clean, don’t forget to sweep up under the chairs and in the corners. If you do this well, he will give you better work to do." [...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
2500|$|As chaos {{broke out}} {{throughout}} China {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (程郁), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi, [...] "Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you." [...] He also wrote to Cheng Yu, [...] "I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged to do my best to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, so you should <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> to serve the Administrator. You should not be thinking of rebelling." [...] Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji, [...] "Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!" [...] Cheng Ji replied, [...] "Yue Yang (樂羊) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I'll do it." [...] Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
