5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the film}} was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations {{included}} the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Sirkeci railway station which also {{was used for the}} Belgrade and Zagreb railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at Pinewood Studios with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were shot in Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were shot in Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent {{of the film}} had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. The Gypsy camp was also to be filmed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> camp in Topkapi, but was actually shot in a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was shot in Spain, as Britain did not allow filming with wild rats, and an attempt filming white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers.|$|E
5000|$|A sinsign (also called token and actisign) {{is a sign}} which {{consists}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reaction/resistance, <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> singular thing, <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> occurrence or fact, a [...] "Second." ...|$|R

25|$|Taking place <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> apartment, the {{tracking}} shot over {{the murder scene}} at the end took three months of preparation just because the production team had {{to cut through the}} ceiling in order to get it right.|$|E
25|$|The {{plight of}} the Aral coast was portrayed in the 1989 film Psy ("Dogs") by Soviet {{director}} Dmitri Svetozarov. The film was shot on location <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> ghost town located near the Aral Sea, showing scenes of abandoned buildings and scattered vessels.|$|E
25|$|Following the battle, Smith won {{praise for}} his gallant conduct, {{including}} a mention {{in a joint}} resolution of the Congress of the Confederate States. General Magruder attempted to secure a regular Naval commission as commander for him, one of several repeated attempts, which did not result <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> commission being granted.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Schenectady {{participated in}} the South Vietnamese Army's {{offensive}} to recapture Quang Tri Province, in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam. While so engaged, on 29 June 1972, the LST came under the fire of enemy shore batteries {{and became the first}} ship of its class to return fire <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> combat situation.|$|E
25|$|A crux gemmata (Latin for: jewelled cross) {{is a form}} of cross {{typical of}} Early Christian and Early Medieval art, where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally {{decorated}} with jewels. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the Crucifixion of Jesus or other subjects.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} launch of torpedoes from a torpedo boat (which itself was launched from a torpedo boat tender) <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> battle was by Russian admiral Stepan Makarov on January 16, 1878, who used self-propelled Whitehead's torpedoes against the Ottoman gunboat İntibâh during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. The first sinking of an armoured ship by a torpedo boat, the , {{occurred during the}} 1891 Chilean Civil War.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he speaks}} of eternal life. He always speaks of it as <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> life, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spiritual body, into which our mortal bodies are to be changed. Nothing can be clearer from what he says in 1 Cor. xv., that he means <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> rising again of our bodies from bodily death; <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> change <b>in</b> them; <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> life <b>in</b> them for ever.|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s, Goldsmith {{scored the}} Michael Crichton film, Runaway, the composer's first all-electronic score. In an {{interview}} with Keyboard Magazine in 1984, Goldsmith said {{that in order to}} simulate the ambiance of a real orchestra, several speakers were set up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> orchestra hall similar to how they would be arranged if they were live players. The playback was re-recorded to capture the feel of the hall.|$|E
25|$|A flow bench tests ports under {{a steady}} {{pressure}} difference {{while in the}} actual engine the pressure difference varies widely during the whole cycle. The exact flow conditions existing in the flow bench test exist only fleetingly if at all <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> running engine. Running engines cause the air to flow in strong waves rather than the steady stream of the flow bench. This acceleration/deceleration of the fuel/air column causes effects not accounted for in flow bench tests.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the years}} the rivalry between the Blue Bulls and Western Province has become legendary, and a clash between these two sides {{is one of the}} Currie Cup's biggest rivalries. The first time that the two sides met <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> Currie Cup final was in 1946, which was also Northern Transvaal's first final contest. The match was played at Northern Transvaal's home ground at Loftus Versfeld, and saw the Western Province go down 11 to 9.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phrase is}} {{sometimes}} cynically rearranged to [...] "One step forward, two steps back..." [...] {{to reflect a}} situation where, seemingly for every attempt to make progress <b>in</b> <b>a</b> task, <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> [...] performance is achieved. The phrase One Step Forward, Two Steps Back {{was used as a}} title of a 1904 revolutionary pamphlet by Vladimir Lenin.|$|R
25|$|The most {{promising}} candidates {{are invited to}} return {{for a second or}} third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a test week, in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> performance setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{various kinds}} of unconformities are gaps in the {{geologic}} record. Such gaps can {{be due to a}} prolonged absence of deposition or due to subsequent erosion that removes previously deposited rock units. The following sections are ordered from oldest to youngest rock units {{in order to create a}} geologic history of events. This is the opposite order one would see <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> cross section of the sediments because newer rock units are deposited on top of older ones per the law of superposition.|$|E
25|$|For us {{the real}} {{revolution}} in critical theory...was heralded by the publication, in 1938, of Understanding Poetry...for {{many of us}} who were preparing ourselves to teach English is those years....this book...came as a kind of revelation. It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E
5000|$|This book {{is said to}} be {{loosely based}} on Herman Wouk's {{experiences}} <b>in</b> managing <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> hotel, the Royal Mail Inn, in the early 1960s in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The hotel was on Hassel Island, located in Charlotte Amalie Harbour.|$|R

50|$|The secret weapon, able to {{obliterate}} entire islands, was deemed {{a bit too}} close <b>in</b> nature to <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> military secret: the atomic bomb.|$|R
25|$|The Constitution is a {{definition}} of the powers of government. Who {{is to determine the}} nature, scope and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It {{featured}} increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 {{as a free}} upgrade CD for 10.0 users, {{in addition to the}} US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems. On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products {{by the end of that}} month.|$|E
25|$|Bachelor {{groups are}} made up of {{adolescent}} and bucks not holding territory. Any new members must perform intimidation displays to enter the group. However, bachelor groups tend to be very loose and members can leave whenever they want. The larger, older males with thick horns have the best chance of establishing a territory. Conflicts between adult males are usually solved with intimidation displays. The bucks circle each other and swing their necks from side to side, displaying their neck power. Neck strength is important <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> fight and the male that cannot keep up yields. Gazelles of nearly equal neck strength are {{more likely to engage in}} actual combat. Fighting occurs in young bucks more often than older ones. Dominant bucks can simply run off subordinates rather than having to display to them.|$|E
5000|$|The show 10 Items or Less {{was filmed}} <b>in</b> Jons Marketplace, <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> grocery store <b>in</b> Reseda, and often used real {{customers}} as extras.|$|R
