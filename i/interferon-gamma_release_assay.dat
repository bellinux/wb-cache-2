The {{aim of this study}} in Egypt was to estimate the usefulness of an <b>interferon-gamma</b> <b>release</b> <b>assay</b> (IFN-γ) assay for the {{detection of}} latent TB infection in contacts of active TB cases. A total of 116 participants were enrolled and divided into 3 groups: community controls, casual (laboratory and clinic) contacts and close (household) contacts.

Subjects diagnosed as latent TB infection by IFN-γ assay (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube) were 5. 9 % of controls, 31. 0 % of casual contacts and 33. 3 % of close contacts.

In recent UK tuberculosis (TB) guidelines, {{it has been}} advised to screen for latent M. tuberculosis infection using the tuberculin skin test (TST), followed by IGRA if the TST is positive.
