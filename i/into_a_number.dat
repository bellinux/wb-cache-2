5000|$|The theorem can be {{interpreted}} combinatorially in terms of partitions. In particular, the left hand side is a generating function {{for the number of}} partitions of n <b>into</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> of distinct parts minus the number of partitions of n <b>into</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> of distinct parts. Each partition of n <b>into</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> of distinct parts contributes +1 to the coefficient of xn; each partition <b>into</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> of distinct parts contributes &minus;1. (The article on unrestricted partition functions discusses this type of generating function.) ...|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{coefficient}} of x5 is +1 because {{there are two ways}} to split 5 <b>into</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> of distinct parts (4+1 and 3+2), but only one way to do so for <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> of distinct parts (the one-part partition 5). However, {{the coefficient}} of x12 is −1 because there are seven ways to partition 12 <b>into</b> <b>an</b> even <b>number</b> of distinct parts, but there are eight ways to partition 12 <b>into</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> of distinct parts.|$|R
5000|$|Statistical data binning {{is a way}} {{to group}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of more or less {{continuous}} values <b>into</b> <b>a</b> smaller <b>number</b> of [...] "bins".

Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices.
