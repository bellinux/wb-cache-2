Middle Location Register (MLR) is located between VLR and HLR. It helps to reduce the heavy load at HLR. Modified PCFLA (MPCFLA) combines the MLR with PCFLA to improve the performance of PCFLA.

The performance capacity of the evolution mechanism was shown by running the model 1100 times for both carnivores and herbivores so that only one type of animals could evolve. Also it was shown that attempts of controlling the population abundances with chemicals or by hunting while being somewhat effective still can be overcome by animals if they have the ability to evolve. </span...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In crisis {{situations}} it {{is important}} that crisis response workers can quickly get access to the right information for the tasks they are required to undertake. A distinction can be made between getting the right information and having the rights to <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>information.</b> The first is an information filtering and relevance problem, the second is a security issue related to access control. In this paper we focus on the second issue. It is impossible to predefine access rules for all players in a crisis situation that ensure that they have access only to the information they need. Therefore the key is to have a system that is flexible and timely (efficient) with respect to the decision to grant access, without a major burden on humans having to make these decisions, and without inadvertant leakages of sensitive information. We believe for crisis management {{it is more important to}} be able to hold individuals and organizations accountable for their use of information than to overly restrict access to information. We propose goal-based explainable security certificate requests as a solution to this problem. ...|$|E

If you manage to become better at giving entrepreneurs objects with the right conditions to maintain a higher productivity per hour, the contractor's financial situation will achieve this. To improve, Södra should follow up the conditions necessary to improve a higher productivity per hour and then give the information to its field personnel. Contractor`s relocation compensation must be raised because it has too much impact on the result. If relocation compensation is raised the contractors do not need to get large objects to reach profitability and hence comes the geographical area to be reduced for the contractors. If the number of plants with mechanized planting increases Södra should develop a plant and a packaging system that is more suited for mechanized planting...|$|E

The central part {{of this study is to}} investigate the magnitude of these six people’s interest in local and national news, how the current coverage from media affects their national social inclusion in society as a whole and finally describes the six people’s faith towards the media in the region. Our theoretical framework has been inspired by similar studies regarding the importance of local news, with the difference that we focused on the perspective of the people we interviewed and the stories they told us. We found that the majority of these six people we interviewed thought the news coverage of Gäddede is low and that is a factor of the social exclusion they feel for the society in general. Some stories from these people indicate that they have low faith in media. There is a strong interest in news of the people we interviewed, but they feel there is an absence of local news.

This study evaluates the consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for different plastics used for water packaging. Successive messages emphasizing the characteristics of plastic are delivered to participants allowing explaining information influence on the consumers' WTP. We find that information has a significant effect on WTP. The participants' WTP for plastic bottles tends to increase after information emphasizing that the related plastic bottles has no negative impact on the environment, and to decrease with information on its negative impact. Using a fixed effect panel model, we show that there is a significant premium for recycled plastic bottles except when biodegradable plastic bottles are present on the market. We compare the welfare effects of regulatory policies allowing reducing environmental damages of plastic water bottles. We <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>information</b> campaign on plastic bottles issues would be the best policy whether it would not be difficult to implement it in practice.
