25|$|Unresponsive to Hartman's harsh discipline, Pyle is {{eventually}} assigned to Joker's squad. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing the recruits {{have failed to}} improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment {{for the rest of}} the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation for Pyle's failures, the platoon hazes him with a blanket party, restraining him in <b>his</b> <b>bunk</b> while beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels and used like blackjacks. After this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model Marine. This impresses Hartman but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as him talking to his M14 rifle.|$|E

25|$|Just as {{the deputies}} {{were about to}} make their move, Ashley's dog began barking at the lawmen. The deputies fired at the dog, causing Ashley to return fire; he killed one of the deputies, the sheriff's cousin Fred Baker, in the {{resulting}} gunfight. His father, Joe Ashley, was killed in <b>his</b> <b>bunk</b> while his partner, Albert Miller, and Laura were seriously wounded by buckshot from a deputy's shotgun. Forced to leave his wife behind, Ashley escaped through a secret entrance; his wife's screaming caused the deputies to hold their fire, which helped enable the escape. Despite a manhunt involving 200 men, during which the homes of both Joe Ashley and Hanford Mobley were burned (as well as a small grocery owned by Miller), Ashley remained {{in the area where}} Laura was being held by police. He hoped to plan a jail break for her, as well as avenge the death of his father, but as more time passed he left for California to lie low.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} train departs Istanbul, its passage is blocked by an avalanche, {{stopping}} it. The sudden stop causes Poirot {{to fall out}} of <b>his</b> <b>bunk</b> and sprain his ankle, rendering him bed-ridden. Soon after, Ratchett is found murdered, with twelve possible suspects to the murder, and the investigation begins. Marceau is challenged by Poirot to find the solution to the murder and do the [...] "legwork" [...] by gathering clues.|$|E

Eliezer lies in the bunk above and does nothing for fear of being beaten too. He hears his father make a rattling noise, [...] "Eliezer." [...] In the morning, 29 January 1945, he finds another man in his father's place. The Kapos had come before dawn and taken Chlomo to the crematorium.|$|E
500|$|Captain Stone now orders Merriam {{to send a}} radio {{message to}} the {{corporate}} office advising them that Winslow has been washed overboard. Merriam accuses the captain of murdering Winslow, and the two fight. Crew members intervene, and the captain has the crew tie up Merriam {{and put him in}} <b>his</b> <b>bunk.</b> [...] The captain then has First Officer Bowns (Ben Bard) administer a sedative to Merriam. Finn finally delivers the captain's radiogram to Bowns, who can read. Bowns becomes deeply alarmed. The first officer talks to several other crew members, all of whom now begin questioning the captain's sanity.|$|E
500|$|A man (Henry Ian Cusick) {{wakes up}} from <b>his</b> <b>bunk</b> bed and {{immediately}} presses a few keys on {{what appears to}} be a late 1970s-era computer. He then gets dressed, and begins his day as the camera moves about the surrounding rooms, which contain an assortment of objects from the 1960s to the present. He puts on some music, begins an exercise routine, has a shower, makes himself some breakfast, and injects himself with a vaccine. He is interrupted by an explosion, spurring the man to arm himself before using a telescope-and-mirror system. His gaze reveals the faces of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) standing around the now-open [...] shaft.|$|E
60|$|I {{got into}} my bunk and Bill got into 'is, and we lay there {{listening}} while the cook, {{who was a}} terrible ticklish man, leaned out of <b>'is</b> <b>bunk</b> and said wot 'e'd do if it 'appened ag'in.|$|R

500|$|Subsequent court-martial {{testimony}} by a surviving midshipman describes {{the behavior of}} the mutineers as [...] "truly savage and brutal". Pigot {{and a number of other}} victims were still alive when they were thrown overboard, while the Marine officer McIntosh was dying of yellow fever when the mutineers dragged him from <b>his</b> <b>bunk.</b> Third Lieutenant Foreshaw had fallen on a mizen chain whaler platform extending from the side of the ship but was hacked to death when he regained the deck. The majority of the crew emerged leaderless from their sleeping quarters to a scene of chaos. No effort was made to oppose those actively involved in the mutiny, even by the sailors who Pigot had brought with him from his previous ship and generally favored.|$|E
500|$|Rodney was ill, {{and spent}} the entire action in <b>his</b> <b>bunk.</b> [...] His flag captain, Walter Young, urged Rodney to give orders to engage when the Spanish fleet was first spotted, but Rodney only gave orders to form a line abreast. [...] Lángara started to {{establish}} a line of battle, but when he realised the size of Rodney's fleet, he gave orders to make all sail for Cadiz. [...] Around 2:00 pm, when Rodney felt certain that the ships seen were not the vanguard of a larger fleet, he issued commands for a general chase. [...] Rodney's instructions to his fleet were to chase at their best speed, and engage the Spanish ships from the rear as they came upon them. [...] They were also instructed to sail to the lee side to interfere with Spanish attempts to gain {{the safety of a}} harbour, a tactic that also prevented the Spanish ships from opening their lowest gun ports. [...] Because of their copper-sheathed hulls (which reduced marine growths and drag), the ships of the Royal Navy were faster and soon gained on the Spanish.|$|E
500|$|Kroonland {{was also}} {{involved}} in several non-weather-related events. On 12 November 1920, after departing Antwerp for New York, she collided with a Dutch tug in the Scheldt, killing two of the tug's crew. In March 1921, a Czechoslovakian woman gave birth to fraternal twins on board the liner shortly after {{she and her husband}} sailed from Antwerp. Because the twins were born on a U.S.-flagged vessel, they were automatically American citizens. On 10 June 1922, The New York Times reported that Charles Simmons, Kroonlands Chief Steward, was found dead in <b>his</b> <b>bunk.</b> Crewmen aboard the ship, which had been docked in New York since 4 June, said Simmons had been seen on deck in apparently good health the day before. The medical examiner nevertheless asked police to investigate, because it appeared to him that Simmons had been dead for three to four days. During an August eastbound crossing, Kroonland stood by for two hours after receiving a report of an explosion and fire on , some [...] behind. The gas explosion in one of Adriatics forward cargo holds killed five crewmen and seriously wounded three others. It also spawned a fire that was quickly extinguished and left little damage. Offers of help from ten liners (including Kroonland) were politely declined and Adriatic arrived in New York three days later. In October, U.S. Federal judge Learned Hand issued a restraining order preventing the Prohibition-related seizure of alcohol aboard Kroonland, Finland, and St. Paul. IMM had sought the order to enable her to continue to carry Italian third-class passengers; Italian law required a minimum number of a ship's crew to be Italian, with Italian wine of at least 12% alcohol provided for them.|$|E

2500|$|The ship's captain, Colin Henthorne, was off {{watch and}} asleep in <b>his</b> <b>bunk</b> {{at the time}} of the accident. The second mate, Keven Hilton was on break, leaving the fourth mate, Karl Lilgert, in command. Local weather reports {{indicated}} winds gusting to [...] in the vicinity of Wright Sound.

2500|$|Xie Jinyuan's {{body was}} interred {{in a small}} garden along Singapore Road (now Yao Road) where <b>his</b> <b>bunk</b> used to be. In 1947 the Shanghai city {{government}} renamed Jiaoyuan Park, where the soldiers lived, to Jinyuan Park, and renamed an elementary school in the vicinity 12th District Jinyuan National Elementary School. The road to the immediate north of the warehouse was renamed Jinyuan Road. His grave was destroyed by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Furman {{led to a}} 1973 {{revision}} of the laws, primarily by introducing the bifurcated trial process (where the guilt-innocence and punishment phases are separate) and narrowly limiting the legal definition of capital murder (and, thus, those offenses for which the death penalty could be imposed). [...] The first person sentenced to death under a new Texas statute was John Devries on February 15, 1974; Devries hanged himself in his cell on July 1, 1974 (using bedsheets from <b>his</b> <b>bunk)</b> before he could be executed.|$|E
