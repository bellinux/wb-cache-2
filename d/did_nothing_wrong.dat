5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong,</b> and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E

The GJKT did nothing to restore Comb's reputation.|$|E

Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong.</b> At that time, newspapers in Nebraska and Oklahoma noted that Coburn failed to criticize very similar earmarks that benefited Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2005, Game {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct and {{resisting}} arrest in Greensboro, North Carolina. At one point, police said his companions were pepper sprayed when they surrounded officers in a threatening manner.

Game continued to act up and was arrested, a police statement said. Game claimed that officers overreacted and that he <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> when he was pepper-sprayed by the mall security. The five officers involved in the incident ended up suing Game for defamation. The officers were awarded $5 million in compensatory damages, which was upheld on appeal by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in February 2012.|$|E

500|$|Scrushy was {{returned}} to Alabama on May 7, 2009, in order to testify in a new civil trial in a Birmingham court. Former HealthSouth investors sued him seeking recompense for money lost due to the fraud of which Scrushy was acquitted in 2005. While opposing counsel claimed Scrushy was a [...] "hands-on manager who treated the company as a personal piggy bank," [...] Scrushy continued to assign blame to his subordinates and maintain that he <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong.</b> Closing arguments were heard in the trial on May 27, 2009. On June 18, 2009, Judge Horn ordered Scrushy to pay $2.87 billion in damages. Judge Horn stated, [...] "Scrushy knew of and actively participated in the fraud" [...] and referred to Scrushy as the [...] "CEO of the fraud". As expected, Scrushy appealed the judgment to the Alabama Supreme Court. [...] On January 28, 2011, Scrushy lost his appeal of the civil verdict.|$|E
500|$|The 1987 Giro {{has become}} {{famous for the}} series of events {{involving}} teammates Roche and Visentini. Many writers highlight the fifteenth stage as the defining moment of the race. The Corriere delle Alpi and cycling book author Bill McGann even named {{it as one of}} the most famous in the Giro d'Italia and cycling history. On that day, Roche [...] who was second in the general classification and over two minutes behind race leader Visentini [...] attacked the lead, despite orders from his team to stop. Upon completing the stage, Visentini told the press that either Roche or himself would not start the following day, while Roche independently held a press conference from his hotel and answered questions. Carrera Jeans-Vagabond manager David Boifava ordered Roche and Visentini to stay silent. The following day, many Italian newspapers called Roche a betrayer or cheat for his actions. Despite Visentini's statement, both riders started the sixteenth stage after receiving orders from Carrera company boss Tito Tachella. In the days that followed, Italian fans threw things and spat at Roche, which led him to receive police protection until the race's conclusion. Looking back on the incident, Roche claimed that he just descended the mountain quicker than Visentini and <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong,</b> while Visentini maintained that Roche attacked him when he should have been aiding him. Visentini accused Roche of dashing the team's morale and strategy, but some critics believed that Roche's actions were acceptable because he was the stronger rider.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{has become}} known for her {{controversial}} performances, most notably during her Bangerz Tour (2014) and Milky Milky Milk Tour (2015). Her performance of [...] "Party In the U.S.A." [...] at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards sparked a [...] "national uproar" [...] because of her outfit and her perceived pole dancing. She faced similar controversy following a performance of [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] (2010) on Britain's Got Talent, where she pretended to kiss one of her female dancers on stage. Cyrus defended the performance, feeling she <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong.</b> Cyrus {{was the subject of}} public and media scrutiny following her performance of [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013) and [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] (2013) with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Clad in a skin colored latex two-piece, Cyrus touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. Shortly thereafter, the word [...] "twerk" [...] was added to the online version of the Oxford Dictionary of English. The performance resulted in a media frenzy; one reviewer likened the performance to a [...] "bad acid trip", while another described it as a [...] "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment". Cyrus entered the stage of her Bangerz Tour (2014) by sliding down a slide {{in the shape of a}} tongue, gaining media attention during the tour for her costumes and racy performances.|$|E

Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> and that he was only acting under [...] "an abundance of caution" [...] when he withdrew the amendment after the new Senate Ethics Rules were passed. Some government watchdogs, including Public Citizen, commented that the earmark probably didn't violate ethics rules. [...] Coburn's motives were called into question by more than one publication, as his criticism did not include his own state delegation's earmark requests.|$|E
