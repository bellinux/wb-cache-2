50|$|Ideograms {{and symbols}} {{may be more}} {{effective}} than written names (logotypes), especially for logos translated into many alphabets in increasingly globalized markets. For instance, a name written in Arabic script might have little resonance in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms keep the general proprietary nature of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the Red Cross (varied as the Red Crescent in Muslim countries and as the Red Star of David in Israel) exemplifies a well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and <b>red</b> <b>crescent</b> are among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red <b>Crescent</b> <b>Societies</b> and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross include these symbols in their logos.|$|R
