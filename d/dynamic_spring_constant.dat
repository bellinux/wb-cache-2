40|$|The de Gennes' blob {{model is}} {{extensively}} used in different problems of polymer physics. This model is theoretically applicable {{when the number}} of monomers inside each blob is large enough. For confined flexible polymers, this requires the confining geometry to be much larger than the monomer size. In this manuscript, the opposite limit of polymer in nano-slits with one to several monomers width is studied, using molecular dynamics simulations. Extension of the polymer inside nanoslits, confinement force on the plates, and the effective spring constant of the confined polymer are investigated. Despite of the theoretical limitations of the blob model, the simulation results are explained with the blob model very well. The agreement is observed for the static properties and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of the polymer. A theoretical description of the conditions under which the <b>dynamic</b> <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of the polymer is independent of the small number of monomers inside blobs is given.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to analyze dynamic characteristics of machinery, catching {{the parameters of the}} machinery. This paper is intended to investigate parameters of the hand tractor for analyzing its dynamic characteristics. The main results are as follows; (1) The mass and center of gravity were measured by measuring the weight acting at two points and the angle of inclination of the hand tractor. Consequently, the mass is 342. 1 kg and the center of gravity is situated at 0. 125 m horizontally and 0. 259 m vertically {{from the center of the}} shaft of the driving wheel. The center of gravity of the hand tractor itself is situated ahead of the center of the shaft of the driving wheel, but it is situated in the rear of the center of the shaft of the driving wheel when the rotary tiller is mounted on the hand tractor. (2) The pitching moment of inertia about the centroid is measured by the coil spring method. As a result, it is 17. 40 kg·m^ 2. This is very small in comparision with the moment of inertia (539. 66 kg·m^ 2) of the riding tractor mounted with a rotary tiller. (3) The <b>dynamic</b> <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> and the viscous damping coefficient of the tire of the tested hand tractor were found to be 131. 847 × 10 ^ 3 N/m, and 687. 25 N· 2 ̆ 7 s/m respectively.

40|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of {{an atomic}} force {{microscope}} cantilever is often needed for quantitative measurements. The calibration method of Sader et al. [Rev. Sci. Instrum. 70, 3967 (1999) ] 10. 1063 / 1. 1150021 for a rectangular cantilever requires measurement of the resonant frequency and quality factor in fluid (typically air), and knowledge of its plan view dimensions. This intrinsically uses the hydrodynamic function for a cantilever of rectangular plan view geometry. Here, we present hydrodynamic functions {{for a series of}} irregular and non-rectangular {{atomic force microscope}} cantilevers that are commonly used in practice. Cantilever geometries of arrow shape, small aspect ratio rectangular, quasi-rectangular, irregular rectangular, non-ideal trapezoidal cross sections, and V-shape are all studied. This enables the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> of all these cantilevers to be accurately and routinely determined through measurement of their resonant frequency and quality factor in fluid (such as air). An approximate formulation of the hydrodynamic function for microcantilevers of arbitrary geometry is also proposed.

As a result, it was certified that vibration characteristics of rubber crawler vehicle were significantly influenced by arrangement of track rollers and the center of gravity. Especially, as center of gravity deviates from center of crawler 2 ̆ 7 s ground contact length to forward or backward, machine vibration increased and this tendency was remarkably in the arrangement of four track rollers compared with five track rollers.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{picture of}} the force on a capacitor assumes a large density of electronic states, such that the electrochemical potential of charges added to the capacitor is given by the external electrostatic potential and the capacitance is determined purely by geometry. Here we consider capacitively driven motion of a nano-mechanical resonator with a low density of states, in which these assumptions can break down. We find three leading-order corrections to the classical picture: the first of is a modulation in the static force due to variation in the internal chemical potential, {{the second and third}} are change in static force and <b>dynamic</b> <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> due to the rate of change of chemical potential, expressed as the quantum (density of states) capacitance. As a demonstration, we study a capacitively driven graphene mechanical resonators, where the chemical potential is modulated independently of the gate voltage using an applied magnetic field to manipulate the energy of electrons residing in discrete Landau levels. In these devices, we observe large periodic frequency shifts consistent with the three corrections to the classical picture. In devices with extremely low strain and disorder, the first correction term dominates and the resonant frequency closely follows the chemical potential. The theoretical model fits the data with only one adjustable parameter representing disorder-broadening of the Landau levels. The underlying electromechanical coupling mechanism is not limited the particular choice of material, geometry, or mechanism for variation in chemical potential, and can thus be extended to other low-dimensional systems.

Methods The experimental group comprised 66 participants (36 men and 30 women) ranging between 46 and 86 years of age, all with diabetes mellitus. In the experimental group, 21 participants suffered from atherosclerosis. All were subjected to the measurements of both the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method. The comparison (control) group comprised 66 normal participants (37 men and 29 women) with an age range of 40 to 80 years {{who did not have}} diabetes mellitus. All control group members were subjected to measurement by the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method. Results Statistical analysis of the experimental and control groups indicated a significant negative correlation between the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> and the cfPWV (P r = − 0. 824 and – 0. 71). Multivariate analysis similarly indicated a close relationship. The Student’s t test was used to examine the difference in the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> parameter between the experimental and control groups. A P- value less than. 05 confirmed that the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant. In receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the Area Under Curve (AUC, = 0. 85) indicates good discrimination. These findings imply that the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method can effectively identify normal versus abnormal characteristics of elasticity in normal and diabetic participants. Conclusions This study verifies the use of the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method to assess arterial elasticity, and found it to be efficient and simple to use. The <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> method should prove useful not only for improving clinical diagnoses, but also for screening diabetic patients who display early evidence of vascular disease. </p...|$|R

50|$|The force {{measurements}} rely on {{an accurate}} {{value of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> of the cantilever. This <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> can be measured by different techniques.

This quantity is related to the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> by means of the equipartition theorem. In the added mass method one attaches a series of metal beads to the cantilever and each case one determines the resonance frequency. By exploiting the relation for an harmonic oscillator between the resonance frequency and the mass added one can evaluate the <b>spring</b> <b>constant</b> as well. The frictional force method relies on measurement of the approach and retract curves of the cantilever through a viscous fluid.

This qualification test includes testing at full load under a sinusoidal forcing function at a maximum frequency of 33 Hz. ^ There remains a practical upper limit to dynamic testing that is imposed by the availability of test equipment. This upper limit is governed {{by the size of the}} hydraulic pumps and servo actuators supplying fluid to the actuating test cylinder. At current writing, this limit is approximately 200 kips @ 33 Hz. New reactor designs have applications for snubbers with load capacities up to 1, 900 kips.
