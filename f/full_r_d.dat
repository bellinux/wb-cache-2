We use detailed data on applications and acceptances for R&D {{tax incentives}}, a special survey, {{and for the first}} time, the science and technology module from the 2000 - 2002 Survey of Manufacturers database in Colombia to analyze this question. We estimate the effect of the R&D tax deduction instituted in Colombia using Zellner''s Seemingly Unrelated Regressions method, and find that the elasticity of demand of R&D investment in manufacturing is quite high in Colombia compared to other countries, particularly for smaller firms, but that the direct benefit from existing policies is minimal. Overall, the results of the paper suggest that there is a great potential for such incentives to promote R&D investment in Colombia, but in their current form, they fail to target those firms that could benefit the most.

Convolution with the characteristic {{function of a}} small ball shows that (1 /p, 1 /q) must lie in the triangle ∆(k,d) with vertices (0, 0), (1, 1), and (d/(2 d − k),(d − k) /(2 d − k)). And a result of Ricci ([5]), which extends an observation of Carbery and Christ, shows that if k(k + 3) < 2 d, then (1) also implies that (2...|$|R

This {{point of view}} allows us to introduce techniques from Thermodynamic Formalism. In particular, we obtain estimates on the growth of orbits and their limiting distribution on projective space. 0. Introduction Let SL(d; <b>R)</b> denote the <b>d</b> Θ d matrices with real entries and determinant one. We shall consider the case d 3. There is a natural linear action SL(d; <b>R)</b> Θ <b>R</b> <b>d</b> ! <b>R</b> <b>d</b> given by matrix multiplication. Given a discrete subgroup Γ ae SL(d; R) and a fixed non-zero vector, {{it is interesting to}} consider the orbit O(v) = fAv : A 2 ae <b>R</b> <b>d.</b> When Γ is a uniform lattice (i. e., SL(d; R) =Γ is compact) Greenberg showed that for a non-zero vector v 2 <b>R</b> <b>d</b> the set O(v) ae <b>R</b> <b>d</b> is dense [3].

40|$|The {{failure of}} the neoclassical growth model to account for {{differences}} in output per worker across countries has suggested that these differences should be driven by cross-country differences in total factor productivity (TFP). This paper discusses various measures of productivity and its determinants for the OECD countries from different dimensions: (i) the measurement perspective; (ii) evidence {{on the evolution of}} productivity levels across OECD countries; and (iii) a critical review of the theoretical and empirical issues regarding the determinants of cross-country productivity differentials.

40|$|Abstract. This paper generalizes {{the mixed}} {{extension}} principle in L 2 (<b>R</b> <b>d)</b> of [50] {{to a pair}} of dual Sobolev spaces H s (<b>R</b> <b>d)</b> and H −s (<b>R</b> <b>d).</b> In terms of masks for φ, ψ 1, [...] ., ψ L ∈ H s (<b>R</b> <b>d)</b> and ˜φ, ˜ ψ 1, [...] ., ˜ ψ L ∈ H −s (<b>R</b> <b>d),</b> simple sufficient conditions are given to ensure that (X s (φ; ψ 1, [...] ., ψ L), X −s (˜ φ; ˜ ψ 1, [...] ., ˜ ψ L)) forms a pair of dual wavelet frames in (H s (<b>R</b> <b>d),</b> H −s (<b>R</b> <b>d)),</b> where X s (φ; ψ 1, [...] ., ψ L) : = {φ(· − k) : k ∈ Z d} ∪ � 2 j(d/ 2 −s) ψ ℓ (2 j · −k) : j ∈ N 0, k ∈ Z d, ℓ = 1, [...] ., L �. For s> 0, the key of this general mixed extension principle is the regularity of φ, ψ 1, [...] ., ψ L, and the vanishing moments of ˜ ψ 1, [...] ., ˜ ψ L, while allowing ˜ φ, ˜ ψ 1, [...] ., ˜ ψ L to be tempered distributions not in L 2 (<b>R</b> <b>d)</b> and ψ 1, [...] ., ψ L to have no vanishing moments. So, the systems X s (φ; ψ 1, [...] ., ψ L) and X −s (˜ φ; ˜ ψ 1, [...] ., ˜ ψ L) {{may not be able to}} be normalized into a frame of L 2 (<b>R</b> <b>d).</b> As an example, we show that { 2 j(1 / 2 −s) Bm(2 j · −k) : j ∈ N 0, k ∈ Z} is a wavelet frame in H s (R) for any 0 1 / 2 are Riesz bases of the Sobolev space H s (R). This general mixed extension principle also naturally leads to a characterization of the Sobolev norm of a function in terms of weighted norm of its wavelet coefficient sequence (decomposition sequence) without requiring that dual wavelet frames should be in L 2 (<b>R</b> <b>d),</b> which is quite different to other approaches in the literature. 1...|$|R
