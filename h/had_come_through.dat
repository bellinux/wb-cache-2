Leech overtook the United States' Joan Rosazza in the final 25 metres to take bronze in 1 minute 5.1 seconds. The race for third place had been tight, with just 0.7 of a second separating Leech and the final finisher. The youngest swimmer in the field, Leech <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> to claim the last podium position. Leech said that it was an emotional occasion, having seen the Australian men take a trifecta in the corresponding event on the previous night of racing.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{the side}} was {{predominantly}} composed of local players who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the club's youth system, including Matthews, Sale, Steele and John McCue, {{all in their}} prime, {{as well as the}} newly discovered Neil Franklin, regarded as the country's best centre-half. In the 1946–47 season, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge: the club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title, but a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield United gave the title to Liverpool. Stanley Matthews left the club three games {{before the end of the}} 1946–47 season to join Blackpool at the age of 32 for a fee of £11,500. The team subsequently failed to mount a title challenge in the following two seasons, 1947–48 and 1948–49, finishing 15th and 11th respectively.|$|E
5|$|The 'Morris' strongpoint near Colleville-sur-Mer was {{captured}} after {{about an hour}} of fighting. The nearby 'Hillman' strongpoint, headquarters of the 736th Infantry Regiment, was a large complex defensive work that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the morning's bombardment essentially undamaged. It was not captured until 20:15. The 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry began advancing to Caen on foot, coming within a few kilometres of the town, but had to withdraw {{due to lack of}} armour support. At 16:00, the 21st Panzer Division mounted a counter-attack between Sword and Juno and nearly succeeded in reaching the Channel. It met stiff resistance from the British 3rd Division and was soon recalled to assist in the area between Caen and Bayeux. Estimates of Allied casualties on Sword Beach are as high as 1,000.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{histories}} of the Bastille were published immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison. By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux and by the trio of Auguste Maquet, Auguste Arnould and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol presented {{the years of the}} Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval torture of prisoners. As living memories of the Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the Bastille between 1659 and 1789. The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with some effort, the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive. After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.|$|E

The Tatar side verified that she <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the secret tunnel, but she guided them deep inside the tunnel which was an extensive maze, and then released a white pigeon that she had with her to use as a prearranged signal.

25|$|On 16 April 1889, two steamships {{were spotted}} {{approaching}} the lighthouse of Russarö {{from the south}} and news about unidentified vessels coming through the ice field began spreading immediately. The ships were the icebreaker Bryderen and a 912-ton cargo steamer Vesuv, owned by the Danish shipping company, that was following on the channel broken by the icebreaker. During the following night, the icebreaker lost all four propeller blades, but once the replacement blades had been installed, the convoy arrived at the port of Hanko on 20 April 1889 at 13:00. Large headlines in the major Finnish newspapers reported how the ice blockade had finally been broken — a foreign icebreaker <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the ice and was now moored at a Finnish port. The successful arrival of Bryderen was seen as the definite answer to the question whether or not an icebreaker would be needed in Finland.|$|E

In the first round she <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> a gruelling three setter against Karin Knapp, despite carrying shin splints and picking up an injury during the match. Baltacha competed at the Summer Olympics in London {{for the first time}} in her career in both the singles and the doubles events (partnering Anne Keothavong). On 28 July 2012, Baltacha made her Olympics debut with a win against Ágnes Szávay of Hungary, defeating her in straight sets. Baltacha was then defeated by 11th seed Ana Ivanovic in the second round in a very tight encounter. This was Baltacha's last professional match of 2012, taking time off to undergo foot surgery.|$|E

500|$|On January 1, 1923, the Taylors' {{neighbor}} {{reported that}} she heard a scream {{while it was still}} dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby. She said a black man was in her house; he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the back door and assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, but no one else. Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed. [...] The charge of rape of a white woman by a black was inflammatory in the South: the day before, the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen [...] away in [...] Gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading, [...] "First and Always Protect Womanhood".|$|E

500|$|When dawn broke on 17 December, {{most of the}} French fleet was {{scattered}} across the approaches to Brest. The largest intact group was that under Vice-amiral François Joseph Bouvet, which <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the Raz de Sein with nine ships of the line, six frigates and one transport. The other ships, including Fraternité, which also carried General Hoche, were alone or in small groups, the captains forced open their secret orders to discover their destination, {{in the absence of}} instructions from any commanding officers. One ship had been lost:, the 74-gun ship of the line [...] had driven onto the Grand Stevenent rock during the night and sank with the loss of 680 lives. She too had fired numerous rockets and signal guns in an effort to attract attention, succeeding only in compounding the confusion in the fleet. Pellew, unable now to affect the large French force, sailed for Falmouth to telegraph his report to the Admiralty and replenish his supplies.|$|E
500|$|Mugford {{said she}} had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|A second, {{possibly}} pre-12th-century {{allusion to}} the Cædmon story is found in two Latin texts associated with the Old Saxon Heliand poem. These texts, the Praefatio (Preface) and Versus de Poeta (Lines about the poet), explain the origins of an Old Saxon biblical translation (for which the Heliand is the only known candidate) in language strongly reminiscent of, and indeed at times identical to, Bede's account of Cædmon's career. [...] According to the prose Praefatio, the Old Saxon poem was composed by a renowned vernacular poet at the command of the emperor Louis the Pious; the text then adds that this poet had known nothing of vernacular composition until {{he was ordered to}} translate the precepts of sacred law into vernacular song in a dream. The Versus de Poeta contain an expanded account of the dream itself, adding that the poet had been a herdsman before his inspiration and that the inspiration itself <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>through</b> the medium of a heavenly voice when he fell asleep after pasturing his cattle. While our knowledge of these texts is based entirely on a 16th-century edition by Flacius Illyricus, both are usually assumed on semantic and grammatical grounds to be of medieval composition. [...] This apparent debt to the Cædmon story agrees with semantic evidence attested to by Green demonstrating the influence of Anglo Saxon biblical poetry and terminology on early continental Germanic literatures.|$|E
