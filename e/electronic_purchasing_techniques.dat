40|$|The main {{purchasing}} {{function is to}} assure the supply of required goods and services [5]. Large organisations have both the finances and knowledge to implement optimised purchasing resources, typically using infor-mation and communications technology (ICT) to improve efficiency [1]. On the contrary, within individual small and medium sized enterprises <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing</b> is conducted predominately through suppliers sales web sites. Relevance This problem of collaborative <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing</b> for SMEs has not been addressed by researchers ex-tensively in the past [2, 3]. In this research we analyse the requirements and characteristics of small and medium enterprises (SME), and thus propose a novel process framework which allows several organisations to collaborate in purchasing [3, 4], and thereby achieve economy of scale supported by ICT to level large enterprises. The framework adopts new features; it enables cross-sector collaboration for different types of organisations; it addresses {{the development of the}} {{purchasing function}} for small organisations; and it also includes process issues such as trust and commitment.

But what mix of transactional and relational purchasing are organizations using, and which should they use? A novel instrument is developed to measure organizations’ use of transaction <b>purchasing,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing,</b> interactive purchasing, and network purchasing. Four mixes of practices are identified and labeled “transactional,” “interpersonal dyadic,” “interpersonal network,” and “integrative relational” configurations. Organizations using an integrative relational configuration generally outperform others. Irrespective of configuration, organizations use more interactive and network purchasing with suppliers of direct inputs but more transaction purchasing with suppliers of indirect inputs...|$|R

[...] In 1975 Informatics had arranged with the National Wholesale Druggists’ Association to create a central clearinghouse for the processing of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> orders within the industry.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research article is to identify the factors of consumer decisionmaking style {{in the context of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing</b> and test the significance of these factors on the basis of gender and age of respondents through multi-comparison analysis. Data for this report came from a survey of consumers (N = 411) with a structured questionnaire design. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), ANOVA and Post-hoc (for multiple comparisons) were used to achieve the objectives of the study. To contribute to an internationally valid and reliable research instrument for consumer decision-making style in the context of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing,</b> new constructs were identified, which we will call Electronic Consumer Style Inventory (ECSI). Consistent with the hypotheses, in general, the extracted factors in consumers’ electronic buying decision-making style are found to be significant on the basis of respondent gender and age. Customers’ evaluations of e-service quality are critical to service firms that aim to improve their marketing strategies; consequently, accurate measurement of e-service quality is a major concern for management. The resultant implications of this research are discussed by the authors and can help e-vendors and marketing managers achieve a sustainable competitive advantage in global markets and enhance their performance...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{purchases}} of extended service contracts, which are essentially insurance products, for electronic products in a retail setting. The primary insurance purchase determinants are perceived probability of loss, extent of loss, risk aversion, {{and amount of}} insurance premium. We examine how product characteristics (hedonic/utilitarian, manufacturer's warranty) and retailer actions (promotions, feature advertising) influence the purchase of extended service contracts. We also investigate the impact of consumer characteristics (income, gender, and prior usage) on these insurance purchase determinants. To test the predictions, we use revealed preferences from panel data of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchases</b> across several product categories.
