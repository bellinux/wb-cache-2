5|$|On 20 November, Grayson reiterated {{his desire}} to keep Kisnorbo but stated that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his fitness before being offered a new deal at Leeds. Kisnorbo got an {{infection}} on his Achilles tendon injury, and stepped up his rehab {{by going to the}} USA for treatment. Kisnorbo returned to Leeds' training ground Thorp Arch during mid January. However, on 11 March 2011, it was confirmed that he would not play again in the 2010–11 season. As Kisnorbo's contract was set to expire in June 2011, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his fitness to the coaching staff at Leeds in the hope of earning a new contract, or be free to join another club. In March 2011, Kisnorbo returned to full training with Leeds after his long spell out injured.|$|E
5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled Don Shula by saying, “I think pro coaches should have to prove themselves by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|The Transfiguration was a {{major theme}} in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his craft by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they {{are thought to be}} powerful channels of divine grace. The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E

5|$|When {{he first}} {{displayed}} this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian {{accused him of}} disrespect. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that he could play to a high level with his left hand. He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.|$|E
5|$|Born in Enfield, London, Morison joined Northampton Town {{as part of}} the club's youth system after a {{successful}} trial period with the club, having also spent time on trial at Leicester City. When Morison turned 18, he signed a two-year professional contract with Northampton. He impressed manager Kevan Broadhurst and subsequently made his debut {{at the end of the}} 2001–02 season in a 2–2 draw against Cambridge United. The following season, Morison featured regularly as a substitute, playing a total of 15 games, scoring his first goal for the Northamptonshire side in a 2–2 draw against Plymouth Argyle. However, the 2003–04 season witnessed Morison feature in only 5 games, getting on the scoresheet once. In June 2004, he was offered a new six-month contract at the club, and told by manager Colin Calderwood that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his worth at the club.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA <b>had,</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E

5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and felt he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E

5|$|In {{connection}} with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon's mother Inga <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The result of the trial strengthened the legal basis for his kingship, and improved {{his relationship with the}} church. The saga's claim that Haakon already had been generally accepted as king in 1217/18 has however been contested by modern historians such as Sverre Bagge. Skule and Haakon increasingly drifted apart in their administration, and Skule focused mainly on governing Eastern Norway after 1220, which he had gained the right to rule in 1218 as his third of the Norwegian kingdom. From 1221 to 1223, Haakon and Skule separately issued letters as rulers of Norway, and maintained official contacts abroad. In 1223 a great meeting of bishops, clergy, secular nobles and other high-ranking figures from all across the country was held in Bergen to finally decide on Haakon's right to the throne. Other candidates to the throne were present either personally or through attorneys, but Haakon was in the end unanimously confirmed as King of Norway by the court.|$|E
