40|$|Tensile {{strength}} of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> {{has been extensively}} investigated by earlier researchers and several methodologies have been evolved for its determination. However, either most of these methods are not valid/applicable {{for a wide range}} of moisture contents or they involve tedious sample/specimen preparation. In this context, the methodology of determining tensile strength by employing thin films, which is available in the literature, has been found to be quite handy and useful. It has been observed that a unique relationship exists among the tensile strength, moisture content, and shrinkage characteristics of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> This methodology is appreciable due to its applicability to a wide range of moisture contents, comparable ease of sample preparation and testing, and the obtained results lack generalization. Exhaustive tests were conducted on <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> of entirely different characteristics and generalized relationships have been proposed between the percentage linear shrinkage, tensile strength, and moisture content (defined as liquid to solid ratio). Based on a critical analysis of the results available in the literature, the efficiency of such relationships for determination of tensile {{strength of}} <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> has been demonstrated. In the authors' opinion, such relationships would be quite useful for determining tensile strength of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> from their linear shrinkage, which can easily be measured in a conventional geotechnical engineering laboratory...|$|R

50|$|In Central Europe, {{towards the}} end of the Vistula or Würm Ice Age, it was about 10 degrees colder than today. There was {{therefore}} no forest cover but only patchy vegetation in the form of tundra. In addition, in the areas covered by the ice sheet, the vegetation had to re-establish itself as the glaciers melted. As a result, the winds could blow almost unhindered. Light, <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soil</b> particles, especially of silt and sand were plucked up by air currents, often transported for miles and then deposited at another location. The wind also had a sorting effect - silt is transported significantly faster than sand - and this resulted, over time, in areas of aeolian sand and sand dunes being formed, while the silt was transported much further and redeposited, for example, on the northern edge of highlands.|$|E

Conversely, Specific Surface Area (SSA) and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) are more fundamental soil properties that dominate engineering behavior of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> SSA and CEC are “inherent ” soil parameters and may be combined with the clay fraction in order to help classify min-eralogic composition of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> Two parameters are examined: 1. Specific Surface Area Activity (Sc), which is defined as the ratio of surface area to the clay content, and 2. Cation Exchange Capacity Activity (CECA), defined as the ratio of cation ex-change capacity to the clay content. These two parameters show clear groupings of low, medium and high “activity ” when used in re-lationship with other index parameters that may help explain fundamental clay behavior. The relationships between Sc and CECA and engineering properties are presented and described.

40|$|Extensive {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} by earlier researchers to understand cracking characteristics of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> Based on these studies, several theories and models which facilitate understanding the effect of various soil- and environment-specific parameters (viz., clay content, plasticity, free swelling index, specimen dimensions, boundary conditions, temperature, and humidity) that influence cracking characteristics of such soils have been proposed. A critical synthesis of the existing literature reveals that selection of any crack sealing/arresting technique would largely depend on the most critical of these parameters. However, studies related to identification of this critical parameter(s) and its (their) influence on cracking characteristics of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> are not available in the existing literature. Hence, efforts {{have been made in the}} present study to establish the effect of each of these parameters on the cracking characteristics of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> and the most critical parameter(s) has/have been identified. To achieve this, the Taguchi method, which is basically a statistical method and has been widely adopted for designing experiments and optimizing and/or detecting the most influential parameter(s) from the set of parameters of any multi-variant problem, has been employed.

40|$|Tensile {{strength}} of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> plays {{a significant role}} in assessing their cracking characteristics, which govern their suitability as a construction material for landfill liners and covers, earthen dams, embankments, and pavements. As such, determination of this property of these soils becomes essential. In this context, various experimental techniques that have been developed by earlier researchers to determine tensile {{strength of}} <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> are worth appreciating. Based on the experimental results obtained from these studies, several empirical relationships have been proposed. However, these relationships relate tensile strength of the soil with a single parameter (i. e., suction, plasticity index, liquid limit, CEC, clay content, or water content). This necessitates: (a) critical evaluation of such relationships, and (b) development of a generalized relationship that employs multiple soil properties. With this in view, investigations were carried out on some <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> and their tensile strength was determined by conducting undrained triaxial tests and suction measurements. Details of the methodologies adopted are presented in this paper and efforts have been made to achieve the two objectives mentioned above...|$|R

The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2  µm (clays being finer than silts); sedimentologists often use 4 – 5  μm and colloid chemists use 1  μm (Guggenheim and Martin 1995).|$|R

40|$|As an {{improvement}} of the two-layer cover with capillary barrier effect (CCBE) (i. e. <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soil</b> overlying a coarse-grained soil), a new three-layer landfill cover system is proposed and investigated for humid climate. This new system is to add a <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soil</b> (i. e., clay) underneath a two-layer CCBE (i. e., a silt overlying a gravelly sand layer). The feasibility of this proposed cover system was investigated by conducting a one-dimensional water infiltration test. In addition, transient seepage simulations were carried out to back-analyse the test results and investigate the importance of hydraulic properties of the CCBE on the proposed cover. Based on the infiltration experiment and numerical back-analysis, {{it is found that}} no percolation was observed after 48 hours of ponding, which is equivalent to a rainfall return period of greater than 1000 years. However, the upper two-layer CCBE is only effective for a rainfall return period of about 35 years. This implies that the proposed bottom clay layer is needed for humid climate. Numerical parametric simulations reveal that increasing the saturated permeability of the upper <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soil</b> by two orders of magnitude (1. 4 x 10 - 6 m/s to 2. 1 x 10 - 4 m/s), the wetting front is still within the clay layer after 12 hours of constant water ponding (> 1000 year rainfall) and no percolation occurred...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Marginal soils can be {{improved}} by introducing permeable geosynthetics as drainage layers.

This paper reports performance of a geosynthetic drain layer placed within two <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soil</b> slurries. A multipurpose consolidation test device has been developed for this purpose. Test results demonstrated that thick geocomposite layers are good enough in draining out water escaped during consolidation. In order to reduce clogging, a combination thin sand mat and geosynthetic drain layer, which is called hybrid system, has been tested. Thin sand mat has been found effective in preventing finer grains from clogging the geocomposite layer. Bearing capacity tests on model embankments proved that hybrid system generates frictional interaction with the rough surface of the geocomposite.

The static stress reversals enable the soils to reach a "near equilibrium state" in terms of volume change, whether {{the soil is}} initially in the undisturbed state or in the remolded state.

It is of interest to a geotechnical or geo-environmental engineer to develop a predictive method of determining the hydraulic conductivity of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils,</b> in order to assess its suitability as a liner material. To predict the hydraulic conductivity of soils, researchers and geotechnical engineers have attempted to correlate it with index properties of the soils, such as the liquid limit, void ratio and specific surface. Based on the present study a predictive method has been developed in this paper to predict the hydraulic conductivity in terms of void ratio and shrinkage index (Liquid limit – shrinkage limit) for remoulded <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> Though the initial conditions for the soil will affect the hydraulic conductivity behaviour to some extent, both the void ratio and soil characteristics are primary factors in affecting the hydraulic conductivity.

40|$|Several {{engineering}} structures for geotechnical engineering applications {{are constructed using}} compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> (i. e., dams, road embankments, pavements, canals, and waste containment structures such as soil covers and liners). The compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> are typically {{in a state of}} unsaturated condition and plastic in nature. There is a growing interest in recent years to apply the mechanics of unsaturated soils in the design of geotechnical structures constructed with compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> The soil-water retention curve (SWRC) is being used as a key tool in extending the mechanics of unsaturated soils into engineering practice. Conventionally, SWRC is determined in the laboratory without taking account the volume changes with respect to soil suction. The water retention characteristics of plastic soils depend on the pore-size distribution, compressibility characteristics and the volume change behavior. For this reason, the conventional procedures that are used in the measurement of the SWRC may not provide reliable information. Therefore, the engineering behavior of compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> cannot be reliably estimated or predicted if the volume change behavior with respect to suction is not considered while measuring the water retention curves for compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils.</b> In this thesis, a comprehensive experimental program is undertaken to determine the water retention characteristics of a local plastic soil, Champlain sea clay. This soil is commonly used in the construction of several structures in Ottawa and Quebec region. The SWRCs of Champlain sea clay were measured on specimens that were statically or dynamically compacted at different water contents and densities using different compaction energies. The suction measurements of the individually compacted specimens were determined using axis-translation technique and thermocouple psychrometers. The volume changes of the specimens were measured at each value of suction while determining the SWRC. In light of the experimental results, the parameters that influence the SWRC behavior such as compaction type (i. e., static or dynamic) and effort, initial compaction water content and void ratio on the water retention behavior of compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> were investigated. In addition, a database of 16 compacted plastic soils with measured SWRCs and their conventional properties from the published literature was summarized. Relationships between the parameters of the SWRC, namely, the rate of desorption and the conventional soil properties were studied using {{the results of the present}} experimental program and the information from the database. This study shows that liquid limit coupled with clay fraction can be a useful tool to correlate with the rate of desorption for compacted soils. Based on this information, a new technique is proposed for the estimation of the entire SWRC of compacted <b>fine-grained</b> <b>soils</b> following the drying path. The required information for using this technique includes one point measurement of suction versus water content in the suction range of 0 - 500 kPa, along with data on the liquid limit and the clay fraction. The proposed technique provides good comparison between the measured and estimated SWRCs for the data studied in this research program. This technique can be used in the preliminary design stages of a project when detailed information about the soil is no available.
