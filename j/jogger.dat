25|$|When {{he reached}} puberty, Dahmer {{discovered}} that he was homosexual. He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents, although in his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse. By his later admission, {{as he began to}} fantasize sexually, issues of dominance and control over a completely subservient partner were prevalent in his thoughts. These thoughts gradually became intertwined with dissection. On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a rape fantasy of rendering a particular male <b>jogger</b> he found attractive unconscious and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the <b>jogger</b> took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for the <b>jogger.</b> On this particular day, the <b>jogger</b> did not pass him and, although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again, he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of different levels of distance running on percent body fat and serum lipids in untrained male University students (n = 40) {{with a mean age}} of 24. 1 years. Subjects were assigned randomly to four groups (n = 10) in each group) : Group 1 (control), Group 2 (1. 6 km <b>joggers),</b> Group 3 (3. 2 km <b>joggers)</b> and Group 4 (4. 8 km <b>joggers).</b> Subjects in the exercise groups jogged the prescribed distances three times a week for 12 weeks at about 85 percent of maximal heart rate. Percent body fat, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were estimated before and after the training programme. In comparison with control group, exercise groups showed statistically significant (p less than. 05) decrease of body fat values (1. 6 km <b>joggers</b> 6 %; 3. 2 km <b>joggers</b> 5. 33 %; 3. 2 km <b>joggers</b> 11 %; 4. 8 km <b>joggers</b> 9. 42 %). However, Newman-Keul's post hoc analysis showed a significant (p less than. 05) reduction in serum triglyceride only in 3. 2 km <b>joggers.</b> This was attributed to the high pre-training level of serum triglyceride in the group. Cholesterol values showed insignificant changes. It was concluded that moderate physical activities of different intensities have lowering effects on body fat and serum lipids...|$|R

Yoshimura wanted the two detectives to also discuss the nature of mortality and death, but deliberately included black humor in their dialogue and made sure the characters did not act [...] "teary-eyed [...] philosophical", because he believed it would be clichéd and an inaccurate depiction of how real detectives would behave. Some viewers were offended or startled by the flippant nature of the discussions about death between the two characters.
