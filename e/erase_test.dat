40|$|In {{this project}} we present an {{improved}} garbage collection scheme for YAFFS 2 (Yet Another Flash File System). Our {{objective was to}} reduce the number of Aggressive Garbage Collections in Garbage Collection module of YAFFS 2. We explore the various values of beta (ratio of number of erased chunks to number of free chunks) experimentally and try to find the optimal value of beta for which number of Aggressive Garbage Collections (Garbage Collection) is the least. Extensive tests were conducted by varying the value of beta (0 < beta< 1). A total of three tests were used to determine the number of Garbage Collections in different scenarios: a write test (clean write as well as overwrites), an <b>erase</b> <b>test</b> and a post <b>erase</b> <b>test</b> Garbage Collection monitoring test. A generic write test and an <b>erase</b> <b>test</b> were provided with YAFFS 2 source code, which needed little modifications. The last test was developed by us as the situation demanded. Reduction in the number of Aggressive Garbage Collections reduces computational load on the processor, which in turn saves power, especially in battery powered devices...|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{component}} of any large scale manufacturing {{line is the}} development of autonomous testing at the wafer scale. This work offers a solution through the fabrication of grating couplers in the silicon-on-insulator platform via ion implantation. The grating is subsequently <b>erased</b> after <b>testing</b> using laser annealing without affecting the optical performance of the photonic circuit. Experimental results show the possibility for the realisation of low loss, compact solutions which may revolutionise photonic wafer-scale testing. The process is CMOS compatible and can be implemented in other platforms to realise more complex systems such as multilayer photonics or programmable optical circuits...|$|R
40|$|Computer Generated Holograms (CGHs) {{are useful}} for {{wavefront}} shaping and complex optics testing, including aspherical and free-form optics. Today, CGHs are recorded directly with a laser or intermediates masks but allows only recording binary CGHs; binary CGHs are efficient but can reconstruct only pixilated images. We propose to use a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) for writing binary CGHs as well as grayscale CGHs, able to reconstruct fulfilled images. DMD is actually studied at LAM, for generating programmable slit masks in multi-object spectrographs. It is composed of 2048 x 1080 individually controllable micro-mirrors, with a pitch of 13. 68 Î¼m. This is a real-time reconfigurable mask, perfect for recording CGHs. A first setup has been developed for hologram recording, where the DMD is enlightened with a collimated beam and illuminates a photosensible plate through an Offner relay, with a magnification of 1 : 1. Our set up resolution is 2 - 3 Î¼m, leading to a CGH resolution equal to the DMD micro mirror size. In order to write and <b>erase</b> CGHs during <b>test</b> procedure or on request, we use a photochromic plate called PUR-GD 71 - 50 -ST developed at Politecnico di Milano. It is opaque at rest, and becomes transparent when it is illuminated with visible light, between 500 and 700 nm; then it can be erased by a UV flash. We choose to code the CGHs in equally spaced levels, so called stepped CGH. We recorded up to 1000 x 1000 pixels CGHs with a contrast greater than 50, knowing that the material is able to reach an ultimate contrast of 1000. A second bench has also been developed, dedicated to {{the reconstruction of the}} recorded images with a 632. 8 nm He-Ne laser beam. Very faithful reconstructions have been obtained. Thanks to our recording and reconstruction set-ups, {{we have been able to}} successfully record binary and stepped CGHs, and reconstruct them with a high fidelity, revealing the potential of this method for generating programmable/rewritable stepped CGHs on photochromic materials...|$|R
