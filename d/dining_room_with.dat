5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in {{the centre of the}} <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E

5|$|The {{interiors}} were streamlined {{as much as}} possible, without traditional touches such as baseboard moldings. Indirect lighting {{was used}} throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded fireplaces topped with indirect lighting and a round <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. The bedrooms included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, glass brick was used as partition material.|$|E

5|$|In 1818 Hope-Weir's {{grandson}} James Hope-Vere (1785–1843) asked Thomas Brown {{to provide}} designs for an attic extension, although this was never carried out. Ten years later, William Burn was commissioned {{to design a}} new north wing, incorporating a <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> new kitchens below and bedrooms above. The front of this extension was topped by a pediment matching Bruce's original, complete with pineapples, although this too was removed in the 1950s. The rear is bowed, with a curved stair led down to the garden at the rear. Plans for a matching wing to the south were never carried out. Burn also remodelled the interior, creating a large drawing room from the rooms of the south apartment.|$|E
5|$|The porch {{leads into}} the great hall which has a Minton tile floor and a large stone chimney piece. In the east wing is the long gallery which has oak panelling, a chimney-piece and a {{panelled}} ceiling. Behind the long gallery is an irregularly-shaped billiard room and the drawing room. To the south {{of these is the}} library. Behind the great hall is the main staircase. The circular tower at the north-west corner contains the octagonal <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a Minton tile floor, two fireplaces, and a vault of eight radial ribs running to a central boss. The room contains an oak sideboard with a carved Green Man. Below the dining room is a wine cellar. On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E
5|$|The west {{range was}} entirely rebuilt by the Gilmours, in the 1660s, {{to provide a}} spacious suite of modern accommodation, to suit Sir John's {{position}} as a senior judge. The ground floor contained a large central drawing room <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> large windows, and a carved stone fireplace. This room would also have had plaster ceilings and other decorative features. To the north was a kitchen, and to the south a chamber, with a wine cellar below. The first floor had four bedrooms. Another new stair was built, connecting the west range with the tower house. The door to this tower has a classical pediment, above which is a 20th-century plaque, erected by a descendant of the Gilmours, and bearing the arms of Sir John Gilmour and his wife. The west range is now roofless, the internal floor is also gone, and the large windows have been blocked up.|$|E

5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E

25|$|Sala de Bilhar (Billiard Room), which {{replaced}} {{an older}} {{room on the}} second floor, and occupied King Luís after dinner, as the Queen and guests would retire to the Blue Room, although the Queen was known {{to play with the}} King on occasion or with her piano teacher, Mrs. Cart. The room is an elaborate extension of the adjacent <b>Dining</b> <b>Room,</b> <b>with</b> a parquet floor, a wood fireplace, lateral wooden pilasters and dark wood grain-coloured walls, with a series of long bunk sofas against the walls. The large wood fireplace is composed of carved wood with cherubs and built-in mirror, while the central pool table occupies the majority of the space.|$|E
25|$|Work on the {{interiors}} {{came to a}} halt when the building's fabric was completed. Not until the 1730s was the first phase of interior work carried out, including a palace chapel in the attic designed by the Swedish architect Carl Hårleman. The interiors at Strömsholm Palace are largely Gustavian in style. In 1766 the heir to the Swedish throne, later King Gustav III, married Princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. As a wedding present from the Riksdag of the Estates, she was given Strömsholm Palace. Extensive interior works commenced, under the architectural direction of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and continued into the 19th century. The queen's bedchamber {{is a prime example of}} Swedish interior design from the start of the Gustavian era, as well as the Chinese <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> its fabric-covered walls with Chinese style paintings done by the renowned tapestry painter Lars Bolander.|$|E
5000|$|Laura Mason in Food Culture in Great Britain {{wrote that}} [...] "In mid-twentieth-century Britain, eating out had a dreadful image.

25|$|Building No.2, {{also known}} as the Garment Center, {{followed}} the same design as Building No.1's warehouse. This structure was built as 10-story warehouses in light brown brick with large open industrial spaces and concrete columns. The building housed offices and showrooms for manufacturing companies, chemical companies, and building supplies. Near the end of construction, a 2-story structure was added {{on the roof of the}} building to serve as the clubhouse for the University Club, a major private men's club. A skybridge was erected to connect the member entrance on the eleventh floor of Santa Fe Building No.1 with the clubhouse. The penthouse included an auditorium/great hall, library and <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> bedrooms for resident members and nonresident members' guests on the second level. Trees, shrubs and a putting green surrounded the clubhouse. Plans were made to expand the club to the roofs of Buildings No.1 and No.3, but the club only used the penthouse until the late 1930s. Radio station WFAA moved into and converted the former University Club space for a broadcast station in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Warner's {{management}} style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian Jack Benny, {{who once worked}} at Warner Bros., quipped, [...] "Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie".

500|$|Citing {{the variety}} of cheeses offered in the patties, George Motz {{described}} the [...] Club's Juicy Lucys as an upscale version of the dish. Dara Moskowitz Grumdahl described the bar's Juicy Lucy in City Pages as a [...] "big, sizzling, dense, and tender burger filled with good cheese" [...] while Thrillists Kevin Alexander disagreed, writing that the patty [...] "lacked serious flavor and the cheese didn't burn [...] tongue as much as just surrender en masse on [...] plate after an initial bite." [...] Of the ambiance, Motz wrote {{that in spite of}} [...] "its clinical-looking rear entrance", the bar has a [...] "comfortable <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> a large outdoor patio." [...] James Norton commented that the eatery [...] "has a clean, bright suburban sheen to it more evocative of a well-maintained Applebee's than a hole-in-the-wall tavern" [...] and Alexander compared the restaurant's exterior to [...] "the rectory of a pretty happening church".|$|E
