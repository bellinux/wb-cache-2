5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|All clues lead F.E.A.R. {{to believe}} Fettel is being {{controlled}} by Alma, who {{was locked in}} the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project owing to the danger the woman posed; Fettel is searching for that same facility to free his mother. The player takes the Point Man to the abandoned structure, fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC guards, who have received orders {{to cover up the}} whole affair. When the protagonist comes to finally face Fettel, he is <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hallucination where the player learns how the Point Man is Alma's first son and is thereafter enabled to kill Fettel himself.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Raoul Silva's attack on MI6, a cryptic message sets in motion events that will see James Bond come face-to-face with the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE.

5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, {{in the event of}} an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> larger NATO–Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VIII is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Square for the PlayStation console.

During the quest to defeat Ultimecia, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey is {{mentioned}} {{again in the}} campaigns of the early 1270s, when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea, Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos. In 1270, Geoffrey and his neighbour, the Baron of Akova, joined the Prince's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry. The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia, but Philanthropenos avoided being <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pitched battle. A period of relative peace followed due to the ongoing Second Council of Lyon, but in 1275, the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks. Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey, who stationed them to keep watch over the defiles of Skorta, but he died of dysentery in late 1275. After his death, Karytaina was increasingly subject to the attacks of the Byzantines, and finally fell to them in 1320.|$|E

5|$|In America Widmerpool becomes {{something}} of a figurehead among youth protest movements; there are suggestions that his earlier problems may have resulted from a CIA plot. He returns to England in the late 1960s and is installed as Chancellor of a new university. During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately identifies with the demonstrators and becomes a central figure in the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more sinister cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence. He is last heard of late in 1971, when during a ritual dawn run through the woods he collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{consulted}} with his frontline commanders and senior {{officers of the}} General Staff from 12 to 15 April 1943. In the end he and the Stavka agreed that the Germans would probably target Kursk. Stalin believed the decision to defend would give the Germans the initiative, but Zhukov countered that the Germans would be <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> trap where their armoured power would be destroyed, thus creating the conditions for a major Soviet counteroffensive. They decided to meet the enemy attack by preparing defensive positions to wear out the German groupings before launching their own offensive. Preparation of defences and fortifications began {{by the end of}} April, and continued until the German attack in early July. The two-month delay between the German decision to attack the Kursk salient and its implementation allowed the Red Army ample time to thoroughly prepare.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 FIFA World Cup {{qualification}} process and 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup (hosted in Guatemala) were both huge disasters for El Salvador. In the former {{they received a}} by to the second round where they inched past Bermuda 4–3 on aggregate (2–1, 2–2). In the third round they were <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> home–and–away round–robin group with Jamaica, Panama, and the United States. El Salvador finished last in the group with just 4 points from 6 games. In the 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup they failed to advance past the first round after losing against Panama 0–1 and Costa Rica 1–2. This mean they also failed {{to qualify for the}} 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They were coached by Carlos Cavagnaro.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 Copa Centroamericana, the {{new name}} of the reorganized UNCAF Nations Cup, used the same two–round system as the {{previous}} tournament, with a round–robin group stage in the first round, followed by a knockout style competition for the remaining four teams. El Salvador was <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> group with Belize, Nicaragua, and Panama. La Selecta defeated Nicaragua 2–0, Belize 5–2, and lost 2–0 against Panama, which was enough to let them advance from the group in second place. In the semifinals they lost to Honduras, again by a 2–0 score. In the third place match, they faced Panama again, losing in a penalty shootout 4–5 after a 0–0 draw. This performance was enough to qualify El Salvador for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The team was coached by José Luis Rugamas. Forward Rafael Burgos jointly received the Golden Boot with Costa Rica's Marco Ureña three goals.|$|E
5|$|The same format as the 1997 and 1999 editions {{was used}} at the 2001 UNCAF Nations Cup, hosted in Honduras. In the first round, El Salvador was <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> group with Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. El Salvador topped the group, {{defeating}} Nicaragua 3–0, Panama 2–1, and tying Honduras 1–1. In the second and final round they drew all their games to finish in third and advance to the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They were coached by Carlos Recinos. Guatemala won the tournament for the first time. El Salvador was still coached by Recinos for the 2002 Gold Cup. They were drawn into Group A alongside Guatemala and Mexico. El Salvador lost to Mexico 0–1, but defeated Guatemala 1–0, with a goal from Santos Cabrera (58'). For {{the first time they}} advanced to the quarter-finals of a Gold Cup. On January 27, they lost to eventual champions United States by a score of 0–4.|$|E

In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path.

With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.|$|E
