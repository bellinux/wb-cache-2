50|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1979 Jan Goossens moved from N.E.C. tot the Edmonton <b>Drillers,</b> where Hans Kraay Sr. was the head coach at that time. Goossens wasn’t the only Dutch soccer player that moved to the Edmonton <b>Drillers</b> that year. Also Henk ten Cate, Dwight Lodeweges and Hans Kraay Jr. moved to the Edmonton <b>Drillers</b> in 1979-1980. In the 1980-1981 season Jan Goossens won the NASL Indoor competition with the Edmonton <b>Drillers.</b> Goossens played a total of 139 matches for the Edmonton <b>Drillers,</b> in which he scored 92 goals. In 1982 the Edmonton <b>Drillers</b> folded due to financial troubles, which caused Goossens to leave for a club from the United States of America.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 Eastern Kentucky <b>Drillers</b> {{season was}} the 1st {{season for the}} Ultimate Indoor Football League (UIFL) franchise. On November 26, 2010, the UIFL {{announced}} that the team in Pikeville, Kentucky would be named the Eastern Kentucky <b>Drillers.</b> The <b>Drillers</b> lost their first game in franchise history, a 44-49 defeat to {{the hands of the}} Saginaw Sting.

25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{career of}} the Finnish-built barge carriers is unclear. Both Yulius Fuchik and Tibor Szamueli {{were sold in}} the late 1990s and renamed Production <b>Driller</b> and Development <b>Driller</b> respectively. Despite the names, it is uncertain if the ships were ever converted or otherwise used for offshore drilling. After the alleged plans for using the barge carriers to transport rolling stock from the United States to the Latin America fell through, the ships were laid up in Piraeus, Greece.|$|E

25|$|Optimism {{was still}} abound about the {{on the field}} product heading into the season, but an 0–5 start quickly brought the team back down to Earth. Struggling {{particularly}} in the offensive end of the pitch, the Drillers shipped Allan to Montreal in a deal that eventually led to Lloyd Barker finding his way back into <b>Driller</b> silks. The Drillers did eventually pull out of their funk, but their season {{on the field and}} in the stands remained largely unspectacular.|$|E

25|$|The {{improbable}} {{run of the}} <b>Drillers</b> {{had made}} the rounds in the media, and coinciding with the poor season the Oilers were having, suddenly the <b>Drillers</b> were the flavour of the month in Edmonton. This {{was evident in the}} stands as the largest regular season crowd in <b>Drillers</b> history took in the regular season finale March 29, where they defeated the Rockers 7–4 in front of a boisterous 9,136 patrons. The win gave the <b>Drillers</b> a 21–19 record for the year, and a first round playoff date with the Milwaukee Wave.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Drillers</b> play at ONEOK Field (pronounced [...] "one-oak"), in {{downtown}} Tulsa's Greenwood district.

25|$|Investment in {{exploration}} at YPF as {{a percentage}} of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol subsidiaries, and fell from 30 new wells in 1998 to eight in 2010 (French energy firm Total S.A. overtook YPF as the leading oil <b>driller</b> in Argentina). Its reserves of crude and natural gas fell 60% and 67% respectively between 1999 and 2011, and declines in output at the firm represented 54% of the nation's lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas.|$|E
25|$|Stewart and Mann also {{collaborated on}} other films outside the western genre. The Glenn Miller Story (1954) was {{critically}} acclaimed, garnering Stewart a BAFTA Award nomination, and (together with The Spirit of St. Louis) continued Stewart's portrayals of 'American heroes'. Thunder Bay, released the same year, transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations {{to a more}} contemporary setting, with Stewart as a Louisiana oil <b>driller</b> facing corruption. Strategic Air Command, released in 1955, allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.|$|E
25|$|Charles Starr {{was born}} around 1933 {{and raised in}} the central part of Texas. The son of an oil <b>driller,</b> he {{attended}} 19 different schools between first grade and sixth grade.

25|$|According to folklore, {{the first}} major shamal {{occurring}} around May 25 {{is known as the}} Al-Haffar, or <b>driller,</b> since it drills huge depressions in desert sand dunes. The second, arriving in early June, coincides with the dawn star, Thorayya (Pleiades), and is therefore named Barih Thorayya. During this event, which is more violent than the others, fishermen usually remain in port because ancient folklore tells them that this wind devours ships. Near the end of June, the last shamal arrives, known as the Al-Dabaran, or the follower. It is violent and continues for several days. Local residents keep doors and windows firmly shut as this shamal includes an all-penetrating fine dust which gets into everything.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{was known}} to exist here, {{but there was no}} {{practical}} way to extract it. Its main use to that time had been as a medicine for both animals and humans. In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent its manager, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, near what is now Oil Creek State Park. Drake hired a salt well <b>driller,</b> William A. Smith, in the summer of 1859. After many difficulties, they finally drilled a commercially successful well on August 27. It was an event that changed the world, beginning with the surrounding vicinity.|$|E
25|$|Lake Wilhelm is a {{warm water}} fishery it lies partly within Maurice K. Goddard State Park and partly within the {{adjoining}} game lands. The common game fish {{found in the}} lake are largemouth and smallmouth bass, perch, crappie, bluegill, catfish, walleye, northern pike and muskellunge. All fishermen are expected to follow {{the rules and regulations}} of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Five natural gas wells have been drilled around Lake Wilhelm as of May 2009, with up to 15 more to follow. The state does not own the mineral rights under much of the park, but did work with the <b>driller</b> to minimize the impact of the wells on recreational uses of the park.|$|E

5000|$|Another pro 87 {{argument}} was that the, [...] "tax will be essentially {{a tax on}} extracting oil in California. This tax exists in other states. Alaska <b>drillers</b> pay a 15% tax, Texas <b>drillers</b> pay a 4.6% tax and Louisiana <b>drillers</b> a 12.5% tax. This tax on the California <b>drillers</b> would only be between 1 - 6% depending {{on the price of}} a barrel of oil. California is the only large producing state in the US without such a tax." [...] This tax would have been on exporters of oil in California and the language in the proposition prohibited the cost to be passed on to consumers.|$|R
50|$|The 2012 Eastern Kentucky <b>Drillers</b> {{season was}} the 2nd {{season for the}} United Indoor Football League franchise. The <b>Drillers</b> were able to finish the season with an 6-4 record, but {{suspended}} themselves from the playoffs for violating league rules.|$|R
25|$|Another more vindictive {{motivation}} for {{bringing in the}} indoor soccer side was to make life {{more difficult for the}} expansion Western Hockey League team, the Edmonton Ice. Pocklington had wanted a WHL franchise in Edmonton for himself, but was never granted one. So when Ed Chynoweth stepped down as WHL commissioner and was promptly granted a franchise in Edmonton, needless to say it rubbed Pocklington the wrong way. As a result, the Ice were not allowed to play at the Pocklington controlled Coliseum, and were instead left to play their games at the somewhat less fan friendly Northlands Agricom. On top of that it was standard practice to schedule <b>Driller</b> games head-to-head with Ice games, and distribute large quantities of complimentary tickets.|$|E
25|$|Sindis' {{recurrent}} obsession is death, and he prophesies {{in detail}} {{about being an}} out-of-body witness to his funeral service and incineration, content that the flames would also consume his parasite. His tormented life is intertwined with those of desperate anti-heroes, including a gout-afflicted man who severs his own fingers, or a <b>driller</b> who was burned alive. When read as a camouflaged record of actual events in Bonciu's life, the novel reveals his claims about having been a witness to Vienna's artistic life under the Double Monarchy: Viennese writers such as Altenberg, Petzold, Wildgans, Peter Hille, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig appear as characters, and Endre Ady is a literary prototype. In {{one section of the}} book, Ramses discovers the beautiful Hilda, who is a painter, a muse, and the living artwork of Egon Schiele, and who ends up being eaten alive by her creator; before this happens, Hilda, Schiele and Ramses become entangled in a sadomasochistic ménage à trois.|$|E
25|$|The first {{commercial}} oil well in Canada became operational in 1858 at Oil Springs, Ontario (then Canada West). Businessman James Miller Williams dug several wells between 1855 and 1858 before discovering a rich reserve of oil four metres below ground. Williams extracted 1.5 million litres {{of crude oil}} by 1860, refining much of it into kerosene lamp oil. Williams's well became commercially viable a year before Drake's Pennsylvania operation and could be argued to be the {{first commercial}} oil well in North America. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. Advances in drilling continued into 1862 when local <b>driller</b> Shaw reached a depth of 62 metres using the spring-pole drilling method. On January 16, 1862, after an explosion of natural gas Canada's first oil gusher came into production, shooting into the air at a recorded rate of 3,000 barrels per day. By the end of the 19th century the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, had taken the lead in production.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Drillers</b> {{have been}} Texas League champions three times: in 1982, 1988, and 1998. As well as Eastern Division Champions in 1999, and 2002. The <b>Drillers</b> also {{appeared}} in the Texas League playoffs during the 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons.|$|R
40|$|A {{clinical}} and radiological survey of 34 {{men who were}} pneumatic <b>drillers</b> employed by the North East Gas Board, was carried out to determine the prevalence of osteoarthrosis. Mild osteoarthrosis of the elbows was found in 2 subjects only.

Our findings do not support the view that pneumatic <b>drillers</b> are particularly prone to develop osteoarthrosis...|$|R
