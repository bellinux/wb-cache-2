40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the influence of freezing on the visco-elastic properties of strawberries. Food structure {{plays an important role}} in food quality and functionality. It is important for the consumers to find an identical sensation when they eat a fresh strawberry and when the strawberry is defrosted. The visco-elastic properties of a food product are an indirect measure of its structure. Experimental measurements of these properties may correlate to changes on the physical attributes of the product. In this work, a dynamic mechanical analyser was used to assess changes on loss (E’’) and storage (E’) modulus, applying a compressive test with a Ø 1. 5 cm parallel plate geometry. Strawberries were acquired in a local market and frozen in a blast and <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>freezer</b> at – 30 ºC for 1 hour. Samples were stored at – 30 ºC in freezing chambers. Analyses were performed on fresh strawberries, after freezing and during storage. The samples were cut in small cylinders (1. 5 cm x 1. 5 cm) and left to relax during 1 hour at room temperature. Preliminary tests were performed in order to evaluate the linear visco-elastic region and the loss and storage modulus were determined. A dynamic frequency sweep test was also performed. Results showed that the behaviour of fresh strawberry sample varies significantly when compared with a defrosted sample. The influence of the storage still cannot be evaluated and is currently under study. Overall, it can be concluded that the freezing process greatly influenced the visco-elastic properties of the strawberries...|$|E

In this study, {{we have made a}} comparison of a conical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> and a cylindrical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> for the direct reduction process. The results showed that the conical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> was more versatile than the cylindrical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> in treating the fine iron ore concentrate. In the conical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed,</b> with a high superficial gas velocity, defluidization was successfully inhibited without adding inert materials or causing elutriation issues. Simultaneously, the reduction efficiency was considerably improved and the obtained iron agglomerates exhibited a high metallization degree. This work also proposes a fluidization regime diagram for the conical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> at the temperature range from 650 to 800 degrees C According to the fluidization regime diagram, the conical <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> is able to considerably expand the operational temperature range for the direct reduction process.

In order to analyze the results of the CFD simulations, two one-dimensional <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> models have been formulated.

In the analysis, the effects of various <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> operation parameters, such as fluidization, velocity, particle and bubble diameter, reactor size, and chemical kinetics, on the heterogeneous mass transfer coefficients in the lower <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> are evaluated extensively.
