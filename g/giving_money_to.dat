25|$|On New Year's Day, Japanese {{people have}} a custom of <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> children, known as otoshidama.

In the Edo period large stores and wealthy families gave out a small bag of mochi and a Mandarin orange to spread happiness all around.

500|$|Later in 2010, Frank and the CCAF, citing American Law Institute {{guidelines}} on cy-près, objected to Apple's settlement of a securities class action over their backdating, arguing that <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> third parties {{affiliated with the}} class counsel instead of to the class was a breach of fiduciary duty. Frank stated that [...] "the magnitude of the settlement compared to the original claims demonstrates {{that it is an}} extortionate nuisance settlement, being made because it would cost more to defend the suit than to pay the attorneys to go away." [...] In response to CCAF's objection, the parties amended the settlement by reallocating the $2.5 million originally proposed as cy-près to class members; the court awarded CCAF attorneys' fees for their role in winning $2.5 million for the class.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, former player Greg Olson accused Musselman {{of having}} {{attempted}} to strike {{him in a}} practice. [...] It was also revealed that Olson had sold complimentary season tickets to a booster named Harvey Mackay, which prompted NCAA investigations. [...] Musselman's coaching style also brought about significant transfers away from the Minnesota program to other schools. In 1975, Musselman resigned and was named the {{head coach of the}} San Diego Sails of the ABA. After his resignation, Musselman admitted to <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> players for rent and transportation. These charges, coupled with the earlier ticket selling scandal and other transgressions regarding payments and aid revolving around Harvey Mackay, resulted in a list from the NCAA of more than 100 rule violations in Musselman's four seasons at the school. The extent of the consequences would not be known until early in Jim Dutcher's eleven season tenure as Gophers head coach.|$|E
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E

500|$|Both of Hale's {{parents died}} {{before he was}} five; Joanna in 1612, and Robert in 1614. It was then {{revealed}} that Robert had been so generous in <b>giving</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the poor that at his death his estate provided only £100 of income a year, of which £20 was {{to be paid to}} the local poor. Hale thus passed into the care of Anthony Kingscot, one of his father's relatives. A strong Puritan, Kingscot had Hale taught by a Mr. Stanton, the vicar of Wotton known as the [...] "scandalous vicar" [...] due to his extremist puritan views. On 20 October 1626, at the age of 16, Hale matriculated at the University of Oxford as a member of Magdalen Hall, with the goal of becoming a priest. [...] Both Kingscot and Stanton had intended this to be his career, and his education had been conducted with that in mind. He was taught by Obadiah Sedgwick, another Puritan, and excelled in both his studies and fencing. Hale also regularly attended church, private prayer-meetings, and was described as [...] "simple in his attire, and rather aesthetic". After a company of actors came to Oxford, Hale attended so many plays and other social activities that his studies began to suffer, and he began to turn away from Puritanism. In light of this, he abandoned his desire to become a priest and instead decided to become a soldier. His relatives were unable to persuade him to become a priest, or even a lawyer, with Hale describing lawyers as [...] "a barbarous set of people unfit for anything but their own trade".|$|E

Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on the phone, at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby."
