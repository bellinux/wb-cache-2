40|$|BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are {{routinely}} {{used in the}} treatment of metastatic bone disease from breast cancer to reduce pain and bone destruction. Zoledronic acid given by intravenous infusion has been widely used, but places a substantial logistical burden on both patient and hospital. As a result, the use of oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> has increased, despite the absence of comparative data. In the ZICE trial, we compared oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> with intravenous zoledronic acid for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer to bone. METHODS: This phase 3, open-label, parallel group active-controlled, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 study was done in 99 UK hospitals. Eligibility criteria included at least one radiologically confirmed bone metastasis from a histologically confirmed breast cancer. Patients with ECOG performance status 0 to 2 and clinical decision to treat with bisphosphonates within 3 months of randomisation were randomly assigned to receive 96 weeks of treatment with either intravenous zoledronic acid at 4 mg every 3 - 4 weeks or oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> 50 mg daily. Randomisation (1 : 1) was done via a central computerised system within stratified block sizes of four. Randomisation was stratified on whether patients had current or planned treatment with chemotherapy; current or planned treatment with hormone therapy; and whether they had a previous skeletal-related event within the last 3 months or had planned radiotherapy treatment to the bone or planned orthopaedic surgery due to bone metastases. The primary non-inferiority endpoint was the frequency and timing of skeletal-related events over 96 weeks, analysed using a per-protocol analysis. All active (non-withdrawn) patients have now reached the 96 -week timepoint and the trial is now in long-term follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00326820. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2006, and Oct 4, 2010, 705 patients were randomly assigned to receive <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> and 699 to receive zoledronic acid; three patients withdrew immediately after randomisation. The per-protocol analysis included 654 patients in the <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> group and 672 in the zoledronic acid group. Annual rates of skeletal-related events were 0 · 499 (95 % CI 0 · 454 - 0 · 549) with <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> and 0 · 435 (0 · 393 - 0 · 480) with zoledronic acid; the rate ratio for skeletal-related events was 1 · 148 (95 % CI 0 · 967 - 1 · 362). The upper CI was greater than the margin of non-inferiority of 1 · 08; therefore, we could not reject the null hypothesis that <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> was inferior to zoledronic acid. More patients in the zoledronic acid group had renal toxic effects than in the <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> group (226 [32 %] of 697 vs 172 [24 %] of 704) but rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw were low in both groups (nine [1 %] of 697 vs five [< 1 %] of 704). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were fatigue (97 [14 %] of 697 patients allocated zoledronic acid vs 98 [14 %] of 704 allocated <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid),</b> increased bone pain (91 [corrected] [13 %] vs 85 [corrected] [12 %]), joint pain (41 [corrected] [6 %] vs 38 [5 %]), infection (31 [5 %] vs 23 [corrected] [3 %]), and nausea or vomiting (38 [5 %] vs 41 [6 %]). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that zoledronic acid is preferable to <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> in preventing skeletal-related events caused by bone metastases. However, both drugs have acceptable side-effect profiles and the oral formulation is more convenient, and could still be considered if the patient has a strong preference or if difficulties occur with intravenous infusions.

40|$|Bisphosphonates are {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} drugs in osteoporosis today. They have unequivocally shown their ability to reduce fracture rate at the spine (alendronic acid, risedronic acid, <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid)</b> and at the hip (alendronic acid and risedronic acid). However, their dosage and administration procedures and the adverse reactions induced by their oral intake are responsible for low adherence. Therefore, intermittent regimens have been developed. Weekly alendronic acid and risedronic acid provide similar benefits, in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) and changes in biochemical markers, as those seen with their daily formulations. <b>Ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce vertebral fractures when given intermittently. <b>Ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> given orally monthly and intravenously every 2 or 3 months provides increases in BMD similar to the daily formulation. Yearly intravenous infusions of zoledronic acid are currently being evaluated for their ability to reduce fractures. If the efficacy and safety of bisphosphonates given at administration intervals longer than weekly are confirmed, this might significantly improve patient adherence and long-term outcomes of bisphosphonate treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

40|$|Zoledronic acid (Zometa(R)) is {{a third-generation}} {{nitrogen-containing}} parenteral bisphosphonate indicated {{for the treatment}} of bone metastases due to solid tumours or multiple myeloma and for hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM). In patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3 - 4 weeks for up to 15 months significantly reduced the proportion of patients with >= 1 skeletal-related event (SRE), excluding HCM, compared with placebo. In patients with advanced breast cancer or multiple myeloma, the incidence of SREs was similar in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg or pamidronic acid 90 mg every 3 - 4 weeks for up to 25 months but, in breast cancer patients, zoledronic acid reduced the risk of SREs, including HCM, by an additional 20 % compared with pamidronic acid. In modelled cost-utility studies comparing direct costs based on efficacy and resource-use data from these and/or other trials, results have varied. In the most recent study performed {{from the perspective of the}} UK NHS and modelled over a 10 -year treatment period in women with advanced breast cancer, intravenous zoledronic acid and oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> were dominant over no treatment. Intravenous zoledronic acid was the most cost effective, in terms of incremental costs per QALY gained, followed by oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid,</b> intravenous pamidronic acid and intravenous <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid.</b> Two other modelled analyses in patients with advanced breast cancer, also conducted from the perspective of the NHS, evaluated the cost utility of three bisphosphonate therapies in patients receiving hormonal therapy or intravenous chemotherapy. Analyses were modelled over 14. 3 months (i. e. expected survival) and assumptions varied markedly from results in clinical breast cancer trials. Also, efficacy assumptions for zoledronic acid were not based on clinical trials with the drug. The results of these analyses suggest that oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> is more cost effective than intravenous zoledronic acid and intravenous pamidronic acid in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained. In a global, 15 -month modelled cost-effectiveness analysis of patients with advanced prostate cancer, conducted from a third-party perspective, the incremental cost per QALY gained for zoledronic acid versus no treatment was $US 159 _ 200 (year 2000 value), which is about 3 -fold greater than commonly accepted thresholds for cost effectiveness. In conclusion, a recent modelled economic analysis suggests that intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg is dominant relative to no treatment in the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer. In contrast, in patients with advanced prostate cancer, the incremental cost per QALY gained for zoledronic acid 4 mg versus no treatment was predicted to be higher than commonly accepted thresholds. Compared with other bisphosphonates in the setting of advanced breast cancer, intravenous zoledronic acid was more cost effective than oral or intravenous <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> and intravenous pamidronic acid in one study, but less cost effective than oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> in another. Further efficacy and economic data comparing intravenous zoledronic acid with oral <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> are needed. Meanwhile, zoledronic acid appears to be the most cost effective intravenous bisphosphonate for the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer and possibly in patients with different types of advanced solid tumours.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Aims This bioequivalence study aimed to compare rate {{and extent of}} absorption of a generic medicinal product of <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> 150 -mg film-coated tablet versus Bonviva. Methods This was a single-centre, open-label, random-ized, three-way, three-sequence, reference-replicated, crossover bioequivalence study, under fasting conditions. A single oral dose of <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> as one 150 -mg film-coated tablet was administered in each study period. Each washout period lasted 14 days. Blood samples were col-lected according to a predefined sampling schedule and up to 48. 0 hours after administraton in each period. Plasma concentrations of <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> were measured using a liquid chromatograph–mass spectrometry/mass spectrom-etry method. Bioequivalence between generic and refer-ence medicinal products is acceptable if the 90 % confidence intervals (CI) of ratio of least-squares means between the test and the reference product of ln-trans-formed area under the serum concentration–time curve from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC 0 –t) is within the 80. 00 – 125. 00 % interval.

40|$|Background and objective: Osteoporosis is a {{major health}} threat nowadays. Aging of the {{population}} and changes in peoples’ lifestyle result in a constant {{increase in the number of}} fractures all over the world. Our study aimed at describing the drug utilization pattern and choice of active substances of antiosteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries. Materials and methods: Sales data of the antiosteoporotic medicines was obtained from the internet. These are available on the website of medicines regulatory agencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) methodology of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and defined daily dose (DDD) was used to compare the data among countries. Results: During the study period the consumption of antiosteoporotic medicines was rather stable in all the countries. The overall choice of active substances used to treat osteoporosis is similar in all the Baltic countries but the market shares of substances were different. Estonia stands out with high use of combination product of alendronic acid and colecalciferol. In Latvia the highest consumption was of risedronic acid. In Lithuania the most used active substance in 2014 was <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> and second was denosumab with 0. 8 daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) and 25 % of the total share. Conclusions: The differences in consumption of drugs against osteoporosis in the Baltic countries are not very big. The consumption of antiosteoporotic drugs is not to be regarded as sufficient though. The generally low consumption of osteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries can be attributed to the overall less than EU average wealth of the countries and less than optimal expenditure on healthcare out of the GDP...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Oral ibandronate (<b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid)</b> is a bisphosphonate {{approved}} in the UK {{for treatment of}} bone metastases from breast cancer. Administration of oral ibandronate oncedaily can be easily combined with oral hormonal therapy, saving costs of iv bisphosphonate administration and monitoring. We used cost-effectiveness (C/E) modelling to compare oral ibandronate with iv zoledronic acid or iv generic pamidronate in this setting. METHODS: The model assumed a UK NHS perspective {{with a duration of}} 14. 3 months (expected average survival). Patients were assumed to receive oral hormonal therapy for 53 % of their survival. Primary outcomes were direct Health Care costs and QALYs. Resource use data for iv bisphosphonates came from a published micro-costing study (validated through review by a UK clinician); costs were calculated using a unit cost database. Monthly drug acquisition costs were £ 195 for oral ibandronate and iv zoledronic acid, and £ 165 for iv generic pamidronate. The cost of managing skeletal-related events (SREs) came from a published study. Renal adverse events with monitoring and treatment costs were assumed for zoledonic acid. Efficacy was calculated as the relative risk reduction (RR) of SREs; utility scores were applied to time with/without an SRE (SRE duration assumed 1 month). RESULTS: The projected total cost was £ 297 less/patient with oral ibandronate than with zoledronic acid, and £ 1087 less than with generic pamidronate. Oral ibandronate led to a gain of 0. 02 QALYs (due to SRE RR and bone pain relief), making it the economically dominant treatment option. For completeness, C/E results for iv ibandronate will also be presented, demonstrating C/E. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the use of C/E modelling to compare oral versus iv bisphosphonates using published data validated by expert clinician review. Oral ibandronate was found to be cost-effective for the management of bone metastases from breast cancer in patients receiving oral hormonal therapy...|$|E

BACKGROUND: Fragility {{fractures}} are fractures that result from mechanical forces that would not ordinarily result in fracture. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates [alendronic acid (Fosamax(®) and Fosamax(®) Once Weekly, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd), risedronic acid (Actonel(®) and Actonel Once a Week(®), Warner Chilcott UK Ltd), <b>ibandronic</b> <b>acid</b> (Bonviva(®), Roche Products Ltd) and zoledronic acid (Aclasta(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd) ] for the prevention of fragility fracture and to assess their cost-effectiveness at varying levels of fracture risk. DATA SOURCES: For the clinical effectiveness review, six electronic databases and two trial registries were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science and BIOSIS Previews, Clinicaltrials. gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Searches were limited by date from 2008 until September 2014. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of effectiveness studies were conducted. A review of published economic analyses was undertaken and a de novo health economic model was constructed. Discrete event simulation was used to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each bisphosphonate treatment strategy and a strategy of no treatment for a simulated cohort of patients with heterogeneous characteristics. The model was populated with effectiveness evidence from the systematic review and NMA. All other parameters were estimated from published sources. A NHS and Personal Social Services perspective was taken, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3. 5 % per annum. Fracture risk was estimated from patient characteristics using the QFracture(®) (QFracture- 2012 open source revision 38, Clinrisk Ltd, Leeds, UK) and FRAX(®) (web version 3. 9, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) tools. The relationship between fracture risk and incremental net benefit (INB) was estimated using non-parametric regression. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and scenario analyses were used to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: Forty-six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the clinical effectiveness systematic review, with 27 RCTs providing data for the fracture NMA and 35 RCTs providing data for the femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) NMA. All treatments had beneficial effects on fractures versus placebo, with hazard ratios varying from 0. 41 to 0. 92 depending on treatment and fracture type. The effects on vertebral fractures and percentage change in BMD were statistically significant for all treatments. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on fractures between bisphosphonates. A statistically significant difference in the incidence of influenza-like symptoms was identified from the RCTs for zoledronic acid compared with placebo. Reviews of observational studies suggest that upper gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported in the first month of oral bisphosphonate treatment, but pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials found no statistically significant difference. A strategy of no treatment was estimated to have the maximum INB for patients with a 10 -year QFracture risk under 1. 5 %, whereas oral bisphosphonates provided maximum INB at higher levels of risk. However, the PSA suggested that there is considerable uncertainty regarding whether or not no treatment is the optimal strategy until the QFracture score is around 5. 5 %. In the model using FRAX, the mean INBs were positive for all oral bisphosphonate treatments across all risk categories. Intravenous bisphosphonates were estimated to have lower INBs than oral bisphosphonates across all levels of fracture risk when estimated using either QFracture or FRAX. LIMITATIONS: We assumed that all treatment strategies are viable alternatives across the whole population. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates are effective in preventing fragility fractures. However, the benefit-to-risk ratio in the lowest-risk patients may be debatable given the low absolute QALY gains and the potential for adverse events. We plan to extend the analysis to include non-bisphosphonate therapies. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD 42013006883.
