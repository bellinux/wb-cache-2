25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into <b>disposable</b> <b>bottles</b> to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E

40|$|The sheer {{amount of}} <b>disposable</b> <b>bottles</b> being {{produced}} nowadays makes it imperative to identify alternative procedures for recycling them {{since they are}} non-biodegradable. Experimental investigation {{on the effects of}} polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer, which is a waste material obtained by crushing of used PET bottles, on the mineralogical composition of composites after 28 days of casting are presented in this paper. Various weight fractions of cement 2. 5 %, 5 % and 7. 5 % were replaced by the same weight of PET plastic; they were then moulded into specimens and cured. The fine powder samples obtained from broken specimens were subjected to X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and the composites were also observed by optical microscope. Thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) were used to study the interaction between polymers and cements. Differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction and FT-IR were also used to investigate the cement hydration according to the additions. The results showed that an increase in polymer-cement ratio meets with a decrease in the quantity of Ca(OH) 2 ; in terms of bonding, the rough surface of particle favours greater contact between PET and cement matrix and doesn’t seem to have chemical interaction between the mineral species and the organic molecules which could lead to the formation of new compounds. The present study highlights the capabilities of the different methods for the analysis of composites and opened new way for the recycling of PET in polymer-mortars...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Dengue virus, {{which is}} {{transmitted}} by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes {{is the most}} important emerging viral disease, infecting more than 50 million people annually. Currently used sticky traps are useful tools for monitoring and control of A. aegypti, despite differences in efficiency, labor requirements and cost. In the present work, a field assay was carried out to evaluate the performance of a sticky trap (AedesTrap), produced using disposable material, in capturing gravid Aedes spp. females. Additionally, conditions necessary for the improved performance of the device, such as number of traps per site and location (indoors or outdoors) were evaluated. Methods During a one year period, traps were placed in a dengue endemic area in 28 [*]day[*]cycles. The trap, named AedesTrap, consisted of a disposable plastic soda bottle coated inside with colophony resin, which served as a sticky substrate. <b>Disposable</b> <b>bottles</b> were donated by restaurants, and traps were made by laboratory staff, reducing the cost of the sticky trap (less than U$ 3). Mosquito capture in indoor and outdoor areas was compared by placing the traps in laundry room, kitchen or bedroom (indoors) and front or back yard (outdoors). The relationship between the number of AedesTraps and quantity of captured mosquitoes was investigated by utilizing one or three traps/site. Results During a 28 [*]day[*]cycle, a single AedesTrap was capable of capturing up to 15 A. aegypti in a house, with a mean capture of 0. 5 to 2. 63 females per premise. The AedesTrap collected three times more outdoors versus indoors. Similarly, the capability of detecting Aedes spp. infestation, and of capturing females, was three times higher when using three AedesTraps per house, compared with one trap per house. Conclusions AedesTrap was shown to be capable of capturing A. aegypti and other culicidae, providing information on the adult mosquito population, and allowing the identification of areas critically infested by mosquitoes. Low requirements for skilled labor together with easy maintenance and low cost are additional advantages of using this sticky trap. </p...|$|E
