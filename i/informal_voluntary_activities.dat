Focusing specifically on <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> around health and welfare, this article reviews how geographers have begun to critically engage with issues of <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> and space.

However, correlation analysis found no significant relationship between local authority and <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity,</b> even though both sometimes arranged the same kinds of activities. In other words, this study finds no support for substitution theory. On the contrary, it shows that a higher level of <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> is found in municipalities where the local authority cooperates with or supports voluntary organisations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Volunteers {{are being}} {{integrated}} in all spheres of human activities. The most widespread {{area where the}} volunteers can operate is health social sphere. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> {{in this area is}} very demanding and that is why the professional approach is necessary. Its part is also a volunteer training. This training is used for the volunteers to strengthen their motivation and understanding their role in the voluntary program. Thanks to this voluntary training future misunderstanding among volunteer, client and organization is prevented. Theoretical part is focused on clarification of some basic concepts from volunteering area. It also tries to scan volunteer programs from the training point of view and to outline common schematics of training. The purpose of this work is to quantitatively evaluate importance of volunteer trainings for <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> in different <b>voluntary</b> programmes. The following collecting data methods were used for quantitative research: controlled interview and questionnaire. Volunteers and co-ordinators of voluntary programmes were included into the investigated group. From the collected data it is obvious that co-ordinators of voluntary programmes consider voluntary training necessary for practising <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity.</b> They also think that the biggest contribution of volunteer training is practical training of necessary skills. Another profit is that the training helps volunteers to practise <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> on high level. Training motivates trainees to become volunteers {{and at the same time}} it declines fear and uncertainty of volunteers from <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities.</b> The thesis will be offered to National voluntary centre Hestia in Prague that may use it as a basis for creation of integrated philosophy of volunteer training...|$|R

The interviewees were four kindergarten teachers, who had had a career of more than ten years when the National curriculum was revised in 1989. It was shown that the following four factors were important in order to really understand play as a <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> of children: (1) Some experiences that trigger to reconsider kindergarten education and care after a certain years of that career: (2) Cooperation and sharing of the same problems with their colleagues; (3) Remaining consciousness of kindergarten education and care; and (4) Personality to live their lives spontaneously...|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} deal with the {{correlation}} between <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> and religion in terms of altruism. In the United Kingdom there are over five-hundred thousand voluntary organizations, and among them about 170, 000 are registered charities. The charitable purposes of these organizations are altruistic and classified under four headings : the relief of poverty, the advancement of education, the advancement of religion, and other purposes beneficial to the community. Although it received only indirect mention in the preamble of the Statute of Elizabeth I (the Charitable Uses Act 1601),the advancement of religion has always been considered a charitable object. Indeed, {{the very concept of}} charity is essentially religious in origin. Thus, charitable activities and religions have traditionally been strongly related. After surveying the literature on altruism, we shall consider the social dimension of these <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> and their significance. There after we shall take a general view of the system of charities in the United Kingdom and its history. In the rest of the article, we shall discuss the correlation between religions and <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> in terms of altruism from various standpoints. The discussion will refer to the meanings of altruism and charitable activities to religious people. Finally, this article will illustrate the differences and affinities between <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> of religious people and those of non-religious people...|$|R
