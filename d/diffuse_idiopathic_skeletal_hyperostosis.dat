The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases.

50|$|Osteophyte {{formation}} {{has been}} classically related to any sequential and consequential changes in bone formation that {{is due to}} aging, degeneration, mechanical instability, and disease (such as <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis).</b> Often osteophytes form in osteoarthritic joints {{as a result of}} damage and wear from inflammation.

40|$|Total hip a≪hroplasty may be {{followed}} by ectopic bone formation. An increased frequency has been suspected in patients with <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> hypcrostosis (DISH). In 204 patients we found that, of the 38 subjects with pre-existing DISH, 29 % developed postoperative ossification compared with only 10 % in those without DISH (p ≪; 0. 01).

In a separate study of 1325 patients (not analysed for spinal DISH), we looked for correlations between the severity of postoperative ectopic bone and clinical measurements. Even for the more severe ossification grades (n = 112), only 10 % reported serious pain and only 26 % had reduced hip flexion (≪ 70 °).

50|$|Hypertrophy of this {{ligament}} {{may cause}} spinal stenosis, particularly {{in patients with}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis,</b> because it lies in the posterior portion of the vertebral canal.Some studies indicate {{that the process of}} thickening and hypertrophy of these ligaments can be linked to a fibrosis process with growing increase in collagen type VI, and this increase could represent an adaptive and reparative process associated with the rupture of elastic fibers.|$|E

Alvrus (1999) assessed the skeletal fracture patterns for almost 600 individuals from the Semna South site. She analyzed healed fractures of the skull and appendicular skeleton and found that almost 21% of adults had at least one healed fracture and that the skull was the most frequently injured region of the body.

A cervical X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed a large bone spur originating from the anterior surface of the C 3 / 4. Barium esophagography revealed osteophytic spurs in the anterior aspect of C 3 / 4 vertebrae, in close approximation to the inlet of the esophagus, obstructing the esophagus passage by external compression.

5000|$|One {{effect of}} ageing and disc {{degeneration}} {{is that the}} nucleus pulposus begins to dehydrate and the concentration of proteoglycans in the matrix decreases, thus limiting {{the ability of the}} disc to absorb shock. This general shrinking of disc size is partially responsible for the common decrease in height as humans age. The anulus fibrosus also becomes weaker with age and has an increased risk of tearing. In addition, the cartilage endplates begin thinning, fissures begin to form, and there is sclerosis of the subchondral bone. As the fissures are formed in the anulus fibrosis due to osteo-arthritic bones or degeneration in general, the inner nucleus pulposus can seep out and put pressure on any number of vertebral nerves. A herniated disc can cause mild to severe pain such as sciatica and treatment for herniated discs range from physical therapy to surgery. [...] Other degeneration of the vertebral column includes <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> hyperostosis(DISH) which is the calcification or ossification of the ligaments surrounding the vertebrae. This degeneration causes stiffness and sometimes even curvature in the lumbar and thoraco-lumbar spinal region.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundDiffuse <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> (DISH) {{is prone}} to be {{accompanied}} by a spinal column fracture which is resistant to conservative therapy. This major characteristic of DISH is not recognized adequately by physicians, because the disease's detailed pathological condition has not yet been investigated. Therefore, {{the purposes of this study}} were to investigate the prevalence of DISH using computed tomography (CT), and to validate the reliability of CT interpretation. MethodsSubjects were 558 patients (300 male and 258 female) who underwent both CT of chest to pelvis and x-ray of chest and abdomen from August 2011 to July 2012  at any department other than orthopedic surgery in our institution. The definition of DISH based on x-ray as well as CT was the presence of consecutive fused vertebral bodies according to Resnick's criteria. The prevalence of DISH based on both modalities was calculated in all subjects. For 107 subjects extracted at random, intra- (Cohen kappa) and inter-observer error (Fleiss kappa) were calculated and the levels of fused segments were investigated. ResultsNinety-eight of 558 subjects (17. 6 %) were diagnosed as DISH by x-ray, and 152 (27. 2 %) by CT. Among males, 70 of 300 subjects (23. 3 %) were diagnosed by x-ray, and 116 (38. 7 %) by CT. Among females, 28 of 258 subjects (10. 9 %) were diagnosed by x-ray and 36 (14. 0 %) by CT. The levels of fused segments were presented from thoracic spine to lumbar spine, especially the middle and lower thoracic spine. Cohen kappa of x-ray was 0. 587, and that of CT was 0. 825. Fleiss kappa of x-ray was 0. 552, and that of CT was 0. 643. ConclusionsThe prevalence of DISH based on CT was 27. 1 %, which was higher than that of x-ray. In addition, intra- and inter-observer error by review of CT was less than that of x-ray. CT evaluation would be a better method for precise understanding of the state of DISH...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Dysphagia is {{a common}} {{presentation}} in older people. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> affecting the cervical spine is an uncommon cause of dysphagia and may be overlooked. Case presentation We present {{the case of an}} 88 -year-old man with dysphagia and weight loss. Initial investigation with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was inconclusive. A diagnosis of <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> as a cause for dysphagia was eventually made using video fluoroscopy. This showed a bony prominence impeding swallow at the level of C 3. The patient was unfit for surgical management so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was inserted for feeding. Conclusion The diagnosis of <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> involving the cervical spine often goes unrecognised as a cause of dysphagia despite its prevalence in the elderly population. Diagnosis is made using cervical radiographs, barium swallow and computed tomography. There is a risk of perforation with endoscopy in patients who have cervical <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>hyperostosis.</b> Conservative management includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and a modified diet.

40|$|Large {{anterior}} cervical osteophytes {{can occur}} in degeneration of the cervical spine or in <b>diffuse</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>skeletal</b> hyperos-tosis (DISH). Large osteophytes can produce otolaryngological symptoms such as dysphagia, dysphonia, and foreign body sensation. We describe a DISH patient with giant anterior cervical osteophyte causing chronic dysphagia and dysphonia. A 56 -year-old man presented with increasing dysphagia, dysphonia, neck pain and neck stiffness. Physical examination of the neck showed a non-tender and hard mass {{on the left side}} at the level of C 4 - 5. Radiography showed extensive ossification of anterior longitudinal ligament along the left anterolateral aspect of vertebral bodies from C 2 to T 1. The ossification was espe cially prominent at the level of C 4 - 5 and linear breakage was noted at same level. Esophagogram revealed a filling defect along the pharynx and lateral displacement of the esophagus. Giant anterior cervical osteophyte was removed through the leftsided anterolateral cervical approach to the spine. Anterior cervical interbody fusion at C 4 - 5 was followed by posterior cervical fixation using lateral mass screws from C 3 to C 6. After surgery, dysphagia and dysphonia improved immediately. One year later, cervical CT showed bone fusion at C 4 - 5 bodies and no recurrence of osteophyte. DISH is a common cause of anterior cervical osteophyte leading to progressive dysphagia. Keeping this clinical entity in the differential diagnosis is important in patients with progressive neck stiffness, dysphagia or dysphonia. And surgical treatment of symptomatic anterior cervical osteophyte due to DISH should be considered with a solid fusion procedure preventing postoperative instability or osteophyte progress...|$|R

Further retrospective and prospective studies confirmed this association (Gerber et al. 1984; Pennes et al. 1984; Tangrea et al. 1992).
