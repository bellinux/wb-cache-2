5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows metabolism inside {{the brain to}} operate <b>differently</b> from metabolism {{in other parts of}} the body.

One such right which the wife owes to her husband is being head of the household.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, gravity {{becomes a}} fictitious force that arises in {{situations}} where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other fundamental forces respectively to the curvature of <b>differently</b> scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E
5|$|Leontovych {{arranged}} many Ukrainian folk songs, creating artistically independent choral compositions {{based on}} their melodies and lyrics.

5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security <b>differently</b> from infants with a low-risk for ASD. Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting {{and the degree of}} risk in the family environment.|$|E
5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational affix would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced <b>differently</b> in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written <b>differently</b> in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E
5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately. Different instruments often play <b>differently</b> in this respect due to the sensitivity of the bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out <b>differently</b> when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|E
