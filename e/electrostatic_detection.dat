40|$|We {{report a}} new {{experimental}} technique for Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) using the dissipation signal of frequency modulation {{atomic force microscopy}} for bias voltage feedback. It features a simple implementation and faster scanning as it requires no low frequency modulation. The dissipation {{is caused by the}} oscillating electrostatic force that is coherent with the tip oscillation, which is induced by a sinusoidally oscillating voltage applied between the tip and sample. We analyzed the effect of the phase of the oscillating force on the frequency shift and dissipation and found that the relative phase of 90 ^∘ that causes only the dissipation is the most appropriate for KPFM measurements. The present technique requires a significantly smaller ac voltage amplitude by virtue of enhanced force detection due to the resonance enhancement and the use of fundamental flexural mode oscillation for <b>electrostatic</b> force <b>detection.</b> This feature will be of great importance in the electrical characterizations of technically relevant materials whose electrical properties are influenced by the externally applied electric field {{as is the case in}} semiconductor electronic devices.

In this unique side-coupled `T' geometry for transport, we predict a novel mechanism for detecting Rabi oscillations induced in the dot through quantum, rather than <b>electrostatic</b> means. This <b>detection</b> shows up as a field-tunable {{split in the}} Fano lineshape arising due to interference between the dipole coupled dot states and the channel continuum. The split is further modified by the Coulomb interactions within the dot that influence the detuning of the Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, time-resolving the signal we see clear beats when the Rabi frequencies approach the intrinsic Bohr frequencies in the dot. Capturing these coupled dynamics, including memory effects and quantum interference in the channel and the many-body effects in the dot requires coupling a Fock-space master equation for the dot dynamics with the phase-coherent, non-Markovian time-dependent non-equilibrium Green's function (TDNEGF) transport formalism in the channel through a properly evaluated self-energy and a Coulomb integral. The strength of the interactions can further be modulated using a backgate that controls the degree of hybridization and charge polarization at the transistor surface.

The activation energies increased with increasing niobium concentration up to 75 at. pct. niobium then decreased. The peaks were broader than expected for single Debye peaks.

40|$|Microwave {{near-field}} probes (MNPs) confine evanescent {{fields to}} regions that are substantially {{smaller than the}} wavelength at the operation frequency. Such probes are able to resolve subwavelength features, thus providing resolution {{much higher than the}} classical Abbé limit. These abilities of MNPs are primarily due to the evanescent nature of the field generated {{at the tip of the}} probes. In the past, MNPs with ultra-high resolution were designed by tapering a resonant opening to provide high field concentration and high sensitivity. The limitations of these MNPs were subject to low surface roughness and practical realization challenges due to their geometrical features and vibration control constraints. Metamaterials with their ability to enhance evanescent fields, lead to the speculation that they could potentially increase the sensitivity of near-field probe. Periodically arranged metamaterial unit elements such as split-ring-resonators (SRRs) can create negative permeability media. Placing such material layer in the proximity of a probe leads to enhancement of the evanescent waves. Guided by this remarkable feature of metamaterials, I proposed an MNP consisting of a wire loop concentric with a single SRR. The evanescent field behavior of the probe is analyzed using Fourier analysis revealing substantial enhancement of the evanescent field consistent with metamaterial theory predictions. The resolution of the probe is studied to especially determine its ability for sub-surface detection of media buried in biological tissues. The underlying physics governing the probe is analyzed. Variations of the probe are developed by placement of lumped impedance loads. To further increase the field confinement to smaller region, a miniaturized probe design is proposed. This new probe consists of two printed loops whose resonance is tunable by a capacitor loaded in the inner loop. The sensing region is decreased from λ/ 20 to λ/ 55, where λ is the wavelength of the probe’s unloaded frequency. The magnetic-sensitive nature of the new probe makes it suitable for sensing localized magnetostatic surface resonance (LMSR) occurring in electrically very small particles. Therefore, I proposed a sensing methodology for detecting localized magnetostatic surface (LMS) resonant particles. In this methodology, an LMS resonant sphere is placed concentrically with the loops. A circuit model is developed to predict the performance of the probe in the presence of a magnetic sphere having Lorentz dispersion. Full-wave simulations are carried out to verify the circuit model predictions, and preliminary experimental results are demonstrated. The Lorentzian fit in this work implies that the physical nature of LMSR may originate from spin movement of charged particle whose contribution to effective permeability may be analogous to that of bound electron movement to effective permittivity in <b>electrostatic</b> resonance. <b>Detection</b> of LMSR can have strong impact on marker-based sensing applications in biomedicine and bioengineering. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} engineering of carbon nanotube electronic devices using {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) based techniques. A possible application for such devices is an electronic interface with individual biological molecules. This single molecule biosensing application is explored both experimentally and with computational modeling. 	Scanning probe microscopy techniques, such as AFM, are ideal to study nanoscale electronics. These techniques employ a probe which is raster scanned above a sample while measuring probe-surface interactions {{as a function of}} position. In addition to topographical and electrostatic/magnetic surface characterization, the probe may also be used as a tool to manipulate and engineer at the nanoscale. 	Nanoelectronic devices built from carbon nanotubes exhibit many exciting properties including one-dimensional electron transport. A natural consequence of one-dimensional transport is that a single perturbation along the conduction channel can have extremely large effects on the device's transport characteristics. This property may be exploited to produce electronic sensors with single-molecule resolution. 	Here we use AFM-based engineering to fabricate atomic-sized transistors from carbon nanotube network devices. This is done through the incorporation of point defects into the carbon nanotube sidewall using voltage pulses from an AFM probe. We find that the incorporation of an oxidative defect leads to a variety of possible electrical signatures including sudden switching events, resonant scattering, and breaking of the symmetry between electron and hole transport. We discuss the relationship between these different electronic signatures and the chemical structure/charge state of the defect. Tunneling through a defect-induced Coulomb barrier is modeled with numerical Verlet integration of Schrodinger's equation and compared with experimental results. 	Atomic-sized transistors are ideal for single-molecule applications due to their sensitivity to electric fields with very small detection volumes. In this work we demonstrate these devices as single-molecule sensors to detect individual N-(3 -Dimethylaminopropyl) -N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) molecules in an aqueous environment. An exciting application of these sensors is to study individual macromolecules participating in biological reactions, or undergoing conformational change. However, it is unknown whether the associated <b>electrostatic</b> signals exceed <b>detection</b> limits. We report calculations which reveal that enzymatic processes, such as substrate binding and internal protein dynamics, are detectable at the single-molecule level using existing atomic-sized transistors. 	Finally, we demonstrate the use of AFM-based engineering to control the function of nanoelectronic devices without creating a point defect in the sidewall of the nanotube. With a biased AFM probe we write charge patterns on a silicon dioxide surface in close proximity to a carbon nanotube device. The written charge induces image charges in the nearby electronics, and can modulate the Fermi level in a nanotube by ± 1 eV. We use this technique to induce a spatially controlled doping charge pattern in the conduction channel, and thereby reconfigure a field-effect transistor into a pn junction. Other simple charge patterns could be used to create other devices. The doping charge persists for days and can be erased and rewritten, offering a new tool for prototyping nanodevices and optimizing electrostatic doping profiles...|$|R
