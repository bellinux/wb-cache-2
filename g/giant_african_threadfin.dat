50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>African</b> <b>threadfin</b> (Polydactylus quadrifilis) is a {{fish species}} in the family Polynemidae. It is native to coastal parts of the East Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola, also ranging into {{freshwater}} rivers. This fish supports important fisheries and can reach up to 2 m in length.|$|E
50|$|Ranging {{in length}} from 20 cm in the black-finned {{threadfin}} (Polydactylus nigripinnis) to 200 cm in fourfinger threadfins (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and <b>giant</b> <b>African</b> <b>threadfins</b> (Polydactylus quadrifilis), threadfins are both important to commercial fisheries {{as a food}} fish, and popular among anglers. Their habit of forming large schools makes the threadfins a reliable and economic catch.|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), <b>Giant</b> <b>African</b> <b>threadfins</b> (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|R

The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|R

40|$|The {{spread of}} the <b>giant</b> <b>African</b> snail (Achatina fulica) across the Pacific islands is still causing concern because it feeds on, and destroys, {{a wide range of}} crops and {{ornamental}} plants. Already present in 11 Pacific countries and territories, the <b>giant</b> <b>African</b> snail was detected most recently in Western Samoa towards the end of 1995 and in Tuvalu in May 1996. However, early detection and swift action taken by staff from the Agricultural Department working with the South Pacific Commission has resulted in eradication of the snail from the island of Vaitupu. It appears that the <b>giant</b> <b>African</b> snail spreads into new territories by hitching a lift on imported second-hand goods such as vehicles and machinery. It is essential for countries free of the pest to be particularly vigilant when importing these goods from countries where the <b>giant</b> <b>African</b> snail is already established and strict quarantine procedures should be followed. If the snail is detected, action must be taken quickly to prevent it from spreading. So far, there are no biological control agents effective against the <b>giant</b> <b>African</b> snail. Predatory snails were introduced to some areas but they were found to destroy populations of harmless indigenous snails. Chemical bait in the form of pellets (Blitzem) may be effective but must be used with care because the bait can affect people and domestic animals, and it can contaminate water supplies. Effective eradication requires community effort to search, collect and kill each snail by burning or by immersing in sea water. Clearing rubbish heaps and weeds also reduces the breeding sites of the snail. The South Pacific Commission calls for regional cooperation to prevent the further spread of this destructive pest.
