5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's <b>diffused</b> lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the <b>diffused</b> lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E

40|$|Along {{with total}} {{radiation}} received, {{the proportion of}} <b>diffuse</b> to direct solar radiation can influence forest photosynthesis and carbon cycling. However, tropical <b>diffuse</b> radiation regimes are poorly described, and to date there are few or no site-based or regional <b>diffuse</b> radiation datasets. The relationship between cloud fraction and <b>diffuse</b> solar radiation was investigated using data from two sites in western and eastern Amazonia. Radiation regimes for <b>diffuse</b> and total radiation were characterised for each site, and the variation in clear sky <b>diffuse</b> radiation fraction between wet and dry season demonstrated and quantified, {{as well as the}} dependence of <b>diffuse</b> radiation on cloud amount. Using high frequency measurements of <b>diffuse</b> and total solar radiation data from the two sites, and estimated top of the canopy clear-sky radiation, a number of alternative models to predict <b>diffuse</b> radiation fraction from cloud fraction were formulated and tested. Results showed that cloud fraction can be approximated using the relationship between observed and calculated top of canopy radiation, after which <b>diffuse</b> radiation can then be predicted from cloud fraction. We also demonstrate that satellite cloud data (from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) can be used as inputs to the <b>diffuse</b> radiation model to provide estimates of annual and monthly <b>diffuse</b> radiation proportion.

40|$|The Rappaport {{classification}} of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomata {{was applied to}} 460 cases at the Princess Margaret Hospital. Statistically {{significant differences in the}} numerical incidence between the nodular and <b>diffuse</b> patterns was found for the entire series and for the lymphocytic, "histiocytic" and mixed cell types individually. All of the undifferentiated types were <b>diffuse.</b> These differences were sustained for the degrees of differentiation within the lymphocytic group. The "histiocytic" group was not subclassified by differentiation. The cell types differed in the numerical distribution of the patterns. The lymphocytics were predominantly <b>diffuse</b> but their nodular forms constituted a higher proportion of the nodular pattern than did their <b>diffuse</b> types of the <b>diffuse</b> group. More of the well differentiated lymphocytics were nodular than were <b>diffuse</b> and they formed a higher proportion of the nodular group than they did of the <b>diffuse.</b> On the other hand, the poorly differentiated lymphocytics were predominantly <b>diffuse</b> and these were less well represented in the nodular group than in the <b>diffuse</b> tumours. The intermediate differentiated types were usually <b>diffuse</b> but slightly better represented in the nodular group. Most tumours of the "histiocytic" type were <b>diffuse</b> and these constituted a higher proportion of <b>diffuse</b> than the nodular tumours. The mixed cell lesions were predominantly nodular and comprised a much higher proportion of nodular lesions than <b>diffuse.</b> No real differences were identified amongst the histological types according to age or sex distributions. The crude survival to 4 years differed significantly for the histological types. For the entire series and for each cellular type, the nodular patterns were superior to the <b>diffuse,</b> although, in the lymphocytic well differentiated types, pattern made no real difference to survival...|$|R

Different likelihood functions can be adopted for {{the estimation of}} parameters in time series models with <b>diffuse</b> initial conditions. In this paper we consider profile, <b>diffuse</b> and marginal likelihood functions. The marginal likelihood {{is defined as the}} likelihood function of a transformation of the data vector. The transformation is not unique. The <b>diffuse</b> likelihood is a marginal likelihood for a specific data transformation that may depend on parameters. Therefore, the <b>diffuse</b> likelihood can not be used generally for parameter estimation. Our newly proposed marginal likelihood function is based on an orthonormal transformation that does not depend on parameters. Likelihood functions for state space models are evaluated using the Kalman filter. The <b>diffuse</b> Kalman filter is specifically designed for computing the <b>diffuse</b> likelihood function. We show that a modification of the <b>diffuse</b> Kalman filter is needed for the evaluation of our proposed marginal likelihood function. <b>Diffuse</b> and marginal likelihood functions have better small sample properties compared to the profile likelihood function for the estimation of parameters in linear time series models.
