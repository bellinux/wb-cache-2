25|$|An {{estimated}} 12,900 new {{cervical cancer}}s and 4,100 cervical cancer deaths {{will occur in}} the United States in 2015. In the United States, it is the eight-most common cancer of women. The median age at diagnosis is 48. Hispanic women are {{significantly more likely to}} be diagnosed with cervical cancer than the general population. In 1998, about 12,800 women were diagnosed in the US and about 4,800 died. In 2014, an estimated 12,360 new cases were expected to be diagnosed, and about 4,020 were expected to die of cervical cancer. Among cancers of the female reproductive tract it is less common than endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. The rates of new cases in the United States was 7 per 100,000 women in 2004. Cervical cancer deaths decreased by approximately 74% in the last 50 years, largely due to widespread Pap smear screening. The annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of cervical cancer prevention and treatment prior to introduction of the HPV vaccine was estimated at $6 billion.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Maxillofacial trauma due {{to motor}} vehicle {{accidents}} had increased the clinical burden {{of health care}} institutions. Economic evaluation on the management of maxillofacial trauma had been studied in many countries. Information related to the factors associated {{with the cost of}} managing maxillofacial trauma is worth explored. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of managing maxillofacial trauma caused by motor vehicle accidents and the associated factors. Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 73 participants treated for maxillofacial trauma due to motor vehicle accidents at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from 1 st January 2010 to 31 st December 2010. The outcome variable was total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> consisted of the sum of macro-cost and micro-cost. The association between total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> and study factors (socio-demographic factors, mode of injury and clinical characteristics) were analyzed using general linear regression. Box-Cox transformation was used to transform total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> in the regression analysis. Results: The median total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> was RM 5, 899. 51 and ranged from RM 82 to RM 1. 5 million. The average cost per-person was RM 58, 398. 20. The cost consisted 97. 3 and 2. 7 percent of macro-cost and micro-cost respectively. Factors significantly associated with the transformed total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> were the length of stay in hospital (regression coefficient 0. 08, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03, 0. 12; P= 0. 001), number of facial soft tissue injury (regression coefficient - 1. 08, 95 % confidence interval - 1. 78, - 0. 38; P= 0. 003) and number of maxillofacial fracture (regression coefficient 1. 64, 95 % confidence interval 0. 44, 2. 84; P= 0. 008). Length of stay was found interacted with other significant factors. The cost associated with length of stay was different in each number of maxillofacial fracture and soft tissue injury. Conclusion: In conclusion, length of stay in hospital, number of maxillofacial fracture and number of facial soft tissue injury were significantly associated with total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of managing maxillofacial trauma caused by motor vehicle accident...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{economic}} impact of Lyme disease (LD), the most common vectorborne inflammatory disease in the United States, cost data were collected in 5 counties of the Maryland Eastern Shore from 1997 to 2000. Patients were divided into 5 diagnosis groups, clinically defined early-stage LD, clinically defined late-stage LD, suspected LD, tick bite, and other related complaints. From 1997 to 2000, the mean per patient <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of early-stage LD decreased from $ 1, 609 to $ 464 (p< 0. 05), and the mean per patient <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of late-stage LD decreased from $ 4, 240 to $ 1, 380 (p< 0. 05).

This study aimed {{to better understand the}} economic burden of influenza-related hospitalizations among patients in China in different age and risk categories. Methods: Laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations between December 2009 and June 2011 from three hospitals participating in the Chinese Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) sentinel surveillance system were included in this study. Hospital billing data were collected from each hospital’s Hospital Information System (HIS) and divided into five cost categories. Demographic and clinical information was collected from medical records. Mean (range) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) costs were calculated and compared among children (# 15 years), adults (16 – 64 years) and elderly ($ 65 years) groups.

40|$|Up to now, costs {{attributable}} to adverse events (AEs) and preventable AEs in the Netherlands were unknown. We assessed the total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with AEs and preventable AEs in Dutch hospitals to gain insight in opportunities for cost savings. Trained nurses and physicians retrospectively reviewed 7, 926 patient records in 21 hospitals. Additional patient information of 7, 889 patients was {{received from the}} Dutch registration of hospital information. <b>Direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> {{attributable to}} AEs were assessed by measuring excess length of stay and additional medical procedures after an AE occurred. Costs were valued using Dutch standardized cost prices. The annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> in Dutch hospitals were estimated at a total of euro 355 million for all AEs and euro 161 million for preventable AEs in 2004. The total number of hospital admissions in which a preventable AE occurred was 30, 000 (2. 3 % of all admissions) and more than 300, 000 (over 3 % of all bed days) bed days were attributable to preventable AEs in 2004. Multilevel analysis showed that variance in <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> was not determined by differences between hospitals or hospital departments. The estimates of the total preventable <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of AEs indicate that they form a substantial part (1 %) of the expenses of the national health care budget and are of importance to hospital management. The cost driver of the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> is the excess length of stay (including readmissions) in a hospital. Insight in which determinants are associated with high preventable costs will offer useful information for policymakers and hospital management to determine starting points for interventions to reduce the costs of preventable AE...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} pneumonia by COPD status and the excess cost of inpatient primary pneumonia in elders with COPD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, longitudinal study using claims linked to eligibility/demographic data for a 5 % sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2005 through 2007. METHODS: Incidence rates of pneumonia were calculated for elders with and without COPD and for elders with COPD and coexistent congestive heart failure (CHF). Propensity-score matching with multivariate generalized linear regression was used to {{estimate the}} excess <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of inpatient primary pneumonia in elders with COPD as compared with elders with COPD but without a pneumonia hospitalization. RESULTS: Elders with COPD had nearly six-times the incidence of pneumonia compared with elders without COPD (167. 6 / 1000 person-years versus 29. 5 / 1000 person-years; RR= 5. 7, p < 0. 01); RR increased to 8. 1 for elders with COPD and CHF compared with elders without COPD. The incidence of inpatient primary pneumonia among elders with COPD was 54. 2 / 1000 person-years compared with 7 / 1000 person-years for elders without COPD; RR= 7. 7, p< 0. 01); RR increased to 11. 0 for elders with COPD and CHF compared with elders without COPD. The one-year excess <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of inpatient pneumonia in COPD patients was $ 22, 697 ($ 45, 456 in cases vs. $ 22, 759 in controls (p < 0. 01)); 70. 2 % of this cost was accrued during the quarter of the index hospitalization.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the incidence and the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young persons in California and each of its 58 counties, and to better inform discussions about statewide policies and local resources needed for STI prevention and control efforts. Methods: On the basis of the methods developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we estimated the statewide number of new cases of eight major STIs among young persons aged 15 to 24 years in California in 2005 : chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, genital herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B, trichomoniasis, and HIV. We also calculated the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of these STIs using national cost-per-case estimates. To inform local policy discussions about STI control efforts, the statewide estimates were allocated by county. Results: An estimated 1. 1 million new cases of STIs occurred among young persons in California in 2005, with a <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of $ 1. 1 billion. The estimated number of new cases within counties ranged from a low of 82 in Alpine and Sierra counties, at a cost of $ 38, 000, to a high of about 360, 000 in Los Angeles County, at a cost of $ 390 million. Conclusions: These estimates illustrate the widespread and frequently underreported incidence and costs of youth STIs in California and its counties, and provide the foundation for a comprehensive assessment of youth STI prevention needs...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{quantify}} {{the financial burden}} of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection and its complications in a cost-of-illness study in Vietnam, a highly endemic country of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. METHODS: The study adopted the micro-costing approach. For <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> estimation, data were retrieved retrospectively from medical histories of inpatients and outpatients with various CHB infection stages in 2008 from a large referral hospital in Vietnam. For direct nonmedical and indirect cost estimation, data were obtained from outpatients from the same hospital through face-to-face interviews. One- and two-way analyses were performed on the cost calculated. RESULTS: In 2008, {{the total cost of}} CHB infection and its complications was estimated to be around US$ 10 billion, with 80 % contributable to <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost.</b> Antivirals were the major cost driver in treating CHB infections. The per-patient total annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> increased with the severity of the disease with the cost amounted to US$ 943. 64 for CHB and US$ 3916. 21 for hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on the results, if all Vietnamese patients received treatment for CHB infections, the estimated cost would be twice as much as the total health budget of Vietnam, highlighting that a significant proportion of CHB infections in Vietnam are not being treated, and the patients are bearing the extra cost out-of-pocket, or seeking treatment from traditional medicines. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that chronic HBV infection poses an unbearable financial burden for the average patient with a GDP per capita of around $ 1024, and the lack of access to treatment is a social issue in Vietnam. Although universal newborns vaccination against HBV has been implemented {{to reduce the number of}} infected subjects, more health-care investment to improve access and provision of affordable medications by re-examining pharmaceutical policies to attain equity in proper treatment for patients with CHB infections would be needed...|$|E

Objective: To determine the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of serious NSAID-related ulcer complications. Method: An observational cost-of-illness study was conducted in a large general hospital serving a population of 152 989 persons. From November 2001 to December 2003 all consecutive patients hospitalised with serious NSAID-related ulcer complications were identified. Serious NSAID-related ulcer complications were defined as ulcerations of the stomach or proximal duodenum causing perforation, obstruction or bleeding that occurred during the use of NSAIDs, necessitating hospitalisation of the patient. Data were retrieved with respect to days hospitalised and the number and type of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The main outcome measure was estimated mean <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of resources used. Results: A total of 104 patients were hospitalised with serious NSAID-related ulcer complications (incidence 31. 4 per 100 000 persons per year). Most patients were elderly (mean 70. 4 years, SD 16. 7). In-hospital mortality was 10. 6 %. Mean <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> were epsilon 8375 (95 % CI 7067, 10 393).

Noting the disproportionate burden of care associated with septic hip revision surgery, he recommended that a method for case sharing should be established by medical centers that are best equipped to care for these patients, and that reimbursement to both hospitals and physicians should more realistically adapted to the magnitude of resources consumed by these patients. <b>Direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with revision THA due to infection were 2.2 times higher than those for aseptic loosening in our study. This finding is in accordance with those described previously by other authors. Hebert et al. [16] reported that the surgical treatment of patients with an infection after TKA was approximately twice as expensive as that required for revision TKA because of aseptic loosening, whereas Bozic [6] reported that total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with revision THA due to infection were 2.8 times higher than the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with revision THA due to aseptic loosening. In this regard {{it should be noted that}} calculating the costs of two-stage versus one-stage aseptic revision is not just a matter of “two procedures versus one.” While septic cases may require more extensive and lengthy surgery and costlier medical treatment, the first-stage procedure is less expensive than a reimplantation procedure (the cost of the spacer, even if it is a preformed, off-the-shelf device, is much less than the cost of a revision prosthesis; the surgical time needed to implant a spacer is often less that that required to implant the revision femoral and acetabular prosthesis, etc.).|$|R
40|$|Aim: To develop {{models to}} {{estimate}} the direct medical costs associated with diabetes-related complicationsin the event year and in subsequent years. Methods: The public direct medical costs associated with 13 diabetes-related complications were estimated among a cohort of 128 353 people with diabetes over 5 years. Private direct medical costs were estimated from a cross-sectional survey among 1825 people with diabetes. We used panel data regression with fixed effects to investigate the impact of each complication on direct medical costs in the event year and subsequent years, adjusting for age and co-existing complications. Results: The expected annual public <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> for the baseline case was US$ 1, 521 (95 % CI 1, 518 to 1, 525) or a 65 -year-old person with diabetes without complications. A new lower limb ulcer {{was associated with the}} biggest increase, with a multiplier of 9. 38 (95 % CI 8. 49 to 10. 37). New end-stage renal disease and stroke increased the annual medical cost by 5. 23 (95 % CI 4. 70 to 5. 82) and 5. 94 (95 % CI 5. 79 to 6. 10) times, respectively. History of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease and lower limb ulcer increased the cost by 2 - 3 times. The expected annual private <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of the baseline case was US$ 187 (95 % CI 135 to 258) for a 65 -year-old man without complications. Heart disease, stroke, sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy and end-stage renal disease increased the private medical costs by 1. 5 to 2. 5 times. Conclusions: Wide variations in <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> in event year and subsequent years across different major complications were observed.

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: To {{estimate}} the total financial burden of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for Vietnam by quantifying the direct medical, the direct nonmedical, and indirect costs among patients with {{various stages of}} chronic HBV infection. Methods: <b>Direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> data were retrieved retrospectively from medical histories of inpatients and outpatients in 2008 from a large referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Direct nonmedical and indirect costs data were obtained from face-to-face interviews of outpatients from the same hospital. The treatment cost per patient per chronic HBV infection stage was multiplied by the total estimated patients in Vietnam to get {{the total cost of}} illness for the nation. Results: Nationally, the total cost attributable to chronic HBV infection and its complications in 2008 was estimated to be approximately US $ 4. 4 billion, with the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> accounting for about 70 % of that estimate. The cost of antivirals was the major cost driver in treating chronic HBV infection. The per-patient total annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> increased with the severity of the disease, with the estimated costs for chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma as US $ 450. 35 and US $ 1883. 05, respectively. When compared with the 2008 per-capita gross domestic product of ∼US $ 1024, the financial burden of treating chronic HBV infection is very high in Vietnam. Conclusions: This study confirmed that chronic HBV infection poses a significant financial burden for the average patient and that lacking treatment would become a social issue in Vietnam. Although HBV vaccination has been universally implemented, more health care investment and the greater availability of affordable medications are still needed to attain equity in proper treatment for patients with HBV infection...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} healthcare resource utilization and {{the economic}} burden associated with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Thailand METHODS: This study included patients diagnosed with wet AMD that were 60 years old or older, and had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured at least two times during the follow-up period. We excluded patients having other eye diseases. Two separate sub-studies were conducted. The first sub-study was a retrospective cohort study; electronic medical charts were reviewed to estimate the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs.</b> The second sub-study was a cross-sectional survey estimating the direct non-medical costs based on face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. For the first sub-study, <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs,</b> including the cost of drugs, laboratory, procedures, and other treatments were obtained. For the second sub-study, direct non-medical costs, e. g. transportation, food, accessories, home renovation, and caregiver costs, were obtained from face-to-face interviews with patients and/or caregivers. RESULTS: For the first sub-study, sixty-four medical records were reviewed. The annual average number of medical visits was 11. 1 ± 6. 0. The average <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> were $ 3 604 ± 4 530 per year. No statistically-significant differences of the average <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> among the BCVA groups were detected (P= 0. 98). Drug costs accounted for 77 % of total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs.</b> For <b>direct</b> non-medical costs, 67 patients were included. Forty-eight patients (71. 6 %) required the accompaniment of a person during the out-patient visit. Seventeen patients (25. 4 %) required a caregiver at home. The average direct non-medical cost was $ 2 927 ± 6 560 per year. There were no statistically-significant differences in the average costs among the BCVA groups (P= 0. 74). Care-giver cost accounted for 87 % of direct non-medical costs. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that wet AMD {{is associated with a}} substantial economic burden, especially concerning drug and care-giver costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{anogenital}} {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is estimated to}} be the most commonly occurring sexually transmitted infection in the US. Comprehensive estimates of the annual economic burden associated with the prevention and treatment of anogenital HPV-related disease in the US population are currently unavailable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to (i) outline an analytic framework from which to estimate the annual economic burden of preventing and treating anogenital HPV-related disease in the US; (ii) review available US literature concerning the annual economic burden of HPV; and (iii) highlight gaps in current knowledge where further study is particularly warranted. Among eight US studies identified that describe the annual economic burden pertaining to one or more aspects of anogenital HPV-related disease, three met the review eligibility criteria (published between 1990 and 2004, examined multiple facets of annual anogenital HPV-related economic burden, and clearly articulated the data and methods used in the estimation process). All costs were adjusted to 2004 $US. Estimates of the annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with cervical cancer were comparable across studies (range $US 300 - 400 million). In contrast, there was a wide range across studies for estimates of the annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (range $US 700 million-$US 2. 3 billion). Only one study reported <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> for anogenital warts ($US 200 million) and routine cervical cancer screening ($US 2. 3 billion). No studies examined <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> attributable to HPV-related anal, penile, vaginal or vulvar cancers, or the work and productivity losses resulting from time spent receiving medical care, morbidity or mortality. Current economic burden estimates would suggest annual <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with the prevention and treatment of anogenital warts and cervical HPV-related disease of at least $US 4 billion. This figure would likely rise to at least $US 5 billion per year if <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with other disease entities caused by the sexual transmission of HPV were included, with further additions to the economic burden totalling in the billions of dollars if work and productivity losses were incorporated, a research priority for future studies.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has the {{potential}} to become a major health concern and associated health care costs may become a significant economic burden on society. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> attributable to AD in patients aged ≥ 60 years in Taiwan from 2000 through 2002 and to explore the correlation of these costs with patients' age and sex. Methods: This study was based on the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program. The NHI program insures > 98 % of the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan. Detailed data were extracted from a random sample of 0. 2 % of inpatient and 5 % of outpatient recipients with AD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code 331. 0) who were aged ≥ 60 years and who received inpatient or outpatient services with claims from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2002. Duplicate charges for a specific patient and diagnoses of other types of dementia were excluded from this study. Results: A total of 69, 780 patients were found to have a diagnosis of AD. The <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> for outpatients were estimated at US $ 1. 2 million in 2000, US $ 1. 9 million in 2001, and US $ 2. 3 million in 2002; the costs for inpatient care were estimated at US $ 670, 000 in 2000, US $ 2. 4 million in 2001, and US $ 3. 2 million in 2002. The total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated at US $ 1. 86 million in 2000, US $ 4. 24 million in 2001, and US $ 5. 48 million in 2002. The increase of total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> was not significantly correlated with patients' age or sex. Conclusions: From 2000 through 2002, the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of AD increased annually in Taiwan among patients with AD aged ≥ 60 years. No significant correlation was found between increased total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> and sex or age.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{cases of}} breast cancer {{have been on the}} rise in Vietnam. To date, there has been no study on the {{financial}} burden of the disease. This study estimates the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of a 5 -year treatment course for women with primary breast cancer in central Vietnam. Methods: Retrospective patient-level data from medical records at the Hue Central Hospital between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Cost analysis was conducted from the health care payers&#x 2019; perspective. Various <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> categories were computed for a 5 -year treatment course for patients with breast cancer. Costs, in US dollars, discounted at a 3 % rate, were converted to 2010 after adjusting for inflation. For each cost category, the mean, standard deviation, median, and cost range were estimated. Median regression was used to investigate the relationship between costs and the stage, age at diagnosis, and the health insurance coverage of the patients. Results: The total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> for a 5 -year treatment course for breast cancer in central Vietnam was estimated at &#x 0024; 975 per patient (range: &#x 0024; 11. 7 &#x 2013;&#x 0024; 3, 955). The initial treatment cost, particularly the cost of chemotherapy, was found to account for the greatest proportion of total costs (64. 9 %). Among the patient characteristics studied, stage at diagnosis was significantly associated with total treatment costs. Patients at later stages {{of breast cancer}} did not differ significantly in their total costs from those at earlier stages however, but their survival time was much shorter. The absence of health insurance was the main factor limiting service uptake. Conclusion: From the health care payers&#x 2019; perspective, the Government subsidization of public hospital charges lowered the direct medical costs of a 5 -year treatment course for primary breast cancer in central Vietnam. However, the long treatment course was significantly influenced by out-of-pocket payments for patients without health insurance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hemoglobin E {{beta-thalassemia}} (β-thalassemia/Hb E) has {{a variable}} severity, {{and the cost}} of treatment has not been well studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the societal cost of caring for children with β-thalassemias in Thailand. The study was designed as a prevalence-based cost-of-illness analysis in a societal perspective. Medical records from three public hospitals of children aged 2 - 18 years with β-thalassemia/Hb E and homozygous β-thalassemia were reviewed for <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> determination. For direct non-medical cost and indirect cost, a family member was interviewed. Findings It was found that 201 patients with β-thalassemia/Hb E (91 %) and homozygous β-thalassemia (9 %) were recruited for this study. Ninety-two (46 %) were severe thalassemia and 109 (54 %) were mild to moderate severity. The annual average cost of treatment was US$ 950; 59 % was <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>cost,</b> 17 % direct non-medical cost, and 24 % indirect cost. The costs were differentiated by some potential predictors. Significant predictor variables were: hospital, health insurance scheme, blood transfusion pattern, and iron chelation drug use. Conclusions The average annual cost per patient was calculated, and the cost model was estimated. These would be applied for national planning, economic evaluation of treatment and prevention interventions, and budget impact analysis. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana and to question the healthcare payment system in Slovenia. Methods. Using an internal patient database, the costs of mCRC patients were estimated in 2009 by examining (1) mCRC <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> related <b>costs,</b> and (2) the cost difference between payment received by Slovenian health insurance and actual mCRC costs. Costs were analysed in the treatment phase of the disease by assessing the <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of hospital treatment with systemic therapy together with hospital treatment of side effects, without assessing radiotherapy or surgical treatment. Follow-up <b>costs,</b> indirect <b>medical</b> <b>costs,</b> and nonmedical costs were not included. Results. A total of 209 mCRC patients met all eligibility criteria. The <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of mCRC hospitalization with systemic therapy in Slovenia for 2009 were estimated as the cost of medications (cost of systemic therapy + cost of drugs for premedication) + labor cost (the cost of carrying out systemic treatment) + cost of lab tests + cost of imaging tests + KRAS testing cost + cost of hospital treatment due to side effects of mCRC treatment, and amounted to % 3, 914, 697. The difference between the cost paid by health insurance and actual <b>costs,</b> estimated as <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of hospitalization of mCRC patients treated with systemic therapy at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana in 2009, was % 1, 900, 757. 80. Conclusions. The costs paid to the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana by health insurance for treating mCRC with systemic therapy do not match the actual cost of treatment. In fact, the difference between the payment and the actual <b>cost</b> estimated as <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> of hospitalization of mCRC patients treated with systemic therapy at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana in 2009 was % 1, 900, 757. 80.

Aim: To estimate the incremental <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> associated with constipation in women. Methods: This is a nested case-control study. The study population consisted of all mothers of 5718 children in the population-based birth cohort born during 1976 – 1982 in a community. The cases presented to the medical facilities with constipation. The controls were randomly selected and matched to cases in a 2 : 1 ratio. <b>Direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> for constipated women and controls were collected for the years 1987 – 2002. Results: We identified 168 women with a diagnosis of constipation. The total <b>direct</b> <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> over the 15 -year period for constipated subjects were more than double those of controls [$ 63 591 (95 % CI: 49 786 – 81 396) vs. $ 24 529 (95 % CI: 20 667 – 29 260) ].
