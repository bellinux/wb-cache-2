A novel {{intumescent}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> {{low-density polyethylene}} (LDPE) composite was prepared based on bamboo fiber (BF) and silica-gel microencapsulated ammonium polyphosphate (MCAPP). The synergistic effects between BF and MCAPP on the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> and thermal properties of <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> LDPE composites were investigated. The {{results show that}} the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> properties of LDPE composites are influenced by the weight ratio of BF and MCAPP. The higher content of MCAPP, the better <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> property can be obtained. When the ratio of BF/MCAPP is 1 : 1, the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> LDPE composite shows excellent <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> properties...|$|R

5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|Brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E

5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats.
