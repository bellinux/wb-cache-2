25|$|The {{archetype}} was {{not merely}} a psychic entity, but more fundamentally, a bridge to matter in general. Jung used the term unus mundus to describe the unitary reality which he believed underlay all manifest phenomena.

25|$|Jackson {{used the}} {{knowledge}} argument, {{as well as}} other arguments, to establish a sort of dualism, according to which certain mental states, especially qualitative ones, are non-physical. The view that Jackson urged was a modest version of epiphenomenalism—the view that certain mental states are non-physical and, although caused to come into existence by physical events, do not then cause any changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{reaction}} to eschatological sensationalism - The millennial fervor of premillennialists {{as the year}} AD 500 was nearing caused them to have overly jovial celebrations (some septa-/sextamillennial interpreters calculated Jesus’s birth to have happened 5,500 years after creation). These feasts appeared to Augustine to take more pleasure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> than the spiritual. Such earthly revelry was repulsive to Augustine since he placed little value on the material world.|$|E
25|$|The stream-of-consciousness style {{being so}} {{prominent}} in this work, {{a summary of}} the plot based on physical action does not give a thorough understanding of the content of the work. In the novel, action occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> (i.e.: characters doing things, such as talking, walking etc.) is far outweighed by material existing in the thought and memory of the protagonists. Some discretion must be made in a plot summary as to which of these thoughts and memories warrant detailing.|$|E

25|$|Told in a first-person narrative, {{the story}} {{focuses on the}} author's {{discovery}} of the doubly fictional world of Tlön, whose inhabitants are completely idealistic and live imaginative lives. Relatively long for Borges (approximately 5,600 words), the story {{is a work of}} speculative fiction. One of the major themes of Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius is that ideas ultimately manifest themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> and the story is generally viewed as a parabolic discussion of Berkeleyan idealism, and to some degree as a protest against totalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|Classical physics draws a {{distinction}} between particles and waves. It also relies on continuity and determinism in natural phenomena. In the early twentieth century, newly discovered atomic and subatomic phenomena seemed to defy those conceptions. In 1925–1926, quantum mechanics was invented as a mathematical formalism that accurately describes the experiments, yet appears to reject those classical conceptions. Instead, it posits that probability, and discontinuity, are fundamental <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> Classical physics also relies on causality. The standing of causality for quantum mechanics is disputed.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other games developed by Blizzard, Hearthstone was an experimental game {{developed by a}} smaller team based on the appreciation of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any possible plays from an opponent during a player's turn and by replicating {{the feel of a}} physical card game within the game's user interface. Many of the concepts as well as art assets were based on those previously published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>World</b> of Warcraft Trading Card Game.|$|E

50|$|Dystopia {{takes place}} in a {{high-tech}} futuristic world spanned by computer networks.

25|$|God was displeased {{and called}} upon Hermes to create {{physical}} bodies that would imprison the souls as a punishment for them. Hermes created human bodies on earth, and God then told {{the souls of}} their punishment. God decreed that suffering would await them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> but he promised them that, if their actions on Earth were worthy of their divine origin, their condition would improve and they would eventually return to the heavenly world. If it did not improve, he would condemn them to repeated reincarnation upon Earth.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not qualia or {{consciousness}} {{can play}} any causal role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> {{remains an open}} question, with epiphenomenalism acknowledging the existence of qualia while denying it any causal power. The position has been criticized {{by a number of}} philosophers, if only because our own consciousness seem to be causally active. In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like interactionist dualism; or perhaps emergentism, the claim that there are as yet unknown causal relations between the mental and physical. This in turn would imply that qualia can be detected by an external agency through their causal powers.|$|E
25|$|One of Swedenborg's lesser-known works {{presents}} a startling claim: that the Last Judgment {{had begun in}} the previous year (1757) and was completed {{by the end of that}} year and that he had witnessed it. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Last Judgment took place not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell. The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E
25|$|The titular {{character}} of the series. Lain is a fourteen-year-old girl who uncovers her true nature through the series. She is first depicted as a shy junior high school student with few friends or interests. She later grows multiple bolder personalities, both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> and the Wired, and starts making more friends. As the series progresses, she eventually comes to discover that she is, in reality, merely an autonomous, sentient computer program in the physical and corporeal form of a human being, designed to sever the invisible barrier between the Wired and the real world. In the end, Lain is challenged to accept herself as a de facto goddess for the Wired, having become an omnipotent and omnipresent virtual being with worshipers of her own, {{as well as an}} ability to exist beyond the borders of devices, time, or space.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic Constructive is an {{exhibition}} of paintings and collages, both reflect the building and managing of synthetically constructed places and expose the human condition of struggle <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> and <b>the</b> emotional world. I view these works as synthetically created arenas that inform my understanding and experience of natural forces that cannot be rationalized or neatly ordered. Though inspired by and constructed from the imagery of the after effects of devastation they become more than that as they explore these relationships. It is important that these works, both as collages and as paintings, reflect the search and process of their creation...|$|R
25|$|Over time, the Egyptians {{developed}} {{more abstract}} {{perspectives on the}} creation process. By {{the time of the}} Coffin Texts, they described the formation of the world as the realization of a concept first developed within the mind of the creator god. The force of heka, or magic, which links things in the divine realm and things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> is the power that links the creator's original concept with its physical realization. Heka itself can be personified as a god, but this intellectual process of creation is not associated with that god alone. An inscription from the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BC), whose text may be much older, describes the process in detail and attributes it to the god Ptah, whose close association with craftsmen makes him a suitable deity to give a physical form to the original creative vision. Hymns from the New Kingdom describe the god Amun, a mysterious power that lies behind even the other gods, as the ultimate source of this creative vision.|$|E
25|$|Some Sunni {{scholars}} {{do believe}} in Raj’a, believing in the return of number of people such as Seven Sleepers synchronous {{with the appearance of}} the Mahdi. Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from the Shiites. According to his book The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels (Arabic: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet Muhammad over 70 times while he was awake. According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection. According to Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Arabi, known for his exegesis of the Sunan al-Tirmidhi, stated that seeing and hearing the prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.|$|E
25|$|Instead of her psychic knife, Psylocke {{began to}} {{manifest}} a telekinetic katana composed of raw psionic energy. At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did, short-circuiting the victim's nervous system on impact. At its highest level, the katana can slice through almost any physical matter. Psylocke's {{control over the}} katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious. Psylocke's telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> and so she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Psylocke herself. She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power-inhibitors imposed on others, despite her own lack of telepathy. With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task, she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors, without doing permanent damage to the subject in question. During the timeline shift known as House of M, Psylocke showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time. It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances.|$|E
