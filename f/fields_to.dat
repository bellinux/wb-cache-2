5|$|I-590 {{begins at}} a semi-directional T {{interchange}} with I-390 {{in the town}} of Brighton, a southern suburb of the city of Rochester. The route heads east from the junction, passing under South Clinton Avenue (which passes through the east half of the interchange but does not connect to either freeway) and traveling east through open <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> its first interchange (a diverging diamond interchange) at South Winton Road. Here, the surroundings rapidly change from <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> densely populated residential areas as it passes through a more developed section of Brighton. As it approaches NY31 (Monroe Avenue) at exit2, I-590 turns a full 90 degrees to the north. Past NY31, I-590 runs through the former Erie Canal and Rochester Subway bed.|$|E

5|$|Some species, such as {{electric}} eels, {{can produce}} powerful electric currents, {{strong enough to}} stun prey. Other fish, such as knifefish, generate weak varying electric <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> detect their prey; they swim with straight backs to avoid distorting their electric fields. These currents are produced by modified muscle or nerve cells.|$|E

5|$|After meeting M-43, the two {{trunklines}} run concurrently {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) before M-50 breaks off to the southwest near Woodbury. From there, the road continues in its southeasterly path along Clinton Trail through the northeast part of Eaton County as it runs through <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> Charlotte. Just prior to entering the city, the road bends {{to the south and}} near the middle of town it has a junction with M-79 and Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69). After this intersection, M-50 continues south concurrent with the business loop for a several blocks before turning eastward. On the eastern end of town, it has an interchange with I-69 at exit60.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E

5|$|Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during {{which time}} Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 {{images of the}} target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total {{exposure}} times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300nm), 33.5 hours (450nm), 30.3 hours (606nm) and 34.3 hours (814nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> aid follow-up observations by other instruments.|$|E
5|$|Dale walks {{alone in}} the <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> cool off when he comes across a cow that has had its stomach gutted. Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} head back when a walker attacks him. The group races towards his screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Chandler confronted {{his ex-wife}} June, who had custody of Jordan, with suspicions that their {{son had been}} in an {{inappropriate}} relationship with Jackson but June dismissed his worries. According to several sources, Chandler threatened {{to go public with}} the evidence he claimed he had on Jackson, who asked his lawyer Bert <b>Fields</b> <b>to</b> intervene. Chandler's lawyer, Barry K. Rothman, called psychiatrist Mathis Abrams and reported a situation of sexual molestation mirroring what his son had alleged.|$|E

5|$|In the fall, Hazen leveled {{charges of}} {{corruption}} and mismanagement against Isaac Tichenor, the deputy commissioner of purchases at Coös, General Bayley, the deputy quartermaster-general, and Matthew Lyons, the deputy commissioner of issues. His regiment were poorly supplied the whole summer at Coös, supplies of beef arrived spoiled, and Hazen had to send his men into the <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> help with the harvest so they could eat. Courts-martial were later held.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a {{standard}} fire mode, {{the ability to}} create force <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player {{to take advantage of the}} three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.|$|E

5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of Sakalava, Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were especially hard hit owing to their reputation as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping in the forests and <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> avoid falling victim to nighttime pillage and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E
5|$|When the Americans arrived, the British {{made every}} effort to include them in the athletics. Space was allotted on the sports <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> provide a {{football}} field and a baseball diamond. In short order, the division developed a baseball league that played 17 games during the summer of 1918. Texas won the division championship, but lost to a visiting team from American naval headquarters in London. Football games occurred throughout the fall.|$|E

5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E
5|$|After passing playing <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, {{a former}} street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Indies in early 1942, Oerip {{was held in}} a mixed prisoner of war camp in Cimahi. Upon his release {{three and a half}} months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese-backed police force and returned to KEM, where he and his wife rented paddy <b>fields</b> <b>to</b> grow rice while continuing to operate their flower garden. To protect their land, they surrounded their property and home with a high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including Abdul Haris Nasution and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 signified that Japan would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.|$|E
