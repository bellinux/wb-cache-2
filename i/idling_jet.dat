500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigated}} the accident. [...] Although {{the tail of}} the Delta DC-9 was several feet from the runway, the NTSB determined that DAL 379's engines were still operating at idle when Flight 159 attempted to take off, and DAL 379's <b>idling</b> <b>jet</b> engines were directing hot jet exhaust over the runway. The NTSB determined that neither Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations nor the Terminal Air Traffic Control Procedures Manual defined the phrase [...] "clear of the runway," [...] and found that the pilots of each plane and the air traffic controller each had their own slightly different definition of the term. The NTSB concluded that DAL 379 was not actually [...] "clear of the runway" [...] because its jet exhaust continued to pose a hazard to aircraft attempting to use runway 27L.|$|E
5000|$|To {{control the}} amount of fuel/air mix {{entering}} the engine, a simple butterfly valve (throttle plate) is generally fitted {{at the start of}} the intake manifold (just below the carburetor in carbureted engines). The butterfly valve is simply a circular disc fitted on a spindle, fitting inside the pipe work. It is connected to the accelerator pedal of the car, and is set to be fully open when the pedal is fully depressed and fully closed when the pedal is released. The butterfly valve often contains a small [...] "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own <b>idle</b> <b>jet.</b>|$|R
50|$|CODAG Water jet And Refined Propeller, {{a system}} {{developed}} by Blohm + Voss as option for their MEKO line of ships, also falls {{in this category}} but avoids the above-mentioned problems. CODAG WARP uses two diesel engines to drive two propellers in a CODAD arrangement, i.e. both shafts can also be powered by any single engine, and a centerline water jet powered by a gas turbine. The <b>idling</b> water <b>jet</b> doesn't cause drag and since its nozzle can be placed further aft and higher it doesn't affect {{the size of the}} propellers.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to develop fundamental understanding {{of the process of}} deposition of complex mixtures by the inkjet method. The rheological properties and DOD drop formation dynamics of carbon black pigmented inkjet inks were investigated. It was found that the suspension microstructure responses to bulk motions, leading to shear rate and time dependent shear viscosity. However, DOD drop formation dynamics of highly pigmented inkjet ink and pure Newtonian fluid is similar even though shear rate up to 105 s- 1 exists during inkjet jetting process. A proposed explanation for these observations is that the shearing time during DOD drop ejection is insufficient for changing and stabilizing the microstructure of the suspension. The effects of signal amplitude and jetting frequency on DOD drop formation dynamics of pure Newtonian fluids were investigated. A transition of DOD drop formation dynamics when the inkjet nozzle is switched from <b>idle</b> to <b>jetting</b> was identified. A qualitative investigation of DOD drop impaction and post-impaction behavior on inkjet paper and textiles was carried out. Dynamics of DOD drop accumulation and spreading on the substrates and final ink distribution show drastic differences between these two substrates. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Wallace W.
