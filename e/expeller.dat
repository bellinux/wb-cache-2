2500|$|Oils are {{extracted}} from nuts, seeds, olives, grains or legumes by extraction using industrial chemicals or by mechanical processes. [...] <b>Expeller</b> pressing is a chemical-free process that collects oils {{from a source}} using a mechanical press with minimal heat. Cold-pressed oils are extracted under a controlled temperature setting usually below [...] intended to preserve naturally occurring phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, plant sterols and vitamin E which collectively affect color, flavor, aroma and nutrient value.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} step of extraction, the oil must be {{separated}} {{from the rest of the}} algae. The simplest method is mechanical crushing. When algae is dried it retains its oil content, which then can be [...] "pressed" [...] out with an oil press. Different strains of algae warrant different methods of oil pressing, including the use of screw, <b>expeller</b> and piston. Many commercial manufacturers of vegetable oil use a combination of mechanical pressing and chemical solvents in extracting oil. This use is often also adopted for algal oil extraction.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effects of combinations of three temperatures and storage times on chemical composition, fatty acid profile, and oxidative stability of canola <b>expellers</b> obtained from the cold-pressing extraction of oil. Canola seeds were single-crushed at moderate temperatures (60 °C) during 3 pressing sessions. Nine samples (100 ± 1 g) of each session were collected, inserted into sealed bags, stored at three temperatures (12, 24, 36 °C) over 3 periods of time (10, 20, 30 d). Then, samples (100 ± 1 g) of canola seeds collected before each pressing session and canola <b>expellers</b> collected before and after each storage time were analyzed for chemical composition, fatty acid profile, peroxide number and Kreis test. Before storage, the fatty acid profile of canola seeds and <b>expellers</b> differed significantly, except for myristic (P= 0. 18), palmitic (P= 0. 57), oleic (P= 0. 07), and α-linolenic acids (P= 0. 45). Compared to canola seeds, <b>expellers</b> showed greater content of saturated, poly-unsaturated, and n- 6 fatty acids (P< 0. 01), but a lower content of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (P< 0. 01). Peroxide values were definitely (P< 0. 01) greater for <b>expellers</b> and averaged 4. 22 and 4. 11 mEq/kg fat before and after storage, respectively. The Kreis test was negative for all samples. Under different temperatures and times of storage, canola <b>expellers</b> showed to maintain a good oxidative stability, as highlighted by low peroxide values (< 10 mEq/kg fat) and negative response for Kreis test. Canola <b>expellers</b> obtained by on-farm cold extraction, despite great oil residual (from 17 to 19 % ether extracts on dry matter basis), can be stored at farm without significant chemical and nutritional changes...|$|R
60|$|My theory {{connecting}} Apollo Smintheus and the place-names {{derived from}} mice {{with a possible}} prehistoric mouse-totem gave me, I confess, considerable satisfaction. But in Mr. Frazer's Golden Bough (ii. 129- 132) is published a group of cases in which mice and other vermin are worshipped for prudential reasons--to get them to go away. In the Classical Review (vol. vi. 1892) Mr. Ward Fowler quotes Aristotle and AElian on plagues of mice, like the recent invasion of voles on the Border sheep-farms. He adopts {{the theory that the}} sacred mice were adored by way of propitiating them. Thus Apollo may be connected with mice, not as a god who superseded a mouse-totem, but as an <b>expeller</b> of mice, like the worm-killing Heracles, and the Locust-Heracles, and the Locust-Apollo. {81a} The locust is still painted red, salaamed to, and set free in India, by way of propitiating his companions. {81b} Thus the Mouse-Apollo (Smintheus) would be merely a god noted for his usefulness in getting rid of mice, and any worship given to mice (feeding them, placing their images on altars, their stamp on coins, naming places after them, and so on) would be mere acts of propitiation.|$|E

The oil seeps through small openings that do not allow seed fiber solids to pass through. Afterward, the pressed seeds are formed into a hardened cake, which is removed from the machine. Pressure involved in <b>expeller</b> pressing creates heat in the range of 140 - 210 F.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of palm kernel <b>expellers</b> on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood profiles of weaned pigs. A total of 88 weaned pigs (6. 94 ± 0. 76 kg body weight [BW]; 28 d old) were randomly allotted to 2 dietary treatments (4 pigs/pen; 11 replicates/treatment) in a randomized complete block design (sex as a block). The dietary treatments were a typical nursery diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON) and CON added with 20 % of palm kernel <b>expellers</b> (PKE). Pigs were fed for 6 wk using a 3 -phase feeding program with declining diet complexity and with phases of 1, 2, and 3 wk, respectively. Blood was collected from randomly selected 2 pigs in each pen before weaning and on d 7 after weaning. Pigs were fed respective dietary treatments containing 0. 2 % chromic oxide from d 29 to 35 after weaning. Fecal samples were collected from randomly selected 2 pigs in each pen daily for the last 3 days after the 4 -d adjustment period. Measurements were growth performances, digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and energy, white and red blood cell counts, packed cell volume, and incidence of diarrhea. The PKE increased average daily gain (ADG) (246 vs 215 g/d; p = 0. 06) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (470 vs 343 g/d; p< 0. 05) and decreased gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) (0. 522 vs 0. 628 g/g; p< 0. 05) during phase 2 compared with CON, but did not affect growth performance during phase 1 and 3. During overall experimental period, PKE increased ADG (383 vs 362 g/d; p = 0. 05) and ADFI (549 vs 496 g/d; p< 0. 05) compared with CON, but did not affect G:F. However, {{no differences were found}} on digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy between CON and PKE. The PKE reduced frequency of diarrhea (15 % vs 25 %; p = 0. 08) for the first 2 wk after weaning compared with CON.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of palm kernel <b>expellers</b> on productive performance, nutrient digestibility, and changes in white blood cells (WBC) of lactating sows. A total of 14 sows (200 ± 12 kg of average body weight [BW]; 2. 5 of average parity) were used and moved from gestation room to farrowing room on d 109 of gestation. Sows {{were randomly assigned to}} 2 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. The treatments were a diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON) and CON added with 20 % of palm kernel <b>expellers</b> (PKE). Sows were fed the treatments for 28 days (weaning) after farrowing. Blood was collected from each sow and 4 randomly selected piglets from each sow before farrowing or on d 3, 7, or 14 of lactation. Sows were fed respective treatments containing 0. 2 % chromic oxide from d 15 to 21 of lactation. Fecal samples were collected daily for the last 3 days after the 4 -d adjustment period. Measurements were performances and WBC changes of sows and litter, nutrient digestibility of sows, and daily diarrhea of litter. Sows fed PKE had greater average daily feed intake (7. 38 vs 7. 10 kg/d; p< 0. 05) and lost less BW (− 6. 85 vs − 8. 54 kg; p< 0. 05) and backfat depth (− 0. 42 vs − 0. 71 mm; p< 0. 05) than those fed CON. However, there were no differences on digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy and weaning to estrus interval of sows fed either CON or PKE. Piglets from sows fed PKE gained more BW (203 vs 181 g/d; p = 0. 08) and had less frequency of diarrhea (6. 80 vs 8. 56 %; p = 0. 07) than those from sows fed CON. On the other hand, no difference was found on preweaning mortality of piglets from sows fed either CON or PKE. Sows fed PKE had lower number of WBC (9. 57 vs 11. 82 × 103 /μL; p = 0. 09) before farrowing than those fed CON, but no difference on d 3 and 7.

30|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of enzyme complex on in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility for feed ingredients. The objective of experiment 1 was to screen feed ingredients that can be effective substrates for an enzyme complex, mainly consisted of β-pentosanase, β-glucanase and α-amylase, using in vitro digestibility methods. In experiment 1, the test ingredients were three grain sources (barley, corn and wheat) and six protein supplements (canola meal, copra <b>expellers,</b> cottonseed meal, distillers dried grains with solubles, palm kernel <b>expellers</b> and soybean meal). In vitro ileal and total tract digestibility (IVID and IVTTD, respectively) of DM for test ingredients were determined. In vitro digestibility methods consisted of two- or three-step procedure simulating in vivo digestion in the pig gastrointestinal tracts with or without enzyme complex. As the enzyme complex added, the IVID of DM for corn and wheat increased (p <  0.05) by 5.0 and 2.6 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn increased (p <  0.05) by 3.1 percentage unit with enzyme complex addition. As the effect of enzyme complex was the greatest in corn digestibility, corn grains were selected to determine the in vitro digestibility of the fractions (starch, germ, hull and gluten) that maximally respond to the enzyme complex in experiment 2. The IVID of DM for corn starch, germ and hull increased (p <  0.05) by 16.0, 2.8 and 1.2 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn starch and hull also increased (p <  0.05) by 8.6 and 0.9 percentage unit, respectively, with enzyme complex addition. In conclusion, the enzyme complex increases in vitro DM digestibility of corn and wheat, and the digestibility increments of corn are mainly attributed to the increased digestibility of corn starch.|$|R
