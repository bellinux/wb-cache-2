In an interview with Sound on Sound, engineer Ari Levine from The Smeezingtons, who carried out the recording and instrumentation on [...] "Grenade", explained that the song was original recorded with [...] "a more guitar‑based arrangement", 15bpm faster. According to Mars, the record was much happier. Mars ended up by playing the song live in showcase for the label and to several booking agents <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> <b>tempo.</b> The singer and his bandmates rehearsed a lot to that show, yet [...] "Grenade" [...] "sounded terrible". Mars decided to do a [...] "stripped down" [...] version by playing the guitar, while Brody Brown played the piano. The single received praise from the label.

It was in this form that Villa-Lobos used both the melody and the words, and he used the song's title as a subtitle for the Chôros, together with an acknowlegdement, [...] "D'après la poésie de Catullo Cearence" [...] sic. The poet attended the 1926 premiere of Chôros No. 10 in the Teatro Lírico, and was overcome with emotion, embracing the composer in a gesture of gratitude [...] Unfortunately, in a moment of financial distress, Catulo had sold the rights of all his literary works to a man named Guimarães Martins, who evidently remained ignorant of Villa-Lobos's use of the text for nearly thirty years until by chance, at a demonstration of new gramophone players at the Ministry of Education in Rio de Janeiro, a recording of the work was used as an example. Martins initiated a breach of copyright action against Villa-Lobos, which was finally resolved only in 1956—in the composer's favour. Nevertheless, the performance of the work Villa-Lobos recorded in Paris in May 1957 substituted neutral syllables for Catulo's text, and when the publisher Max Eschig reissued the score in 1975, the text was likewise removed. Most performances since then, however, have restored the words of Catulo's poem ( [...] ; [...] ) ...|$|E

5000|$|As a composer, Becker is {{influenced}} by his world music education at Wesleyan, more specifically from his understanding of North Indian Classical, or Hindustani, music. The Hindustani style of composition is based primarily on raga scales as the method of pitch organization. [...] The style focuses on communicating certain rasas, or moods, while allowing the performer to freely interpret those rasas through their own virtuosity. [...] In terms of form, the Hindustani style tends {{to focus on a}} development [...] "from static to ecstatic," [...] featuring a drone followed by virtuosic, highly rhythmic content that fluctuates freely from metered to unmetered moments. [...] There is also a tendency to initiate <b>a</b> composition <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>tempo,</b> and end it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fast tempo.|$|R
