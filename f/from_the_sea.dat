40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to determine the infection status of anisakid larvae in marine fish collected from 3 <b>sea</b> areas of <b>the</b> Republic of Korea. Total 86 marine fish (8 species) collected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Sea</b> (Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do), 171 fish (10 species) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Sea</b> (Sacheon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do), and 92 fish (7 species) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yellow <b>Sea</b> (Incheon Metropolitan City) were examined by both naked eyes and artificial digestion method. Among the total of 349 fish examined, 213 (61. 0 %) were infected with 8 species of anisakid larvae, i. e., Anisakis simplex, 6 types of Contracaecum spp., and Raphidascaris sp., and the mean larval density was 13. 8 per infected fish. Anisakid larvae were detected in 45 fish (52. 3 %) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Sea,</b> 131 fish (76. 6 %) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Sea,</b> and 37 fish (40. 2 %) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yellow <b>Sea.</b> <b>The</b> average numbers of larvae detected were 4. 0, 16. 6, and 15. 9, respectively. Anisakis simplex larvae were detected in 149 fish (42. 7 %), and the mean larval density was 9. 0 per infected fish. They were found in 26 fish (30. 2 %) collected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Sea,</b> 96 fish (56. 1 %) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Sea,</b> and 27 fish (29. 3 %) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yellow <b>Sea.</b> <b>The</b> average numbers of larvae detected were 2. 9, 10. 3, and 10. 5, respectively. Conclusively, the present study suggests that the infection rate and density of anisakid larvae {{are more or less}} higher in <b>the</b> fish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Sea</b> than those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Sea</b> or <b>the</b> Yellow <b>Sea...</b>|$|R
