At this point, opposition to the bridge began to form on both sides of Long Island Sound. In addition, plans to turn the Oyster Bay area into a bird sanctuary and a protected park made working on the highway harder as building on such protected places is forbidden by law. Faced with growing opposition, Governor Rockefeller cancelled the plans for the bridge on June20, 1973, nine years after the first proposal by Moses.|$|E

The tank can hold 165 pounds of liquid waste and the crew only managed to get it down to about 80 pounds. Later in the day, astronauts used the camera on Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to survey the condition of the nozzle. Since no ice was found, Flight Controllers told the crew that it is likely that there is a blockage in the line.|$|E
25|$|Kant ran <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{with his}} {{theory that the}} mind plays a part in {{producing}} objective knowledge. Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, so how can they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time. All the principles are temporally bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times. Hence there are principles such as substance is that which endures through time, and the cause must always be prior to the effect.|$|E

500|$|Donovan Patton (born March 1, 1978 at Agana Naval Air Station in Guam) is an American host, actor, voice actor, and singer. Patton {{graduated}} from the Interlochen Arts Academy and acted in Shakespeare plays such as Much Ado About Nothing and Romeo and Juliet before he replaced Steve Burns as Joe, the new host of Nickelodeon's children's television program Blue's Clues in 2002. On Patton's acting, series co-creator Angela Santomero stated that Patton brought Joe, his character, closer to the preschool viewer, as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> rather than figure it out first like Steve". After Blue's Clues ended Patton voiced Bot on Nickelodeon's Team Umizoomi; {{for his work on}} children's television, Patton {{has been described as a}} [...] "household name" [...] and an [...] "unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents".|$|E
500|$|According to Traci Paige Johnson, {{one of the}} {{producers}} and creators of Blue's Clues, Patton's character {{was more like a}} preschooler and more innocent than Steve. Angela Santomero, another producer and creator, stated that Patton's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> rather than figure it out first like Steve". Patton liked working on Blue's Clues because, as he stated, [...] "I got to go be a kid for twelve hours a day". [...] He called the show's crew [...] "a real fun little family" [...] and a [...] "well-oiled machine" [...] by the time he joined the show. Patton remained on the show until the show's cancellation, and also appeared in its spin-off, Blue's Room, which premiered in 2004. Several years later, Patton said he had not yet grasped the enormity of replacing Burns, even after he became a parent and witnessed the show's effect on his own children. [...] He admitted that he preferred when his two-year-old daughter watched the Steve episodes.|$|E

But here homosexuality is shown as completely normal, and the problem is something quite different, it's a love story, where one person exploits the love of the other person, and that's the story I always tell".|$|E

[...] It was reported that even some of the experienced Einsatzgruppen killers claimed to have been horrified by its cruelty.

There were nine components to this assembly-line method as applied to the Riga ghetto.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the land}} side our {{surroundings}} were as sombre {{as on the}} sea. It was a country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional church tower to mark the site of some old-world village. In every direction upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race which had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes of the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife. The glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and {{he spent much of}} his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and he had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the Chaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in tin. He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was settling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams, plunged <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> at our very doors which was more intense, more engrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had driven us from London.

Many of my readers may retain some recollection of what was called at the time [...] "The Cornish Horror," [...] though a most imperfect account of the matter reached the London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the public.|$|E
