25|$|The Midge, {{partly due}} to its nature as a private venture, had only a short lifespan, however {{had served as a}} {{proof-of-concept}} demonstrator for the subsequent aircraft. It had failed to interest the RAF as a combat aircraft at that time, but officers did issue encouragement of the development of a similar aircraft for training purposes. The larger Gnat, which was being developed in parallel with the Midge, was an improved version of the original fighter design; it was differentiated by larger air intakes to suit the Orpheus engine, a slightly larger wing, and provision for the installation of a 30mm ADEN cannon in each <b>intake</b> <b>lip.</b> The first prototype Gnat was built as a private venture by Folland. Subsequently, six further aircraft were ordered by the British Ministry of Supply for evaluation purposes. On 18 July 1955, the Folland prototype, serial number G-39-2, first flew from RAF Boscombe Down, Wiltshire.|$|E

The F-105 had a spacious cockpit with good visibility and layout (particularly after introduction of [...] "tape" [...] instruments); the advanced electronics were easy to learn and operate. Takeoffs and landings were often performed in the [...] range. The spoilers provided good roll control at all speeds and the distinctive four-petal airbrakes (which also opened slightly when the afterburner was engaged to allow for the larger flow of exhaust gases) were highly effective even at supersonic speeds. Loss of control due to a spin or complications of adverse yaw required deliberate effort from the pilot and spontaneous spin recovery was rapid.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the <b>intake</b> <b>lips,</b> and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} a numerical investigation on a supersonic air intake was done. The aim of this  {{work is to}} investigate a variable geometry of cross-section area for supersonic air intake at range  (1. 1 - 1. 5) Mach number, to get a maximum pressure recovery. In this work, the flow starts with a  normal shock attached to the <b>intake</b> cowl <b>lip.</b> The flow is assumed compressible, inviscid, twodimensional flow, unsteady, and axisymmetric. The equations (Continuity, Momentum, and Energy)   were solved based on a finite volume method. The governing equations were solved iteratively  using time marching technique. This part is analyzed for several Mach numbers, where the flow  properties are determined from inlet of air intake to the diffuser exit. Results show that, the  implementation of time marching scheme has succeeded in the prediction of the choked flow  region, which {{is important in the}} study of the performance of convergent-divergent diffuser. Also the  results indicated the absolute velocity increases along the convergent part and then start to  decrease along divergent part independently on the values of free-stream Mach numbers. </span...|$|R

The main difference {{was the use}} of a Wright R-1820-40B Cyclone in a distinctly more rounded and compact cowling, with a single double-wide flap {{on each side of the}} rear and no <b>lip</b> <b>intake.</b> These machines were named Martlet Mk IV. Boscombe Down testing of the Martlet IV at 7350 lb weight showed a maximum speed of 278 mph at 3400 ft and 298 mph at 14,600 ft, a maximum climb rate of 1580 fpm at 6200 ft at 7740 lb weight, and a time to climb to 20,000 ft of 14.6 minutes.

However, below the shock-on-lip flight Mach number, the shock wave angle/s are less oblique, causing the streamline approaching the lip to be deflected {{by the presence}} of the cone/ramp. Consequently, the intake capture area is less than the <b>intake</b> <b>lip</b> area, which reduces the intake airflow. Depending on the airflow characteristics of the engine, it may be desirable to lower the ramp angle or move the cone rearwards to refocus the shockwaves onto the cowl lip to maximise intake airflow.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{engineering}} challenges in designing the National Aerospace Plane, NASP, is to overcome augmented heating on the <b>intake</b> cowl <b>lip</b> from shock/shock interactions. The shock/shock interaction arises when the bow shock from the craft's nose interferes with the bow shock from the cowl lip. Considering only the region immediately around the cowl lip, the problem geometry may be simplified as that of an oblique shock impinging on a bow shock from a circular cylinder. Edney classified six different interference patterns resulting from an oblique-shock/curved bow-shock interaction. Of these six types, type 3 and 4 are most significant in that augmented surface heat transfer may be ten to thirty {{times greater than the}} case without the shock/shock interaction. The objective was to begin to develop a mathematical model which is capable of predicting the effect of a type 3 and 4 shock/shock interaction in the stagnation region of an arbitrary 2 -D body. This model must be capable of predicting the maximum surface heat flux and the surface stagnation point pressure once the outer (effectively inviscid) flowfield is given. Therefore, it must capture the unsteady physics of the impinging shear layer...|$|R
2500|$|In 1994 a {{whole new}} FTO coupé concept was created. The only body style was a 2-door coupé, and all FTOs were front wheel drive. Either a {{inline-four}} or a transversely mounted V6 engine was available, mated to either a 5-speed manual or INVECS-II semi-automatic transmission. Earlier (pre-facelift) auto models had a four-speed version, whilst most facelift [...] auto versions had a five-speed. The most recognizable exterior styling change during 1997 was, in simple terms, to the front bumper - which went from two air intakes to a single deeper <b>intake,</b> restyled front <b>lip</b> and indicator/fog lighting arrangement. On the pre-facelift models there exists a minor difference in the lower intake - on some earlier models there are two blanking plates on either side, thus reducing {{the size of the}} aperture. (These can be seen, either side of the number plate, {{in the image of the}} yellow GPX Limited Edition below).|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out {{on the model of}} an {{isolated}} supersonic air-intake to study the effect of natural ventilation of the internal boundary layer on the overall pressure distribution, total pressure recovery, intake buzz oscillations and surfaceflow patterns in the Mach number range of 2 to 3 at design and off-design conditions. The intake was stared in supercritical condition with benign back-pressure condition; the back-pressure was gradually increased using a butterfly valve driven by a PCcontrolled stepper motor. The tests {{were carried out}} at the 0. 3 m supersonic blowdown wind tunnel at the Experimental Aerodynamics Division, NAL, Bangalore. The results show that with ventilation, significant improvement in the total pressure recovery occurs at all back-pressure conditions, with the optimum vent gap of 1. 6 mm indicating improvement in the pressure recovery efficiency from about 60 % to 90 % at Mach 3; improvement was observed at Mach 2 also, though of reduced magnitude. Schlieren visualizations suggest a clear delay in the occurrence of critical condition of the intake. Ventilation created a stable oblique shock at the <b>intake</b> cowl <b>lip,</b> in contrast to the bow-wave without ventilation, indicating reduced spillage and improved pressure recovery of th e entry flow. Image analyses of video pictures suggest a limit-cycle oscillation of the oblique shock just past the critical region. Numerical simulation for some selected cases was carried out with and without ventilation using a CFD code FLUENT. Reasonable agreement with the experimental data was observed...|$|R

40|$|To reduce fuel {{consumption}} {{as well as}} noise and CO 2 emissions, the overall trend in civil aviation is to decrease exhaust velocities associated with an increase of the fan diameter, implying more weight and more drag because of the larger nacelle size. To compensate for the introduced weight increase, the concept of nacelles with short inlet, for which {{the interaction between the}} nacelle and the fan is higher than for current engines, is often considered. This paper proposes to design a short inlet geometry with a length over diameter ratio of l/D� 0. 35 that provides better or equal aerodynamic performances, predominantly for the fan, than conventional long inlet configurations with typical ratios of l/D� 0. 65. To obtain such a design, an optimization process with a flow field covering the entire fan, intake and nacelle system is used. The first step is to define the parameterization of the nacelle which finally contains the nacelle and the intake contour as basics parameters. The next step is to establish a robust and automatic meshing procedure of the entire calculation domain (far field, nacelle, intake and fan), which guarantees a high mesh quality independent of the parameter selected. AutoOpti, which is an optimization tool developed at DLR, is applied, providing an optimization framework based on an evolutionary algorithm with heavy surrogate model enhancements. For the calculations, which are realized with the DLR in-house solver TRACE, three operating conditions are considered: static take-off (OP 1), take-off (OP 2) and cruise (OP 3). The classification of the results is based on the assessment of the fan aerodynamic performances, considering fan total pressure ratio for OP 1 and OP 2 with the aim to increase the fan stability limit and on the isentropic efficiency for OP 3. Among the Paretofront, the best individual is selected and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, explaining the performance gain and corresponding geometric modifications of the <b>intake</b> and <b>lip</b> section. A new optimization process is realized to minimize the pressure peak observed at static take-off condition on the nacelle’s leading edge. Then, a full annulus nacelle geometry is created in order to study the influence of some asymmetric parameters such as the angle of the nacelle inlet face (droop angle), the thickness in circumferential direction and the inflow angl...|$|R
50|$|At subsonic flight speeds, the conical inlet {{operates}} {{much like}} a pitot intake or subsonic diffuser. However, as the vehicle goes supersonic a conical shock waveappears, emanating from the cone apex. The flow area through the shock wave decreases and the air is compressed. As the flight Mach number increases, the conical shock wave becomes more oblique and eventually impinges on the <b>intake</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ideally, {{the first}} oblique shock wave should {{intercept}} the air <b>intake</b> <b>lip,</b> thus avoiding air spillage and pre-entry {{drag on the}} outer boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because {{the angle of the}} shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed.|$|E
50|$|A sharp-lipped {{version of}} the pitot intake, {{described}} above for subsonic applications, performs quite well at moderate supersonic flight speeds. A detached normal shock wave forms {{just ahead of the}} <b>intake</b> <b>lip</b> and 'shocks' the flow down to a subsonic velocity. However, as flight speed increases, the shock wave becomes stronger, causing a larger percentage decrease in stagnation pressure (i.e. poorer pressure recovery). An early US supersonic fighter, the F-100 Super Sabre, used such an intake.|$|E
5000|$|... c) are {{designed}} to have a normal shock in the ducting downstream of <b>intake</b> <b>lip,</b> so that the flow at compressor/fan entry is always subsonic. This intake {{is known as a}} mixed-compression inlet. However, two difficulties arise for these intakes: one occurs during engine throttling while the other occurs when the aircraft speed (or Mach) changes. If the engine is throttled back, there is a reduction in the corrected (or non-dimensional) airflow of the LP compressor/fan, but (at supersonic conditions) the corrected airflow at the <b>intake</b> <b>lip</b> remains constant, because it is determined by the flight Mach number and intake incidence/yaw. This discontinuity is overcome by the normal shock moving to a lower cross-sectional area in the ducting, to decrease the Mach number at entry to the shockwave. This weakens the shockwave, improving the overall intake pressure recovery. So, the absolute airflow stays constant, whilst the corrected airflow at compressor entry falls (because of a higher entry pressure). Excess intake airflow may also be dumped overboard or into the exhaust system, to prevent the conical/oblique shock waves being disturbed by the normal shock being forced too far forward by engine throttling.|$|E
5000|$|Each Adour engine {{provided}} 22.75 kN (5,115 lbf) max {{dry thrust}} and 32.49 kN (7,305 lbf) afterburning thrust. The TF40-801As {{did not have}} the [...] "part throttle reheat" [...] feature added to Adour 102s as an engine-out safety feature, and the T-2 was never refitted with more powerful Adour engine variants, {{along the lines of the}} Adour 104 eventually refitted to British Jaguars, leaving the T-2 somewhat underpowered. The engine intakes had fixed rectangular geometry and fuselage splitter plates, plus a set of spring-loaded auxiliary inlets behind the <b>intake</b> <b>lip</b> for increased airflow in ground running. There were large service doors beneath the fuselage that provided excellent access to the engines for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} no {{downstream}} turbine, a ramjet combustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel:air ratios, which implies a combustor exit stagnation temperature {{of the order of}} 2400 K for kerosene. Normally, the combustor must be capable of operating over a wide range of throttle settings, for a range of flight speeds/altitudes. Usually, a sheltered pilot region enables combustion to continue when the vehicle intake undergoes high yaw/pitch during turns. Other flame stabilization techniques make use of flame holders, which vary in design from combustor cans to simple flat plates, to shelter the flame and improve fuel mixing. Overfuelling the combustor can cause the normal shock within a supersonic intake system to be pushed forward beyond the <b>intake</b> <b>lip,</b> resulting in a substantial drop in engine airflow and net thrust.|$|E

50|$|The second {{difficulty}} {{occurs when}} the aircraft Mach number changes. The airflow {{has to be the}} same at the <b>intake</b> <b>lip,</b> at the throat and at the engine. This statement is a consequence the conservation of mass. However, the airflow is not generally the same when the aircraft's supersonic speed changes. This difficulty is known as the airflow matching problem which is solved by more complicated inlet designs than are typical of subsonic inlets. For example, to match airflow, a supersonic inlet throat can be made variable and some air can be bypassed around the engine and then pumped as secondary air by an ejector nozzle. If the inlet flow is not match, it may become unstable with the normal shock wave in the throat suddenly moving forward beyond the lip, known as inlet unstart. Spillage drag is high and pressure recovery low with only a plane shock wave in place of the normal set of oblique shock waves. In the SR-71 installation the engine would continue to run although afterburner blowout sometimes occurred.|$|E

Numerical results for a variety of wind tunnel conditions were compared with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and unsteady RANS (URANS) data as well as experimental results. The time evolutions of distortion coefficients (e. g. DC 60) at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP) very well demonstrate the highly turbulent flow in the separated region downstream of the S-duct and allow the comparison of the dynamic intake distortion behavior with steady-state performance as well as experimental data, revealing an improved prediction of the time-averaged DC 60 value with hybrid methods. A numerical study on <b>intake</b> <b>lip</b> shaping was conducted allowing an improved assessment of the sources of the aerodynamic forces.

Numerical results for a variety of wind tunnel conditions were compared with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and unsteady RANS (URANS) data as well as with experimental results. The impact of not considering the wind tunnel walls in the CFD calculations on the computational results was investigated, revealing that the ventilated walls of the T 1500 wind tunnel eliminate the blockage of the model within the closed test section and that free stream conditions can be applied for the computational boundary conditions. Since <b>intake</b> <b>lip</b> shaping is a vital design parameter impacting the intake internal flow and performance, the original geometry was compared with a modified cowl while maintaining low-observability features of the W-shaped cowl design. A trade-off study between boundary layer diversion versus ingestion was performed numerically by applying Euler boundary conditions to the walls of the numerical model of the UAV configuration, thus simulating the total removal or diversion of the boundary layer. The computed inviscid results were compared with the viscous data, quantifying the losses in total pressure recovery and the increase in distortion for the ingested test cases. Internal flow control in the intake duct of the UAV configuration was studied by numerically applying vortex generators, and the results were compared with experimental data. Numerical models were employed in order to simulate micro-jets as active flow control devices in the serpentine duct. Increasing of jet velocities resulted in smaller areas of flow separation and thus led to beneficial total pressure recoveries and distortion parameters.
