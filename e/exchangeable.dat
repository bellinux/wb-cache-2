5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, <b>exchangeable</b> for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain <b>exchangeable</b> until 2022.|$|E

25|$|The {{platform}} principally features 3D-based user-generated content. Second Life {{also has}} its own virtual currency, the Linden Dollar, which is <b>exchangeable</b> with real world currency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exchangeable</b> bond: Convertible bond {{where the}} issuing {{company and the}} {{underlying}} stock company are different companies (e.g. XS0882243453, GBL into GDF Suez). This distinction is usually made in terms of risk i.e. equity and credit risk being correlated: {{in some cases the}} entities would be legally distinct, but not considered as <b>exchangeable</b> as the ultimate guarantor being the same as the underlying stock company (e.g. typical {{in the case of the}} Sukuk, Islamic convertible bonds, needing a specific legal setup to be compliant with the Islamic law).|$|E
25|$|Yield to worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, <b>exchangeable,</b> or {{has other}} features, the yield to worst {{is the lowest}} yield of yield to maturity, yield to call, yield to put, and others.|$|E
25|$|The {{first series}} of notes was dated 31 October 1993. The 5, 10 and 20 kuna notes from this series were {{withdrawn}} on 1 April 2007, and the 50, 100 and 200 kuna notes were withdrawn on 1 January 2010, but remain <b>exchangeable</b> at the HNB in Zagreb.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were created with inadequate capital for their operations and authorized to issue bonds <b>exchangeable</b> at a 1:1 rate for Reichsmarks and sold at a discount. The Reichsbank rediscounted the bills of these companies creating a monetary expansion without formally renouncing the link to gold.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the French franc was locked to the euro at 1 euro = 6.55957 FRF on 31 December 1998, and after the {{introduction}} of the euro notes and coins, ceased to be legal tender after 28 February 2002, although they were still <b>exchangeable</b> at banks until 19 February 2012.|$|E
25|$|An {{adaption}} of {{this method}} {{is to determine the}} non-exchangeable (C-H) and <b>exchangeable</b> hydrogen (bounds to other elements, e.g. O, S and N) in organic matter. The samples are equilibrated with water in sealed autosampler carousels at 115 oC and then transferred into pyrolysis EA followed by IRMS measurement.|$|E
25|$|Battery {{swapping}} {{is common}} in warehouses using electric forklift trucks. The concept of an <b>exchangeable</b> battery service was first proposed as early as 1896, in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. It was first put into practice between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric, and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric {{through the use of}} an <b>exchangeable</b> battery. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the guilder was {{replaced}} by the euro at an exchange rate of 2.20371 guilders = 1 Euro. Coins remained <b>exchangeable</b> for euros at branches of the Netherlands Central Bank until 1 January 2007. Banknotes valid at the time of conversion to the euro may be exchanged there until 1 January 2032.|$|E
25|$|Peseta notes issued since 1939 and coins {{that were}} legal tender on 31 December 2001 remain <b>exchangeable</b> at any {{branch of the}} Spanish Central Bank until 31 December 2020. According to that entity, as of March 2011 pesetas to a value {{estimated}} at 1.7 billion euros had not been converted to euro.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{exchange}} chromatography (usually {{referred to}} as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There {{are two types of}} ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the <b>exchangeable</b> ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the <b>exchangeable</b> ion is an anion. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.|$|E
25|$|Voting {{dilution}} deferred. With {{a convertible}} bond, dilution {{of the voting}} rights of existing shareholders only happens on eventual conversion of the bond. However convertible preference shares typically carry voting rights when preference dividends are in arrears. Of course, the bigger voting impact occurs if the issuer decides to issue an <b>exchangeable</b> rather than a convertible.|$|E
25|$|In {{the output}} stream 0 and 1 are equally likely, as 10 and 01 are equally {{likely in the}} original, both having {{probability}} pqnbsp&=nbsp&qp. This extraction of uniform randomness {{does not require the}} input trials to be independent, only uncorrelated. More generally, it works for any <b>exchangeable</b> sequence of bits: all sequences that are finite rearrangements are equally likely.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the limited operating range of electric vehicles, {{and the lack of}} recharging infrastructure, an <b>exchangeable</b> battery service was first proposed as early as 1896. The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an <b>exchangeable</b> battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Light Electric cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.|$|E
25|$|On dry, deep, outwash {{deposits}} in northern Ontario, both white spruce and aspen grow slowly (MacLean 1960). But, broadly, white spruce {{is able to}} tolerate considerable droughtiness of sites that are fertile, and no fertile site is too moist unless soil moisture is stagnant (Sutton 1968). Soil fertility holds the key not just to white spruce growth but to {{the distribution of the}} species. At least moderate fertility is needed for good growth, but white spruce occurs on many sites where nutrient deficiencies depress its growth more than that of black spruce, red spruce, Norway spruce, and the pines generally (Heiberg and White 1951, Lafond 1954, McLeod 1956, MacArthur 1957, Paine 1960, Swan 1960). Minimum soil-fertility standards recommended for white spruce sufficient to produce 126 to 157nbsp&m3/ha of wood at 40 years are much higher than for pine species commonly planted in the Lake States (Wilde 1966): 3.5% organic matter, 12.0 meq/100 g exchange capacity, 0.12% total N, 44.8nbsp&kg/ha available P, 145.7nbsp&kg/ha available K, 3.00 meq/100 g <b>exchangeable</b> Ca, and 0.70 meq/100 g <b>exchangeable</b> Mg.|$|E
25|$|Kadamba {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} planted trees in the tropics. The tree is grown along avenues, roadsides and villages for shade. Kadamba are suitable for reforestation programs. It sheds large amounts of leaf and non-leaf litter which on decomposition improves some physical and chemical properties of soil under its canopy. This reflects an increase in the level of soil organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity, available plant nutrients and <b>exchangeable</b> bases.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{emergence}} of new currencies in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, the Interchangeability Agreement which the three countries adhered to as original members of the currency union meant the Malaysian dollar was <b>exchangeable</b> at par with the Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar. This ended on 8 May 1973, when the Malaysian government withdrew from the agreement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board still maintain the interchangeability of their two currencies, as of 2009.|$|E
25|$|In France, Électricité de France (EDF) and Toyota are {{installing}} charging {{stations for}} PHEVs on roads, streets and parking lots. EDF is also partnering with Elektromotive, Ltd. to install 250 new charging points over {{six months from}} October 2007 in London {{and elsewhere in the}} UK. Recharging points also can be installed for specific uses, as in taxicab stands. Project Better Place began in October 2007 and is working with Renault on development of <b>exchangeable</b> batteries (battery swapping).|$|E
25|$|Although the Euro {{became the}} {{official}} currency of Austria in 1999, euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002. Old Schilling denominated coins and notes were phased out from circulation {{because of the}} introduction of the euro by 28 February of that year. Schilling banknotes and coins which were valid at the time of {{the introduction of the}} euro will remain <b>exchangeable</b> for euros at any branch of the Austrian National Bank (Österreichische Nationalbank) indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the Bahrain Monetary Agency {{took over}} the {{issuance}} of paper money, and starting in July 1978 with a 20 dinar note, it introduced a new family of notes dated 1973 in Arabic. Denominations of , 1, 5 and 10 dinars were released on 16 December 1979. The 100-fils note of the Bahrain Currency Board was withdrawn in November 1980 and {{the remainder of the}} notes were withdrawn on 31 March 1996, remaining <b>exchangeable</b> until one year afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that while}} {{this gives the}} {{probability}} that a future observation will fall in a range, it does not give any estimate as to where in a segment it will fall – notably, if it falls outside the range of observed values, it may be far outside the range. See extreme value theory for further discussion. Formally, this applies not just to sampling from a population, but to any <b>exchangeable</b> sequence of random variables, not necessarily independent or identically distributed.|$|E
25|$|Coins were freely <b>exchangeable</b> until 17 February 2005 at Banque de France only (some {{commercial}} banks also accepted the old coins {{but were not}} required to do so for free after the transition period in 2001), by converting their total value in francs to euros (rounded to the nearest cent) at the fixed rate of 6.55957 francs for 1 euro. Banknotes remained convertible up until 17 February 2012. By that date, franc notes worth some €550 million remained unexchanged, allowing the French state to register the corresponding sum as revenue.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2009, Warner, {{offered to}} replace any HD DVD Warner home video release with a Blu-ray Disc {{equivalent}} for US$4.95 each plus US$6.95 shipping to the contiguous United States or $8.95 to Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico. The deal required the HD DVD's original sleeve art {{to be returned}} to Warner as a proof of purchase. The turn-around time for processing was approximately two weeks. Multi-disc sets were <b>exchangeable</b> at a discount, e.g., $14.95 for the 5-disc Blade Runner release, rather than $24.75. No exchanges were offered to customers outside the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{this early}} stage of {{hydrogen}} stable isotope study, most isotope compositions or fractionations were reported as bulk measurements of all organic material or all inorganic material. Some exceptions include cellulose and methane, as these compounds are easily separated. Another advantage of methane for compound specific measurements {{is the lack of}} hydrogen exchange. Cellulose has <b>exchangeable</b> hydrogen, but chemical derivatization can prevent swapping of cellulose hydrogen with water or mineral hydrogen sources. Cellulose and methane studies in the 1970s and 1980s set the standard for modern hydrogen isotope geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{circulating}} Indonesian banknotes {{date from}} 2000 (1,000 rupiah), 2001 (5,000 rupiah), 2004 (20,000 and 100,000 rupiah), 2005 (10,000 and 50,000 rupiah), 2009 (the new denomination of 2,000 rupiah), 2010 (revised {{version of the}} 10,000 rupiah), and 2011 (revised versions of the 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 rupiah). The 1998–1999 notes have not been legal tender since 31 January 2008 (but will be <b>exchangeable</b> until 31 January 2018 at Bank Indonesia). Earlier notes are also no longer legal tender, {{due to the lack}} of security features and association with the Suharto regime, but could be exchanged in Bank Indonesia offices until 20 August 2010.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} surgical {{alternative to}} corneal transplant is {{the insertion of}} intrastromal corneal ring segments. A small incision {{is made in the}} periphery of the cornea and two thin arcs of polymethyl methacrylate are slid between the layers of the stroma {{on either side of the}} pupil before the incision is closed by a suture. The segments push out against the curvature of the cornea, flattening the peak of the cone and returning it to a more natural shape. The procedure offers the benefit of being reversible and even potentially <b>exchangeable</b> as it involves no removal of eye tissue.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating is a radiometric dating {{method that}} uses (14C) to {{determine}} the age of carbonaceous materials up to about 60,000 years old. The technique was developed by Willard Libby and his colleagues in 1949 during his tenure as {{a professor at the}} University of Chicago. Libby estimated that the radioactivity of <b>exchangeable</b> carbon-14 would be about 14 disintegrations per minute (dpm) per gram of pure carbon, and this is still used as the activity of the modern radiocarbon standard.C|accessdate=2007-06-11|publisher=Martin Stute's homepage at Columbia}} In 1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for this work.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additional}} {{standards have}} evolved to address these issues. The first of these, released in 1992, was JPEG File Interchange Format (or JFIF), followed {{in recent years by}} <b>Exchangeable</b> image file format (Exif) and ICC color profiles. Both of these formats use the actual JIF byte layout, consisting of different markers, but in addition employ one of the JIF standard's extension points, namely the application markers: JFIF uses APP0, while Exif uses APP1. Within these segments of the file, that were left for future use in the JIF standard and aren't read by it, these standards add specific metadata.|$|E
25|$|The Wankdorf Stadion in Berne saw 60,000 people cram {{inside to}} watch the final between West Germany and Hungary, a rematch of a first-round game, which Hungary had won 8–3 against the {{reserves}} of the German team. The Golden Team of the Hungarians were favourites, as they were unbeaten for a record of 32 consecutive matches, but they had had two tough play-off matches. It started raining on match day – in Germany this was dubbed Fritz-Walter-Wetter ("Fritz Walter's weather") because the West German team captain Fritz Walter was said to play his best in the rain. Adi Dassler had provided shoes with <b>exchangeable</b> studs.|$|E
