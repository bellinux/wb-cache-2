John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the very next match he was dropped, replaced by the more experienced Watkins.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{negotiations}} leading to {{the transfer of the}} codex to the Tsar's possession are open to an interpretation that reflects adversely on Tischendorf's candour and good <b>faith</b> <b>with</b> the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery. For a recent account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch's article 'Nichts gegen Tischendorf' in Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70.

5|$|Having won both League and Cup in {{separate}} seasons with two clubs, Chapman {{was determined to}} go one better and win the Double – which {{had not yet been}} won in the 20th century – in 1931–32 but ended up missing out on both, finishing second in the League behind Everton and losing the 1932 FA Cup Final controversially to Newcastle United, with Newcastle's equaliser coming after the ball had gone behind for a goal kick. Undeterred, Chapman kept <b>faith</b> <b>with</b> his side and launched a bid for the 1932–33 title. However, it was during this season that Arsenal suffered one of the most infamous defeats in their history.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Presbyterian Church is the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The {{writings}} of Swiss/French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509–64) solidified much of the Reformed thinking that came before him {{in the form of}} the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. John Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, took Calvin's teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. As a result, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity. The Ulster Scots brought their Presbyterian <b>faith</b> <b>with</b> them to Ireland, where they laid the foundation of what would become the Presbyterian Church of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept <b>faith</b> <b>with</b> his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E

5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of <b>faith.</b> <b>With</b> the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E
