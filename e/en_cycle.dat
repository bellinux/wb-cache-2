Traffic actuated signals have been efficiently used in controlling isolated I intersections because they respond to random traffic fluctuations using detectors on all approaches. Application to coordinated arterial operations is a more complex task and insight into the operational performance of various arterial signal timing strategies is limited. The purposes of this study were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} performance of various traffic models providing arterial coordination using actuated control, to determine better ways to use the added flexibility of actuated control in a coordinated system, and to recommend more efficient strategies for coordination using actuated control. Representative traffic control problems were modeled into a statistical testbed using TRAF-NETSIM. A series of scenarios covering a range of arterial geometry, traffic volumes, and traffic actuated control settings were tested. The results indicate that green splits have to be more perfectly tuned in pretimed operation for optimal performance at higher volume levels for a g' <b>en</b> <b>cycle</b> length. At low volumes, any reasonable signal timing strategy works well as long as the detectors work and the traffic signals are coordinated. NETSIM simulation results for pretimed control demonstrate that PASSER 11 - 90 's green splits are optimal and any significant improvement to the arterial is only possible by employing traffic actuated control. It was observed that actuated system performance improved when the arterial's coordinated pretimed phase was reduced from its optimum pretimed value using existing actuated control technology. This finding suggests that a more optimal allocation of arterial green times is possible. Development of an advanced signal controller to implement the recommended control strategy is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Artículos <b>en</b> revistasCombined <b>cycle</b> {{gas turbine}} power plants (CCGTs) {{play a key}} role in modern {{electric}} power systems due to their operational flexibility and the firmness they provide to the networks where they operate. Due in part to this flexibility and firmness, the function of CCGTs has experienced a significant evolution with the advent of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind: CCGTs are increasingly required to rapidly vary load levels in order to counterbalance the fluctuations of renewable energy sources and satisfy overall system demand. The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology that can be used for assessing the optimal operational strategy of a CCGT when subjected to cycling requirements. This is achieved by introducing a unit commitment formulation that takes into account useful life expenditure costs due to fatigue damage accumulation associated to cycling. The case studies presented in this paper show that neglecting fatigue cycling costs when making operational decisions generates suboptimal cost and profit outcomes for CCGT operators. Furthermore, it is shown that profitability of CCGTs is compromised in systems with very significant penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, due to the increase in cycling costs derived from continuous load-following operation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

In addition, due to their flexible operation, CCGT plants are a useful support for {{the integration of the}} growing renewable energy installed capacity. Consequently, during the last years, CCGT plants have proliferated in electricity systems, increasing the global demand of natural gas (NG). In order to guarantee the NG supply and to hedge the price volatility, electricity generation companies (Gencos) sign supply contracts with NG producers. Typically, NG producers force long-term contracts in order to recover their huge capital investments. Therefore, Gencos should optimize the exercise of the supply contracts in the long-term scope in order to maximize their profits in the electricity market. However, the optimal exercise of the supply contracts on behalf of the Gencos could be impeded because of possible bottlenecks in the NG system. Accordingly, this paper proposes a methodology to incorporate both the characteristics of NG supply contracts and the congestions in the NG system in an electricity market model that could support the decision-making process on behalf of the Gencos. A study case illustrates the methodology. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

They can be classified into eight general types accroding to their specific characteristics as rhythmicity frequancy and modulation. These whistles are repeated with a great constancy and a frequency which depends on many factors : - rhythms : during netsting phase, a nycthemeral rhythm appears, represented by a bimodal curve. It includes internal rhythms whch characterize {{the different types of}} call. During the cycle of reproduction whistles types utilized and their respective frequency are changing. - physical environment : the individuals don't emit the same calls on a song perch or on immediate approaches to the nest. - social environment : phonoresponses influence the types of calls emitted. Among its 7 to 12 differnt whistles, some are particular to the individual ("individual calls"), when the others are shared with its neighbors. These last vocalizations could serve to the development of local dialects which permet here to distinguish two levels of communities : the restricted groups and the "super-groups". Intergroups differences are based on physical structure for certain calls and on frequency for others. Interindividual differences, based from one part on the existence of the individual calls and on the other part on the structure variation of "dialectal whistles", could permet an individual recognition inside the vocal communities.

Notation Our notation is generally consistent with Macdonald [5]. We write λ ⊢ n (or |λ | = n) and ℓ(λ) = k to indicate that λ is a partition of n into k parts; that is, λ = (λ 1, [...] ., λk) with λ 1 ≥ · · · ≥ λk ≥ 1 and λ 1 + [...] . +λk = n. If λ has exactly mi parts equal to i then we write λ = [1 m 12 m 2 · · ·], suppressing terms with mi = 0. We also define zλ = � i imimi! and Aut(λ) = � i mi!. A hook is a partition of the form [1 b, a + 1] with a, b ≥ 0. We use Frobenius notation for hooks, writing (a|b) in place of [1 b, a + 1]. The conjugacy class of the symmetric group Sn consisting of all n!/zλ permutations of cycle type λ ⊢ n will be denoted by Cλ. The irreducible characters χλ of Sn are naturally indexed by partitions λ of n, and we use the usual notation χλ µ for the common value of χλ at any element of Cµ. We write fλ for the degree χλ [1 n] of χλ. For vectors j = (j 1, [...] .,jm) and x = (x 1, [...] ., xm) we use the abbreviations j! = j 1 ! · · ·jm! and xj = x j 1 1 · · · xjm m. Finally, if α ∈ Q and f ∈ Q[[x]] is a formal power series, then we write [αxj] f(x) for the coefficient of the monomial αxj in f(x) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to produce and evaluate high-performance wood fiber composites. High-performance was defined as: high dimensional stability and a high durability, including resistance to wood-decaying organisms (fungi, bacteria, and insects). The main method, used to accomplish these properties, was acetylation of the wood fibers prior to the composite production. Acetylation involves a chemical modification of wood components, which {{was carried out by}} reaction with acetic anhydride. Another method applied was impregnation with kraft lignin followed by fixation of the lignin with an aluminum salt solution. Thus, lignin metal complexes are formed in situ - complexes that are insoluble under normal conditions in the environment. Test results show that both methods lead to more dimensionally stable composites, i. e. reduced swelling and shrinkage due to a varying moisture load. Kraft lignin treatment of wood fiber was estimated to be an economical method for obtaining a certain degree of stabilization of composites (fiberboards), although the composites cannot be labeled "high-performance" since they do not meet all requirements, as defined above. However, the use of acetylated fibers leads to a very high degree of dimensional stability as well as biological decay resistance and, furthermore, the mechanical properties are maintained during and after cyclic climate aging. Regardless of the lignocellulosic fiber source used, the thickness swelling of acetylated fiberboards in water is reduced by approximately 90 % and results from cyclic testing according to <b>EN</b> 321 (three <b>cycles,</b> each comprising 72 h water immersion, 24 h freezing at - 18 °C and 72 h drying at 70 °C) show that more than 85 % of the original internal bond strength, IBS, remains after testing. The latter figure should be compared with the corresponding value of 20 - 40 % obtained for fiberboards made from unmodified fibers. Acetylated wood fiber composites have also been tested for resistance to biological decay in a worldwide field test where 30 cm long fiberboard stakes were half-buried in soil. After three years of testing, most of the control stakes (made from unmodified fiber) had failed due to heavy decay while most of the acetylated composite stakes were perfectly sound, showing no sign of decay. To determine whether the acetylation, and other methods of chemical modification, cause any degradation of the cellulose,. alfa. -cellulose was isolated from unmodified and chemically modified fibers after which the intrinsic viscosity and molecular mass distribution (determined by size exclusion chromatography) of the cellulose samples were analyzed. The main part of the cellulose from acetylated wood fiber seems to be unaffected by the modification method, whereas the other modification methods appear to yield more or less degraded cellulose. In order to manufacture products with complex shapes, moldable flexible fibermats were produced on both a small pilot scale (kilograms) and on a large scale (over one metric ton). A variety of industrial products were manufactured from the acetylated fibermats: exterior doors, automotive panels, façade claddings, flooring boards, wet-room wall panels, toilet lids and roof tiles. Generally, {{it was found that the}} dimensional stability of the products was high and that other important properties, such as mechanical and weathering properties, were also very satisfactory. The conclusion is that composites based on acetylated wood fiber are truly high-performance, as defined above...|$|R
40|$|Cet article présente les résultats d'une étude menée sur le {{traitement}} d'effluents fortement chargés (DCO > 1, 5 kg. m- 3) par un procédé à boues activées. L'objectif principal de ce travail est de montrer qu'une alimentation séquentielle d'un réacteur parfaitement agité avec maintien permanent du recyclage des boues et de l'oxygénation permet d'obtenir une bonne épuration tant du point de vue de l'élimination de la pollution carbonée que de la maîtrise de la décantabilité des flocs microbiens. Les essais sont menés sur un pilote de laboratoire constitué d'une colonne à bulles et d'un décanteur, alimenté avec un substrat synthétique. Contrairement à une alimentation continue, la mise <b>en</b> place de <b>cycles</b> d'alimentation permet d'obtenir des flocs de bonne décantabilité de manière constante dans le temps. Ainsi une concentration élevée en biomasse peut être maintenue dans le réacteur. De plus, le suivi d'un cycle 1 h/ 1 h confirme que la mise <b>en</b> œuvre d'un <b>cycle</b> court n'entraîne pas de variations importantes des performances d'épuration. Par ailleurs, le suivi d'un long cycle (24 h/ 24 h) montre des variations significatives des concentrations en DCO, polysaccharides dans la phase liquide et exopolysaccharides dans les flocs microbiens. Ceci semble indiquer que des produits microbiens sont relargués des flocs vers la phase liquide pendant l'arrêt de l'alimentation et que des exopolysaccharides sont produits dans les flocs pendant l'alimentation. The {{overall efficiency}} of an activated sludge {{wastewater treatment system}} depends both {{on the ability of}} the activated sludge culture to remove the soluble organic pollution and on the efficiency of the separation of the treated water from the biomass. In the treatment of a high-strength wastewater (COD > 1. 5 kg. m- 3), ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems can sometimes substitute for the final clarifier, the separation of the sludge from the effluent water being very good regardless of changes in sludge settleability. Because of the high pollutant concentrations, the biomass must be more concentrated in the bioreactor than in the usual aerobic processes (10 to 20 kg. m- 3 rather than 4 kg. m- 3), whatever the separation system (settler or filtration system). Thus, with this biomass concentration, the volumetric loading rate can be increased while the organic loading rate is maintained at a low level. The use of a clarifier is preferable because it is cheaper than ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems, which have very high investment and operation costs, on the other hand, and some fouling problems, on the other hand. However, its use requires a very good biomass settleability. Results from the literature show that there is no general relation between sludge settleability and such wastewater treatment operating parameters as dissolved oxygen concentration in the aeration basin, organic loading rates, pH, or low relative influent nitrogen and phosphorus contents. On the other hand, the separation ability of the clarifier depends on the hydraulic configuration of the aerated reactor: biomass settleability can be controlled by completely stirred reactors in series, plug-flow reactors or intermittently-fed systems. Indeed, this spatial or temporal staggering should allow microorganisms to consume their accumulated substrate and thus restore their accumulation capacity. In the case of high-strength wastewater treatment, temporal staggering is better than spatial staggering. Indeed, higher organic loading rates require a higher number of reactors. Thus, the COD concentration significantly increases in the first reactors of the cascade and some toxic or inhibitory problems could appear. For this reason, a temporal staggering was chosen. Biomass settleability is linked to the extracellular polymers that are the third component of the sludge flocs, after the cells and the water. These polymers are composed largely of microbial exopolysaccharides. Measurements of exopolysaccharides could be used to characterize sludge settleability. A too low level of exopolysaccharides indicates a sludge defloculation problem, whereas a too high level of exopolysaccharides means that sludge settleability could be hindered because of an excessive growth of filamentous organisms. The purpose of the present work is to show that the use of only one completely stirred reactor, fed in a cyclic way with permanent oxygenation and return sludge flow, leads to good sludge settleability and effluent quality. The experiments have been performed with a laboratory pilot-plant composed of a 11. 3 litre bubble column, which is a completely stirred reactor, and a secondary settling tank of 14. 8 litres. The reactor is fed with an equilibrated synthetic substrate consisting mainly of meat extract, saccharose and ethanol (COD:N:P= 100 : 5 : 1 and 1 kg COD= 1 kg meat extract + 0. 444 kg saccharose + 0. 2 kg ethanol). The feeding cycle is a set of consecutive periods of feeding and starvation. For example, during a 1 h/ 2 h feeding cycle, the substrate feeding is continuous during 1 hour and stopped during 2 hours. The sludge comes from the Nancy-Maxéville wastewater treatment plant and its acclimation to the synthetic substrate begins with an aeration without feeding during 12 hours. Afterwards, the experimental system is fed during 1 hour every 2 hours with the substrate (first concentration of COD= 0. 1 kg. m- 3). Then, the inlet COD is increased by steps of 0. 1 kg. m- 3 every day until the required concentration is reached. Once the biomass is acclimated to the influent and sufficiently concentrated, the experiment can begin. In order to show the positive influence of cyclic feeding on wastewater treatment quality, we have carried out one experiment with continuous feeding and two experiments with cyclic feeding (see Table 1). For these experiments, the volumetric loading rate is about 4 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1. With an appropriate feeding cycle, the settleability of the sludge and the effluent quality remain good: the diluted sludge volume index is 56 cm 3. g- 1 and 96 % of the inlet COD is removed. Thus, the biomass concentration remains high in the reactor (19 kg. m- 3). This is not the case with a continuous feeding where the biomass settleability rapidly deteriorates. The principal advantage of sequential feeding is the maintenance of good sludge settleability and a high biomass concentration in the aeration basin. Moreover, during the short feeding cycles, the variations of the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides in the bulk phase and extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are very low. This augurs well for system stability. In contrast, monitoring of a long cycle (24 h of feeding and 24 h of starvation) shows great variations in the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides in the system. When the feeding is stopped, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase increase whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration in sludge flocs decreases. Reciprocally, after the feeding is begun, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase decrease, and then remain constant, whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration increases. As 1 kg of measured polysaccharides represents 0. 9 kg COD, and as in the bulk phase the COD concentration is equivalent to 4 times the polysaccharide concentration, it seems that microbial products other than polysaccharides are released in the bulk phase during starvation, these products being slowly biodegradable. Extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are formed during the feeding phase...|$|R

OriginThis document is a doctoral thesis in French, defended on December 22, 1983, at Aix-Marseille 1 University. The original paper document is available, together with two annex volumes including experimental materials and raw data, at Aix-Marseille University library (Aix-Schuman), cote TLD 3351 / 1 *BULA (Vol. 1), TLD 3351 / 2 *BULA (Vol. 2), and TLD 3351 / 3 *BULA (Vol. 3). ContentsThis {{is a series}} of 12 experimental studies on the perceptual encoding processes involved in reading printed words silently. In a preliminary experiment (pp. 97 - 107), one exploited the fact that all nouns in French language have a gender. So, one can build grammatical nominal syntagms of the form LE PHARE, non-grammatical syntagms of the form LE NEIGE, and non-grammatical syntagms that are homophonic of grammatical syntagms, such as LE PAIRE, which is a homophone of the correct syntagm LE PERE. It was observed that when participants had to judge the grammaticality of such syntagms in an orthographic judgment task, it was more difficult to reject homophone syntagms than to reject non-homophone non-grammatical syntagms. When the participants were requested to make their judgment uniquely based on the phonological form of the stimuli, it was more difficult to accept homophone syntagms than to accept orthographically grammatical syntagms. It was concluded that both the use of an orthographic encoding and of a phonological encoding were automatic and irrepressible in printed word recognition. The next 11 experiments concerned orthographic coding. In experiment 1, fast left-to-right scanning effects involved in the discrimination of words were observed in a lexical decision task, while in experiment 2, left-to-right scanning effects were observed in an alphabetic decision task on rapidly presented non-words. Experiments 3 - 11 all used masked priming type techniques with a lexical decision task. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that non-alphabetical primes produce less masking effect than alphabetical primes, and that repeated letter primes produce less masking effect than primes made of different letters. This suggests that different occurrences of the same letter are not processed independently. Experiment 5 showed that the processing of letters has a local component and also a non-local one. The results also suggest that left-to-right serial effects observed in this experiment are not related to phonological encoding. Experiments 5 - 11 tested the effects of primes that were anagram of the target with various structures. It was concluded that non-positional letter codes activate the lexicon, and that bigrams are used to verify the structure of the stimulus, while the initial bigram is, in fact, made of the left space followed by the first letter of the word, and it plays a very important role in the word recognition. It was also observed that reverse bigrams (e. g. ON / NO) are perceptually antagonist, the first presented bigram tending to mask the second one, no matter their respective positions. A simple neuron-like model is proposed that detects bigrams from sequential responses of non-positional letter detectors. This model spontaneously generates the reverse bigram effect and makes new predictions concerning the perception of palindromes (RADAR).

40|$|Aiming {{to define}} {{irrigation}} strategies improving the water productivity by folder crops under water scarcity in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla (Morocco), this work combines field experimentation and modeling. The field study of crop response to water stress {{is important to}} maximize yield and improve agricultural water use efficiency (WUE) in areas where water resources are limited. On the silage maize, {{the results showed that}} water deficit affected plant height growth, accelerated the senescence of the leaves and reduced the leaf area index. Dry matter yields varied from 3. 9 t. ha- 1 under T 5 (20 % ETc) to 16. 4 t. ha- 1 under T 1 (100 % ETc). The establishment of the water budget by growth phase showed that the water use efficiency was higher during the linear phase of growth. WUE calculated at harvest varied between 2. 99 kg. m- 3 under T 1 and 1. 84 kg. m- 3 under T 5. The actual evapotranspiration under T 1 (100 % ETc) was 478 mm and 463 mm in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The yield response factor (Ky) for the silage maize for both growth seasons was 1. 12. The ETc of silage maize was determined using lysimeter drainage at 415 mm. the mean values of crop coefficients Kc were 0. 56, 1. 22 and 1. 05 for beginning phase, mid-season and at harvest (grain milky pasty stage) respectively. Drip irrigation allows obtaining dry matter yields similar to flood irrigation but with less water and saves about 30 % of irrigation water applied. Over five cycles, berseem dry biomass yields achieved under T 1 are 14. 3 and 13. 9 t/ha in 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 respectively. The yield reductions by applying 60 % of water requirements are 40 and 42 % in 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 respectively. Berseem daily productivity increases with more water applied with the highest value of 102 kg DM/ ha/ day. The dry matter content increases with water stress. The mean values range between 12. 3 and 23. 7 % under T 1 (100 % ETc) and T 4 (40 % ETc) respectively. The contribution of without irrigation cycles (rainy period) on the total annual yield may vary from 35 % to 52 % under treatments T 1 and T 4 respectively. Water balance achieved by water regime shows that drainage losses increase with more water applied especially in the first cycle. WUE is low during the first cycle, optimal in 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th cycle and decreases in the last one with water stress. Global WUE of berseem determined over the entire crop period (slope of the regression line) is 3. 37 kg. m- 3. The yield response factor (Ky) for the berseem for both growth season was 1. 11. Berseem ETc determined by drainage lysimeter was 520 mm. The Kc values were estimated for each cycle for all three phases: initial, development (median) and mid-season. Maximum yield average under drip irrigation was 15. 7 t/ha and obtained with 411 mm of water supply allowing to save 57 % of water compared to traditional irrigation technique. Comparing the behavior of six alfalfa varieties most commonly practiced in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla shows that the "Super Siriver" cultivars followed by «Trifecta» have higher yield potential and higher tolerance to water deficit. Alfalfa maximum annual yield obtained was 24. 2 t. ha- 1. The contribution of the spring cycles to the annual yields range from 55 % under T 1 (100 % ETc) to 65 % under T 4 (40 % ETc). In addition to water quantities, alfalfa yields depend on time application during a growth cycle. WUE varies from cycle to another and from one season to another. The maximum value was 2. 57 kg. m- 3 and obtained in spring 2011, while the low value was 0. 64 kg. m- 3 and obtained in winter 2010. WUE decreases with water stress, with mean values of 1. 83, 1. 67, 1. 54 and 1. 23 kg. m- 3 under T 1 (100 % ETc), T 2 (80 % ETc), T 3 (60 % ETc) and T 4 (40 % ETc) respectively. The yield response factor (Ky) of alfalfa was 0. 92. The determination of the alfalfa water requirements was performed on the basis of cycle’s calendar during two years in 2010 and 2011. The values founded for flood irrigation are 1388 and 1364 mm respectively for the two years. Drip irrigation allows achieving similar dry mater yield to flood irrigation with less water and agronomic efficiency. Water applied under T 1 in drip irrigation with 50 cm of spacing between ramps was less than water requirements (of alfalfa) by about 7 % and 18 % in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Under the same treatment in flood irrigation, the water requirements are exceeded by 16 % and 21 % in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Two crop models, PILOTE and CropSyst, had been selected to be tested on their ability to simulate the growth and yield of the studied crops under the edaphic-climatic conditions of Tadla. Tested on silage maize, both models correctly simulated the growth and development of the crop under different water regimes. The parameters of both models are validated and shown effective for simulation of biomass, leaf area index and soil water storage. Although PILOTE requires less parameters and data than CropSyst, it often proves to be more successful in simulating the biomass of silage maize and water balance. As to berseem, predictions of biomass by CropSyst seem to be more accurate than PILOTE model. The latter was best at predicting the soil water reserve on the soil depth exploited by the roots (0 - 80 cm). Given its ease of integrating daily climatic data for several years, CropSyst model was chosen to test its ability to simulate the crop rotation of berseem and maize silage. The results show that this model correctly simulates the evolution of biomass and yields of the two crops considered in rotation during three years. Modeling the growth and production of alfalfa is made by both models outside the crop installation period (seeding year). After calibration and validation achieved, the model CropSyst simulates adequately biomass and soil water reserve under all water regimes considered while PILOTE best simulations were limited to non-stressed treatment T 1 (100 % ETc). Although CropSyst model takes into account several parameters in the simulation of alfalfa growth, their simplifications (unique values) reduce its performance in more water stress situation. Less parameters considered in the PILOTE model makes it validation difficult for perennial crops such as alfalfa. CropSyst model was used to evaluate irrigation practices of farmers and develop irrigation virtual scenarios for the three crops studied. The assessment shows that virtual scenario developed for alfalfa that applying 1600 mm of irrigation water amount through 14 applications divided into six irrigations during the spring, six in summer, one in the fall and another in early winter maximizes irrigation water efficiency (1. 21 kg/m 3) and achieve a yield of 23. 1 t/ha (95 % of the yield potential). In the case of maize, if water is available, application of 648 mm according to the combination [2 irrigations in initial phase (after sowing), 2 irrigations in linear and two in final phases] allows to achieve high biomass yield and better water use. On berseem, the simulation results confirm that the adoption of the scenario that provides 625 mm through 7 irrigations (3 in autumn, 2 in winter and 2 in spring) allows obtaining 14. 1 t/ha of dry matter which represents 94 % of the yield potential of the 6454 cultivar. This scenario allows greater water efficiency (1. 24 kg/m 3) and results in low water drainage losses estimated at about 17 % of applied water. The comparison of the two cropping systems represented by alfalfa and silage maize-berseem rotation shows that the rotation allows the better water use and mobilizes less water than alfalfa, which is distinguished by its profitability. Finally, the coupling of the results of three years (2008 to 2011) "in situ" experimentations with the simulations of scenarios by CropSyst and PILOTE models has shown to be highly effective in order to improve the folder crops irrigation in the Tadla irrigated area in Morocco. Dans l’objectif d’améliorer la productivité des principales cultures fourragères au périmètre irrigué de Tadla dans des situations hydriques de plus en plus sévères, le présent travail associe l’expérimentation sur terrain et la modélisation. L’étude de la réponse des cultures au déficit hydrique est importante pour maximiser les rendements et améliorer l’efficience d’utilisation de l’eau. Sur le maïs ensilage, les résultats ont montré que le déficit hydrique affecte la croissance en hauteur des plants, accélère la sénescence des feuilles et réduit l’indice de la surface foliaire. Les rendements en matière sèche ont varié de 3, 9 t. ha- 1 sous T 5 (20 % ETc) à 16, 4 t. ha- 1 sous T 1 (100 % ETc). L’efficience d’utilisation de l’eau (EUE) est plus élevée durant la phase linéaire de croissance. L’EUE calculée à la récolte varie entre 2, 99 kg. m- 3 sous T 1 à 1, 84 kg. m- 3 sous T 5. L’évapotranspiration réelle sous T 1 (100 % ETc) est de 478 mm et 463 mm en 2009 et 2010, respectivement. La valeur du coefficient de réponse à l’eau (Ky) du maïs ensilage est de 1, 12. L’ETc du maïs a été déterminé par lysimètre à drainage à 415 mm. Les valeurs moyennes obtenues des coefficients culturaux sont de 0, 56, 1, 22 et 1, 05 pour le stade initial, mi-saison et avant la récolte (stade grain laiteux pâteux) respectivement. L’irrigation localisée permet d’obtenir des rendements similaires au système gravitaire mais avec des apports hydriques très réduits et permet ainsi d’économiser environ 30 % de l’eau d’irrigation. Sur des périodes de culture du bersim de 5 <b>cycles,</b> les rendements <b>en</b> biomasse atteints sous le régime T 1 sont de 14, 3 et 13, 9 t/ha en 2009 / 10 et 2010 / 11 respectivement.

La productivité journalière du bersim augmente avec plus d’apport en eau avec comme valeur maximale 102 kg MS/ha/jour. Le taux de matière sèche augmente avec|$|R
