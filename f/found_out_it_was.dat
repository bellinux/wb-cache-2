South Australian police collected the shoebox-sized piece and {{it was to be}} delivered to the ATSB for further investigation. The examination <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not from the missing aircraft.|$|E

He did so without {{understanding}} why, but <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to enable the chief to bite off the nose of a new wife who refused to sleep with him. Jewitt unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade him from carrying out this traditional punishment (p.207).|$|E
25|$|Osbourne {{experienced}} tremors {{for some}} years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In May 2005, he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne {{will have to take}} daily medication {{for the rest of his}} life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they say. At the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.|$|E

500|$|After {{experiencing}} headaches {{upon his}} arrival to America, N'Diaye saw {{a doctor and}} {{it was discovered that}} he was suffering from a golf ball-sized tumor in his pituitary gland, which had caused his excessive growth and was threatening his vision. Afterwards, he recalled the moment, [...] "For me, it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t know what a tumor was. Once I <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> tough to hear I had one." [...] The condition was treated in the Hoag Memorial Hospital following several charitable donations from around the area. A married couple who lived in Huntington Beach, California, a city close to N'Diaye's future school, offered to become his guardians to ease his commute for medical treatment.|$|E
500|$|Riding {{the train}} were Ralph Budd, Edward G. Budd, H. L. Hamilton, {{president}} of the Winton Motor Company (at that time {{a part of the}} new General Motors Electro-Motive Division), a number of reporters, some Burlington employees, members of the public, and Zeph, a burro that was contributed by a Colorado newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News, as a mascot for the train. The newspaper had described Zeph to the railroad as a [...] "Rocky Mountain canary" [...] so the train's crew had originally planned only enough space for a birdcage; when they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a bird, the railroad hastily built a pen in the baggage section and bought some hay for it. When asked about the burro, Ralph Budd replied [...] "why not? One more jackass on this trip won't make a difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E

500|$|The writers {{also use}} the {{newsgroup}} to test how observant the fans are. In the seventh-season episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI", the writer of segment Homer3, David S. Cohen, deliberately inserted a false equation into the background of one scene. The equation that appears is 178212 + 184112 = 192212. Although a false statement, {{it appears to be}} true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision. If it were true, it would disprove Fermat's last theorem, which had just been proven when this episode first aired. Cohen generated this [...] "Fermat near-miss" [...] with a computer program. After the episode aired, Cohen lurked on the newsgroup to see the response; at first there was astonishment when users tested it, but later there was despair when they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only accurate to eight decimal places when expressed in scientific notation.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as {{she said when she}} received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard his story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] to her than the Legion of Honour.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Frank Falzon, the {{homicide}} inspector with the San Francisco police to whom White had {{turned himself in}} after the killings, said that he met with White in 1984, and that at this meeting White had confessed that he had intended to kill not only Moscone and Milk, but another supervisor, Carol Ruth Silver, as well as then-member of the California State Assembly and future San Francisco Mayor, Willie Brown. Falzon quoted White as having said, [...] "I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver, she was the biggest snake ... and Willie Brown, he was masterminding the whole thing." [...] Falzon indicated that he believed White, stating, [...] "I felt like I {{had been hit by}} a sledge-hammer ... I <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a premeditated murder." ...|$|E

2500|$|Herbert sent Baralongs 12 Royal Marines, {{under the}} command of a Corporal Collins, to find the {{surviving}} German sailors aboard Nicosian. As they departed, Herbert told Collins, [...] "Take no prisoners." [...] The Germans were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Steele: [...] "Wegener ran to a cabin on the upper deck -- I later <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head." [...] Corporal Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's death, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, [...] "What about the Lusitania, you bastard!" [...] An alternative account says that the Germans who boarded Nicosian were killed by the freighter's engine room staff; this report apparently came from the officer in command of the muleteers.|$|E
2500|$|According to Mr. Bungle themselves, Kiedis {{had never}} met or spoken to anyone {{involved}} with the band aside from Mike Patton. Patton stated to The A.V. Club, [...] "Our agent {{was in the process}} of booking these festivals, and it was becoming apparent that we'd landed some pretty good ones—one in France, another one in Holland, some big-name festivals.

2500|$|Singer Mike Patton {{was known}} {{to have had a}} bad {{relationship}} with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis, beginning when Kiedis saw Patton performing with Faith No More and accused him of imitating his style. California was scheduled to be released on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Kiedis had Mr. Bungle removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe; as the headlining act at the festivals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear. According to the band members themselves, Kiedis had never met or spoken to anyone involved with Mr. Bungle aside from Mike Patton. Patton explained to The A.V.
