Therefore, this research aims to identify the important factors that affect <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> project management <b>and</b> to assess the degree of project management performance in a <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturer, with the focus on South Johor region. In addition, the research also aims to obtain the correlation between factors affecting project management and project management performance, as well as to develop a prediction model for project management performance. In line with this, a quantitative approach was chosen with the population consisted of all <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers in South Johor, Malaysia. Simple random probability sampling was used to include 53 <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> manufacturers. Data were collected through self administered questionnaires. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis was used. Findings from the study revealed that factor that perceived as important by respondents are human factor, followed by financial, organizational, technological supply chain relationship and physical factor. In term correlation, all factors were positively correlated with project management performance except human factor where regression model suggested that two strongest predictor are technological and supply chain relationship factor. Finding from the study suggested that factor that perceived as the most important is not correlated with project management performance, and the two strong predictors were perceived at medium important level. As such, further study could be conducted to study the implementation of those factors to identify the top of importance level, the effectiveness of the implementation, the focus level of the implementation and at once analyze the challenges and problem thus obtains the remedial strategies...|$|R

40|$|Tool {{selection}} is {{perhaps one of}} the most important functions in a process planning system because the selection of a tool affects the selection of machining parameters, <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> selection, production rate, cost of the product, and the resulting accuracy. Therefore computer-aided tool selection (CATS) is an essential element within a computer-aided process planning (CAPP) system (C. Koulamas, Tool requirements in multi-level machining systems, International Journal of Production Research, 29 (2) (1991) 417 - 437.), and in turn in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) environment. This paper proposes an object-oriented methodology for selecting the tooling parameters for parts in a CIM environment. As this system can be incorporated into both static and dynamic process planning systems, it is termed as Incorporated Tool Selection Systems (ITSS). The steps of the methodology are discussed in detail, together with an example. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith {{the ever}} {{increasing}} demands for {{higher and higher}} accuracy on modern CNC equipment, the manufacturing processes for machining and assembling the structural components are an increasingly important factor in establishing a geometrically correct machine tool. Specifically, flatness, perpendicularity, parallelism, and straightness of interfacing surfaces determine whether the machine tool's basic accuracy. Exhibiting less geometric error allows other errors such as thermal growth, ballscrew pitch error, and control error to be isolated and more easily corrected. The geometric errors are predominately a factor of the machine tool machining and assembly process. Multiple orientations during fixturing in both assembly and machining result in significant distortions to the final assembled product. These {{are a result of}} cutting forces, fixturing deformations, gravity deformations, and bolt force deformation. By analyzing each process in detail using virtual simulation techniques, a high-fidelity model of the corresponding error at each manufacturing step can be achieved that is not physically measurable due to constraints of measurement equipment. Using simulated data as offset data in the machining process {{as well as in the}} <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> design ensures a geometrically accurate final product...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{increasing}} demand {{for an extended}} flexibility to model types and production volumes {{in the manufacture of}} large-size assemblies has generated a growing interest in the reduction of <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixtures</b> deployment during assembly operations. A key factor enabling and sustaining this reduction is the constantly expanding availability of instruments for dimensional measurements of large-size products. However, the increasing complexity of these measurement systems and their set-up procedures may hinder the final users in their effort to assess whether the performance of these instruments is adequate for pre-specified inspection tasks. In this paper, mixed-effects and fixed-effects linear statistical models are proposed as a tool to assess quantitatively the effect of set-up procedures on the uncertainty of measurement results. This approach is demonstrated on a Metris Indoor GPS system (iGPS). The main conclusion is that more than 99 % of the variability in the considered measurements is accounted for by the number of points used in the bundle adjustment procedure during the set-up phase. Also, different regions of the workspace have significantly different error standard deviations and a significant effect on the transient duration of measurement. This is expected to affect adversely the precision and unbiasedness of measurements taken with Indoor GPS when tracking moving objects...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a concept that shows a way to {{automatically}} create a point-based tolerance analysis model out of existing development data. Nowadays solutions for an automated tolerance simulation model creation are using a static approach for the model build-up. For this purpose product-/ production- development data are automatically mapped on preexisting models (e. g. skeleton models). If chances during development process occur, the tolerance simulation models have to be reworked. Today only simple changes in the model can be automated (e. g. change of distribution, tolerance range etc.). A complete new tolerance simulation model build-up process for dynamically changing product-/ production- development information is not possible. To give an application example, tolerance simulation models for sheet metal parts in automotive industry are based on different development data. Before the first simulation model is created (to secure the tolerance concepts etc.), all necessary information have already been developed, e. g. in the automotive industry's development process: part geometry, tolerance information, assembly graph, <b>jig</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> concept, joining location and measurement points. Thus the automated simulation generation should be possible. First step is to describe an interface for a dynamic model creation in tolerance simulation systems. In a second step preprocessing of development data is necessary to map them into tolerance simulation software restrictions. This delivers a solution {{to fill the gap}} between the PDM-/ CAD and the CAT-system. The considered approach for automated tolerance simulation model creation provides the opportunity to build-up the tolerance analysis models highly efficient and almost automatically. Tolerance analysis can then be used to rapidly calculate several options. This offers the possibility to increase the product maturity level at a very early stage of the development process...|$|R
40|$|An {{automotive}} {{body assembly}} system consists of many individual sub- assemblies and {{sheet metal parts}} welded. The objective in this project is to identify the problem that always happens in line assembly. Then improve the problem in line assembly to overcome from the problem arise. Hence make a comparison and find a solution about body assembly to improve the problem from the data analysis. At body assembly process there are several problem could happen such as miss the spot part, dent or hump, scratch, spatter burr and hole to the body during assembly. But the major problem happen at line assembly is spot weld and men mistake. By using 4 M method which includes machine, method, material and man, this problem can be identify easily and effected. As a result there are some problem {{that contributes to the}} problem happen such as logistic problem which involve the wrong part delivery and wrong shipment. Besides that, man power and workability also be the problem to the line assembly. Lack of discipline, behaviour and competency of worker give a worse impact to the company. Wrong workability involves many of tools, machine and man power and affected the production and flow in line assembly. Spot welding becomes a problem when the current voltage supply is not enough and it can work properly. Lastly <b>jigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixture</b> need to be right servicing schedule to make sure the machine and tools are in good condition and avoid the problem happen used it. The method were used to make the analysis data is by making study case at AMM factory which more focus at body assembly line and problem occur during the process. From the data collected, analysis data can be done and improve the problem that always happen in line assembly. Hence it gives benefit to the company either in productivity or working environment from the solution has done...|$|R
