25|$|The time won't be {{that bad}} because {{individual}} records are grouped {{together in a}} <b>disk</b> <b>block.</b> A <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> might be 16 kilobytes. If each record is 160 bytes, then 100 records could be stored in each block. The disk read time above was actually for an entire block. Once the disk head is in position, one or more disk blocks can be read with little delay. With 100 records per block, the last 6 or so comparisons don't need to do any disk reads—the comparisons are all within the last <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> read.|$|E
25|$|TOPS-20 (and {{possibly}} TENEX) used a 0 to 2 level {{tree that}} has similarities to a B-tree. A <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> was 512 36-bit words. If the file {{fit in a}} 512 (29) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical <b>disk</b> <b>block.</b> If the file fit in 218 words, then the directory would point to an aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block. If the file fit in 227 words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index. Consequently, the physical <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> for a 227 word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.|$|E
25|$|The {{trick of}} {{creating}} an auxiliary index can be repeated to make an auxiliary index to the auxiliary index. That would make an aux-aux index that would need only 100 entries and would fit in one <b>disk</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pointers to the <b>disk</b> <b>blocks</b> {{that store}} the file's {{contents}} (see inode pointer structure).|$|R
5000|$|The map {{describes}} which physical <b>disk</b> <b>blocks</b> (extents) map to each virtual {{block of}} the file.|$|R
50|$|In modern computing, {{journaling}} is a capability which ensures {{consistency of}} {{data in the}} file system, despite any power outages or system crash that may occur. XFS provides journaling for file system metadata, where file system updates are first written to a serial journal before the actual <b>disk</b> <b>blocks</b> are updated. The journal is a circular buffer of <b>disk</b> <b>blocks</b> that is not read in normal file system operation.|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same <b>disk</b> <b>block.</b> The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E
25|$|B-trees have {{substantial}} advantages over alternative implementations {{when the time}} to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in secondary storage such as disk drives. By maximizing the number of keys within each internal node, {{the height of the}} tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{required}} because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use {{different types of}} UART chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a <b>disk</b> <b>block.</b> Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in the BIOS or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.|$|E

50|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, data are concatenated {{from the end}} of <b>disk</b> 0 (<b>block</b> A63) to the beginning of <b>disk</b> 1 (<b>block</b> A64); end of <b>disk</b> 1 (<b>block</b> A91) to the beginning of <b>disk</b> 2 (<b>block</b> A92). If RAID 0 were used, then disk 0 and disk 2 would be truncated to 28 blocks, the size of the smallest disk in the array (disk 1) for a total size of 84 blocks.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{operating}} systems require {{the user to}} allocate the maximum size of the file when the file is created. The file can then be allocated as contiguous disk blocks. In that case, to convert the file block address [...] into a <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> address, the operating system simply adds the file block address [...] to {{the address of the}} first <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> constituting the file. The scheme is simple, but the file cannot exceed its created size.|$|E
2500|$|MS-DOS, for example, used {{a simple}} File Allocation Table (FAT). The FAT has an entry for each <b>disk</b> <b>block,</b> and that entry {{identifies}} whether its block {{is used by}} a file and if so, which block (if any) is the next <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> of the same file. So, the allocation of each file is represented as a linked list in the table. In order to find the disk address of file block , the operating system (or disk utility) must sequentially follow the file's linked list in the FAT. Worse, to find a free <b>disk</b> <b>block,</b> it must sequentially scan the FAT. For MS-DOS, {{that was not a}} huge penalty because the disks and files were small and the FAT had few entries and relatively short file chains. In the FAT12 filesystem (used on floppy disks and early hard disks), there were no more than 4,080 [...] entries, and the FAT would usually be resident in memory. As disks got bigger, the FAT architecture began to confront penalties. On a large disk using FAT, {{it may be necessary to}} perform disk reads to learn the disk location of a file block to be read or written.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its use in databases, the B-tree (or [...] ) is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block [...] address into a <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.|$|E

2500|$|If bit 14 (on FAT16) or bit 26 (on FAT32) is cleared, the {{operating}} system has encountered disk I/O errors on startup, a possible indication for bad sectors. Operating systems aware of this extension will interpret this as a recommendation {{to carry out a}} surface scan (SCANDISK) on the next boot. (A similar set of bitflags exists in the FAT12/FAT16 EBPB at offset 0x1A or the FAT32 EBPB at offset 0x36. While the cluster 1 entry can be accessed by file system drivers once they have mounted the volume, the EBPB entry is available even when the volume is not mounted and thus easier to use by <b>disk</b> <b>block</b> device drivers or partitioning tools.) ...|$|E
