2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have <b>HF</b> RDF <b>equipment,</b> so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet."

40|$|Abstract Background Since its {{introduction}} {{in the national}} antenatal care (ANC) system in Tanzania in 2001, little evidence is documented regarding the motivation and performance of health workers (HWs) {{in the provision of}} intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) services in the national ANC clinics and the implications such motivation and performance might have had on HWs and services' compliance with the recommended IPTp delivery guidelines. This paper describes the supply-related drivers of motivation and performance of HWs in administering IPTp doses among other ANC services delivered in public and private health facilities (HFs) in Tanzania, using a case study of Mkuranga and Mufindi districts. Methods Interviews were conducted with 78 HWs participating in the delivery of ANC services in private and public HFs and were supplemented by personal communications with the members of the district council health management team. The research instrument used in the data collection process contained a mixture of closed and open-ended questions. Some of the open-ended questions had to be coded in the form that allowed their analysis quantitatively. Results In both districts, respondents acknowledged IPTp as an essential intervention, but expressed dissatisfaction with their working environments constraining their performance, including health facility (HF) unit understaffing; unsystematic and unfriendly supervision by CHMT members; limited opportunities for HW career development; and poor (HF) infrastructure and staff houses. Data also suggest that poor working conditions negatively affect health workers' motivation to perform for ANC (including IPTp) services. Similarities and differences were noted in terms of motivational factors for ANC service delivery between the HWs employed in private HFs and those in public HFs: those in private facilities were more comfortable with staff residential houses, <b>HF</b> buildings, <b>equipment,</b> availability of water, electricity and cups for clients to use while taking doses under direct observed therapy than their public facility counterparts. Employees in public HFs more acknowledged availability of clinical officers, nurses and midwives than their private facility counterparts. More results are presented and discussed. Conclusion The study shows conditions related to staffing levels, health infrastructure and essential supplies being among the key determinants or drivers of frontline HWs' motivation to deliver ANC services in both private and public HFs. Efforts of the government to meet the maternal health related Millennium Development Goals and targets for specific interventions need to address challenges related to HWs' motivation to perform their duties at their work-places. </p...|$|R

40|$|When Samuel Morse {{invented the}} {{telegraph}} in 1843, meteorologists {{were among the}} first to promote the new technology, as it allowed them to communicate weather observations over large distances in real time. Today, meteorologists continue to be at the forefront of technological innovation, using the latest ICTs to collect, analyze and communicate weather information. Agrometeorologists, who specialize in agricultural applications of weather and climate information, are no exception. This issue of ICT Update illustrates a number of ICTs that are playing a crucial role in the agrometeorologists´ efforts to help farmers improve production, mitigate the impacts of natural hazards, and cope with climate variability and change. The first example relates to the main objective of agro-meteorology - to provide weather information to farmers. There are still many farmers in ACP countries who have limited or no access to reliable weather forecasts to help them plan their activities. Reidner Mumbi and Kelly Sponberg report how RANET is using low-cost satellite radio technology and a network of local radio stations to broadcast weather reports to farmers in the remotest areas. In another example of satellite technology, John Stephenson and Jim Williams describe how low-cost satellite reception systems are making real time weather and climate data more accessible to local natural resource managers. Such satellite receiver systems are getting cheaper, but the same cannot be said of the latest meteorological satellite programme of the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT. Anne Taube explains how the programme will benefit national meteorological services throughout Africa. Pest forecasting is another important area of agrometeorology. Under the right environmental conditions, such as rainfall, wind direction and humidity, insect pest populations can explode, with devastating effects. Keith Cressman explains how the FAO´s eLocust system - a palmtop computer, GPS device and <b>HF</b> radio <b>equipment</b> that run on a car battery is being used to monitor and to provide early warning of outbreaks of desert locusts in the Sahel. In the Caribbean, agrometeorology is above all concerned with natural hazard mitigation. Hurricanes and floods can and often do cause extensive damage to fisheries, farms, and island economies in general. Terry Ally explains how the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) is compiling a catalogue of digital hazard maps that will enable planners to assess flood risks, and small farmers to make sound business decisions. Kees Stigter, one of the world´s leading agrometeorologists, concludes with a cautionary note. He reminds us that ICTs are extremely useful tools, but when it comes to the provision of agrometeorological services to poor farmers, the starting point should always be the technologies and adaptive strategies they have developed themselves.

A relationship between wave variations in f d and magnetic pulsations in the Y -component of the geomagnetic field at Tromsø was detected. The analysis of the magnetic field variations from the IMAGE magnetometer stations shows that ULF waves occurred, not only at Tromsø, but in the adjacent area bounded by geographical latitudes from 70. 5 ° to 68 ° and longitudes from 16 ° to 27 °. It is suggested that the ULF observed can result from superposition of the natural and heater-induced ULF waves. During the substorm expansion a strong stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE) at the third harmonic of the downshifted maximum frequency was found. It is believed that SEE is accompanied by excitation of the VLF waves penetrating into magnetosphere and stimulating the precipitation of the energetic electrons (10 – 40 keV) of about 1 -min duration. This is due to a cyclotron resonant interaction of natural precipitating electrons (1 – 10 keV) with heater-induced whistler waves in the magnetosphere.

The paper describes the topology of the HF HV power supply, power management and controls, and brings the most importantdetails of the implementation. It is found that the HF HV solution achieves several significant improvements over the conventional thyristor system. It is possible to provide more precise control ofthe ESP parameters such as the output voltages and currents. It isalso possible to make a rapid increase or decrease in voltage andto effectuate a very fast response to load changes. Due to this advantages it is possible to suppress the supply quickly in the caseof sparking, reducing the spark energy and the quantity of ionized gasses produced by the electric arc. Reduction in the spark energy is up to 10 times compared to conventional thyristors solution. This means that the erosion of the electrode system is significantly reduced, and that the quality of the collection plates is preserved for much longer periods. At the same time, lower quantity of ionized gasses produced by the spark contribute to much shorter de-ionization intervals, required to quit sparking and evacuate charged particles in order to reinstate the voltage and proceed with the operation. In addition, HF HV power supply provides a significant reduction in size and weight of the complete ESP installation, hence reducing the tons of steel that has to be built in.

Within this paper, in addition to describing the AR 70 / 1000 unit topology and principles of operation, the paper presents the results and measurements obtained during extensive experimental investigations wherein performances of 50 Hz based thyristor units with T/R sets are compared to HF HV power supply...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{large number}} of studies in {{industrial}} waste processing, this field is still a challenge. In this regard, new processing capabilities emerging from the use of high frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) heat equipment are a positive factor to be researched. In HF and MW processing the heating process is determined by absorption of electromagnetic wave power through the processed material. This electromagnetic wave power is transmitted by the substance atoms and spent for heating a sample, polarization, and initiation of chemical reactions. The non-conductor (dielectric and semiconductor) material heat is explained by the existing effect of dielectric losses due to losses caused by the through electrical conductivity and slow processes of polarization. The dielectric losses due to electrical conductivity result from the Joule heat released when through-current flows through the dielectric. The differences in frequency radiation of <b>HF</b> and microwave <b>equipment</b> define their different technological capabilities. HF-radiation represents almost homogeneous field between the plates of a running capacitor. With multiple reflection from the chamber walls MW-radiation is randomly distributed within the chamber. Thus, radiation partly returns to the generator, thereby affecting the equipment performance capability and life time. Microwave heating is uneven. The depth of penetration into the material is much less to HF-processing. HF heating features are high penetration of radiation and uniform heating of the material. Together with pre-pressing it can afford an opportunity to join the non-standard pieces of plastic to have the larger insulating items. The fact of the selective effect on the material is positive when processing the waste. Since the tangent of angle of dielectric losses of materials such as wood is directly proportional to humidity, the heating automatically stops as wood dries. This fact was used to produce for the fuel briquettes, which were modified by waste of polyethylene. Using the authors’ snap enables producing the sawdust briquettes with enhanced heat of combustion. Using the waste of pulp and paper industry was successful in creating the arrays of hydrolytic lignin for their use as a fuel or an insulation material. The presence of temperature gradient contributed to the mass-transfer of low boiling and water-soluble compounds to the sample surface, and, thus, to its hardening. The thermal insulation properties of produced material are higher than those of wood, claydite-concrete, etc. thereby making it advanced for further research. The article draws a conclusion from the theoretical and experimental studies that the use of НF power for of waste processing has unconditional prospects. </p...|$|R
40|$|On 20 July 2004 Reuters {{reported}} that swarms of desert locusts had infested {{large areas of}} Mauritania, and were sweeping into Senegal and Mali. According to a local official, the locusts threatened to destroy crops and spark a food crisis in West Africa´s worst locust plague in 15 years. * The news report came {{five months after the}} UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) first warned of a major locust plague in the making, potentially affecting agricultural production and food security throughout West and Northwest Africa. The FAO based this early warning in part on local meteorological and field survey data that are received daily through the Electronic Locust Information System (eLocust). The desert locust, a creature similar to a grasshopper, breeds in the deserts of North Africa. Most years, the locusts stay within their breeding grounds. They are normally solitary, scattered insects but when climatic conditions are favourable, such as after a period of good rains and mild temperatures, they can rapidly increase in number. As the rainy season ends, the locusts tend to group together in the remaining areas of green vegetation. They then change their behaviour and appearance, and form enormous swarms that can devastate entire crop fields in minutes, and can travel more than 120 km per day. They can easily cross the Red Sea into the Arabian Peninsula and even to India, depending on the prevailing winds. They have even been known to reach the UK and the Caribbean. Since the last desert locust plague of 1987 - 89, the FAO has been actively involved in strengthening the early warning and reaction capacities of the affected countries. Most of these countries have now established national locust units with teams of specialists who conduct regular field surveys using four-wheel drive vehicles equipped with eLocust monitoring and data transmission equipment. The eLocust system consists of a palmtop computer (Psion 5 mx), a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) device, and <b>HF</b> radio <b>equipment</b> (a mobile transceiver and data modem), all of which run on the vehicle´s battery. The palmtop is equipped with a customized database and shareware software (PsiDat, RealMaps). Each day, between sunrise and sunset, a field survey team makes about a dozen stops to monitor environmental conditions, such as vegetation, temperature, rainfall and soil moisture. They are also on the lookout for locusts, and interview nomads, travellers, villagers and farmers along the way. At each survey and control location, the field officer opens a new record in the database and enters relevant data. He taps on the touch-sensitive screen with a stylus to select the appropriate items from a drop-down menu, and uses the full keyboard to enter the names of locations and general comments. The GPS device automatically adds the coordinates, date and time to the record, which is then stored in the computer database. Different types of maps can be linked to the database, including satellite imagery such as Landsat or maps showing the extent of locust infestations in the past. The field team can view different combinations of the data as well as the survey route using the RealMaps software. Almost any type of map can be loaded onto the Psion. At scheduled times throughout the day, the officer connects the Psion to the HF radio and data modem inside the vehicle and within a minute or so transmits the data to the national locust centre. With the eLocust system, data transmission is much faster and more reliable than in the past, when field officers recorded their observations on paper forms, which were then sent to the national centre. Most important, the data they send are now automatically included in a national geographic information system (GIS), together with data from the national meteorological service, such as temperature, humidity, wind direction and atmospheric pressure, and forwarded to the Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS) at FAO headquarters in Rome for analysis. Nearly 20 locust-affected countries are currently using the eLocust system. A French version is available for use in at least seven of these countries. Data from the remotest parts of Africa now arrive at the FAO in a matter of minutes. This has led to significant improvements in analysis and forecasting, enabling the affected countries to take steps to reduce the frequency of desert locust outbreaks. During the current crisis the system is being used to track the movements of locust swarms, and to identify locations where targeted ground and aerial spraying could minimize their devastating consequences for farmers in some of the world´s poorest countries. mailto:Keith.

40|$|A {{herdsman}} in the semi-desert {{region of}} northern Niger winds up his radio and tunes {{in to the}} daily weather report, {{in the hope that}} it will help him find suitable grazing pasture for his cattle. The programme, broadcast by a community-owned FM radio station in a village some 15 km away, is based on information downloaded via a digital satellite radio receiver. The same broadcast also features a request for assistance from another herdsman who has lost some of his animals. Later that day the station broadcasts discussions on health issues in four local languages. The sun is setting, but for a few more hours the solar-powered transmitter will still be able to broadcast local music, national news, and messages from migrants to loved ones at home. This scenario is the goal of RANET (Rural Communications using Radio and the Internet), an international collaboration that is helping to make weather, climate and related information accessible to communities in remotest areas of Africa, Asia and the Pacific. RANET works with national meteorological services to improve their outreach to rural communities, which will ultimately strengthen the agencies themselves. In addition, the programme forms partnerships with local NGOs and other development organizations to ensure that the information in the community radio broadcasts is relevant {{to the needs of the}} local population, and that it will help them to cope with adverse weather, and improve their livelihoods. RANET is often associated with the WorldSpace digital satellite system, which enables audio broadcasts and one-way data transfers to anywhere in Africa, Asia and the western Pacific. Working through First Voice International (formerly the WorldSpace Foundation) RANET uses reserve capacity on the satellite system to transmit current weather information including maps and charts to weather stations, rural radio stations and community centres in remote areas. The information is received by special digital radio receivers provided to partner groups at low cost. The networks RANET develops, however, are not limited solely to the WorldSpace system. The programme works with a variety of partners to standardize appropriate FM community radio station <b>equipment,</b> <b>HF</b> systems, and even energy solutions. By bringing together various appropriate and sustainable technologies, RANET is supporting ´human networks´ of dialogue and partnership that serve as the basis for sharing knowledge that will improve the lives of communities in remote areas. The most important element of RANET´s strategy is to encourage broad local ownership. Each radio station or satellite receiver system is locally owned. RANET rarely funds an activity in full, but requires the participants - regional, national or local - to demonstrate the need for and value of the system and then to mobilize in-kind and local resources to operate it. In Zambia, for example, in July 2004 a team of RANET members and the national programme coordinator visited the Mumbwa community radio station, which is now under development. The community has organized an association, is raising funds to refurbish a building for the station, and has constructed a radio mast with the help of another local partner. During the visit, RANET members were able to offer technical advice on the most affordable and durable equipment, and on how to obtain a broadcast licence, as well as to discuss the association´s plans for covering operating costs, programme development, and energy supply options. While it may take another six months or more for the Mumbwa radio station to become operational, the extended process of planning and dialogue will help to ensure that the station is firmly rooted and will have broad community support when it begins broadcasting, thus helping to ensure the sustainability of the service. RANET believes that as well as providing assistance to the station operators, it is just as important to hold dialogues with potential listeners to determine their needs. Thus, in Zambia, RANET members recently visited the Mazabuka community radio station, where they met with local weather service staff, station operators and local farmers. During the dialogue they discussed technical aspects such as coverage and reception, as well as programming issues such as the timing of broadcasts so that they reach the largest audience. The farmers were able to talk about the past growing season and their needs in terms of weather forecasts, observations and even hazard warnings. Although some requests may have been beyond RANET´s scientific capacities, the farmers suggested a number of changes in format or content that could easily be accommodated, such as using more familiar local place names in the forecasts. Such fine-tuning can often mean the difference between a forecast being used to good effect, or ignored completely. The partnerships with various national agencies, international organizations and local communities help to ensure the sustainability of RANET´s communication networks. Most important, however, the process of dialogue leads to the effective dissemination and application of weather and climate information, thereby reducing the vulnerability of rural farming and other communities to seasonal weather fluctuations and other natural hazards. mailto:rmumbi@meteo-zambia. net Reidner Mumbi is Director of RANET Zambia, and mailto:kelly. sponberg@noaa. gov Kelly Sponberg is RANET Program Coordinator at US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
