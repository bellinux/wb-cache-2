5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days <b>in</b> <b>jail,</b> <b>and</b> fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E

5|$|Chrissie {{discovers that}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, {{and she and}} Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 he was {{approached}} by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, who was arrested by the Ottomans, like he did for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli's refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli's life was saved {{at the last minute}} by fellow inmate, al-Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more months in jail, before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, who served as a deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was <b>in</b> <b>jail,</b> <b>and</b> Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, cigarette-smoking {{policies}} {{have become increasingly}} restrictive <b>in</b> <b>jails</b> <b>and</b> prisons across the United States. Cigarette black markets of various form and scale often emerge <b>in</b> <b>jails</b> <b>and</b> prisons where tobacco is prohibited or banned. Case studies of 16 <b>jails</b> <b>and</b> prisons were undertaken to understand the effects of ciga-rette bans versus restrictions on inmate culture and prison economies. This study describes how bans can transform largely benign cigarette “gray markets, ” where cigarettes are used as a currency, into more problematic black markets, where ciga-rettes are a highly priced commodity. Analysis points to several structural factors that affected the development of cigarette black markets in the visited facilities: the archi-tectural design, inmate movement inside and outside, officer involvement in smug-gling cigarettes to inmates, and officer vigilance in enforcing the smoking policy. Although these factors affect the influx {{of other types of}} contraband into correctional facilities, such as illegal drugs, this study argues that the demand and availability of cigarettes creates a unique kind of black market. Since the mid- 1980 s, cigarette-smoking {{policies have}} become increas-ingly restrictive <b>in</b> <b>jails</b> <b>and</b> prisons across the United States. Currently, two thirds of U. S. <b>jails</b> <b>and</b> one quarter of U. S. prisons ban inmates from smoking cigarettes or possessing tobacco (Falkin, Strauss, & Lankenau, 1998, 1999). In institutions where bans are enforced, inmates are prohibited from smokin...|$|R
