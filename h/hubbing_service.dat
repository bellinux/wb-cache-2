30|$|At the moment, Hubbub only {{supports}} resource representations in the Atom and RSS feed formats as {{they allow}} the documents to contain links to related resources, in this case, to <b>hub</b> <b>services.</b> However, we extend these capabilities by adding support to other possible representations. References to <b>hub</b> <b>services</b> are expected as links within documents {{or as an}} attribute in service's descriptions. In this way, services that cannot include links in the representations because of limitations in data formats, can point to a <b>hub</b> in the <b>service's</b> description. Additionally, if a service declares to implement the Hubbub protocol but does not point to a hub in any ways, an execution engine will search for an available <b>hub</b> <b>service</b> in the environment {{to use it for}} event notifications during the application flow.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{constant}} performance upgrades and regular price reductions of mobile devices in recent years, users are {{able to take advantage}} of the various devices to obtain digital con-tent regardless of the limitations of time and place. The increasing use of e-books has stimu-lated new e-learning approaches. This research project developed an e-book <b>hub</b> <b>service</b> on a cloud computing platform in order to overcome the limitations of computing capability and storage capacity that are inherent in many mobile devices. The e-book <b>hub</b> <b>service</b> also allows users to automatically adjust the rendering of multimedia pages at different resolu-tions on terminal units such as smartphones, tablets, PCs, and so forth. We implemented an e-book <b>hub</b> <b>service</b> on OpenStack, which is a free and open-source cloud computing platform supported by multiple large firms. The OpenStack platform provides a large-scale distributed computing environment that allows users to build their own cloud systems in a public, private, or hybrid environment. Our e-book hub system offers content providers an easy-to-use cloud computing service with unlimited storage capacity, fluent playback, high usability and scalability, and high security characteristics to produce, convert, and man-age their e-books. The integration of information and communication technologies has led the traditional publishing industry to new horizons with abundant digital content publica-tions. Results from this study may help content providers create a new service model with increased profitability and enable mobile device users to easily get digital content, thereby achieving the goal of e-learning...|$|R
