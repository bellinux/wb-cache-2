500|$|Tyler's {{presidency}} {{has provoked}} highly divided responses among political commentators. It is generally held in low esteem by historians; Edward P. Crapol began his biography John Tyler, the Accidental President (2006) by noting: [...] "Other biographers and historians {{have argued that}} John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed." [...] In The Republican Vision of John Tyler (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency [...] "is generally ranked {{as one of the}} least successful". Seager wrote that Tyler [...] "was neither a <b>great</b> <b>president</b> nor a great intellectual," [...] adding that despite a few achievements, [...] "his administration has been and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment". A survey of historians conducted by C-SPAN in 2017 ranked Tyler as 39th of 43 men to hold the office.|$|E

500|$|The {{motorcade}} {{arrived at}} the Cathedral and Reagan's casket was removed. The bearers carrying it paused on the Cathedral steps, and an opening prayer was given by Bishop John Bryson Chane, Dean of the Washington National Cathedral. The casket was then carried down the aisle; the Reagan family followed and Nancy Reagan was escorted to her seat by President Bush. Rabbi Harold Kushner and Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (the first female Supreme Court justice, whom Reagan appointed), then each gave a reading, which preceded the eulogies. The choir then sang hymns—"Faire is the Heaven"; [...] "Bring Us, O Lord"; [...] "And I saw a New Heaven"—before Thatcher delivered the first eulogy. In view of her failing mental faculties following several small strokes, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier and was broadcast throughout the Cathedral on plasma television screens.

Trump planned to use the committee, not to raise money—he would personally fund his campaign—but to advise him on political matters {{in preparation for a}} run. In the interview with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances indicating a [...] "very strong possibility" [...] of victory. He referenced a non-scientific National Enquirer poll of 100 individuals, showing him in first place against his Democratic and Republican counterparts. [...] When pressed, Trump identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running mate, describing her as [...] "somebody that is very special," [...] and that if she agreed to run, [...] "she'd be fantastic [...] [...] [...] she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman." [...] Oprah's spokesperson later responded [...] "at this point in time [...] [...] [...] Oprah is not running." [...] Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani the greatest Mayor of New York and spoke admirably of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenomenal spirit in the nation. [...] Trump argued that President Bill Clinton could have been a <b>great</b> <b>president,</b> but destroyed his legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. [...] As for the Reform Party, Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and attacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone [...] "enamored" [...] with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan's thesis that Hitler presented no military threat to the United States ahead of World War II.|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed {{legislation}} for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating {{that he hoped}} to have it approved by the full House {{in time for the}} late president's birthday on October 14. On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against {{the manner in which the}} legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman H. R. Gross objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: [...] "You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal." [...] Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator Peter Dominick, calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from Mamie Eisenhower, recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890. Idaho Senator James McClure stated, [...] "It is somehow beneath the dignity of a <b>great</b> <b>president</b> like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin." [...] On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative Robert R. Casey introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent Apollo 11 Moon landing. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar. Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, [...] "We came in peace for all mankind", to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.|$|E

60|$|That {{afternoon}} Cynthia and {{her father}} walked through the green park to make their {{first visit to the}} State House.

Wetherell seemed to feel again the thrill he felt when he saw the blue-clad men of this state crowded in the train at Boston: and to hear again the cheers, and the sobs, and the prayers as he looked upon the blood that stained stars and stripes alike with a holy stain. With that blood the country had been consecrated, and the state--yes, and the building where they stood. So they went on up the stairs, reverently, nor heeded the noise of those in groups about them, and through a door into the great hall of the representatives of the state.|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{will not}} {{pretend to be}} {{anything}} but a strong partizan in this matter. When I speak of [...] "democracy" [...] I mean [...] "selective democracy." [...] I believe that [...] "delegate democracy" [...] is already provably a failure in the world, and that the reason why to-day, after {{three and a half years}} of struggle, we are still fighting German autocracy and fighting with no certainty of absolute victory, is because the affairs of the three great Atlantic democracies have been largely in the hands not of selected men but of delegated men, men of intrigue and the party machine, of dodges rather than initiatives, second-rate men. When Lord Haldane, defending his party for certain insufficiencies in their preparation for the eventuality of the great war, pleaded that they had no [...] "mandate" [...] from the country to do anything of the sort, he did more than commit political suicide, he bore conclusive witness against the whole system which had made him what he was. Neither Britain nor France in this struggle has produced better statesmen nor better generals than the German autocracy. The British and French Foreign Offices are old monarchist organizations still. To this day the British and French politicians haggle and argue with the German ministers upon petty points and debating society advantages, smart and cunning, while the peoples perish. The one man who has risen to the greatness of this great occasion, the man who is, in default of any rival, rapidly becoming the leader of the world towards peace, is neither a delegate politician nor the choice of a monarch and his councillors. He is the one authoritative figure in these transactions whose mind has not been subdued either by long discipline in the party machine or by court intrigue, who has continued his education beyond those early twenties when the mind of the [...] "budding politician" [...] ceases to expand, who has thought, and thought things out, who is an educated man among dexterous under-educated specialists. By something very like a belated accident in the framing of the American constitution, the President of the United States is more in the nature of a selected man than any other conspicuous figure at the present time. He is specially elected by a special electoral college after an elaborate preliminary selection of candidates by the two great party machines. And be it remembered that Mr. Wilson is not the first <b>great</b> <b>President</b> the United States have had, he is one of a series of figures who tower over their European contemporaries. The United States have had many advantageous circumstances to thank for their present ascendancy in the world's affairs: isolation from militarist pressure for a century and a quarter, a vast virgin continent, plenty of land, freedom from centralization, freedom from titles and social vulgarities, common schools, a real democratic spirit in its people, and a great enthusiasm for universities; but no single advantage has been so great as this happy accident which has given it a specially selected man as its voice and figurehead in the world's affairs. In the average congressman, in the average senator, as Ostrogorski's great book so industriously demonstrated, the United States have no great occasion for pride. Neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives seem to rise above the level of the British Houses of Parliament, with a Government unable to control the rebel forces of Ulster, unable to promote or dismiss generals without an outcry, weakly amenable to the press, and terrifyingly incapable of great designs. It is to the United States of America we must look now if the world is to be made [...] "safe for democracy." [...] It is to the method of selection, as distinguished from delegation, that we must look if democracy is to be saved from itself.|$|E
