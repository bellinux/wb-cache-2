5|$|The bottom line, {{with the}} signing of the treaty, was that any capital ships under {{construction}} by the five signatories (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) had to be canceled and scrapped. For battlecruisers, this encompassed the United States Lexington class, Japan's , and Great Britain's G3 battlecruisers. For the U.S. Navy, the choice seemed clear. If it scrapped all six Lexingtons in accordance with the treaty, it would throw away $13.4 million that could otherwise <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> aircraft carriers. The Navy opted for the latter course.|$|E

5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 2014, JPMorgan Chase {{announced}} that it was injecting $100 million over five years into Detroit's economy, providing development funding for a variety of projects that would increase employment. It is the largest commitment made to any one city by the nation's biggest bank. Of the $100 million, $50 million will <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> development projects, $25 million will <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> city blight removal, $12.5 million will go for job training, $7 million will go for small businesses in the city, and $5.5 million will <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> the M-1 light rail project (Qline). On May 19, 2015, JPMorgan Chase {{announced that}} it has invested $32 million for two redevelopment projects in the city's Capitol Park district, the Capitol Park Lofts (the former Capitol Park Building) and the Detroit Savings Bank building at 1212 Griswold. Those investments are separate from Chase's five-year, $100-million commitment. On May 10, 2017, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced a $50 million increase in the $100 million investment the firm committed to economic development and neighborhood stabilization in Detroit by 2019. Half of the $150 million will be grants and the other half is going to toward a variety of loan funds for small business growth, mixed-use real estate development and residential housing projects.|$|E

25|$|The {{taxation}} methods {{imposed on}} the Low Countries under the Habsburgs were mainly targeted at providing money for military operations. Under Charles V, taxes in the Netherlands were raised fivefold {{in order to accommodate}} his conflict with the French. The money that the populations of the Low Countries paid did not <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> forging a national state which could unite them under one nationality. On the contrary the Low Countries were an integrated, prosperous, densely populated, and developing part of the Habsburg empire.|$|E
25|$|In one's own {{half the}} aim of a throw-in may be to retain {{possession}} {{in order to build}} up the next attack. The throw may or may not <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> the opponents' goal; the most unmarked player may be a full-back who is behind the ball. Such a throw followed by a quickly taken 'switch' pass can be an effective tactic. Under pressure however, the ball is often thrown up the line, toward the opponents' goal line to gain as much ground as possible.|$|E

25|$|Among {{those who}} opposed the canal {{expansion}} proposal is Panama's construction workers' union, SUNTRACS. The union's secretary general, Genaro Lopez, argued that while some construction jobs would be created by the project, the debt that Panama incurs to build a third set of locks will not be defrayed by increased canal usage and thus an increased part of canal revenues will <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> paying the debt, reducing the waterway's contributions to the national government's general fund, in turn reducing the money available for road projects, public schools, police protection, and other government services.|$|E

25|$|In February 1983, after {{relations}} between Irsay {{and the city}} of Baltimore had deteriorated significantly, Baltimore Mayor Schaefer asked the Maryland General Assembly to approve $15 million for renovation to Memorial Stadium. The legislature did not approve the request until the following spring, after the Colts' lease had expired, and only half of that $15 million would <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> improvements that the Colts were seeking (The other half for the Orioles'). However, Baltimore reportedly did offer Irsay a $15 million loan at 6.5%, a guarantee of at least 43,000 tickets sold per game for six years, and the purchase of the team's Owings Mills training facility for $4 million.|$|E
25|$|In February 1990, Governor HernÃ¡ndez ColÃ³n â {{serving his}} {{third and final}} term â {{proposed}} {{the sale of the}} PRTC to Bell Atlantic (which merged with GTE in 2000 to create Verizon Communications). HernÃ¡ndez ColÃ³n suggested that proceeds from the sale would <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> public education and improved infrastructure. Labor unions in Puerto Rico opposed the sale, however, and on 28 March 3,800 telephone workers went on a one-day strike. On the same day, a march 150,000 Puerto Ricans proceeded to the capitol building in San Juan. This activity â in addition to a law requiring a $3 billion sale price and a ban on firings for 18 months â blocked the proposed sale.|$|E

President Taft, Representative Champ Clark, Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson, and Virginia Governor William Hodges Mann all spoke at the February 22 meeting. The George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association (GWMNMA) was formed at this meeting, and plans were adopted to raise $500,000 to <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> the cost of construction and another $500,000 for an endowment and maintenance fund.

25|$|A {{part of the}} Rutgers University Department of Athletic Communications, RVision, is {{a digital}} media network that is {{responsible}} for providing live and highlight video coverage of many Rutgers intercollegiate athletic events. Created in 2009, RVision broadcasts more than 100 live events in addition to countless interviews and game highlights posted by the RVision staff on ScarletKnights.com. With the recent addition of Rutgers to the Big Ten Conference in 2014, RVision set up a fundraiser nicknamed RStarter. RStarter's goal was to raise $30,000 to improve all aspects of RVision and bring even better coverage of all sports to Rutgers fans. RStarter's proceeds would <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> the purchase of new cameras, laptops and student stipends. By the start of the opening day for football on August 28, 2014, fans and supporters came together and raised over $32,000 for the RVision Network.|$|E
25|$|World War II nearly {{proved to}} be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime {{registration}} showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing college. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to <b>go</b> <b>toward</b> an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaignâLynch Memorial. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.|$|E
