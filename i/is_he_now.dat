25|$|Coach Kermit Davis {{broke the}} all-time {{coaching}} wins record, previously held by Earle, with a 68-56 win over Ole Miss on December 21. The win was especially sweet for Davis. Not only <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> the winningest coach in Blue Raiders history, {{but he also}} graduated from the Rebels biggest rival, Mississippi State. On January 26, Middle Tennessee beat Troy 71-58 to earn their 20th win of the season, {{the first time the}} school had reached that mark since the 1990-91 season. And on February 18 the Blue Raiders defeated Florida Atlantic to earn their 24th win and break the school's single season wins record. The team finished the regular season 25-5 overall and 14-2 in the Sun Belt Conference, earning them their first ever outright championship of the league.|$|E

6000|$|... "Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> He {{is the man}} {{who caused}} me all my trouble. Just let me get at him! He covered up his tracks pretty well, but I've now got the {{evidence}} against him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Mr. Dutton, if I could {{pray for}} him; but the turmoil {{seems to have}} driven away all such things! My boy, my boy, where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> Who has heard him say his little prayers?' ...|$|E
60|$|And where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> Where {{those will}} never come--let false preachers and false priests flatter {{them as they}} may--who fancy {{that they can get}} to heaven without being good and doing good. Where those will never come, likewise, who, when they find {{themselves}} in trouble, try to help themselves out of it by false and mean methods; and so begin worshipping the devil, just when they have most need to worship God. He is where the fearful and unbelievers and all liars can never come. He is with the Word of the Lord, who endureth for ever in heaven.|$|E
60|$|A {{great and}} awful disgust filled his whole heart. It <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> who <b>was</b> {{conscious}} of the loathsome web, which had enveloped him more completely {{than he had ever}} anticipated.|$|R

60|$|For {{just one}} moment we have a seeming flash of {{comprehension}} of, the Kanaka's reason for exiling himself: he goes away to acquire civilization. Yes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> naked and not ashamed, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> clothed and knows how to <b>be</b> ashamed; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unenlightened; <b>now</b> <b>he</b> has a Waterbury watch; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unrefined, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> has jewelry, and something to make him smell good; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a nobody, a provincial, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> to far countries and can show off.|$|R

6000|$|... "And what <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now,</b> then," [...] said Dalgetty, [...] "that {{he thinks}} it fitting to lie upon the lowest step of the stairs, and clew'd up like a hurchin, that honourable cavaliers, who chance to be in trouble, may break their noses over him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh!' said Quilp, {{drawing in}} his breath with great relish {{as if he}} were taking soup, 'you and I will have such a {{settling}} presently; there's such a scratching and bruising in store for you, my dear young friend! Aha! Nelly! How <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now,</b> my duck of diamonds?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, friend," [...] said a quiet voice. It {{was that}} of the Moslem captain, Yusuf, he who befriended us when we arrived at Alexandria, who had been {{watching}} all this scene. [...] "Then you serve a great general, as some of us have cause to know. Tell me, where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now,</b> for I hear that he has left Lesbos?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir Edmund Acour, for I {{take it you}} <b>are</b> <b>he.</b> <b>Now</b> I {{shall never}} forget you again, for though a man may shift his armour he cannot change his countenance"--a saying at which de Noyon {{coloured}} a little and looked down uneasily.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> an officer, naval officer, or {{at least}} <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> trades and hunts. We are coming down from Natal. But what's your name?" ...|$|R

60|$|Yes. Thought so. Sloping {{into the}} Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen's. Broth of a boy.

Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat. Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white hat. His parboiled eyes. Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> Beggar somewhere. The harp that once did starve us all.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few days}} after the ball Roger Carbury was up in town and was closeted with her in her back drawing-room. The {{declared}} cause of his coming was the condition of the baronet's affairs and the indispensable necessity,--so Roger thought,--of taking some steps by which at any rate the young man's present expenses might be brought to an end. It was horrible to him that a man who had not a shilling in the world or any prospect of a shilling, who had nothing and never thought of earning anything should have hunters! He was very much in earnest about it, and quite prepared to speak his mind to the young man himself,--if he could get hold of him. 'Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now,</b> Lady Carbury,--at this moment?' ...|$|E
60|$|After {{what he had}} heard, Mr. Fenwick {{declined}} {{going into}} the mill-house, and returned home without seeing Mrs. Brattle and her daughters.

60|$|An oath was Joseph's only answer--a curse it {{was upon}} his own folly and assurance. A {{little while ago}} he had thought to have drawn so tight a net about this ruler, and here <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> taken in its very toils, well-nigh {{exhausted}} and in his enemy's power.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} to say to it," [...] said Harold Smith, looking up very solemnly from under the {{penthouse}} of his hat, and, perhaps, rather savagely. Sowerby had supported the Government at the late crisis; but why <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> seen herding with such a one as Supplehouse? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. You don't know. They," [...] said Psmith, {{indicating}} the rest {{with a wave}} of the hand, [...] "don't know. Nobody knows. His locality is as hard to ascertain as that of a black cat in a coal-cellar on a moonless night. Shortly before I joined this journal, Mr. Wilberfloss, by his doctor's orders, started out on a holiday, leaving no address. No letters were to be forwarded. He was to enjoy complete rest. Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> Who shall say? Possibly legging it down some rugged slope in the Rockies, with two bears and a wild cat in earnest pursuit. Possibly in the midst of some Florida everglade, making a noise like a piece of meat in order to snare crocodiles. Possibly in Canada, baiting moose-traps. We have no data." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will take}} it as a working {{hypothesis}} for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now,</b> and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties." ...|$|E
6000|$|On this {{particular}} occasion, {{as he reached}} the Frenchman's plot, Tu-Kila-Kila stepped forward across the white taboo-line with a suspicious and peering eye. [...] "The King of the Rain has been here," [...] he said, in a pompous tone, as the Frenchman rose and saluted him ceremoniously. [...] "Tu-Kila-Kila's eyes are sharp. They never sleep. The sun is his sight. He beholds all things. You cannot hide aught in heaven or earth from the knowledge of him that dwells in heaven. I look down upon land and sea, and spy out all that takes place or is planned in them. I am very holy and very cruel. I see all earth and I drink the blood of all men. The King of the Rain has come this morning to visit the King of the Birds. Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>now?</b> What has your divinity done with him?" ...|$|E
