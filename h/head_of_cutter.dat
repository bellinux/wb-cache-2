50|$|The first {{electric}} razor was patented in 1930 by the American manufacturer Col. Jacob Schick. The Remington Rand Corporation {{developed the}} electric razor further, first producing the Remington brand of razor in 1937. Another important inventor was Prof. Alexandre Horowitz, from Philips Laboratories in the Netherlands, {{who invented the}} very successful concept of the revolving (rotary) electric razor. It has a shaving <b>head</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> that cut off the hair entering the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the razor at skin level. The major manufacturers introduce new improvements to the haircutting mechanism of their products every few years. Each manufacturer sells several different generations of cutting mechanism at the same time, and for each generation, several models with different features and accessories to reach various price points. The improvements to the cutting mechanisms tend to 'trickle-down' to lower priced models over time.Early versions of electric razors {{were meant to be}} used on dry skin only. Many recent electric razors have been designed to allow for wet/dry use, which also allows them to be cleaned using running water or an included cleaning machine, reducing cleaning effort. Some patience is necessary when starting to use a razor of this type, as the skin usually takes some time to adjust to the way that the electric razor lifts and cuts the hairs. Moisturizers designed specifically for electric shaving are available.|$|R

The vapour appeared to have become packed into a mass of some eighty or a hundred feet in height, leaving a perfectly clear atmosphere above it. In the clear air, were visible the upper spars and canvass of the entire fleet mentioned by the stranger; sixteen sail in all. There were the eleven two-deckers, and the three frigates, rising in pyramids of canvass, still fanning in towards the anchorage, which in that roadstead was within pistol-shot of the shore; while the royals and {{upper part of the}} topgallant sails of the sloop seemed to stand {{on the surface of the}} fog, like a monument. After a moment's pause, Wychecombe discovered even the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cutter's</b> royal-mast, with the pennant lazily fluttering ahead of it, partly concealed in vapour.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the influence of working conditions on the duration <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> participation in group work skidding. Two main theoretical assumptions were considered. First, working conditions that decrease the skidding efficiency increase the time <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> assistance, because {{the group as a}} whole strives to improve efficiency, and second, the duration of assistance to the working group is specific regardless of working conditions. The research included 5 places of research (compartments) in Slovenian state forests, with 3 working groups consisting <b>of</b> two <b>cutters</b> and a cable skidder driver. All working groups used the cable skidder IWAFUJI–T 41. The model included 100 cycles of downhill timber skidding. We have established that the duration <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> assistance is reciprocal to the skidding distance, average bunching distance and number of logs in the load. The model accounts for 40. 7 % of the whole variability. After excluding the influence of working conditions between the groups, there are no typical differences in the duration <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> assistance. Results imply that the number of working group members should be adjusted to working conditions. On the other hand, insignificant differences <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> assistance duration between the groups show that the mere group daily standard is a motivational factor big enough for the rationalization of group work of workers who are not additionally educated and qualified for group work...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, carbide {{end mills}} are widely {{utilized}} in the aluminum, titanium and steel cutting industries, so the {{more and more}} high-precision requirements to design <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> are provided by users.

For this purpose, many research works have been successfully conducted on optimizing the geometry model <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> to get more real and easy controlled geometry; however, another critical factor, there are still more space to optimize the geometry model <b>of</b> <b>cutters.</b> To finish this task, in this work, first, a method has been established and implemented in the MATLAB to convert mathematic model into a free-form geometry model.

40|$|Calculation of the {{swept volume}} <b>of</b> a <b>cutter</b> {{is the heart}} of any {{numerical}} controlled (NC) simulation system. In NC machining, a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>cutter</b> shapes are used such as flat end mills, dome end mills, ball nose end mills, angle cutters, face mills and side-and-face cutters. There are also many types <b>of</b> <b>cutter</b> paths along which the cutter is guided by the NC controller: rapid motion, linear motion and circular motion are the most commonly used cutter paths among them.

30|$|For the hardness-alternating formation, {{there are}} several phenomena: (1) part <b>of</b> the <b>cutters</b> will cut hard rock, these cutters will bear a large impact load, and the impact load can not only cause impact damage <b>of</b> <b>cutters,</b> but also reduce the {{stability}} of PDC bit; (2) DC bit will bear large lateral imbalance force, which lead the reverse circumnutation (whirling motion) of bit. The stress state <b>of</b> <b>cutter</b> change continuously, and the cutting area <b>of</b> each <b>cutter</b> is unstable, which will exacerbate the impact force consequently. Therefore, when design the PDC bit for hardness-alternating formation, {{it is not only}} need to improve the rock-breaking efficiency, but also should reduce the impact load on single cutter, improve the working stability, and prevent bit balling simultaneously.|$|R

Therefore, {{in order to}} perform milling operations efficiently, we need to select a set <b>of</b> milling <b>cutters</b> with optimal sizes. It is difficult for human process planners to select the optimal or near optimal set <b>of</b> milling <b>cutters</b> due to complex geometric interactions among tools size, part shapes, and tool trajectories. In this paper, we give a geometric algorithm to find the optimal cutters for 2 - 1 / 2 D milling operations. We define the 2 - 1 / 2 D milling operations as covering the target region without intersecting with the obstruction region. This definition allows us to handle the open edge problem. Based on this definition, we introduced the offsetting and inverse-offsetting algorithm to find the coverable area for a given cutter. Following that, we represent the cutter selection problem as shortest path problem and discuss the lower and upper bond <b>of</b> <b>cutter</b> sizes that are feasible for given parts.
