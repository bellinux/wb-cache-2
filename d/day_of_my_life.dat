5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

500|$|Still, Balzac {{believed}} that keeping her letters was dangerous and, {{in a moment}} of characteristic impulse, threw them into the fire. He described it to her as [...] "the saddest and most frightful <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life...</b> I am looking at the ashes as I write to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up." [...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first time}} in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E

Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad.

2500|$|Ryan Benjamin Tedder {{was born}} on June 26, 1979 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised by an {{extended}} family of missionaries and pastors in a Christian church. He began learning {{to play the piano}} at the age of three via the Suzuki method. His early interest in music was prompted by his musician father and school-teacher mother, who coaxed their young son into practicing piano in exchange for candy corn. Tedder started singing at the age of seven. A self-taught vocalist, Tedder began honing this skill at the age of twelve by imitating his favorite artists, who ranged from The Beatles to other acts like Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder and Sting. He has commented, [...] "I sang for two hours a day every <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> until I was eighteen."

2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was so painful that I find it hard, even now, to see beyond {{the memory of the}} pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E
2500|$|On the October 7, 2008 {{episode of}} Making the Band, Combs {{stated that he}} did have Richard on three demos for his new album. On the same episode of the show, after {{continued}} debate with O'Day about the well-being of Danity Kane, he stated that O'Day {{was no longer in}} the group, as had been foreshadowed in an earlier episode within the season after a TRL (Total Request Live) appearance. Combs was unaware of the specific problems within the group, but sensed that O'Day and Aundrea Fimbres, who were originally close friends, had drastically drifted apart. O'Day and Richard informed Combs that the entire group had trust issues with management and ultimately each other. The season finale, which took place Tuesday, October 14, 2008, confirmed the departure of O'Day and Woods. Combs removed Woods due to feeling that she was unhappy with the group and that she had gotten [...] "caught up in the wrath" [...] of close friend O'Day. In the live section of the episode, Combs explained that the reason he let O'Day go was that she was not the same person he signed, that the fame had changed her (as had been expressed on the August 28, 2008 episode). [...] "I got love for Aubrey," [...] he said. [...] "I don't have any beef with her. I just want to work with the young lady that I signed, not the person that fame has made her." [...] He later stated that he would be open to working with Woods again. When O'Day came on to reply, just moments after deciding not to leave the studio, she first addressed the perception some people, especially bloggers, have of her. [...] "I would rather be hated every damn <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> for being real than loved for being something I'm not," [...] she stated. Combs, who spoke to the group and the audience via satellite, relayed to O'Day, [...] "Check this out, baby girl... See, your attitude is gonna have you in a dark and lonely place. ... What you need to do, {{at the end of the}} day, is humble yourself." [...] Woods did not appear on the live episode due to prior obligations.|$|E
