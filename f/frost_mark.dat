50|$|Shadow marks are a form {{of archaeological}} feature visible from the air.

Mark tells Olivia that they still need to know what Charlie saw in her vision, because she told Mark [...] "D. Gibbons is a bad man". That night, Olivia finally convinces Charlie to tell her what she saw in her vision. Charlie tells her that she gave Dylan a cookie and they overhear his dad saying D. Gibbons is a liar. Dylan writes out [...] "D. Gibbons is a bad man" [...] on the refrigerator, saying that bad people lie. Charlie hears some fireworks go off, she goes to the back door, and sees Vogel telling another man [...] "Mark Benford is dead". Olivia reveals what she heard to Mark, and when Olivia decides to leave the house that night, Mark tells her he can't because there's gonna be another blackout and he needs to see it through, meaning he needs the flashforwards to come true to see what he saw come true.|$|E

A {{collection}} of transcripts from Agent Dale Cooper's audio tapes, {{from his childhood}} to the day he is assigned to Laura Palmer's murder. The book includes Dale's upbringing in Philadelphia, family, education at Quaker institutions Germantown Friends School and Haverford College, first stumbles with love, obsession with the FBI, {{and the relationship between}} him, Windom Earle, and Earle's wife, Caroline. Many of these tape transcripts are dictated to [...] "Diane," [...] though a later tape states that Cooper enjoys the thought of Diane listening to his tapes so much that he will address all tapes to her, whether she will ever listen to them or not.|$|E

40|$|Multi-site {{simulation}} of hydrological data {{are required for}} drought risk assessment of large multi-reservoir water supply systems. In this paper, a general Bayesian framework is presented for the calibration and evaluation of multi-site hydrological data at annual timescales. Models included within this framework are the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the widely used lag- 1 autoregressive (AR(1)) model. These models are extended by {{the inclusion of a}} Box–Cox transformation and a spatial correlation function in a multi-site setting. Parameter uncertainty is evaluated using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Models are evaluated by their ability to reproduce a range of important extreme statistics and compared using Bayesian model selection techniques which evaluate model probabilities. The case study, using multi-site annual rainfall data situated within catchments which contribute to Sydney’s main water supply, provided the following results: Firstly, in terms of model probabilities and diagnostics, the inclusion of the Box–Cox transformation was preferred. Secondly the AR(1) and HMM performed similarly, while some other proposed AR(1) /HMM models with regionally pooled parameters had greater posterior probability than these two models. The practical significance of parameter and model uncertainty was illustrated using a case study involving drought security analysis for urban water supply. It was shown that ignoring parameter uncertainty resulted in a significant overestimate of reservoir yield and an underestimation of system vulnerability to severe drought.

5000|$|Mike DeGagne of AllMusic {{retrospectively}} awarded Escape four-and-a-half stars out of five, writing, [...] "The {{songs are}} timeless, {{and as a}} whole, they {{have a way of}} rekindling the innocence of youthful romance and the rebelliousness of growing up, built from heartfelt songwriting and sturdy musicianship". Colin Larkin awarded the album four out of five stars in the 2002 edition of the Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Contemporary Rolling Stone reviews were less favorable. The first review of 1981 by Deborah <b>Frost</b> <b>marked</b> Journey as heavy metal posers and the music in the album as easily playable by any session musician. In the 2004 edition of their album guide, Rolling Stone awarded the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, which was nonetheless an improvement from Dave Marsh's one star rating in the 1983 edition of the publication.|$|R
