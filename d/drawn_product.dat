40|$|Abstract: Springback is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in sheet metal forming since the elastic recovery of the internal stresses is induced after removal of the tooling. The numerical analysis of springback is a complicated time-consuming job and its result is greatly effected by a type of the yield function, finite elements used and the constraint condition for eliminating a rigid body motion. In this paper, optimization of the draw-bead force is carried out utilizing the response surface method {{in order to reduce}} springback and improve shape accuracy of a deep <b>drawn</b> <b>product.</b> In the optimization process, the tendency of springback is evaluated qualitatively without springback simulation usually done with the implicit solving scheme. Instead of springback simulation, the amount of stress deviation along the thickness direction in the deep <b>drawn</b> <b>product</b> is used as an indicator of springback. The stamping process is analyzed for a front side member formed with advanced high strength steel (AHSS) sheets such as DP 60. The analysis procedure fully covers the binder-wrap, stamping, trimming and springback processes with the commercial elasto-plastic finite element code LS-DYNA 3 D. The effect of the restraining force of draw-beads is confirmed with the decreased stress deviation. The analysis result shown in the final springback simulation demonstrates that the present analysis provides a guideline for controlling the evolution of springback based on the finite element simulation of complicated auto-bod...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The Deep {{drawing is}} a {{manufacturing}} {{process in which}} sheet metal is progressively formed into a three-dimensional shape through the mechanical action of a die forming the metal around a punch. To reduce various defects in deep drawing process {{it is necessary to}} control some parameters of deep drawing process. Sheet-metal drawing is a more complex operation than cutting or bending. Number of defects can occur in a <b>drawn</b> <b>product.</b> To reduce production cost it is necessary to reduce defects accrued during deep drawing process. A punch force, material property of sheet metal, blank holding force, thickness of sheet, velocity of punch are affecting parameters in deep drawing process to regulate defects like wrinkling, tearing, earing and fracture defect. By conducting experiment in universal testing machine we know stress, strain, displacement and load. These results compare with the software for validation...|$|E
40|$|When a {{flat sheet}} is {{deformed}} into desired shape, a distribution of strain is created. It is the resultant {{outcome of a}} number of factors and their interactions, including the shape of the product, design of the tool, forming conditions and the material properties. While one would desire a very uniform strain all over the formed product, this is never achieved. Effects of material properties on the strain distribution for axisymmetric shapes have been documented. Quantification of strain distribution has been attempted by many but few applications of these are available in the literature. In the present work, methods of analysing the simulated strain distribution profiles obtained using the PAMSTAMP- 2 G software have been demonstrated to (a) perform process design for a <b>drawn</b> <b>product</b> and (b) explore the possibility of predicting the strain distribution of a full scale product based on a geometrically scaled down model...|$|E

Our objective {{is to develop a}} parametric study that can leads mainly to predict accurately the final geometry of the sheet blank and the distribution of strains and stresses and also to control various forming defects, such as thinning as well as parameters affecting strongly the final form of the sheet after forming process. Design/methodology/approach: The main approach of the current paper is to conduct a validation study of the FEM model. In fact, a 3 D parametric FEA model is build using Abaqus /Explicit standard code. Numerous available test data was compared to theoretical predictions via our model. Here, several elastic plastic materials low was used in the FEA model and then, they were validated via experimental results. Findings: Several 2 D and 3 D plots, which can be used to predict incipient thinning strengths for sheets with flat initial configuration, have been presented for the various loading conditions. Unfortunately, most professionals in the forming process, lack this expertise, which is an obstacle to fully exploit the potential of optimization process of metal forming structures. In this study optimization approach is used to improve the final quality of a deep <b>drawn</b> <b>product</b> d by determining the optimal values of geometric tools parameters. Research limitations/implications: This paper is a first part study of a numerical parametric investigation that is dealing with the most influent parameters in a forming process to simulate the deep drawing of square cup (such as geometric, material parameters and coefficient of frictions). In the future {{it will be possible to}} get a large amount of information about typical sheet forming process with various material and geometric parameters and to control them in order to get the most accurate final form under particular loading, material and geometric cases. Originality/value: This model is used with conjunction with optimisation tool to classify geometric parameters that are participating to failure criterion.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} for the deep-drawing process is springback. Generally, the deep-drawing tools are directly derived from {{the shape of the}} product. However, when the press is opened after forming, the product will spring back due to internal stresses. In order to produce a geometrically accurate product, the geometry of the tools is compensated. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to perform this task automatically, with the use of FE deep-drawing simulations. In this report the two main compensation algorithms are discussed that are mentioned in literature. Springback compensation is always the last step in the process planning of a deep <b>drawn</b> <b>product.</b> It is not always needed, in some cases the product can be made to fit the assembly by simply pushing it back into the right shape. To make the right decision, springback has to be measured and evaluated properly, which can be hard for complex shaped products. Today, manual springback compensation is applied, based on the measurements on prototype products. This is a time consuming process for which a lot of experience is needed. The use of FE simulations can speed up this process, but to fully use the detailed results of such a simulation, a compensation algorithm has to be used. The first algorithm is called the smooth displacement adjustment (SDA) method. The method is based on a direct comparison of the desired shape and the shape after springback. The idea is to compensate springback by reversing the springback deformation field and applying this to the product geometry. The method can also be applied iteratively by using the shape deviation field between the springback (actual) geometry and the reference (desired) geometry. A smoothing/extrapolation function has been added, so the new toolset can be derived directly from this compensated product geometry. The method has been tested on a real industrial part, a trunk-lid inner frame that has been adopted as a benchmark part for the NUMISHEET 2005 conference. The method was very successful, after compensation the mean shape deviation was lowered by 70 %. However, some large shape deviation was still present in the product flanges, showing that there is still room for improvement. The second algorithm is called the springforward (SF) method. The principle of the SF method is to compensate springback with the internal stresses that cause it, instead of applying direct geometric optimization, such as the DA method. The method was applied to an academic process, the plastic bending of a strip. It is explained that with the current definition of the algorithm, iterative application is not useful. This problem is solved by adding a push-back stage, so the compensation is linked to the desired geometry again. However, the actual calculation of the compensated geometry suffers from large principal and numerical problems, as was demonstrated using a simple industrial product. ...|$|E
