The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed {{from the area}} of convection, which was also deteriorating.

There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> occurs in any of these places.

5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster {{that can take}} a high polish, and which is so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name.

That year's Grey Cup, held in Edmonton and won by Toronto, drew nearly 22,000 more fans than the previous year.
