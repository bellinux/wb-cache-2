Part II explains how courts have unpersuasively applied these rules when refusing to enforce <b>foreign</b> libel <b>judgments.</b> Part III then explains how the Yahoo! court adopted much of this faulty reasoning. Finally, Part IV explains the considerations that better justify judicial refusal to enforce speech-restrictive <b>foreign</b> <b>judgments,</b> especially those triggered by Internet speech. The Article concludes that the prospect that U. S. Internet speakers will choose to speak only to a U.

Instead, a party wishing to domesticate the foreign default judgment or <b>foreign</b> <b>judgment</b> obtained by confession must bring another action in New York State [...] "on the judgment" [...] where the relief sought is to have the <b>foreign</b> <b>judgment</b> domesticated in New York State. Moreover, a quicker [...] "motion-action" [...] procedure is available in New York where the owner of the foreign default judgment/judgment by confession files a summons and notice of motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{recognition}} and enforcement of <b>foreign</b> <b>judgments</b> in China is gaining in practical significance. However, a great wall {{seems to have been}} erected against {{recognition and}} enforcement of <b>foreign</b> <b>judgments</b> in China. To make a breakthrough, the essentials for achieving {{recognition and enforcement}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>judgments</b> in China must be unveiled from a practical perspective rather than for purpose of purely theoretical analyses. Investigation into the representative cases in this regard shows that there are two requirements that are of Chinese courts first and foremost concern, namely the principle of reciprocity and the due service requirement. Special attention should be paid to both requirements informing the aforesaid cases. Satisfaction of these two requirements may well bring an anticipated recognition and enforcement of <b>foreign</b> <b>judgments</b> in China. As a necessity, applicants and foreign courts must enrich their knowledge of the Chinese law and judicial practice in this respect...|$|R
