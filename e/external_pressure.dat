In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional <b>external</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to <b>external</b> <b>pressure.</b> This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or <b>external</b> <b>pressure</b> to fulfill roles and {{expectations}} of being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>external</b> <b>pressure,</b> domestic policies {{implemented by the}} Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven to be largely ineffective in stimulating the country’s economic growth. By building on the Soviet model of central economic planning, Vietnam placed most emphasis {{on the development of}} heavy industries, while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated. Furthermore, attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos, as economic output were driven down by dislocation of the general population. In {{addition to}} those failed economic policies, Vietnam maintained the fifth largest armed forces in the world, with 1.26 million regular soldiers under arms, 180,000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984. Consequently, the Vietnamese Government had to spend one-third of its budget on the military and the campaign in Kampuchea, despite receiving $1.2 billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union, thus further hampering Vietnam’s economic rebuilding efforts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of <b>external</b> <b>pressures,</b> internal motivations and their interplay, {{with the intention of}} identifying whether they drive substantive or instead symbolic implementation of ISO 14001. The context is one of economic crisis. We focus on Greece, where the economic crisis has weakened the country’s institutional environment, and analyse qualitatively new interview data from 45 ISO 14001 -certified firms. Our findings show that (a) weak <b>external</b> <b>pressures</b> can lead to a symbolic implementation of ISO 14001, as firms can defend their legitimacy without incurring the costs of internalization in the local market; (b) weak <b>external</b> <b>pressures</b> can lead to substantive implementation of ISO 14001 when firms have strong internal motivations seeking to strategically differentiate from competitors in international markets. Firms internalize ISO 14001 so as to restore their legitimacy and reputation in foreign markets and stimulate their competitiveness; and (c) strong internal motivations pave the way for companies to stimulate their competitiveness by enhancing their efficiency, as some companies might strengthen their position in the local market by implementing ISO 14001 substantively. The contribution of this paper to the literature on ISO 14001 internalization lies in refining existing theory on the importance of internal motivations for the substantive implementation of ISO 14001 in the context of economic crisis. Additionally, this paper extends current theory by challenging studies that dismiss the importance of <b>external</b> <b>pressures.</b> We argue that the intensity of <b>external</b> <b>pressures</b> influences the internalization of ISO 14001, but propose that this relationship might not be linear...|$|R

5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and <b>external</b> <b>pressure</b> on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E
5|$|When Barry {{became a}} {{tropical}} cyclone, its convection wrapped around {{roughly half of}} the center. Outflow in the eastern semicircle was good, although due to upper-level wind shear, it was restricted to southeast of the circulation. The cyclone became embedded within a mid- to-upper-level trough between the ridge over the central U.S. and the ridge over the northwestern Caribbean. A strong, upper-level cyclonic shear axis extended from just south of Cape Hatteras to near Brownsville, Texas, which prevented Barry from accelerating in forward speed. The ridge over the United States weakened, thus collapsing the steering pattern; {{this resulted in a}} west-southwestward drifting motion of the tropical storm by around August 3. Early on August 3, strong westerly winds prevailed, and separated the center of circulation from what limited convection remained. The storm quickly regained some convection, although maximum sustained winds remained weak, at about 40mph (60km/h). Despite a slight drop in barometric pressure, post-season analysis revealed Barry weakened into a tropical depression early on August 4 due to the persistent wind shear and falling <b>external</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E

25|$|If {{a bubble}} or an object exists which {{collects}} gas molecules {{this collection of}} gas molecules may reach a size where the internal pressure exceeds the combined surface tension and <b>external</b> <b>pressure</b> and the bubble will grow. If the solvent is sufficiently supersaturated, the diffusion of gas into the bubble will exceed {{the rate at which}} it diffuses back into solution, and if this excess pressure is greater than the pressure due to surface tension the bubble will continue to grow. When a bubble grows, the surface tension decreases, and the interior pressure drops, allowing gas to diffuse in faster, and diffuse out slower, so the bubble grows or shrinks in a positive feedback situation. The growth rate is reduced as the bubble grows because the surface area increases as the square of the radius, while the volume increases as the cube of the radius. If the <b>external</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced due to reduced hydrostatic pressure during ascent, the bubble will also grow, and conversely, an increased <b>external</b> <b>pressure</b> will cause the bubble to shrink, but may not cause it to be eliminated entirely if a compression-resistant surface layer exists.|$|E
