The essay stated the analysis was {{to test the hypothesis}} that the <b>drafting</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> and statements by societies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, American Association for the Advancement of Science and National Academy of Sciences might downplay legitimate dissenting opinions on anthropogenic climate change.

The essay received a great deal of media attention from around the world and has been cited by many prominent persons such as Al Gore in the movie An Inconvenient Truth.|$|E
