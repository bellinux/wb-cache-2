5|$|Miller was {{selected}} for an Australian XIa team comprising a mix of established international representatives and fringe playersfixture against the tourists prior to the Test series, but made only <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> with the bat and bowled only four overs, taking 0/8 in a rain-affected match that did not reach the second innings. In a Shield match against South Australia—led by national captain Don Bradman—at the Adelaide Oval, Miller {{had a chance to}} push for selection by performing well in front of the Australian captain, who was {{also a member of the}} three-man national selection panel.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2009, in a {{game against}} the Baltimore Orioles, Kinsler hit for the cycle, {{becoming}} only the fourth Ranger to do so (and, at the time, the only right-handed Ranger). In the same game, Kinsler became only the second player in Ranger history to get 6 hits in a single game (the first having been Alfonso Soriano, on May 8, 2004), and the first to do so in a 9-inning game. His <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> and four extra base hits in the game matched two other team records.|$|E

5|$|Somerset {{entered the}} tournament {{in the first}} round, in which they beat Warwickshire by six wickets, aided {{primarily}} by a score of 139 not out by Viv Richards, who was later named man of the match. In their second round match against Glamorgan, Somerset scored 330 for 4, the highest total in that year's competition. Peter Denning scored 145 runs, while Joel Garner bowled six overs and conceded just <b>five</b> <b>runs.</b> Garner's bowling was once again miserly in the quarter-final against Kent; he conceded <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> in nine overs, though Colin Dredge was named as {{the man of the}} match for his four wickets, which helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. In the semi-final, Somerset batted first, and helped by another century from Richards, scored 287 for 6. In their response, Essex kept up with the required run rate, and needed three runs to win from the final ball of the match. The batsmen managed two runs, but Neil Smith was run out attempting the third run, and as a result the scores were tied. Somerset advanced to the final, as they had lost fewer wickets; six to ten.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary was 18 {{during the}} season and still {{eligible}} for the Under-19s and she represented her state during the tournament, which {{was held in the}} middle of a break in the WNCL. She scored 119 runs at 19.83 and took nine wickets at 15.55 with a best of 4/27 against the Australian Capital Territory. At the end of the season, Ebsary was chosen in the Australia Youth team to play New Zealand A and New Zealand. In four matches she took two wickets at 32.00 at an economy rate of 2.66 but had no impact with the bat, scoring <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> at 1.66.|$|E
5|$|England {{came out}} for their second innings, and with Bradman {{predominantly}} reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost <b>five</b> <b>runs,</b> as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E

5|$|Four of {{the first}} <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{subsequent}} to the resumption, Compton took two boundaries from Lindwall's first over and another from Johnston's subsequent over. He then hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided {{in an attempt to}} prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. According to O'Reilly, it was the only mistake Compton made in his innings. The stand fell <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> short of England's highest Test partnership for the eighth wicket against Australia, a mark set by Patsy Hendren and Harold Larwood.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Bickford {{was sold}} to the Baltimore Orioles for an {{undisclosed}} amount of cash and catcher Charlie White. The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox were both interested in Bickford's services, but general manager John Quinn decided to go with Baltimore's offer. He only played one game, a start against the Chicago White Sox on April 24. He gave up <b>five</b> <b>runs,</b> four of them earned, in four innings before being credited with the 14–4 loss. A pinched nerve in his throwing arm and eventual elbow surgery shortened his career. In 1955, he unsuccessfully tried a brief comeback with the Triple-A Richmond Virginians in the International League. He pitched in nine games before retiring due to complications of his arm injuries.|$|E

In Double-A, Jackson played for the Reading Phillies, recording a 1.66 ERA over 43.1 innings pitched. He played Triple-A ball for the Portland Beavers before making his major league debut for the Philadelphia Phillies on August 11, 1986. For his debut, Jackson pitched a perfect inning in relief of Dan Schatzeder {{in a game against}} the New York Mets. Jackson finished the 1986 Major League season with a 3.38 ERA, allowing <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> off of 12 hits and becoming the seventh youngest player in the National League that year.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{retired after}} {{playing in the}} 1957–58 season. With the Test players in South Africa, he made 331 runs at 41.37 {{including}} 2 centuries, and took 9 wickets at 26.33 in 8 matches. He made 107 in an innings triumph over Queensland and 106 in a drawn match against South Australia. It was not {{enough for him to}} win a third Sheffield Shield title; New South Wales won for the fifth successive time, defeating Victoria in both of their matches. Loxton made little impact in his final match; although the Victorians defeated Queensland, his only participation was to score <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> in the first innings. His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first-class debut.|$|E
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by <b>five</b> <b>runs,</b> the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler grounded out to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally a sacrifice fly double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E

5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds.

5|$|On May 5–6, 2006, Greer was {{the site}} of a game which tied the record for the longest game, in terms of innings played, in PCL history. The Sounds and the New Orleans Zephyrs competed in a 24-inning game, played over the course of two days, which lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes. New Orleans {{defeated}} Nashville by a score of <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> to four. The record was originally set on June 8, 1909 in a game between the San Francisco Seals and Oakland Oaks. A few years later, on September 10, 1911, the record was tied by a contest between the Sacramento Solons and Portland Beavers. Seven PCL records were broken in the game, and three were tied.|$|E
5|$|Played at Chelmsford {{after the}} semi-final, Vipers' captain Charlotte Edwards won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Western Storm opening batsmen, Stafanie Taylor and Rachel Priest started well, {{propelling}} the score to 71 without loss after ten overs. In the subsequent over, Arran Brindle dismissed Taylor for 35, and her miserly bowling helped {{to slow the}} Storm's scoring. Heather Knight and Priest got out soon after one another, scoring 6 and 57 respectively, before the Storm's middle-order batsmen; Fran Wilson (16*), Lizelle Lee (6), Sophie Luff (2) and Georgia Hennessy (9*), added a few more runs to bring their total to 140 from 20 overs. Brindle and Tash Farrant were the pick of the bowlers, both conceding less than <b>five</b> <b>runs</b> per over.|$|E
