40|$|Abstract—Packet {{classification}} {{problem has}} received much attention {{and continued to}} be an important topic in recent years. In packet classification problem, each incoming packet should be classified into flows according to a set of pre-defined rules. Grid-of-tries (GoT) is one of the traditional algorithmic schemes for solving 2 -dimensional packet classification problem. The advantage of GoT is that it uses the switch pointers to avoid backtracking operation during the search process. However, the primary data structure of GoT is base on binary tries. The traversal of binary tries decreases the performance of GoT due to the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> binary tries are usually high. In this paper, we propose a scheme called GST (Grid <b>of</b> <b>Segment</b> Trees). GST modifies the original GoT by replacing the binary tries with <b>segment</b> trees. The <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>segment</b> trees are much shorter than those of binary tries. As a result, the proposed GST can inherit the advantages <b>of</b> GoT and <b>segment</b> trees to achieve better performance. Experiments conducted on three different kinds of rule tables show that our proposed scheme performs better than traditional schemes, such as hierarchical tries and grid-of-tries.

In the present study, using a goat model, we aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in spinal cord volume and spinal cord injury due to spinal shortening, and to quantify the spinal cord volume per 1 -mm height in order to clarify a safe limit for shortening. Vertebral column resection was performed at T 10 in 10 goats. The spinal cord was shortened until the somatosensory-evoked potential was decreased by 50 % from the baseline amplitude or delayed by 10 % relative to the baseline peak latency. A wake-up test was performed, and the goats were observed for two days postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the spinal cord volume, T 10 height, disc height, osteotomy segment height, and spinal segment height pre- and postoperatively. Two of the 10 goats were excluded, and hence, only data from eight goats were analyzed. The somatosensory-evoked potential of these eight goats demonstrated meaningful changes. With regard to neurologic function, five and three goats were classified as Tarlov grades 5 and 4 at two days postoperatively. The mean shortening distance was 23. 6 ± 1. 51 mm, which correlated with the d-value (post-pre) of the spinal cord volume per 1 -mm <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the osteotomy <b>segment</b> (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 001) and with the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the T 10 body (r = 0. 79, p = 0. 02).

The main objective in {{this problem is}} to produce a realization that minimizes both the street congestion {{and the number of}} doglegs. Simulated annealing (SA) is a stochastic, hill-climbing and gradient-descent technique based on the statistical properties of particles undergoing thermal annealing. By performing slow cooling, the nets in the single-row routing problem align themselves according to a configuration with the lowest energy. The model has been known to produce reasonably good solutions for many NP-complete optimization problems, such as the single-row routing problem. In ESSR, our strategy is to minimize both the street congestion and the number of interstreet crossings (doglegs) by expressing a single energy function as their collective properties. This objective is achieved by representing the energy as the absolute sum <b>of</b> the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the net <b>segments.</b> To speed up convergence, we pivot the street congestion value while having the energy drops directly proportional to the number of doglegs. This action has the effect of minimizing the number of doglegs as the energy stabilizes. Our simulation work on ESSR produces optimal results in most cases for both the street congestion and the number of doglegs. Our experimental results compare well against results obtained from our earlier model (SRR- 7) and two other methods reported in the literature. ...|$|R

The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5 x 10 ^{ 37 } - 2 x 10 ^{ 38 } erg/s) is ~ 11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below ~ 5 x 10 ^{ 37 } erg/s, {{the energy of the}} fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to ~ 16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the emitting region by ~ 2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant.

The following parameters were recorded. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) at baseline, 2 mins, 5 min and then 5 min thereafter. Mean <b>height</b> <b>of</b> block, Total no. <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> blocked, Onset Time of sensory block (in Minutes), ephedrine doses, incidence of hypotension & bradycardia, APGAR score at 1 & 5 Minutes. Results : The decrease in MAP was much more in wedged position as compared to table tilt position also the incidence of hypotension was 40 % in wedged position as compared to 12 % in table tilt position. Mean <b>height</b> <b>of</b> block, Total no. <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> blocked, and boluses of inj. ephedrine used were more in the wedged position than in table tilt position. Conclusion: Wedge placement caused increased incidence of hypotension and higher blockade after spinal anaesthesia as compared to left lateral table tilt position, there was no adverse effects on foetus and patients tolerated wedge better than left lateral table tilt position. Also surgery was easier to perform after wedge placement...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{stature of}} lower- and upper-class English youth are compared {{to one another}} and to their European and North American counterparts. The height gap between the rich and poor was the greatest in England, reaching 22 cm at age 16. The poverty-stricken English children were shorter for their age than any other European or North American group so far discovered, while the English rich were the tallest in their time: only 2. 5 cm shorter than today’s US standards. <b>Height</b> <b>of</b> the poor declined in the late- 18 th century, and again in the 1830 s and 1840 s conforming to the general European pattern, while the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the wealthy tended rather to increase until the 1840 s and then levelled off. Acknowledgment: I appreciate comments from Francesco Cinnirella, Thomas Weiss, and Hans Th. Waaler on {{an earlier version of this}} paper. 2 A significant advantage of anthropometric history is the insight it affords into the living conditions <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> a population for whom conventional economic indicators are frequently – or even generally- unavailable. Important such groups include children and youth, whose welfare depended, in the main, upon overall family socio-economi...|$|R
40|$|Lateral {{impact tests}} were {{performed}} using seven male post-mortem human subjects (whole, unembalmed cadavers) to further characterize {{the response of}} the body, and in particular the force-deflection response of the lower abdomen, to lateral impact. All tests were performed using a dual-sled, side-impact test facility. A multi-segmented impactor was mounted on a sled that was pneumatically accelerated into a second, initially stationary sled on which a cadaver subject was seated facing perpendicular to the direction of impact. Sizes and <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> impactor <b>segments</b> were adjusted for each subject so that forces applied to different anatomic regions including thorax, abdomen, greater trochanter, iliac wing, and thigh could be independently measured on each cadaver. For all tests, the impactor contact surfaces were located in the same vertical plane except that the abdomen plate was offset 5. 1 cm toward the subject. Each subject was first impacted {{on one side of the}} body using an initial impactor speed of 3 m/s. Following the five of these tests that did not result in injury, the contralateral side of the body was impacted at a speed of either 8 m/s or 10 m/s. The masses of the sleds and the force-deflection characteristics of the energy-absorbing material that acted as the interface between the sleds were set so that the velocity history of the impactor sled matched the average driver door velocity history produced in a series of side NCAP tests. Impactor padding was also selected so that average ATD pelvis and thorax responses from the same series of side NCAP tests were reproduced when the ATD used in these tests was impacted using the average door-velocity history. Results of these tests were used to develop force-deflection response targets for the abdomen, force history response targets for the pelvis (iliac wing and greater trochanter), the midthigh, and the thorax at each of the three impact velocities. Response targets for the lateral acceleration of the pelvis were also developed. Future work will compare side impact ATD responses to these response targets...|$|R
