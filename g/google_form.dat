40|$|Technology TrackThe University of Minnesota, {{like many}} {{institutions}} of higher education, recently adopted the Google Apps for Education Suite of tools for students, staff, and faculty. One particularly useful tool in this suite is the <b>Google</b> <b>Form,</b> which collects responses from a form in a Google Spreadsheet. Members of the University Libraries' Personal Information Management Collaborative (PIM) built a customized <b>Google</b> <b>form</b> using a few lines of Javascript code. The customized form asks respondents to indicate topics they'd {{like to know more}} about, and the code triggers an email to the respondent with links to tutorials, workshops, and other instruction in their areas of interest. This unique solution can be adapted for a variety of uses in higher education, increasing the basic functionality of the standard <b>Google</b> <b>Form.</b> This presentation gives an overview of the customized form created by PIM, and highlights resources and tools that enable participants to create their own custom solutions with Google Forms...|$|E

30|$|Some {{researchers}} also study the gamification platforms which use web-based students’ response {{systems such as}} Kahoot! and Quizizz (Wang 2015; Wang and Lieberoth 2016; Chaiyo and Nokham 2017; Sawang et al. 2017). Wang (2015), found that Kahoot! implementation in different situation (event and semester) by two groups of students produce the same result as both groups agree that the game are still engaging irrespective of the duration they were using the Kahoot!. The students similarly found that the interactive and fun way of learning provided by Kahoot! increased their determination in winning the game which helped their engagement in class. Thus, Wang (2015) concluded that the duration of gamification did not affect negatively on the students’ engagement. In another study, Wang and Lieberoth (2016) expanded the research by studying the effects of game elements such as audio and points in Kahoot! towards students’ engagement. The result indicates that although the use of audio do have positive impact on students’ interaction, the combination of both audio and points gave a much greater effect as they provide positive classroom dynamics (Wang and Lieberoth 2016). In contrast, Chaiyo and Nokham (2017) studied the effects of three different gamification tools to the students’ engagement, enjoyment, concentration, perceived learning, satisfaction and motivation in lessons. They found that although all the three tools, which are Kahoot!, Quizizz and <b>Google</b> <b>Form,</b> did not show any variance on how the students perceived their learning, the students were more biased towards Kahoot! and Quizizz in comparison to <b>Google</b> <b>Form</b> as they agree that Kahoot! and Quizizz can improve their concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation (Chaiyo and Nokham 2017).|$|E
