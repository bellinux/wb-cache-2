Given how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, {{who at the time}} was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, she {{was cast}} as Andie Walsh in another successful Hughes film called Pretty In Pink (1986). Ringwald's role as Andie {{went on to}} become one of her most recognizable performances. When first asked to be in Pretty in Pink, Ringwald was reluctant, but after seeing how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for the producers to find a replacement for her, she decided she would portray Andie in the film. Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film called Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) but she turned down the role as she felt it was too similar to her other films she worked on with Hughes. After Pretty In Pink, Ringwald planned to star in more mature roles. Ringwald was later featured on the cover of Time magazine on May 26, 1986.|$|E

She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift {{between parents and children}} is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how hard it is for them to have to take time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} Alcorn's suicide note was {{published}} online, Chris Seelbach, the first openly gay councilman on Cincinnati City Council, shared {{it as part}} of a Facebook message in which he stated that her death showed how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be transgender in the U.S. His post was shared over 4,700 times and raised increased public awareness of the incident. By December 30, Alcorn's death had attracted worldwide attention. News outlets across the world had picked up the story, and the hashtag #LeelahAlcorn had topped Twitter. According to British newspaper The Independent, the incident [...] "triggered widespread anguish and raised a debate about the rights of transgender people", while the U.S.-based Boston Globe stated that it [...] "served as a flashpoint for transgender progress in 2014".|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{went into}} lap 48 {{less than a}} second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he {{attempted}} to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, [...] "That didn't work Michael. You hit the wrong part of him, my friend". The right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve's Williams—unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill's suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race [...] "The car felt very strange. The hit was very <b>hard.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not a small thing." [...] He continued but the damage to his car meant he was slower than the cars behind him.|$|E

The game was originally scheduled to be released on October 14, 2014, which in turn was delayed to June 2, 2015. On the first delay, Rocksteady marketing game manager Guy Perkins stated, [...] "If we didn’t give the team more time to do it, then we would be releasing something that we weren’t happy with. We {{want to make sure}} we’re absolutely nailing it 100%." [...] A quality assurance tester for the game added, [...] "Getting [...] to work on consoles was impossible for months. That’s part of why the game got delayed so many times, [...] totally unprepared for how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> on next-gen consoles." [...] In the UK, the Microsoft Windows version is only available as a digital release. Additionally, an OS X and Linux version of the game developed by Feral Interactive was scheduled for release in early 2016 after originally being scheduled to release in late 2015; it was cancelled in February 2016. Feral stated the original delay was to [...] "ensure good performance and wide-ranging support" [...] for the two platforms.|$|E
500|$|The Tsarina {{relied on}} the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and {{wandering}} starets or [...] "holy man", and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Tatiana and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as [...] "Our Friend" [...] and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Tatiana's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Tatiana and her sisters and brother were all wearing their long white nightgowns. The children appeared to be friendly with Rasputin and comfortable in his company. Rasputin's friendship with the children was also evident {{in some of the}} messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to [...] "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." [...] Eleven-year-old Tatiana wrote a letter asking Rasputin to visit her and telling him how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to see her mother ill.

In the episode, Homer, Bart, and Lisa visit a video game convention called the Expensive Electronic Entertainment Expo (E4), which is {{a reference to the}} Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that is presented annually in the United States by the Entertainment Software Association. This marked {{the first time that the}} family visited a video game convention in The Simpsons. Selman and other staff members on the show had previously visited E3 during the release of The Simpsons video games such as The Simpsons Game. While appearing on GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley on November 11, 2011, Selman commented that [...] "We've been to so many [...] and we've been pushed around, and knocked around, and seen so many PR guys [...] about how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> working on their game.

500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} to the handheld praises its accomplishments, but defines it as a [...] "niche" [...] device that appeals to only certain gamers. Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi's design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market, but blames Bandai for its lack of success, stating, [...] "While WonderSwan ultimately {{will be remembered as}} a highly localized blip in the history of handheld games, as a platform it genuinely held its own... the system's obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai's strangely meek strategy, not from any inherent flaws {{in the design of the}} machine itself." [...] Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America, stating, [...] "given how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail, it's hard to imagine they were clamoring for yet another niche portable from Japan." [...] Luke Plunkett from Kotaku praised the WonderSwan's challenge to Nintendo, stating, [...] "t tried some pretty unique and interesting things, and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed." [...] Retro Gamers Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld, including its lack of a headphone and AC port, as well as its poor control scheme for left-handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected. Wild offers some praise for the handheld, however, stating [...] "what [...] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition. The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration." ...|$|E

Some people, such as Robyn Anderson, who knew the perpetrators, stated that the pair were not obsessed with Nazism nor did they worship or admire Hitler in any way. Anderson stated, in retrospect, {{that there were many}} things the pair did not tell friends. Dave Cullen, author of the 2009 book Columbine, cites evidence that Harris did revere the Nazis. He praised them often in his journal, and some of his friends grew irritated at his frequent Nazi salutes and quotations {{in the months leading up}} to the shooting. At a certain point, Harris realized he needed to reduce this behavior, for fear of revealing his plans. He commented in his journal about how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to wait until April to express all his hatred for the human race. In his journal, Harris mentioned his admiration of what he imagined to be natural selection, and wrote that he would like to put everyone in a super Doom game and see to it that the weak die and the strong live. On the day of the massacre, Harris wore a white T-shirt with the words [...] "Natural selection" [...] printed in black.|$|E

2500|$|Most glucometers today use an {{electrochemical}} method. Test strips {{contain a}} capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing through the electrode {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample.|$|E
