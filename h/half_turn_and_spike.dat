60|$|The two lads stopped, <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> {{then stood}} still, holding the three buckets undecidedly.|$|R
60|$|She halted <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> I thought I saw {{a slight}} droop {{at the corners}} of her mouth.|$|R
60|$|Cranley <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> threw a {{quick look}} at him, as rapid and timid as the glance of a hare in its form.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunio here," [...] said he, <b>and</b> he <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> let {{his hand}} {{fall on the}} captain's shoulder, [...] "is my very good friend. I have no secrets from him." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{moved toward}} the closed door that {{connected}} the two rooms, but stopped, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> bestowed upon Goodwin a grave, searching look that ended in a quizzical smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jonathan," [...] cried Betty {{when he did}} {{not answer}} the colonel. At her call he <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> his dark eyes, steady, {{strained}} like those of a watching deer, sought his sister's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't do," [...] he said, <b>half</b> <b>turning</b> <b>and</b> {{then moving}} nearer the slope. [...] "There's gas {{enough in the}} drift to choke me before I'd get ten yards. Why don't the idiots move faster!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ruggeri {{considers}} {{rings and}} pommel horse his weak events. [...] He has vaulted a Yurchenko entry to two different tricks: a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> double full off [...] or (without turn) to 2-1/2 twists (Shewfelt). [...] His height is 5-8.|$|R
5000|$|Phelps - a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> {{onto the}} vault table, {{followed}} by a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> off <b>and</b> into a front layout.|$|R
6000|$|He ceased. His father {{wiped his}} spectacles, and almost audibly murmured, [...] "Bless him!" [...] Ethel, who had sat like one enchanted, forgetting who spoke, forgetting all save the islanders, <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> met Richard's smiling eyes, and his whisper, [...] "I told you so." ...|$|R
6000|$|Don Sabas <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{waved his}} hand, with a ringing laugh, toward his fellow fugitives. [...] "To you, caballeros, I have related {{the history of}} that session when we issued that O! so ridiculous commission. Of a truth our jest has been turned against us. Behold the Frankenstein's monster we have created!" ...|$|R
60|$|More {{angry than}} before the grizzly <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> then, without warning, raised up on his hind legs and made for Chet, whose horse was now flat upon the rocks, having {{stumbled}} in his hasty retreat, Chet himself was partly in and partly {{out of the saddle}} when the charge was made.|$|R
60|$|As {{if he had}} overheard her the man <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> calmly {{examined}} the group. His eyes were an almost colorless blue, his features destitute of any expression. By his dress he seemed well-to-do, if not prosperous, yet there was a hint of melancholy in his poise and about him a definite atmosphere of loneliness.|$|R
60|$|At the garden-gate of a fair-sized house some half-mile {{along the}} road the captain stopped, and after an {{impatient}} fumbling at the latch strode up the path, followed by Mr. Wilks, and knocked at the door. As he paused on the step he <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> {{for the first time}} noticed the facial expression of his faithful follower.|$|R
50|$|To tie the hitch {{around a}} pole, begin by passing the working end a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> round the pole. Next, pass a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> round the {{standing}} part. Then, pass a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> round both the working {{end and the}} standing part, above the first turn (i.e. closer to the pole). Finally, push a bight of the working end {{through the middle of}} the hitch - between the two <b>half</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> between the standing part and the working end. Pull on the standing part to tighten, if necessary sliding the hitch snugly up against the pole.|$|R
60|$|Hirst <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> {{threw his}} head back so that {{he looked at the}} {{branches}} crossing themselves in the air above him.|$|R
60|$|I <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> {{the shorter}} one {{glanced back at}} me over her shoulder--I could draw you now the pose of her cheek and neck and shoulder--and {{instantly}} I was as passionately {{in love with the}} girl as I have ever been before or since, as any man ever was with any woman. I <b>turned</b> about <b>and</b> followed them, I flung away my cigarette ostentatiously and lifted my school cap and spoke to them.|$|R
25|$|According to the neo-gnostic {{teachings of}} Samael Aun Weor, the third eye is {{referenced}} symbolically and functionally {{several times in}} the Book of Revelation 3:7-13, a work which, as a whole, he believes describes Kundalini and its progression upwards through three <b>and</b> a <b>half</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> seven chakras. This interpretation equates the third eye with the sixth of the seven churches of Asia detailed therein, the Church of Philadelphia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know why}} not," [...] said the inspector. [...] "He doesn't look {{a credit to}} the Bow Street cells, does he?" [...] He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, {{moistened}} his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, of course. Thank you {{for being}} so patient. I know my {{arguments}} are silly, but--' She <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>and</b> went on in a changed voice, 'Perhaps this will help you to decide.' ...|$|R
50|$|Boussu {{was active}} in the Brussels area {{during the middle of the}} eighteenth century (c. 1749 - c. 1761). His making method {{incorporated}} both local archaic as well as foreign influences. The Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels) has several Boussu violins and cellos in their collection; two of these instruments are in unaltered condition. Boussu's instruments feature a very remarkable scroll with an extra <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> a yellow-brown varnish. The Mus√©e national de la Renaissance collection includes a pochette violin by Boussu.|$|R
60|$|The great banker nodded {{with an odd}} air of {{business}} assent, seemed to reflect a moment, and before they could interpose took a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> a step that {{brought him to the}} edge of the outer mountain wall. Then, flinging up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach. But this time he did not fall into a little meadow just beneath; he fell a thousand feet below, to become a wreck of bones in the valley.|$|R
6000|$|... 9. Double Whorl.--One {{portion of}} the {{transverse}} lines runs forward [...] with a bend and recurves upon itself with a <b>half</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> is embraced [...] by another portion which proceeds {{from the other side}} in the same way. [...] This produces a doubly twisted figure which is rarely met with except [...] on the thumb, fore, and ring fingers. The ends of the curved portions [...] may be variously inclined; they may be nearly perpendicular, of [...] various degrees of obliquity, or nearly horizontal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] She {{drew back}} a pace from him. There was a moment's silence, during which {{it seemed she}} {{gathered}} her forces to destroy him, and, in the spirit, he bowed his head before the coming storm. Then, with a sudden relaxing of the stiffness her lissom figure had assumed, [...] "I think you had better leave me, Sir Rowland," [...] she advised him. She <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> moved a step away; he followed with lowering glance, his upper lip lifting and laying bare his powerful teeth. In a stride he was beside her.|$|R
60|$|Duncombe {{tore the}} bill in <b>half</b> <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> away. He bowed to the lady at the desk.|$|R
60|$|When {{he looked}} back from the corner she was still at the gate. She was perhaps a little disconcerted by his retreat. He felt that. He hesitated for a moment, <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> stood <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} did great things with his hat. That hat! The wonderful hat of our civilisation!...|$|R
60|$|I drew aside on {{the instant}} to the footpath. The two {{foremost}} men were carried beyond me {{before they could}} check themselves. The third was as quick as lightning. He stopped, <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> struck at me with his stick. The blow was aimed at hazard, and was not a severe one. It fell on my left shoulder. I returned it heavily on his head. He staggered back and jostled his two companions {{just as they were}} both rushing at me. This circumstance gave me a moment's start. I slipped by them, and took {{to the middle of the}} road again at the top of my speed.|$|R
60|$|Lan-O saw {{the woman}} from Helium <b>half</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> with a quick {{movement}} jerk her right hand from where it had lain upon her breast. She saw the hand shoot from beneath the arm of E-Med and rise behind his shoulder and she saw in the hand a long, slim blade. The lips of the warrior were drawing closer {{to those of the}} woman, but they never touched them, for suddenly the man straightened, stiffly, a shriek upon his lips, and then he crumpled like an empty fur and lay, a shrunken heap, upon the floor. Tara of Helium stooped and wiped her blade upon his harness.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the crew}} fled back with laughter. They had {{no wish to}} be jerked on to the track. The {{engineer}} <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> his wrist, <b>and</b> [...] .007 found his drivers pinned firm.|$|R
5000|$|The number a of {{positions}} that require n any (<b>half</b> or quarter) <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> number q {{of positions}} that require n quarter turns only are: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And again, in the {{instance}} of your finding the mummy case empty, {{and then a}} few moments later with an occupant, you know that it was lamplight, that the lamp was <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> down, <b>and</b> that you had no special reason to look hard at the case. It is quite possible that you may have overlooked the creature in the first instance." ...|$|R
60|$|Dazed but unhurt, the boy rolled {{from the}} lifted fore {{quarters}} of the struggling brute to the ground. When he staggered to his feet again, not only his horse was gone but the whole herd of buffaloes seemed to have passed too, and {{he could hear the}} shouts of unseen hunters now ahead of him. They had evidently overlooked his fall, and the gully had concealed him. The sides before him were too steep for his aching limbs to climb; the slope by which he and the bull had descended when the collision occurred was behind the wounded animal. Clarence was staggering towards it when the bull, by a supreme effort, lifted itself on three legs, <b>half</b> <b>turned,</b> <b>and</b> faced him.|$|R
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>half</b> round <b>and</b> growled at him. Then I plunged {{deeper into}} the bush, {{growling}} as I went.|$|R
60|$|The big snake <b>turned</b> <b>half</b> round, <b>and</b> saw the egg on the verandah. 'Ah-h! Give it to me,' she said.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{men were}} tied Jethro secured {{in the same manner}} the man who was lying stunned from his blow. Then he turned to Plexo, who had not moved since he had fallen. He <b>half</b> <b>turned</b> him round, <b>and</b> uttered a low exclamation of surprise.|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} the Valmet M62/76 series rifles is the flash suppressor. It resembles an {{enlarged}} version of the suppressor on the original M16. Directly under the flash suppressor is a bayonet lug to accommodate the knife-style bayonet manufactured by Fiskars and Hackman. The flash suppressor has some sharp edges along its longitudinal cuts for wire cutting. A soldier slides the barbed wire into the flash suppressor and simply rotates his rifle around until it snaps the small gauge wire. For thicker wire, the soldier inserts the wire, gives a <b>half</b> <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> fires the rifle, which will snap the wire. On the M16 the prong type flash suppressor was abandoned for the bird cage type because the prongs tended to snag on vegetation in the field. While {{this is still a}} problem with the M62/76, the sharper edges help to cut through some of the vegetation.|$|R
