40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to examine the influence of slag evolution on BOF dephosphorisation.

The observed evolution of slag composition was consistent with many previous studies, where in the first half <b>of</b> the <b>blow</b> slags high in (%SiO 2) and low in (%FeO) are generated. During the second half <b>of</b> the oxygen <b>blow,</b> (FeO) generation and lime dissolution improve the slag basicity and contribute to the transfer of phosphorus from metal to slag. Poor levels of phosphorus removal during the centre region <b>of</b> the <b>blow</b> were found to coincide with a minimum in the (%FeO) composition. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>blow,</b> 70 % <b>of</b> the mass of phosphorus in the furnace is present in the slag, and the extent of phosphorus removal is proportional to the slag basicity and the (%FeO) concentration in the slag. By utilizing mass balance calculations to estimate the mass of slag in the furnace, it was shown that at tap, approximately 30 % of lime and 50 % of magnesia remain undissolved in a liquid slag saturated in both components. It was concluded that the mass of lime added to the furnace could be reduced without influencing the dissolved concentration of (%CaO), and therefore without deteriorating the extent of dephosphorisation...|$|R

The barrier layer thickness optimization for thermoplastic multilayer fuel tanks is also considered. The diffusion model {{is based on the}} continuum approach with steady-state permeation regime across the multilayer polymeric wall.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 60 years the {{steel making process}} has {{developed}} valuable technology for the scrap melting operation inside EAF. Traditionally, operators rely on the calculation of static charge models {{that are able to}} predict chemical composition and temperature of the bath at tapping.

The aim of the present work is to correlate the off gas composition with the values of temperature and carbon concentration at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> melting and refining process. For the calculation of the temperature, the thermal regime was estimated within the EAF and thereafter the temperature inside the metal bath as a function of the concentration of carbon present.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{dynamic control}} model based on {{simultaneous}} mass transfer of C, Cr, and Mn and dynamic heat balance is developed. It allows dynamic adjustment of argon-oxygen ratio. The model is implemented through Level II control system. The total operating period of one heat {{is divided into}} five different stages: charge calculation, first blow period, second blow period, third blow period and, lastly, the reduction stage. The charge calculation model, based on heat balance, mass balance and the costs decided the optimum charge mix to start with. Both linear and non-linear regression models are used to predict the temperature and composition of bath at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> first <b>blow</b> period. The second blow and the third blow periods use the dynamic models for predicting the chemical composition and temperature. In the model for reduction stage (final stage) the amount of reduction mixture is determined for obtaining maximum recovery of Cr and Mn from slag. On-line testing of the dynamic models was carried out on the shop floor. The practical aspects of integration of models in the Level II control system using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) are discussed. User friendly Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) are developed such that the operators can easily use it during the regular operation on shop-floor.
