500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to grow and <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to have a purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able}} to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to do.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall {{is known}} for his ability to break and dodge tackles. He led all NFL wide {{receivers}} in yards after first contact for the 2007 NFL season. Regarding Marshall's breakaway ability, cornerback Brandon Flowers said, [...] "Brandon Marshall is a defensive lineman playing wide receiver. He wants to inflict punishment on you. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to try to tackle him so he can shove you off of him and get more yards." [...] Cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha said Marshall is [...] "the toughest guy to bring down, one-on-one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Grace, I won't," [...] said Mrs. Maynard earnestly. [...] "I won't, indeed. And {{that makes}} me think: <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to go along this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What has Jacobus done? Did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> {{to marry}} again, Captain?" [...] I inquired in a deferential tone. But he was {{launched}} now and only grinned fiercely.|$|R
2500|$|Rowley {{finally caught}} up to where Wallace's {{division}} last was, only to find a supply wagon departing the scene. He rode on further and found General Wallace {{at the head of}} his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lied just ahead, exclaiming, [...] "I've been sent to hurry you up. Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole (Confederate) army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it." [...] Rowley further exclaimed, [...] "I had a devil of a time finding you!" [...] Wallace asked, [...] "Does General Grant send me orders?" [...] Rowley replied, [...] "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> at Pittsburg Landingand <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> there like hell." [...] Wallace, stunned by the news, said that was the second such message he received and immediately sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation. Upon their return they had confirmed Rowley's claim. Later, in his Autobiography, Wallace wrote about his encounter with Rowley, how he realized he was {{at the rear of the}} entire Confederate army, and how he was stunned by the news. Rowley and Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Putnam later corroborated Grant's account of the event when Grant was being criticized for the heavy losses involved in the battle. In the aftermath of the costly battle, rumors also emerged that Grant was delayed at Savannah because he had been drinking.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't. I said, if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> your head, <b>you</b> was to let {{him take}} it. But if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> mine, <b>you</b> wasn't {{to give it to}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well--I rather {{think he}} does. That is, {{not to give}} them, of course; you don't suppose <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> {{to make him a}} present of money. But <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to {{accommodate}} him with the price of them. You can either do that, or let him have so many of your own; it will be as broad as it is long; and he'll give you his note of hand for the amount.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{give up the}} Tower--just yet. That is what--he {{has brought}} you here for. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> {{to give it up}} and go back. Don't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> {{to go to}} the Blue Posts, did he?" [...] said Miriam {{when she}} heard of the proposition. [...] "It's like him. If there is to be any money spent it's {{anywhere}} but at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're right, {{but your}} {{speaking}} of India, {{reminds me of}} something I want to mention. I've been thinking over what Clarke said to you. His game's obvious, and {{it might have been}} a profitable one. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to help him in squeezing Colonel Challoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know, Pigeonswing, but you {{had started}} for the openings, before us," [...] {{observed}} le Bourdon. [...] "That tribeless old Injin made something of a fuss about your being out of the way; I dare say <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to help back the furniture down to the canoes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jake, who {{paused and}} looked hard at Dick. [...] "But I'm not sure that was all <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>You</b> were {{standing}} right under the block, and if I hadn't been a little to one side, where the lights didn't dazzle me, the smashing {{of a lot of}} concrete wouldn't have been the worst damage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{reasoning}} isn't very obvious, but I think I see a light," [...] he said. [...] "It's possible, however, {{he asked}} <b>you</b> because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you,</b> {{and there is}} an explanation for his waiting. I understand he hesitated because he doubted if he could support a wife. It looks as if Mr. Lister didn't know you were rich." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't {{you think}} you ought to at least listen to what Ruth's father has to say? All <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> to do is to hear his story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> for, do you think?" [...] asked Kennedy, {{stretching}} himself, with a yawn. It never {{struck him}} that Fenn {{could be in}} any serious trouble. Fenn was a prefect; and when the headmaster sent for a prefect, it was generally {{to tell him that}} he had got a split infinitive in his English Essay that week.|$|R
2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford, who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, [...] "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that <b>he</b> made <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to please him, but <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do that by writing in your own distinct way." ...|$|R
