50|$|In {{early and}} middle 20th century {{telephone}} exchanges this task {{was done by}} a supervisory relay set known variously as <b>junctor</b> circuit or district <b>junctor.</b> Later designs made it {{a function of the}} trunk circuit or absorbed it into software.|$|E
50|$|Early TNs {{had four}} JSF, {{for a total}} of 16 grids, 1024 J links and the same number of B links, with four B links from each Trunk <b>Junctor</b> grid to each Trunk Switch grid. Starting in the mid-1970s, larger offices had their B links wired differently, with only two B links from each Trunk <b>Junctor</b> Grid to each Trunk Switch Grid. This allowed a larger TN, with 8 JSF {{containing}} 32 grids, connecting 2048 junctors and 2048 B links. Thus the <b>junctor</b> groups could be larger and more efficient. These TN had eight TSF, giving the TN a unity trunk concentration ratio.|$|E
50|$|<b>Junctor</b> Circuits were {{installed}} in similar frames, but were simpler, {{with only two}} relays. They were used only in Line to Line junctors. Large offices, {{in addition to these}} <b>Junctor</b> Circuits, had Intraoffice Trunks, which were of similar design but fit into the same Universal Trunk Frames as interoffice trunks. They carried overflow traffic when the small <b>Junctor</b> Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in relay racks similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|E
5000|$|All JSFs had a unity {{concentration}} ratio, that is {{the number}} of B links within the network equalled the number of <b>junctors</b> to other networks. Most LSFs had a 4:1 Line Concentration Ratio (LCR); {{that is the}} lines were four times as numerous as the B links. In some urban areas 2:1 LSF were used. The B links were often [...] to make a higher LCR, such as 3:1 or (especially in suburban 1ESS) 5:1. Line Networks always had 1024 <b>Junctors,</b> arranged in 16 grids that each switched 64 <b>junctors</b> to 64 B links. Four grids were grouped for control purposes in each of four LJFs.|$|R
5000|$|In early {{electromechanical}} switches including panel switch, a [...] "district junctor" [...] handled {{supervision and}} talk battery duties for outgoing calls, {{similar to the}} duties of the cord circuit of manual exchanges. The <b>junctors</b> for incoming calls were simple three-wire connections between the incoming frame and the line frame. In the later electromechanical 5XB switch, <b>junctors</b> only consisted of three wires to connect the two legs of a call: the line and the trunk, of which the latter supplied all talk battery and supervision.|$|R
5000|$|... 5XB {{introduced}} the call-back principle, {{in which the}} initial concentrating switch train from the line to the digit receiver was entirely dropped during call completion so its links could immediately be reused for this or another call. It also uses entirely the same four-stage switching fabric for incoming as for outgoing calls. All lines are terminated on Line Link Frames and all trunks and most service circuits on trunk link frames. Each TLF is connected to all LLF by at least ten <b>junctors</b> ...|$|R
50|$|A channel from {{a line to}} a trunk {{consisted}} of three links of switching fabric: line link, <b>junctor,</b> and trunk link. In a 10x20 or larger office, ten channels, numbered 0 to 9, were available from any line to any trunk. The line <b>junctor</b> switch number and the trunk <b>junctor</b> switch number {{are the same as}} the channel number. Logic in the marker compares the ten links of each kind to obtain a clear channel. The lack of a channel is called a mismatch and resulted in picking another trunk, or another line, or the use of the ALL where that exists, or giving up and letting the caller try again.|$|E
5000|$|Line link frames (LLFs) are {{tiers of}} 10x20 {{crossbar}} switches {{in two or}} more bays. The switches in the first bay have their horizontal multiples, or [...] "banjo wires", cut in half, effectively dividing each switch into a line switch and a line <b>junctor</b> switch. Each of the ten <b>junctor</b> switches have ten junctors on its ten verticals, and each of its ten levels was wired as a line link, {{to one of the}} ten line switches of the LLF. Thus, the line link frame terminates 100 Junctors. Each <b>junctor</b> has full availability to however many hundreds of lines there are, via the hundred line links. The number of lines, thus the line concentration ratio (LCR), was engineered for the expected occupancy.|$|E
50|$|Late in {{the career}} of 5XB, <b>junctor</b> group size and thus link {{efficiency}} of the largest offices was increased {{by the use of}} auxiliary line link (ALL) frames. The ALL is a bay with ten <b>junctor</b> switches, divided as usual into left and right halves. One half has on its levels the line links of an even numbered LLF, and on its verticals, the junctors of the neighboring odd numbered one; the other half is vice versa. By this means, each LLF can use the junctors of its mate, if the marker failed to find an idle path on the first try. Since they are odd and even, their junctors appear {{on opposite sides of the}} trunk <b>junctor</b> switches, thus giving access to the mate trunk links as well. Connections through the ALL were only used in heavy traffic periods.|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} less {{efficient}} for coin phones, which need special signalling. In urban areas, they were served by older exchanges that had separate <b>junctors</b> for coin phones. Where the 5XB {{was the only}} exchange, a number of work-around methods were devised. Regular and coin phones shared the more complex and expensive coin trunks, or else separate routes were established, or coin trunks connected via tandem switches including the 5XB itself acting as its own tandem. In this last case, the call had to use two connections through the switching fabric: one to connect the line to the coin supervision trunk and another to connect that trunk to the outgoing trunk.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{computational}} linguistics, the representation of natural languages (NL) in formal grammar terms is a well-known issue and a wicked problem indeed.

50|$|Within each LN or TN, the A, B, C and J links {{were counted}} {{from the outer}} {{termination}} to the inner. That is, for a trunk, the trunk Stage 0 switch could connect each trunk to any of eight A links, which in turn were wired to Stage 1 switches to connect them to B links. Trunk <b>Junctor</b> grids also had Stage 0 and Stage 1 switches, the former to connect B links to C links, and the latter to connect C to J links also called Junctors. Junctors were gathered into cables, 16 twisted pairs per cable constituting a <b>Junctor</b> Subgroup, running to the <b>Junctor</b> Grouping Frame where they were plugged into cables to other networks. Each network had 64 or 128 subgroups, and was connected to each other network by one or (usually) several subgroups.|$|E
50|$|Each four stage Line Network (LN) or Trunk Network (TN) {{was divided}} into <b>Junctor</b> Switch Frames (JSF) and either Line Switch Frames (LSF) {{in the case of}} a Line Network, or Trunk Switch Frames (TSF) {{in the case of a}} Trunk Network. Links were {{designated}} A, B, C, and J for <b>Junctor.</b> A Links were internal to the LSF or TSF; B Links connected LSF or TSF to JSF, C were internal to JSF, and J links or Junctors connected to another net in the exchange.|$|E
50|$|Gennadius is a genus of snout moths. It was {{described}} by Carl Heinrich in 1956, and contains the species G. <b>junctor.</b> It is found in French Guiana.|$|E
50|$|A <b>junctor</b> is {{a circuit}} used in analog {{telephone}} exchanges, including the Number One Crossbar Switching System, Number Five Crossbar Switching System, Panel switch, 1ESS switch and other switches.|$|E
50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} <b>junctor</b> {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk <b>junctor</b> switches in the trunk link frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to trunk circuits. The basic design of the TLF has ten <b>junctor</b> switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|E
50|$|The TLF having {{twice as}} many links, <b>junctor</b> switches, and junctors as the LLF, there are always {{twice as many}} LLFs as TLFs. As first designed, the maximum number was ten TLFs and twenty LLFs, known as 10x20, and at first rarely achieved. In the late 1950s {{multiple}} trunk <b>junctor</b> switch bays (ETL and SETL) were added to give each TLF access to more junctors. The first expanded version allowed each office to have 20x40, and in the 1960s the maximum reached 30x60. Development stopped at that point because the four-stage layout was becoming progressively less efficient at greater sizes, and because the 1ESS switch with eight stages was under development.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{controllers}} in each <b>Junctor</b> Frame had no-test {{access to}} their Junctors via their F-switch, a ninth level in the Stage 1 switches which could be opened or closed independently of the crosspoints in the grid. When setting up each call through the fabric, but before connecting the fabric to the line and/or trunk, the controller could connect a test scan point to the talk wires in order to detect potentials. Current flowing through the scan point would be reported to the maintenance software, resulting in a [...] "False Cross and Ground" [...] (FCG) teleprinter message listing the path. Then the maintenance software would tell the call completion software to try again with a different <b>junctor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stored-program analog {{switches}} {{such as the}} 1ESS switch, {{had both}} simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were {{in the form of}} plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for intraoffice calls and were closely similar to intraoffice trunk packs, with two scan points and two signal distributor points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were two-wire connections between trunk nets and other trunk nets or line nets. When three-way calling was introduced, three-port conference trunks were used, which only appeared on trunk nets. All junctors appeared in subgroups of sixteen on plugs or jacks at the <b>Junctor</b> Grouping Frame, where as many subgroups as required were plugged into other trunk nets, line nets, or circuit <b>junctor</b> frames.|$|E
50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder {{of the panel}} switch, autonomously connecting the line to a <b>junctor,</b> which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the panel switch, the sender then found the chosen <b>junctor</b> and supplied dial tone. Like the panel switch, the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the panel switch, two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient trunking. Unlike the panel switch, it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|E
50|$|Electromechanical pulse {{counters}} counted message {{units for}} message rate service lines in panel switches and similar exchanges {{installed in the}} early and middle 20th century. The metering pulses were generated in a <b>junctor</b> circuit, at a rate set by the sender, usually one pulse every few minutes. Every month a worker read and recorded the indicated number of message units, similar to the accounting of a gas meter. In {{the middle of the}} 20th century it became customary to photograph the meters, about a hundred per film frame, for examination in comfort.|$|E
50|$|The voice {{switching}} fabric plan {{was similar to}} that of the earlier 5XB switch in being bidirectional and in using the call-back principle. The largest full access matrix switches in the system, however, were 8x8 rather than 10x10 or 20x16. Thus they required eight stages rather than four to achieve large enough <b>junctor</b> groups in a large office. Crosspoints being more expensive in the new system but switches cheaper, system cost was minimized with fewer crosspoints organized into more switches. The fabric was divided into Line Networks and Trunk Networks of four stages, and partially folded to allow connecting line-to-line or trunk-to-trunk without exceeding eight stages of switching.|$|E
5000|$|With a clean FCG test, {{the call}} {{completion}} software told the [...] "A" [...] relay {{in the trunk}} circuit to operate, connecting its transmission and test hardware to the switching fabric and thus to the line. Then, for an outgoing call, the trunk's scan point would scan {{for the presence of}} an off hook line. If the short was not detected, the software would command the printing of a [...] "Supervsion Failure" [...] (SUPF) and try again with a different <b>junctor.</b> A similar supervision check was performed when an incoming call was answered. Any of these tests could alert for the presence of a bad crosspoint.|$|E
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming trunk circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} <b>junctor</b> circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|E
50|$|In most mid-20th-century {{switching}} equipment, {{a permanent}} signal would tie up a <b>junctor</b> circuit, diminishing {{the ability of}} the switch to handle outgoing calls. When flooded cables or other conditions made this a real problem, switch staff would open the cable, or paper the off-normal contacts of the crossbar switch, or block the line relay from operating. These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all outgoing calls from that line until it was manually cleared. Manufacturers also sold devices that monitored the talk wires and held up the cutoff relay or crossbar hold magnet until the condition cleared. Some crossbar line circuit designs had a park condition allowing the line circuit itself to monitor the line.|$|E
50|$|Scanners were Line Scanners (LSC), Universal Trunk Scanners (USC), <b>Junctor</b> Scanners (JSC) and Master Scanners (MS). The {{first three}} only scanned for supervision, while Master Scanners did all other scan jobs. For example, a DTMF Receiver, mounted in a Miscellaneous Trunk frame, had eight demand scan points, {{one for each}} frequency, and two {{supervisory}} scan points, one to signal {{the presence of a}} valid DTMF combination so the software knew when to look at the frequency scan points, and the other to supervise the loop. The supervisory scan point also detected Dial Pulses, with software counting the pulses as they arrived. Each digit when it became valid was stored in a software hopper to be given to the Originating Register.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} controlled the magnetic latching relays by Signal Distributors (SD) packaged in the Universal Trunk frames, <b>Junctor</b> frames, or in Miscellaneous Trunk frames, {{according to which}} they were numbered as USD, JSD or MSD. SD were originally contact trees of 30-contact wire spring relays, each driven by a flipflop. Each magnetic latching relay had one transfer contact dedicated to sending a pulse back to the SD, on each operate and release. The pulser in the SD detected this pulse to determine that the action had occurred, or else alerted the maintenance software to print a FSCAN report. In later 1AESS versions SD were solid state with several SD points per circuit pack generally on the same shelf or adjacent shelf to the trunk pack.|$|E
50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the <b>junctor</b> circuits with incoming trunks, leaving only the ability to connect those incoming trunks to outgoing trunks. In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|E
50|$|The {{much smaller}} Remreed crosspoints, {{introduced}} {{at about the}} same time as 1AESS, were packaged as grid boxes of four principal types. Type 10A <b>Junctor</b> Grids and 11A Trunk Grids were a box about 16x16x5 inches (40x40x12 cm) with sixteen 8x8 switches inside. Type 12A Line Grids with 2:1 LCR were only about 5 inches (12 cm) wide, with eight 4x4 Stage 0 line switches with ferrods and cutoff contacts for 32 lines, connected internally to four 4x8 Stage 1 switches connecting to B-links. Type 14A Line Grids with 4:1 LCR were about 16x12x5 inches (40x30x12 cm) with 64 lines, 32 A-links and 16 B-links. The boxes were connected to the rest of the fabric and control circuitry by slide-in connectors. Thus the worker had to handle a much bigger, heavier piece of equipment, but didn't have to unwrap and rewrap dozens of wires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the status of the {{connective}} ça fait que in the French spoken in the Magdalen Islands, by taking into account the distributional characteristics of this ambiguous <b>junctor.</b> Among all the locutions that figure in the category of conjunctions, the expression ça fait que plays an important role in both Acadian and Quebec French. According to Grevisse, its meaning in Popular French in France is close to donc, ainsi and alors, whereas recent research indicates that the connective seems to have partially lost the notion of consequence in North American French varieties. Previous studies by Roy (1979), Léard (1986) and Wiesmath (2000) show that ça fait que (which may be reduced to ça fait or fait que) tends to be used more and more as a discourse marker. This gradual loss of semantic value goes along with a modification of the pragmatic status of the connective. Our analysis, based on a number of examples found in our corpus of spoken French in the Magdalen Islands, focuses on syntactic behaviour and pragmatic functions in order to reveal the types of possible operations and various combinations of the marker with other discourse particles...|$|E
