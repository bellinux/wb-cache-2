40|$|Underground online <b>forums</b> are {{platforms}} {{that enable}} trades of illicit services and stolen goods. Carding <b>forums,</b> in particular, {{are known for}} being focused on trading financial information. However, little evidence exists about the sellers that are present on carding <b>forums,</b> the precise types of products they advertise, and the prices buyers pay.

This paper provides first-of-its-kind empirical evidence on active <b>forums</b> where stolen financial data is traded.
