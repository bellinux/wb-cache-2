5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (<b>kaempferol,</b> myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
5|$|These cytotaxonomic {{findings}} {{were supported by}} subsequent chromatographic studies. A.montanum was shown to produce a pattern of seven substances chromatographically distinct from those produced by the other diploid members of the Appalachian Asplenium complex. These substances {{were present in the}} chromatograms of all tested hybrids believed to descend from A.montanum at one or more removes: A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii, A.×kentuckiense, A.pinnatifidum, A.×trudellii, and A.×wherryi. Four of the compounds present in the chromatograms of A.montanum and its descendants, fluorescing gold-orange under ultraviolet light, were subsequently identified as the xanthonoids mangiferin, isomangiferin, and their O-glucosides. The other two were identified as <b>kaempferol</b> derivatives, but could not be more precisely determined due to lack of material; the last was a trace compound which could not be studied.|$|E
25|$|In red grapes, {{the main}} {{flavonol}} is on average quercetin, followed by myricetin, <b>kaempferol,</b> laricitrin, isorhamnetin, and syringetin. In white grapes, the main flavonol is quercetin, followed by <b>kaempferol</b> and isorhamnetin. The delphinidin-like flavonols myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin are missing in all white varieties, {{indicating that the}} enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is not expressed in white grape varieties.|$|E
25|$|The {{red color}} of the juice is due to betalains, (betanin and indicaxanthin). The plant also {{contains}} flavonoids, such as quercetin, isorhamnetin and <b>kaempferol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Extracts of {{ginkgo leaves}} contain {{phenolic}} acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, <b>kaempferol,</b> isorhamnetin and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones, ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, {{as well as}} alkylphenols and polyprenols.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{produced}} from muscadine grapes may contain more than 40mg/L, an exceptional phenolic content. In muscadine skins, ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, <b>kaempferol,</b> and trans-resveratrol are major phenolics. Contrary to previous results, ellagic acid and not resveratrol {{is the major}} phenolic in muscadine grapes.|$|E
25|$|Herbal {{extracts}} as {{a source}} of compounds with an antiviral activity has attracted significant attention recently. Two researches independently published in 2016 screened a library of natural chemicals against FCV. The first one showed that Theaflavin and its derivatives but not <b>Kaempferol</b> significally inhibited entry of FCV into cells. On the contrary, authors of the second article claimed that kaempherol showed anti-FCV activity, but theaflavin treatment was insufficient. This striking difference may be (at least partially) explained by differences in testing conditions. Indeed, further studies of activity, as well as molecular mechanisms of action, needed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compounds}} {{found in}} passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides {{have been found}} in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), <b>kaempferol,</b> lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), quercetin, rutin, saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue passion flower (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at least in some Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the anthocyanidin pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.|$|E
500|$|Phenolic and ellagic acids were undetected in N. rajah, while {{concentrations}} of <b>kaempferol</b> {{were found to}} be very weak. [...] Chromatographic patterns of the N. × alisaputrana samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species.|$|E
2500|$|Regular {{green tea}} is 99.9% water, {{provides}} 1 Calorie per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant nutrient content (table) and contains phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and caffeine. Polyphenols found in green tea include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate, epicatechins and flavanols, which have antioxidant, anticarcinogen, anti-inflammatory, and anti-radiation biochemical effects in vitro. [...] Other components include {{three kinds of}} flavonoids, known as <b>kaempferol,</b> quercetin, and myricetin. A remarkably higher content of myricetin is detected in tea and its extracts than in many other plants, and this high concentration of myricetin may have some implications for the experimentally-observed bioactivity of tea and its extracts in vitro.|$|E
2500|$|The Leguminosae {{are rarely}} cyanogenic, however, where they are, the cyanogenic {{compounds}} {{are derived from}} tyrosine, phenylalanine or leucine. They frequently contain alkaloids. Proanthocyanidins can be present either as cyanidin or delphinidine or {{both at the same}} time. [...] Flavonoids such as <b>kaempferol,</b> quercitin and myricetin are often present. Ellagic acid has never been found in any of the genera or species analysed. [...] Sugars are transported within the plants in the form of sucrose. C3 photosynthesis has been found {{in a wide variety of}} genera. The family has also evolved a unique chemistry. Many legumes contain toxic and indigestible substances which may be removed through various processing methods. Pterocarpans are a class of molecules (derivatives of isoflavonoids) found only in the Fabaceae.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and <b>kaempferol.</b> The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kaempferol</b> is {{ingested}} as a glycoside, {{absorbed in}} the small intestine, usually by passive diffusion due to kaempferol’s lipophilicity, and metabolized in various areas of the body. In the small intestine, <b>kaempferol</b> is metabolized to glucuronides and sulfoconjugates by intestinal enzymes. It can also be metabolized by colon microflora which can hydrolyze the glycosides to aglycones or form simple phenolic compounds. These compounds can be absorbed or excreted. <b>Kaempferol</b> is also extensively metabolized in the liver to form glucurono-conjugated and sulfo-conjugated forms. These forms of <b>kaempferol,</b> and <b>kaempferol</b> itself, can then be excreted in urine. About 2.5% of <b>kaempferol</b> ingested is excreted as urine. Much {{of the rest of}} ingested <b>kaempferol</b> is present in the plasma and tissues in nanomolar concentrations.|$|E
