40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Standard methods for culturing equine synovial fluid (SF) are often unrewarding. Evidence-based {{information on the}} relative efficiency of different systems used for optimisation of isolation of microorganisms from equine SF is lacking. Objectives: To compare the results of different culture systems performed in parallel on SF samples from horses clinically diagnosed with synovial sepsis. Methods: Synovial fluid specimens were collected between February 2007 and October 2008 from all horses admitted to a referral hospital that were clinically diagnosed with synovial sepsis and from control horses. Synovial fluid samples were cultured in parallel by: 1) direct agar culture (DA); agar culture after: 2) lysis-centrifugation pretreatment (LC); 3) conventional enrichment (CE); 4) combined LC/CE; or 5) blood culture <b>medium</b> <b>enrichment</b> using an automated system (BACTEC 9050). Results: Ninety SF samples from 82 horses were included, together with 40 control samples. Seventy-one of 90 samples (79 %) were culture-positive by using blood culture <b>medium</b> <b>enrichment</b> (BACTEC), which was significantly higher compared to all other methods. BACTEC enrichment was never negative while {{any of the other}} methods was positive. Although agar culture following LC and/or CE resulted in a slightly higher number of positive samples compared to DA, this difference was not significant. All control samples were culture negative by the 5 different techniques. Although the majority of samples containing isolates recovered without enrichment, culture results after BACTEC enrichment were available on the same day as for agar culture with or without LC (19 / 23 samples), while CE postponed recovery by at least one day in 20 / 23 samples. Conclusion: Blood culture <b>medium</b> <b>enrichment</b> is superior to other techniques for isolation of bacteria from SF of horses. The use of an automated system allows enrichment without substantially postponing recovery of microorganisms. Potential relevance: The efficient and fast isolation of microorganisms from infected SF by the BACTEC system allows for rapid susceptibility testing and a more appropriate antibiotic treatment...|$|R

40|$|Topographical {{distribution}} of concanavalin A binding sites (CABS) was studied in {{two lines of}} virally transformed fibroblasts {{as a function of}} fatty acid composition. Fatty acid composition was manipulated by incubating cells in fatty acid, ATP, CoA, and delipidated fetal calf serum (FCS). VLM cells grown in medium containing 5 % FCS have a clustered CABS distribution. Plasma membrane vesicles (PMVs) derived from these cells have an arachidonate content of 1. 7 %. Elevation of PMV arachidonate to 15. 8 % results in a marked restriction of CABS patching, while elevation to 6. 8 % is associated with intermediate restriction of patching. Restriction of patching is associated with increased microviscosity. CABS of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (RSV-CEF) are also responsive to arachidonate <b>enrichment</b> <b>medium.</b> Whereas untreated cells have a clustered CABS distribution, cells incubated for 24 h in arachidonate <b>enrichment</b> <b>medium</b> have predominantly a dispersed CABS distribution. In both VLM cells and RSV- CEF, ATP, CoA, and delipidated FCS alone have no effect upon CABS mobility. Inhibition of CABS patching is also observed when aspirin is included in the arachidonate <b>enrichment</b> <b>medium</b> but not when the cells are incubated in prostaglandins, thus suggesting that the restriction of CABS mobility is not mediated by prostaglandins. Other fatty acids (palmitate, oleate, nonadecanoate) failed to restrict CABS movement. The inhibition of CABS mobility is independent of cell shape change...|$|E
30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} is {{a measure}} of water capacity to convey electric current. The most desirable limit of EC in drinking water is prescribed as 1, 500  μmhos/cm (WHO 2004). The EC of the groundwater is varying from 64.02 and 2199.57  μmhos/cm with an average value of 514  μmhos/cm (Fig.  3 b). Higher EC in the study area indicates the enrichment of salts in the groundwater. The value of electrical conductivity may be an approximate index of the total content of dissolved substance in water. It depends upon temperature, concentration and types of ions present (Hem 1985). The EC can be classified as type I, if the enrichments of salts are low (EC <  1, 500  μmhos/cm); type II, if the enrichment of salts are medium (EC 1, 500 and 3, 000  μmhos/cm); and type III, if the enrichments of salts are high (EC >  3, 000  μmhos/cm). According to the above classification of EC, 96  % of the total groundwater samples come under the type I (low enrichment of salts) and 4  % under type II (<b>medium</b> <b>enrichment</b> of salts). The effect of saline intrusion may be the reason for <b>medium</b> <b>enrichment</b> of EC in the study area. The effect of pH may also increase the dissolution process, which eventually increases the EC value.|$|R

The mortality rate of early onset neonatal sepsis has been reported up to 50 %.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} effect of the <b>enrichment</b> <b>medium</b> used on the {{isolation}} of Salmonella from the duodenal content of naturally infected slaughter pigs. At six slaughterhouses, the duodenum was collected from 458 randomly chosen pigs and examined in the laboratory. Three semi-solid enrichment media (modified semisolid Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium [MSRV], diagnostic semi-solid Salmonella medium [DIASALM], and Simple Method Salmonella [SMS] agar) and three enrichment broths (Rappaport-Vassiliadis, Rappaport Vassiliadis broth with Soya [RVS], and Muller Kauffmann Tetrathionate novobiocin broth [MKTTn]) were evaluated. If a migration zone was present on the semi-solid media, a loopful was taken both near the inoculation drop and {{at the edge of the}} migration zone and streaked on a Xylose Lysine Desoxycholate (XLD) agar plate. Each enrichment broth was streaked on XLD, and three presumptive colonies were further examined. Detection rate was calculated, and isolates were, after serotyping, genotyped by performing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The overall frequency of Salmonella isolated in at least one of the six different media was 15. 5 % (71 / 458). No significant differences in relative sensitivity were obtained within semi-solid media and within liquid media. Semi-solid media showed a significant higher relative sensitivity than the one obtained with liquid media. A relative sensitivity higher than 83. 1 %, namely of 94. 4 %, could only be obtained by combining three different enrichment media (MSRV or DIASALM+RVS+MKTTn).
