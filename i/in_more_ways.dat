5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, {{coming out of the}} woods <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> than one.|$|E

5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> than one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in}} the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

25|$|By 1923 Coventry {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{consistent}} full forwards in the league and would remain the club's leading goal kicker for the next five seasons, as well as playing in three losing grand final sides.

Coventry would continue being Collingwood's leading goal kicker during the years 1931–1934, and would win his first and only, Copeland Trophy in 1933, where he kicked another 108 goals for the season.|$|E
