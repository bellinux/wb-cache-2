5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending on rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E

Burke sued in Cook County Circuit Court to remove Washington from office, contending that Washington forfeited his office by being three weeks late in filing a routine financial disclosure by the deadline set by state law. The suit was dismissed. Burke asked Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan to seek the ouster of Washington. The request was denied. Richard M. Daley, Cook County States Attorney at the time, pleaded for unity, saying, [...] "This personal hatred <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Catlin {{from the}} Hartford Courant {{said that the}} {{passages}} from the book were [...] "too dirty to quote here, even the funny ones". The Daily Beast said that [...] "the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] Sex is convincing only when it's playful, as when she appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she's simply undressed {{with no place to}} go". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post gave the book a mixed review by saying: [...] "Is Sex shocking? not really. Mostly because it's Madonna, and somehow we've come to expect this from her. Is Sex boring? surprisingly, yes". During her review of the book, British author Zoë Heller from The Independent wrote that it was [...] "the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation" [...] and that [...] "previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, 'empowering' way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far." [...] Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for The New Yorker, wrote that [...] "unfortunately, the book is going to be mistaken for pornography". Vanity Fair deemed it [...] "the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published". Caryn James from The New York Times was negative in her review stating that [...] "There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)". Vicki Goldberg from the same newspaper was also dismissive of the photography of the book saying that [...] "Unfortunately, not many of the images are very good photographically. Many are just pictures, or just porn". Writing for Spin magazine, Bob Guccione, Jr. gave the book a particularly unfavorable review: ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{initially}} {{reservations about the}} song from the radio industry; a common complaint {{was that it was}} too long, and others also questioned the speed of the song, and thought that the singer [...] "keeps yelling". Some stations refused to play the song after checking the song's length, or after it caused them to miss the news. The radio industry trade publication Gavin Report offered the opinion that [...] "blue-eyed soul <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far". In Britain, Sam Costa, a DJ on the BBC Light Programme, said that The Righteous Brothers' record was a dirge, adding, [...] "I wouldn't even play it in my toilet." [...] However, [...] despite the initial reservations, the song would become a highly popular song on radio.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, {{longtime}} drummer and percussionist Kliph Scurlock {{left the}} band, he {{was replaced by}} drummer, percussionist and keyboardist Matt Duckworth, and the band added percussionist and drummer Nicholas Ley, Derek Brown began focusing on guitars, and occasional keyboards and percussion. In May, Scurlock claimed he had been fired for negative comments about Wayne Coyne's friend Christina Fallin, the daughter of Oklahoma's governor and leader of a band called Pink Pony. Fallin had recently been criticized for cultural appropriation after she wore a Native American headdress in a publicity photo. [...] According to Scurlock, his criticism of Fallin's actions led to conflict with Coyne and his dismissal. In response, Drozd said, [...] "his Lips/Kliph bullshit <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far. We parted ways because of the usual band musical differences. The rest has been blown way out." [...] Coyne went even further, calling Scurlock a [...] "pathological liar" [...] and stated that he never meant his defense of Fallin, which included posting a photo of his dog in a feathered headdress, to be offensive {{but that he was}} [...] "very sorry, to anybody that is following my Instagram or my Twitter, if I offended anybody of any religion, any race, any belief system. I would say you shouldn't follow my tweets; you shouldn't even probably want to be a Flaming Lips fan because we don't really have any agenda." ...|$|E
