5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, and resolved {{to do whatever}} he can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed essential in stopping the Austrian ambitions at the Verona's congress. Memoring these good services, the King Carlo Felice invited Paulucci in Piedmont in 1829, and the two started a close friendship.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} rookie season, Urlacher {{was able to}} gain popularity with the fans. On a national level, Urlacher's jersey sales have rivaled those of other NFL superstars, such as Brett Favre and Michael Vick. Football fans across the nation have also voted Urlacher into eight Pro Bowls. Urlacher's teammates and coaches have also praised his character and athletic ability.

5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> many legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared {{at the time that}} inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member. She feels uncomfortable {{replacing}} a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous plans.|$|E
5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{visits to}} Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector {{at the age}} of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E

50|$|He {{was active}} as a violinist in {{performances}} organized by Gottfried van Swieten (in quartets by Haydn and Mozart), {{but he was}} most widely admired as a lutenist.

5|$|In 1943 Larkin was {{appointed}} librarian {{of the public}} library in Wellington, Shropshire. It was while working there that in early 1944 he met his first girlfriend, Ruth Bowman, an academically ambitious 16-year-old schoolgirl. In 1945, Ruth went to continue her studies at King's College London; <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> visits their friendship developed into a sexual relationship. By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the Library Association and {{was appointed}} assistant librarian at University College, Leicester. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's Senior Common Room that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write Lucky Jim (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably. Six weeks after his father's death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring Hardy country.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Friday prayer sermons, {{he called}} for volunteers {{to engage in a}} jihad against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman {{military}} training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen (those who engage in jihad) when he arrived in Alexandretta {{in the latter part of}} that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state's focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
50|$|Couse {{left the}} ship and charged Cornish with forcible sodomy.

5|$|Kazuma is {{a native}} Alter user who makes his living as a {{mercenary}} so {{that he and his}} close friend, Kanami Yuta, can live together. Kazuma's friend Kunihiko Kimishima gives him a mission to defeat another native Alter user. However, a man known as Ryuho from HOLY captures Kazuma in the aftermath. Ryuho tries to interrogate Kazuma over an unknown Alter user (later dubbed Crystal) who killed his mother and dog. Using a woman from HOLY named Mimori Kiryu as a hostage, Kazuma manages to return to his house. When native Alter users are captured by HOLY, Kazuma enters a forest where he finds Crystal. After fighting Crystal, Kazuma's Alter receives a power up. Shortly afterwards, it is revealed the Great Uprising was caused by a similar event in a parallel universe where all creatures are independent thinking Alters. Kazuma goes on a rampage against HOLY after Kinishima dies while helping him <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fights. Shortly afterwards, Kazuma and Ryuho fight, but during the battle, they open a gateway to the parallel universe, causing another uprising and attracting the attention of the Mainland government.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and likely spent a few months {{attending}} lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, Báthory joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya's supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time Báthory fell out of favour at Zápolya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and {{was seen as a}} possible successor to Zápolya.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed <b>during</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> routine pit stops due to {{a problem with a}} loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
50|$|In 1749 he was {{in command}} at the capture <b>of</b> Devicota, <b>during</b> which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{subordinate}} officers was Robert Clive (1725-1774), the future Commander-in-Chief of British India, with whom a lifelong friendship began.

5|$|The colony faced {{numerous}} difficulties {{during its}} brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions {{to find the}} Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only {{with help from the}} French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny.|$|E

50|$|Johnson has {{cited the}} film Electric Dreams as an {{influential}} force {{in his early}} musical pursuits.
