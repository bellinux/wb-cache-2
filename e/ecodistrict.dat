40|$|In {{the world}} today, people are {{increasingly}} {{paying more attention}} to our living environment and rapid resource depletion. How we live in cities {{is one of the greatest}} challenges of our time. This marketing plan introduces a way to deploy <b>EcoDistricts,</b> an innovation that will have potentially the greatest positive impact on green energy, water, construction, planning and transportation thus far. It can help to achieve the cost and resource savings required to serve the massive numbers of people migrating to cities. This marketing plan is intended to explore the potential market for <b>EcoDistricts</b> Projects and form a strategy to capture that market. The report analyzes the target market – cities concentrating on existing neighborhoods with projects based on private funding, and provides customer and competition analyses. The plan concludes with a strategy constituting pricing and partnership plans as well as a communication plan to build brand awareness for <b>EcoDistricts</b> projects. The Portland Sustainability Institute (PoSI) created <b>EcoDistricts,</b> a five phase approach for accelerating sustainable neighborhood development. <b>EcoDistricts</b> aims to create and implement a replicable, exportable, scalable, and economically viable framework for the resource-efficient regeneration of existing cities. This proposal will introduce and demonstrate how <b>EcoDistricts</b> will execute a plan to build and develop regenerative and resilient cities that are culturally thriving, energy and resource hyper-efficient, and economically sustainable [1]. This is a marketing plan for a new service named <b>EcoDistricts.</b> Market research data has been used to demonstrate an opportunity and how <b>EcoDistricts</b> can develop its marketing strategy...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims to gain {{a better}} understanding for how the processes, goals, and actions are formulated and implemented throughout three <b>EcoDistricts</b> within Portland, Foster Green, Living Cully, and South of Market (SoMa). More specifically, this study will analyze how these districts are formed around three different drivers in the push for sustainability. The research will use case studies to provide insight into exactly what those drivers might be, whether they be citizens, institutions, etc., and then what this means for on-the-ground results. As <b>EcoDistricts</b> currently reside as the most well-known example for neighborhood sustainability in Portland, and arguably across the United States, this research will analyze the <b>EcoDistricts</b> process and look to infer how this translates to general neighborhood-scale efforts. Challenges and possible solutions will then be brought forth to help set up future research into the field. This paper will draw out the major themes present in neighborhood-scale literature that suggest successful sustainable efforts. I will then use this research to provide context for Portland 2 ̆ 7 s biggest neighborhood-scale effort, <b>EcoDistricts.</b> Through the analysis of SoMa, Foster Green, and Living Cully, I will then draw on the successes and failures of the districts, tie them back to the literature, and finish by analyzing what this means for future discussion around neighborhood-scale sustainability efforts. Methods of research include qualitative content analysis, interviews, and extensive scholarly research to ascertain a full understanding of the processes, goals, and actions within the three varying <b>EcoDistricts...</b>|$|R

In recent years we have witnessed an impressive growth of ecodistrict-labelled projects in European countries, and more specifically in Spain during the recent take-off of the real estate market. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that in many cases, such urban programmes are mere smoke-screens which obscure the financing of traditional housing projects of doubtful sustainable content.

30|$|The Doñana social-ecological system (Doñana SES) {{consists}} of four <b>ecodistricts</b> (marsh, aeolian sheets, estuary, and coast) (Montes et al., 1998). The Doñana marsh, covering 1, 660 km 2, is one of Europe's biggest coastal wetlands and maintains a high biodiversity that delivers multiple ecosystem services, including biodiversity conservation, nature tourism, and water regulation (Zorrilla-Miras et al. [2014]). The social system includes several institutions, {{some of which have}} shaped the past and present of Doñana, such as the Doñana Protected Area. Nonetheless, in the previous decades, much of the marshes were transformed into agricultural lands. As a result, the protected area is surrounded by a matrix dedicated to agriculture which mainly delivers food (Palomo et al. [2014]). The most important crops being produced are rice and red fruits, many of which are exported to other countries, while non-irrigated farming has declined in the last decades.|$|R
40|$|The {{geographical}} {{area that is}} the province of Manitoba stretches across five distinct terrestrial ecozones, each with a unique combination of land forms, soils, water features, vegetation and climate. Within each ecozone exists a number of <b>ecodistricts</b> characterized with distinctive relief, geography, landforms and soils, vegetation, water, fauna and land use. The majority Manitoba’s agricultural activity, including pig production, lies within the Prairies and southern portions of the Boreal Plains ecozones. Agriculture activity exists {{to a lesser degree}} in the northern Boreal Plains and Boreal Shield ecozones, however, industry and public initiatives are likely to increase agriculture, including animal production in these regions. The challenge to Manitoba regulators is great as environmental regulation or policy requires the flexibility to address issues across this broad and geographically diverse landscape. Trends over the past 20 years confirm that Manitoba’s agriculture activity is diverse and remains very dynamic. Pig production has {{played a major role in}} this evolution and today leads the agriculture sector in farm cash receipts. However, unlike many other pork producing regions of the world, Canadian farm investment and management practices have two to four fold greater reliance on export markets. The challenge is to identify environmental protection policies that continue to offer Manitoba’s agriculture sector, and the pig industry specifically, opportunities to adapt as market forces change and new technologies become available...|$|R
40|$|In modern times, {{efforts to}} {{construct}} sustainable alternative neighbourhood scale developments date to isolated voluntary initiatives in 1970 s Europe and the United States. Since about 2006, they have increased rapidly in popularity. They now go by many names: <b>ecodistricts,</b> écoquartiers, eco-cities, zero/low-carbon/carbon-positive cities, ecopolises, ecobarrios, One Planet Communities, and solar cities. They have become frames—sometimes the dominant frame—used to orient {{the construction of}} new pieces of a city in a growing number of countries. Despite numerous standardization efforts, the field of ecourban neighbourhood planning and practice lacks a consistent cross-cultural understanding of what constitutes meaningful ecourbanism in specific economic, political, ecological, social, and design-based terms. Ecourban neighbourhood projects also respond to strictly local challenges and opportunities and express themselves in fragmented ways in different contexts. This article presents an original typology of ecourbanism as the integration of seven extreme type principles. We developed this typology through an abductive approach, or the back and forth testing of observed practices with arguments advanced in theories of sustainable development, planning and urban studies. While ecourban neighbourhood developments by definition express integrative goals, this typology permits assessment {{of the extent to which}} outcomes are being achieved in terms of each specific principle. We define and present a limiting case for each of these extreme type principles. Rather than attempting to render different standards equivalent across national contexts, this typology-based approach to understand the outcomes of ecourban neighbourhood developments promises a means to facilitate orienting these developments toward higher levels of integration within a common set of principled boundaries, as they are developed around the world...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} for urban facilities management (UFM) {{is to identify}} ways to promote sustainable urban development at a community/precinct level. One potential approach is via the application of sustainable community assessment/rating tools which have seen increased popularity amongst urban planners and developers over the past decade. This study investigates the efficacy and applicability of this approach to urban sustainability, particularly within the "developing country"context of South Africa. Furthermore, the paper suggests that the deployment of UFM in creating a management platform for urban precincts, one {{that focuses on the}} process of achieving urban sustainability within a specific locale, will deliver improved strategies for operationalising urban sustainability. Using soft systems methodology (SSM), the study aimed to establish the fundamental requirements for sustainable community development frameworks in both "developing" and "developed countries". Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 11 key stakeholders who consisted of two main categories. Firstly, participants from private and public sector engaged in the management and development of sustainable urban precincts. Secondly, participants from NGO's that develop sustainable community rating tools. The tools included: Leadership in Engineering and Environmental Design for Neighbourhood Development (LEED-ND), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology for Communities (BREEAM-C), Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency for Urban Development (CASBEE-UD), <b>EcoDistricts,</b> Green Star Communities (GSC), and the Living Community Challenge (LCC). Interviews were conducted in both Cape Town and Vancouver; representing the "developing" and "developed"contexts respectively. It was found that the prescriptive and outcomes-based nature of assessment tools excludes "developing countries" from the sustainable community development conversation. The logical next step is to develop frameworks that offer sustainable solutions appropriate to these contexts. Findings also highlighted a need for a more robust procedural framework to manage relationships between various professionals and interest groups involved in the development of sustainable communities/precincts. This in turn provides a unified method to facilitate the achievement of urban sustainability. This research concludes that urban sustainability needs to draw upon the management principles of facilities management (FM), and more specifically UFM, to develop and assess the sustainability of communities and cities within a specific locale. Without a process-orientated method such as this, cities will continue to fall short of their sustainable imperatives...|$|R
40|$|While the {{challenge}} of achieving a sustainable built environment is global, governments and nonprofits working to advance sustainability are increasingly turning to the neighborhood scale (Luederitz, Lang, and von Wehrden 2013). This attention to the neighborhood {{has been accompanied by}} a corresponding increase in Neighborhood Sustainability Assessment (NSA) standards, which evaluate neighborhoods against sustainability criteria. Since 2001, when the first NSA standard was published (Sharifi 2016), the number of NSA standards in use worldwide has climbed to 32 (Criterion Planners 2016). Despite this volume, there is relatively little written on individual NSA standards, and even less on how these standards compare to one another or relate to city-led sustainability efforts (Haapio 2012; Sharifi and Murayama 2013; Berardi 2013; Reith and Orova 2015; Komeily and Srinivasan 2015). This study addresses these gaps in the literature by studying four NSA standards in use in Denver, Colorado: LEED ND, 2030 Districts, <b>EcoDistricts,</b> and Sustainable Neighborhoods. This is the first study to examine the use of multiple NSA standards in the same city and the first to analyze the relationship between NSA standards and citywide sustainability efforts. I answer the following three questions: What are the similarities and differences between the intent, certification approach, and applicability of different NSA standards? Why are individuals, institutions, and cities adopting NSA standards and how satisfied are they with their choice? What is the relationship between NSA standards and city-led, city-scale planning? I find that the four NSA standards I examine prioritize different elements of sustainability, employ different approaches to certification, and operate in different development contexts, and that this diversity helps advance neighborhood-scale sustainability in Denver. I find that individuals adopt specific NSA standards {{as a result of a}} tangle of iterative decisions that draw upon the initiator's personal and professional networks, their knowledge of the variety of standards available, and the authority they possess. Finally, I find that these four NSA projects are well connected to the City of Denver but that rather than working through Denver's Office of Sustainability, they intersect with multiple City agencies, thus benefiting from Denver's mandate that all City departments support sustainability initiatives. by Lily Perkins-High.
