Theoretically, if electrical machines rotor stored energy is known, {{it is possible}} to reduce the <b>flywheel</b> <b>mass</b> of electromechanical battery. For example, the efficiency of energy recovery (kilowatt-hours out versus kilowatthours in) in nowadays appliances exceeds 95 % which is considerably better than of any electrochemical battery, such as lead-acid battery. For the rotor stored energy amount calculation, it is necessary to find all geometrical dimensions of the electrical machine. To achieve this goal the iterative calculation method was used. Electromechanical battery mass was analyzed as a discharge process rotation speed function. Taking into account the rotor stored energy, we can increase the minimum rotation speed thus reducing the electrical machine mass and increasing the <b>flywheel</b> <b>mass,</b> which provides EMB cost reduction. Additionally, the possibilities of using numerical approximation calculations of magnetization curves are discussed.

These have been applied to an automotive valve train modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom vibration system. Stability of the system has been investigated for three types of follower motion events and four different cam profiles. The results have not only been very interesting but also revealing. This work presents analytical and experimental investigations of a particular flexible cam-follower mechanism. The effects of pressure angle variation on the parametric stability and vibration response of the flexible cam-follower mechanism are investigated. An experimental flexible cam-follower mechanism has been constructed to help validate the earlier analytical findings, and an analytical model {{similar to that used}} in previous works, and more truly reflective of the experimental mechanism, is developed. ^ The camshaft speed variation due to the varying moment about the camshaft axis is predicted by use of a rigid-body model, and a method developed to evaluate the parametric steady-state rigid-body response of a cam-follower mechanism. This rigid-body camshaft speed variation is helpful in performing dynamic analysis of the flexible cam-follower mechanism. The effects of the <b>flywheel</b> <b>mass</b> moment of inertia and camshaft torsional vibration are included in a three-degree-of-freedom model. The stability determination method, based on Floquet theory, and the closed-form numerical solution algorithm for computing the periodic response of the multi-degree-of-freedom vibration system are validated with the help of direct integration results.

40|$|Theory and {{simulation}} results {{have demonstrated that}} four, variable speed flywheels could potentially provide the energy storage and attitude control functions of existing batteries and control moment gyros (CMGs) on a satellite. Past modeling and control algorithms {{were based on the}} assumption of rigidity in the flywheel?s bearings and the satellite structure. This dissertation provides {{simulation results}} and theory which eliminates this assumption utilizing control algorithms for active vibration control (AVC), flywheel shaft levitation and integrated power transfer and attitude control (IPAC) that are effective even with low stiffness active magnetic bearings (AMB), and flexible satellite appendages. The flywheel AVC and levitation tasks are provided by a multi input multi output (MIMO) control law that enhances stability by reducing the dependence of the forward and backward gyroscopic poles with changes in flywheel speed. The control law is shown to be effective even for (1) Large polar to transverse inertia ratios which increases the stored energy density while causing the poles to become more speed dependent and, (2) Low bandwidth controllers shaped to suppress high frequency noise. These two main tasks could be successfully achieved by MIMO (Gyroscopic) control algorithm, which is unique approach. The vibration control mass (VCM) is designed to reduce the vibrations of flexible appendages of the satellite. During IPAC maneuver, the oscillation of flywheel spin speeds, torque motions and satellite appendages are significantly reduced compared without VCM. Several different properties are demonstrated to obtain optimal VCM. Notch, band-pass and low-pass filters are implemented in the AMB system to reduce and cancel high frequency, dynamic bearing forces and motor torques due to <b>flywheel</b> <b>mass</b> imbalance. The transmitted forces and torques to satellite are considerably decreased in the present of both notch and band-pass filter stages. Successful IPAC simulation results are presented with a 12 [%] of initial attitude error, large polar to transverse inertia ratio (IP / IT), structural flexibility and unbalance mass disturbance. Two variable speed control moment gyros (VSCMGs) are utilized to demonstrate simultaneous attitude control and power transfer instead of using four standard pyramid configurations.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines produce a fluctuating torque due to discrete pistons combustion, {{as well as}} induced inertial imbalance of the reciprocating pistons. In standard operating conditions, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transferred to the gearbox, leading {{to a number of}} comfort problems. Rattle noise is one of these problems and it is caused by impulsive forces caused by clearances across the driveline and especially in the gearbox. In order to prevent rattle, dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheels</b> may be used to reduce torsional oscillations in automotive powertrains. The present paper presents a 3 D nonlinear dynamic model of an automotive dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel.</b> The model is made of primary and secondary masses and the arc springs between them.

40|$|Heavy duty {{trucks are}} faced with strict {{requirements}} regarding exhaust emissions and fuel efficiency. The demands are achieved through downsizing and downspeeding. This introduces torsional vibrations in the powertrain which, if not dealt with, will decrease life and comfort. One solution that deals with these vibrations is the Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel</b> that absorbs the vibrations. The goal of this thesis is to develop and verify different computational models of a Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel</b> and in particular study how the friction between the arc-spring and the primary ywheel affects the system. Modelling is done in Python using the Newmark- method combined with Newton's method for numerical simulations. The same model is also created in AVL Excite for verification. The friction between the arc-spring and the primary flywheel channel is modelled using the Coulomb friction model or an inverse tangent function. It has been verified that the two computational models give similar results. A method to approximate Coulomb friction has been developed {{in order to make}} the computational model more stable. The friction depends on both spring compression and centripetal force due to the rotation of the Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel.</b> For a truck's operating speed the spring compression is the largest factor to frictional losses with current selection of geometrical and structural parameters. The results show that with low friction and low viscous damping resonance is not a significant problem even if it occurs at low engine speed.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new <b>flywheel</b> coil–magnet proof <b>mass</b> transducer for vibration energy harvesting. The seismic transducer {{presented in this}} paper includes an additional flywheel element that produces three effects on the elastically suspended proof mass: firstly, it lowers the fundamental resonance frequency, secondly it lowers the static displacement and thirdly it lowers the mechanical damping effect. The combination of all three effects is beneficial for vibration energy harvesting applications. In fact, having a low resonance frequency transducer facilitates the tuning of the harvester to a low frequency band where ambient vibration energy is normally higher. Also, having a low static displacement of the proof mass element allows the construction of a device robust to shocks and fast movements despite it has a low fundamental resonance frequency. Finally, having a low internal mechanical damping leaves more energy for the conversion to electrical energy.

40|$|The damping {{characteristics}} of the traditional dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> (DMF) cannot be changed and can only meet one of the damping requirements. Given that the traditional DMF cannot avoid the resonance interval in start/stop conditions, it tends to generate high-resonance amplitude, which reduces the lifetime of a vehicle’s parts and leads to vehicle vibration and noise. The {{problems associated with the}} traditional DMF can be solved through the magnetorheological fluid dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> (MRF-DMF), which was designed in this study with adjustable damping performance under different conditions. The MRF-DMF is designed based on the rheological behavior of the magnetorheological fluid (MRF), which can be changed by magnetic field strength.

Thus, the cosimulation between the drivetrain model built in AMESim and the control system model developed in Simulink is conducted. The controller of MRF-DMF is developed, after which the torsional vibration control test of drivetrain is carried out.

This primarily results from the need to greatly increase the speed of rotation of the flywheel {{in order to reduce}} the <b>flywheel</b> size and <b>mass.</b> This goal was achieved by making use of a proprietary, space-qualified, high-speed (100, 000 rpm) motor technology to spin the flywheel at a speed ten times faster than other known miniature CMGs under development. NASA is supporting innovations in propulsion, power, and guidance and navigation systems for low-cost small spacecraft. One of the key enabling technologies is attitude control mechanisms.
