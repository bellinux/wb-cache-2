5|$|Monthly average temperatures, {{rainfall}} and snowfall for four communities {{are shown in}} the attached graphs. St. John's represents the east coast, Gander {{the interior of the}} island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website. The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount which fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Napoli lost {{a closely}} contested relegation battle {{at the end}} of 1942 and were relegated to Serie B. They moved from the Stadio Giorgio Ascarelli to the Stadio Arturo Collana and {{remained}} in Serie B until after the war. When play continued, Napoli earned the right to compete in Serie A, but were relegated after two seasons for a bribery scandal. The club bounced back to ensure top flight football {{at the start of the}} 1950s. Napoli moved to their new home ground Stadio San Paolo in 1959. Despite erratic league form with <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows during this period, including a further relegation and promotion, Napoli had some cup success when they beat SPAL to lift the Coppa Italia in 1962, with goals from Gianni Corelli and Pierluigi Ronzon. Their fourth relegation cut celebrations short the following season.|$|E

Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E

Fully aware of their daughter's occupation, Kim's parents remain completely supportive of her crime-fighting endeavors so long as she continues to obey curfew, but tend to be more-so concerned about the character's performance in school, as well as her love life. Lacking a secret identity, Kim is world famous and her profession, although accepted by her peers, is seldom acknowledged by her schoolmates or teachers. Captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, Kim Possible also explores the <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, academics, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work-life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more standard components of adolescence.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} circulation {{is controlled by}} the two semi–permanent South Atlantic and South Pacific <b>highs,</b> <b>and</b> the Chaco Low. During summer, the interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low brings northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region during summer results in very high precipitation. Most of the precipitation comes from the east since the Andes block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Southern parts of the region are influenced by cold fronts travelling northward. These cold fronts are responsible for producing precipitation during summer. For example, in Tucumán Province, cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. Furthermore, the intertropical convergence zone (or doldrums) reaches the region during the summer months, leading to enhanced precipitation. During the winter months, the intertropical convergence zone, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic highs move northward while the Chaco Low weakens, all of which results in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean, along with {{atmospheric circulation}} patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. The Chaco Low attracts air masses from the South Pacific High, creating a dry and cold wind, particularly during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms.|$|E
