40|$|Over {{the past}} four decades, {{there has been a}} {{substantial}} increase in financial globalization, that is, rapid growth in gross external portfolio positions. There has also been a substantial fall in the variability of inflation. Many economists have conjectured that financial globalization contributed to the improved inflation performance. This paper explores the causal link running in the opposite direction. Using an open economy model with endogenous portfolio choice, it is shown that a monetary rule that reduces inflation variability tends to increase the size of gross <b>external</b> <b>asset</b> positions. This result appears to be robust across different modeling specifications. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{balance of}} payments identity {{does not take into}} account changes in asset prices and exchange rates. For example, the value of <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> or liabilities can change due to higher or lower stockmarket prices or a default/write-off on debt. Similarly, changes in exchange rates will affect the value of foreign assets and liabilities. An appreciation of a country's currency will decrease both the value of assets denominated in foreign currency and the burden of liabilities denominated in foreign currency. The value of assets and liabilities denominated in the home currency will not be affected by changes in the exchange rate.|$|E

The implications of these developments for optimal conduct of monetary policy are analyzed in a standard open economy model which is augmented to allow for endogenous portfolio choice. The model shows that monetary policy takes on new importance due to its impact on nominal asset returns. Nevertheless, the case for price stability as an optimal monetary rule remains. In fact, it is reinforced. Even without nominal price rigidities, price stability is optimal because it enhances the risk sharing properties of nominal bonds.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between macroeconomic volatility of a country and its net foreign asset position. We show that in OECD economies over the period 1970 - 2005 changes in country specific macroeconomic volatility are strongly positively associated with changes in net <b>external</b> <b>asset</b> position. We show that this relation arises naturally {{in the context of}} a standard open economy consumption/saving/investment model. Changes in macroeconomic volatility act as observable changes in the rate of time preference which increase the gain from inter-temporal trade and hence make large imbalances more likely. We conclude that time varying macroeconomic volatility is a quantitatively important factor to understand and forecast the evolution of external imbalances across OECD countries. jel codes: f 32, f 34, f 4...|$|R

50|$|The idea of {{dark matter}} has not gone without criticism. First, Willem Buiter has argued that dark matter should result in {{a higher rate of}} return on U.S. <b>{{external}}</b> <b>assets</b> than on U.S. external liabilities. However, he claims, there is no convincing evidence that this is the case. Second, the U.S. income from dark matter seems to vary enormously from year to year, even though it stems from permanent characteristics of the U.S. economy like the export of know-how. Lastly, Mathew Higgins, Thomas Klitgaard,and Cedric Tille agree with the assertion that U.S. foreign assets are currently undervalued. However, they argue that more important, U.S. foreign liabilities are overvalued. Thus, The U.S. has fewer foreign liabilities than is currently assumed; this fact (rather than dark matter) explains the unexpectedly high net income. In a 2007 article, Hausmann and Sturzenegger respond to some of these critiques, defending the existence and function {{of dark matter}}.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} between a country's external financial assets and liabilities is its {{net international investment position}} (NIIP). A country's external debt includes both its government debt and private debt, and similarly its public and privately held (by its legal residents) <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> are also taken into account when calculating its NIIP. [...] Note that commodities, as well as currencies tend to follow cyclical patterns, whereby they undergo significant valuation changes, of which is reflected in NIIP. [...] A country's international investment position (IIP) is a financial statement setting out the value and composition of that country's external financial assets and liabilities. A positive NIIP value indicates a nation is a creditor nation, while a negative value indicates it is a debtor nation. The USA, as recently as 1960 the world's largest creditor, has now become the world's largest debtor, and since the 1980s, Japan has replaced USA as the world's largest creditor nation.|$|E
