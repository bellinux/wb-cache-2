5|$|French rule in {{the region}} was marked by the rapid <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> {{extension}} of numerous reforms which had been passed in post-Revolution France since 1789. Administration was organized under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, in {{the cases}} of Şahide Goekce (deceased) v. Austria and Fatma Yildirim (deceased) v. Austria, the Committee ruled that the Austrian {{government}} was failing to protect women from domestic violence. It recommended strengthening the <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> monitoring of existing domestic violence laws and greater training for police.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} permits provides {{the government with}} revenues. These revenues {{could be used to}} fund low-carbon investment, and also fund cuts in distortionary taxes. Auctioning permits can therefore be more efficient and equitable than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236–237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E

5|$|The Itanium {{processors}} show {{a progression}} in capability. Merced was a proof of concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with {{the shift to}} a 130nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90nm process, allowed for a dual-core <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667MHz.|$|E
