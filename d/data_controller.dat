40|$|As {{a result}} of datafication (the {{generation}} and acquisition of personal data from automated processes), consumers’ activities generate large data streams. Analysis of these streams reduces privacy and shifts power towards <b>data</b> <b>controllers.</b> Consumers often contractually agree to this analysis of their data, but their autonomy can be questioned: the agreements often contain non-negotiable terms unilaterally drafted by <b>data</b> <b>controllers.</b> Consumer protection law can alleviate this power shift towards <b>data</b> <b>controllers,</b> but only if EU member states increase their enforcement efforts...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. People who are {{referred}} to as data owners in this study, use the Internet for various purposes and one of those is using online services like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and so on. These online services are offered by organizations which {{are referred}} to as <b>data</b> <b>controllers.</b> When <b>data</b> owners use these service provided by <b>data</b> <b>controllers</b> they usually have to agree to the terms and conditions which gives <b>data</b> <b>controllers</b> indemnity against any privacy issues that may be raised by the <b>data</b> owner. <b>Data</b> <b>controllers</b> are then free to share that data with any other organizations, referred to as third parties. Though <b>data</b> <b>controllers</b> are protected from lawsuits it does not necessarily mean they are free of any act that may be considered a privacy violation by the data owner. This thesis aims to arrive at a design proposition using the design science research paradigm for a middleware extension, specifically focused on the Tomcat server which is a servlet engine running on the JVM. The design proposition proposes a client side annotation based API to be used by developers to specify classes which will carry data outside the scope of the <b>data</b> <b>controller's</b> system to a third party system, the specified classes will then have code weaved in that will communicate with a Privacy Engine component that will determine based on data owner's preferences if their data should be shared or not. The output of this study is a privacy enhancing platform that comprises of three components the client side annotation based API used by developers, an extension to Tomcat and finally a Privacy Engine...|$|R

25|$|Under section 26 of the Act, a <b>data</b> <b>controller</b> who {{processes}} {{personal data}} {{must ensure that}} the data is complete, accurate, up to date and not misleading, having regard to the purpose for which that data is collected or processed.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{requires}} {{a person who}} processes personal data {{to ensure that the}} data is processed without infringing the rights of the data subject, and should be processed in a lawful and reasonable manner (Section 18(1)). Where the data to be processed involves a foreign data subject, the <b>data</b> <b>controller</b> or processor must ensure that the personal data is processed according to the data protection laws of the originating jurisdiction (Section 18 (2)).|$|E
25|$|The {{prior consent}} of a data subject is also {{required}} before personal data is processed. (Section 20) This requirement is, however, subject to exceptions. For instance, where the purpose {{for which the}} personal data is processed {{is necessary for the}} purpose of a contract to which the data subject is a party; authorised or required by law, to protect a legitimate interest of the data subject; necessary for the proper performance of a statutory duty or necessary to pursue the legitimate interest of the <b>data</b> <b>controller</b> or a third party to whom the data is supplied (section 20(1)). Consent is also required for the processing of special personal data (Section 37(2) (b)). A data subject also object to the processing of personal data (section 20(2)), and the data processor is required to stop processing the data upon such objection (section 20(3)).|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of information security safeguards {{is a key}} information principle contained in every privacy legislation measure, framework, and guideline. This principle requires <b>data</b> <b>controllers</b> to use an adequate level of safeguards before processing personal information. However, privacy literature neither explains what this adequate level is nor how to achieve it. Hence, a knowledge gap has been created between privacy advocates and <b>data</b> <b>controllers.</b> This paper takes a step to bridge the aforementioned knowledge gap by presenting an analysis of how data protection and privacy commissioners have evaluated the level of adequacy of security protection given to personal information in selected privacy invasive cases. This study addresses security measures used to protect personal information against accidental incidents. This analysis also lays a foundation for building a set of guidelines for <b>data</b> <b>controllers</b> on designing, implementing, and operating both technological and organizational measures used to protect personal information...|$|R

5000|$|The court {{accepted}} {{two fundamental}} points: first, that the protection {{given by the}} legislation is for the privacy of personal data, not documents, the latter mostly retrievable by a far cruder searching mechanism than the former; and second, of the practical reality of the task that the Act imposes on all <b>data</b> <b>controllers</b> of searching for specific and readily accessible information about individuals. Furthermore, to constitute a [...] "relevant filing system" [...] a manual filing system must: 1) relate to individuals; 2) be a [...] "set" [...] or part of a [...] "set" [...] of information; 3) be structured by reference to individuals or criteria relating to individuals; and 4) be structured {{in such a way}} that specific information relating to a particular individual is readily accessible. Accordingly, this requires a filing system so referenced or indexed that it enables the <b>data</b> <b>controller's</b> employee responsible to identify at the outset of his search with reasonable certainty and speed the file or files in which the specific data relating to the person requesting the information is located and to locate the relevant information about him within the file or files, without having to make a manual search of them.|$|R
