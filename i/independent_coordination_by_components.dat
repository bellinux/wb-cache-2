40|$|AbstractIn {{the domain}} of {{software}} engineering, the use of software components is now a well established approach. However, it raises problems about the dynamic adaptation of these components to particular users demands. Indeed, these components have been developed {{with the intent to}} have a wide range of use, and so they implement functionalities which perhaps do not match precisely enough the demands of specific users. Therefore, we address the adaptation of the <b>coordination</b> between <b>components</b> <b>by</b> means of so-called Moderators. A Moderator is itself a coordination component managing interactions that are described and formalized using Petri nets. More precisely, we study the dynamic adaptation of the <b>coordination</b> rules <b>by</b> means of specific transformations of the Petri nets used to describe a Moderator. Safety properties must be enforced to maintain a consistent cooperation among participants with respect to the requested evolutions of the coordination rules. In particular, an adaptation of the Moderator can be considered safe if it cannot be detected by the participants. We present a computable criterion which enables to check such a satefy property automatically. We illustrate our approach {{in the context of a}} computer aided learning system, <b>by</b> adapting the <b>coordination</b> rules for controlling accesses to documents during an examination...|$|R

Based on the {{assumption}} that all robots in a given multi-agent scenario can evaluate a global formation function, we show how a model <b>independent</b> <b>coordination</b> strategy for multi-agent formation control can be obtained. The main theorem states that under a bounded tracking error assumption out method stabilizes the formation error. We furthermore complement this result with an investigation of how limited sensory range capabilities affect the group performance...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{parallel}} structures {{in these cases}} (marked by brackets) are not adjacent to each other, one really cannot view them as involving coordination. What {{this means is that}} the RNR mechanism is <b>independent</b> of <b>coordination.</b> In this regard, exactly what renders two or more structures parallel enough so that RNR can occur is not clear. What is clear, however, is that while coordination does commonly produce {{the parallel}} structures that allow RNR to occur, the RNR mechanism is <b>independent</b> of <b>coordination.</b>|$|R

The {{structure of the}} reduced 22 -membered selenaaza macrocycle 4 (C 32 H 36 N 4 Se 2) has been determined. The Ni-II complex 7 exhibits <b>coordination</b> <b>by</b> the N 4 Se 2 donor sites. The Pd-II complexes 8, 9, 10, and 14 have been structurally characterized. The molecular structures of these complexes reveal interesting versatile ligating behaviors of the ligands. The Pd complexes 8, 9, and 14 display <b>coordination</b> <b>by</b> hard nitrogen donor atoms only, whereas the complex 10 showed <b>coordination</b> <b>by</b> N 2 Te 2 donor centers. The Pt-II complex 11 shows {{the formation of a}} cationic metallamacrocycle with C-Pt-Se linkage. The crystal structures suggest that the coordination of metal atoms to donors is determined by the geometrical arrangement around the metal and by the conformation of the macrocycle rather than by the HSAB (hard/soft acid/base) principle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} evaluating the potential supply chain benefits of adopting continuous processing technologies for a diverse set of pharmaceutical products. The approach integrates upstream ‘continuous’ processing considerations {{for the production of}} active ingredients and final product formulation, with the downstream implications for packing and distribution. Currently, these upstream and downstream operations largely operate as decoupled operations with <b>independent</b> <b>coordination</b> and governance mechanisms, and the approach presented in this paper identifies opportunities for more case-specific integrated end-to-end supply chains enabled by continuous flow technologies. Three specific product (and corresponding processing technology) case studies are used to demonstrate the utility of the approach in assessing the supply network and system integration opportunities that emerge from the continuous processing of pharmaceutical products...|$|R
