2500|$|Psychogenic amnesia, {{also known}} as dissociative amnesia, is a [...] memory {{disorder}} characterized by sudden retrograde episodic memory loss, said to occur {{for a period of}} time ranging from hours to years. More recently, [...] "dissociative amnesia" [...] has been defined as a dissociative disorder [...] "characterized by retrospectively reported memory gaps.

40|$|Background Precipitated by psychological stress, {{dissociative amnesia}} {{occurs in the}} absence of {{identifiable}} brain damage. Its clinical characteristics and functional neural basis are still a matter of controversy. Methods In the present paper, we report 3 cases of retrograde autobiographical amnesia, characterized by an acute onset concomitant with emotional/neurological precipitants. We present 2 cases of <b>dissociative</b> amnesia with <b>fugue</b> (cases 1 and 2), and one case of focal dissociative amnesia after a minor head trauma (case 3). The individual case histories and neuropsychological characteristics are reported, as well as the whole-brain voxel-based 18 FDG-PET metabolic findings obtained at group-level in comparison to 15 healthy subjects. Results All patients suffered from autobiographical memory loss, {{in the absence of}} structural lesion. They had no significant impairment of anterograde memory or of executive function. Impairment of autobiographical memory was complete for two of the three patients, with loss of personal identity (cases 1 and 2). A clinical recovery was found for the two patients in whom follow-up was available (cases 2 and 3). Voxel-based group analysis highlighted a metabolic impairment of the right posterior middle temporal gyrus. 18 FDG-PET was repeated in case  3, and showed a complete functional brain recovery. Conclusion The situation of dissociative amnesia with disproportionate retrograde amnesia is clinically heterogeneous between individuals. Our findings may suggest that impairment of high-level integration of visual and/or emotional information processing involving dysfunction of the right posterior middle temporal gyrus could reduce triggering of multi-modal visual memory traces, thus impeding reactivation of aversive memories...|$|R
2500|$|In time, {{emotional}} exhaustion may set in, {{leading to}} distraction, and clear thinking {{may be difficult}} or impossible. Emotional detachment, as well as dissociation or [...] "numbing out", can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue,</b> dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{terminology}} fugue state may carry a slight linguistic distinction from <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue,</b> the former implying {{a greater degree}} of motion. For the purposes of this article then, a fugue state occurs while one is acting out a <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Dissociative</b> <b>fugue,</b> {{formerly}} fugue {{state or}} psychogenic fugue, is a dissociative disorder. It {{is a rare}} psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality. The state can last days, months or longer. <b>Dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> usually involves unplanned travel or wandering, and is sometimes accompanied by {{the establishment of a}} new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia, according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).|$|E
5000|$|A fugue state, {{formally}} <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue,</b> {{is a rare}} condition {{precipitated by}} a stressful episode. It is characterized by episode(s) of traveling {{away from home and}} creating a new identity.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the fugue state is related to dissociative amnesia, (DSM-IV Codes 300.12) which has several other subtypes: {{selective}} amnesia, generalised amnesia, continuous amnesia, and systematised amnesia, {{in addition to the}} subtype <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both {{dissociative amnesia}} and <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> usually emerge in {{adulthood}} and rarely occur {{after the age}} of 50. The ICD-10 classifies conversion disorder as a dissociative disorder while the DSM-IV classifies it as a somatoform disorder.|$|E
50|$|David Fitzpatrick, a {{sufferer}} of <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> disorder, {{from the}} United Kingdom, was profiled on Five's television series Extraordinary People. He entered a fugue state on December 4, 2005, {{and is still}} working on regaining his entire life's memories.|$|E
50|$|As {{the person}} {{experiencing}} a <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> may have recently suffered the reappearance {{of an event}} or person representing an earlier life trauma, {{the emergence of an}} armoring or defensive personality seems to be for some, a logical apprehension of the situation.|$|E
50|$|Ansel Bourne (1826-1910) was {{a famous}} 19th-century {{psychology}} case due to his experience of a probable <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue.</b> The case, among the first ever documented, remains of interest {{as an example of}} multiple personality and amnesia. Among the doctors who treated Bourne was William James.|$|E
50|$|Treatment: Hypnosis {{is often}} used to help patient recall true {{identity}} and remember events of the past. Psychotherapy is helpful for the person who has traumatic, past events to resolve. Once <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> is discovered and treated, many people recover quickly. The problem may never happen again.|$|E
5000|$|ABC News {{speculated that}} the name was {{actually}} [...] "most likely" [...] inspired by Ansel Bourne, a famous 19th-century psychology case due to his experience of a probable <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue.</b> Ansel Bourne one day left his previous life and built himself a new life with a new profession elsewhere under a new name ("A. J. Brown"); after two months, he woke up with no memories of this new life, but with memories recovered up to this time {{and returned to his}} old life. The rare and controversial <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> has been described [...] "a state in which an individual has lost their identity" [...] by Harvard psychologist Daniel Schacter. [...] "They don't know who they are, and they've lost all information about their past. They go on functioning automatically." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> (formerly {{psychogenic}} fugue) is now subsumed {{under the}} dissociative amnesia category. It {{is described as}} reversible amnesia for personal identity, usually involving unplanned travel or wandering, sometimes accompanied by {{the establishment of a}} new identity. This state is typically associated with stressful life circumstances and can be short or lengthy.|$|E
50|$|A {{doctor may}} suspect <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> when people seem {{confused}} about their identity or are puzzled about their past or when confrontations challenge their new identity {{or absence of}} one. The doctor carefully reviews symptoms and does a physical examination to exclude physical disorders that may contribute to or cause memory loss. A psychological examination is also done.|$|E
50|$|Jeff Ingram {{appeared}} in Denver in 2006 with {{no memory of}} his name or where he was from. After his appearance on national television, to appeal for help identifying himself, his fiancée Penny called Denver police identifying him. The episode was diagnosed as <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue.</b> Ingram has experienced three incidents of amnesia: in 1994, 2006, and 2007.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> {{cannot be}} {{diagnosed}} until people abruptly {{return to their}} pre-fugue identity and are distressed to find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances. The diagnosis is usually made retroactively when a doctor reviews the history and collects information that documents the circumstances before people left home, the travel itself, {{and the establishment of}} an alternative life.|$|E

After {{four members of}} the Embera community began exhibiting symptoms later described as, [...] "repetitive episodes of what resembled a <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue</b> disorder," [...] a local shaman explained that the outbreak could be attributed to a shaman from a different region. The local shaman attempted their own treatment, but the affected member's symptoms continued and after six months, they eventually chose to seek help in the closest province. Soon after they arrived, their local relatives began to develop the same symptoms. After five more individuals presented similarly, all nine members began seeking forms of treatment including care from different types of religious healers, psychiatrists, and antipsychotic drugs. After none of these tactics proved successful, a shaman from the Chocó province in Columbia was brought to attempt treatment. The shaman's treatments reportedly reduced the frequency of the symptoms greatly in all of the patients and eliminated symptoms completely in two patients.|$|E
5000|$|American Amnesiac (2013), Raptosh’s fourth poetry collection, was longlisted for the 2013 National Book Award. The booklength {{dramatic}} monologue, alternately {{considered a}} novella in verse, takes on such themes as individual identity, corporate personhood, and the U.S. prison system. Also {{a finalist for}} the 2013 Housatonic Book Award in Poetry, American Amnesiac was hailed by poet/reviewer Daniela Gioseffi as “a magnum opus—one long poem spoken in the persona of an older man suffering from amnesia. The book constitutes his stream of consciousness as he attempts to piece together who he is and what he’s experienced in his American life.” Poet H.L. Hix writes that “American Amnesiac makes a genre of the condition its protagonist suffers: it is a <b>dissociative</b> <b>fugue.</b> What its speaker cannot remember, its reader will not forget.” [...] Poet/reviewer Marc Sheehan wrote, “In these poems, Rinehart/Doe spends as much time and emotional energy piecing together the world around him as he does trying to reconstruct his past. Culture, Rinehart/Doe discovers, both liberates us from ourselves and imprisons us in its expectations.” ...|$|E

Lights and textures and 3D environments and referencing older models I built years ago come into the virtual space. I love that I can hide old letters and photographs in lockets and tuck them away into drawers that are closed. I know they are there and that seems important to me and I love that sometimes I forget they are there.
