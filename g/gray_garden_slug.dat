40|$|Slugs {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} animals called Mollusks that {{includes}} clams, oysters, squid, octopus, and snails- slugs closest relative. Snails cause similar damage as slugs, but usually are not as serious a pest in the Pacific Northwest. Outside the garden, slugs and snails actually do good things. They recycle organic matter, which helps to build soils, and {{are an important part of}} the foodchain. Inside the garden and landscape, however, slugs and snails can do considerable damage and often must be controlled. The most common slug species are the <b>Gray</b> <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum, and the European slug, Arion ater. The native Yellow green banana slug, Ariolimax columbianus, is most often found in wooded areas. Slugs vary in length, depending on species and age, from 1 / 4 inch to as much as 10 inches. They move or glide on a “foot”, which produces the slime that helps them move. Their eyes are at the end of stalks, which can be drawn back into their head at the sign of danger. Slugs are active largely at night. They feed during the night and on cool, cloudy days. If the weather is hot and dry, slugs hide beneath stones, flower boxes, boards, and dense plant cover such as ivy. Slugs avoid dry, dusty areas. Slugs have both male and female reproductive systems. Slugs can live from 1 to 2 years, and can begin to lay eggs when they are a...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Understanding the {{physiological}} basis of environmental regulation of reproduction at the cellular level {{has been difficult}} or unfeasible in vertebrate species because of the highly complex and diffuse nature of vertebrate neuroendocrine systems. This {{is not the case}} with the simple nervous system of mollusks in which reproductive neuroendocrine cells are often readily identifiable in living tissue. Given that there are mollusks that are seasonal breeders, that the neuroendocrine cells controlling reproduction have been identified in several molluskan species, that these neurons are conducive to cell physiological analysis, and that basic features of cell biology have been highly conserved between mammals and mollusks, it seems that the mollusk would provide an excellent model system to investigate cell-physiological events that mediate effects of environmental signals on reproduction. The purpose of this review is to explore this idea in three species in which the topic of the neural basis of seasonal reproduction has been studied: the giant <b>garden</b> <b>slug</b> Limax maximus, the freshwater pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, and the marine snail Aplysia californica...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory-reared grey <b>garden</b> <b>slugs,</b> Deroceras reticu-latum, {{were exposed}} to soil and food treated with solu-tions of three metal salts (CdC 12, ZnCl,, PbClJ) in three {{environmentally}} relevant concentrations, each for 21 days. Metal concentrations were determined in the soil,,food and slugs by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (A AS). Zinc was localized ultrastructurally in the hepato-pancreatic cells by means of energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM). Zinc, and also high amounts of copper, could be detected by electron spectroscopical imaging (ESI) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in spherites of the basophilic cells. Ultrastructural responses to metal impact were investi-gated in two cell types of the hepatopancreas (digestive and basophilic cells) and the cellular responses {{were found to be}} dose- and metal-dependent. In order to evalu-ate the toxicity of the respective metal concentrations to the slugs, the ultrastructural reactions were semi-quanti-jied and summarized as complex reaction patterns of numerous organelles.

In this study, we {{examined}} the nature of latex in Lactarius Pers. 1797 spp. to clarify the role on fungivorous predation. In the field, we compared the degree of predation on taxonomically closely related latex-exuding Lactarius spp. and latex-non-exuding Russula Pers. 1796 spp. (Russulaceae) at developmental stages of sporocarps. We clarified that Russula spp. suffered more infestation than did Lactarius spp. at young and mature developmental stages, whereas Lactarius spp. did only at decaying stages. We measured the amount of latex exuded varied according to developmental stage and sporocarps parts in Lactarius spp. : mature sporocarps exuded more latex than did younger ones, while decaying sporocarps exuded the least, and the same patterns were observed at sporocarps parts: the amount of latex was more intense at hymenophore and cap than at stripe. At feeding experiments, three-band <b>garden</b> <b>slugs</b> Ambigolimax valentianus F´erussac, 1822 avoided feeding on sporophores of Lactarius spp. when they exuded latex, but fed on them when they did not.
