5|$|In the {{interest}} of strengthening the defenses of the kingdom, Andriamasinavalona divided his realm into four quadrants to be ruled by his four favorite sons. This decision had the opposite effect, however; each was interested <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> his own realm, prompting one son to kidnap the king and hold him hostage for seven years. After the king's eventual release, he famously committed a mock human sacrifice to re-sanctify his authority. Upon his death, Andriamasinavalona's sons launched military campaigns against one another to seize each other's territories, triggering 77 years of civil war in Imerina. In Madagascar today, Andriamasinavalona's reign is remembered as a golden age of justice, harmony and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Parthia {{had always}} posed {{a threat to}} Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were the first step <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not always a {{permanent}} success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.|$|E
5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E

5|$|The first attack upon Kobe was by one B-25 bomber {{as a part}} of the Dolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. With Japan's success <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> its {{territory}} through south-east Asia at the time, an attack by foreign aircraft was not expected at the time and it was reported that some residents even waved flags at the plane as it flew overhead, thinking it was a Japanese aircraft. One resident of Hyogo ward was the only fatality of the bombing of Kobe on that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{publication of}} Theory of Literature consists of twenty chapters set in five sections based on thematic similarities; one chapter and section was removed in later editions. Wellek contributed thirteen of the book's chapters, while Warren wrote six; {{the final chapter}} was written collaboratively. Although most of the chapters are credited {{as the work of}} one man, the two often copyedited and proofread each other's work, at times inserting entire sentences or paragraphs. Each also suggested further references that the other could use <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> his chapter.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong's Basic Law, {{implemented}} in the territory on 1 July 1997, consists of outstanding articles which require bill adoption by the Legislative Council before becoming effective laws. Two {{of the most prominent}} articles include Article 23 ("National Security") and universal suffrage of Chief Executive elections. In 2002, the government's motion of an anti-subversion bill pursuant to Article 23, was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Reform bills on universal suffrage, however, have made partial progress <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> the Chief Executive election's committee (from 600 to 800 in 2007 and to 1,200 selected members in 2012) and the Legislative Council (from 60 to 70 seats). These additional 10 seats are created through directly elected members of District Offices.|$|E
5|$|In March 1951 secret United States {{intercepts}} {{of diplomatic}} dispatches disclosed clandestine conversations in which General MacArthur expressed confidence to the Tokyo embassies of Spain and Portugal {{that he would}} succeed <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> the Korean War into a full-scale conflict with the Chinese Communists. When the intercepts {{came to the attention}} of President Truman, he was enraged to learn that MacArthur was not only trying to increase public support for his position on conducting the war, but had secretly informed foreign governments that he planned to initiate actions that were counter to United States policy. The President was unable to act immediately since he could not afford to reveal the existence of the intercepts and because of MacArthur's popularity with the public and political support in Congress. However, following the release on April 5 by Representative Martin of MacArthur's letter, Truman concluded he could relieve MacArthur of his commands without incurring unacceptable political damage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of Hawaiian annexation. Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani, the new {{government}} of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States. Harrison was interested <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii John L. Stevens recognized the new government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation. The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E
5|$|Private sector {{participation}} in Colombia's {{water and sanitation}} sector has been much more stable than in some other Latin American countries. In 2004, there were 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies in Colombia, including large, medium and small companies. Private sector involvement in the Colombian water sector began in 1995 in Cartagena, {{with support from the}} World Bank. The most important examples are in Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Tunja, Montería, Palmira, Girardot, and Riohacha. Operators are to a large extent Colombian. Overall performance of utilities with private sector participation has improved, in some cases spectacularly, and some – such as Barranquilla – have had impressive successes <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> coverage to the urban poor.|$|E

5|$|The Rage {{played in}} the 4,500 seat EnCana Events Centre where their first win came on September 24, 2010, against the Alaska Avalanche. Their final home game was a loss to the Wenatchee Wild in March 2012. The team's name and symbol was {{intended}} to represent an outward expression of passion and internal desire to dominate other teams. The Rage players, all aged between 15 and 20 years old in accordance with league rules, were active with charities and within the community. Prior to the team's formation, the ownership group attempted to establish the team in the British Columbia Hockey League but were refused with the league citing {{the lack of a}} competitive base for a northern division. The group also attempted to establish the team in the Alberta Junior Hockey League but that league was not interested <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> or re-locating teams at that time. Another unsuccessful attempt at moving the team to either of those league was made before their dissolution.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force, focused toward {{nuclear weapons}} and {{delivery}} of such munitions against static strategic targets had spent little effort <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> its tactical capabilities {{since the end of}} the World War II. Operation Shed Light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology. The programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all-weather and night flying, sensor equipment for seeing through clouds, foliage, and darkness, improved equipment and methods for target marking and battlefield illumination, and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments. In the end, few of the programs would yield applicable results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most applicable developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{process was}} not without obstacles, however. The Neapolitan nobles distrusted Skanderbeg since the Kastrioti family had {{previously}} been allied with Venice. Alfonso himself had been offended when he asked Skanderbeg to attack Venice along with Đurađ Branković and the Albanian refused. Alfonso was also a devout Christian and found it uneasy to ally with Skanderbeg who had previously practiced Islam in the Ottoman court. On the other hand, Skanderbeg had been disillusioned when Alfonso failed to send any troops to Krujë when they were most needed. But things changed once Skanderbeg had thwarted the Ottoman Army. Both Venice and Alfonso grew an interest <b>in</b> <b>expanding</b> their powers in the Adriatic and the Ionian. On 26 March 1451, the Treaty of Gaeta was signed, creating an Albanian-Aragonese alliance.|$|E
