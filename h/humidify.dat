40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comBackground: It has previously been shown that the insufflation of <b>humidified</b> gas during laparoscopy results in less postoperative pain than is observed following the use of dry gas. Experimental evidence also suggests that dry gas insufflation during thoracoscopy results in greater structural injury to the pleura than occurs {{with the use of}} <b>humidified</b> gas. The present study was designed to determine the effect of <b>humidified</b> gas insufflation on postoperative pain following thoracoscopic procedures. Methods: Forty consecutive patients were prospectively randomized. Twenty patients were insufflated with <b>humidified</b> carbon dioxide (CO 2), and 20 control patients received standard dry CO 2. Results: The patients' analogue pain score was significantly lower following <b>humidified</b> gas insufflation compared to dry gas insufflation when assessed at 6 h postoperatively, {{as well as on the}} 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 14 th postoperative days. The postoperative morphine consumption was lower in the <b>humidified</b> group than it was in the control group. The incidence of respiratory complications was identical for both groups. Conclusion: The use of <b>humidified</b> gas appears to reduce postoperative pain but not the rate of respiratory complications. W. G. Mouton, M. Naef, J. R. Bessell, K. T. Otten, H. E. Wagner and G.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a randomized controlled trial during laparoscopic cholecystectomy {{to determine the}} extent of heat preservation and postoperative pain reduction using <b>humidified</b> carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas insufflation instead of standard dry insufflation gas. Forty consecutive patients were randomized. Twenty patients received <b>humidified</b> CO 2, and 20 control patients received standard CO 2 insufflation. A sample of 16 patients from each group was evaluated for postoperative pain levels. No adverse effects from the humidification of insufflated gas were observed. There was no significant difference in core body temperature between the two groups for this brief operation. Pain, as assessed by the Analogue Pain Score (APS) was significantly less for the group with <b>humidified</b> gas insufflation than for the control group at 6 h postoperatively as well as on the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd postoperative day and at follow-up 10 days after the operation.

50|$|A {{humidifier}} is {{a device}} that increases humidity (moisture) in a single room or an entire building. In the home, point-of-use humidifiers are commonly used to <b>humidify</b> a single room, while whole-house or furnace humidifiers, which connect to a home's HVAC system, provide humidity to the entire house. Medical ventilators often include humidifiers for increased patient comfort.

50|$|Key {{specifics}} of the design include siting of the building {{to take advantage of}} prevailing winds and solar gain, minimizing north-facing surface area, using the building's south-facing atria to provide and precondition the building's constant fresh-air supply and using several 24-meter-tall waterfalls to <b>humidify</b> and dehumidify the fresh air intake.

50|$|The wine {{industry}} has long considered a constant temperature between 55 °F and 60 °F (13.0 °C and 15.5 °C) to be optimal for wine storage and aging. The air temperatures in Northern California {{result in a}} uniform underground temperature of about 58 °F (14.5 °C), optimal for wine caves. A surface warehouse requires energy to cool, heat, and <b>humidify.</b> While the most basic wine cave can cost over $100 per sq ft to construct, reduced energy costs result in a net savings over the long term.|$|E
50|$|Key to {{understanding}} whether the lung {{is involved in}} a particular case of hypoxemia is the difference between the alveolar and the arterial oxygen levels; this A-a difference is often called the A-a gradient and is normally small. The arterial oxygen partial pressure is obtained directly from an arterial blood gas determination. The oxygen contained in the alveolar air can be calculated because it will be directly proportional to its fractional composition in air. Since the airways <b>humidify</b> (and so dilute) the inhaled air, the barometric pressure of the atmosphere is reduced by the vapor pressure of water.|$|E

50|$|Hair inside {{nostrils}} filter incoming air, as a {{first line}} of defense against dust particles, smoke, and other potential obstructions that would otherwise inhibit respiration, and as a kind of filter against airborne illness. In addition to acting as a filter, mucus produced within the nose supplements the body's effort to maintain temperature, as well as contributes moisture to integral components of the respiratory system. Capillary structures of the nose warm and <b>humidify</b> air entering the body; later, this role in retaining moisture enables conditions for alveoli to properly exchange O2 for CO2 (i.e., respiration) within the lungs. During exhalation, the capillaries then aid recovery of some moisture, mostly as a function of thermal regulation, again.|$|E
50|$|Tasks of the functions:• The {{hydropneumatic}} control {{makes it}} possible to <b>humidify</b> every room regardless of a heat source or a fan. • By reversing the humidification process, i.e. through moisture, which slides downward into the room, this causes a longer dwell time of the humidity in the room.• Also the filling process of the evaporation surface runs from top to bottom. This {{makes it possible}} to fill up the surface with water, by flooding and prevents contamination, because the water tank is without direct contact to the evaporation surface and allows fresh water to flow. Here the evaporation surface does not act as a filter for the lime, it is used to evenly distribute the water.|$|E

40|$|Background Heat and {{moisture}} exchangers (HMEs) improve respiratory function after laryngectomy, {{but there is}} virtually no information on the benefit of traditional stoma cloths or other covers. Methods Two sequential studies were performed: (1) an ex vivo test was used to compare the <b>humidifying</b> capacity of stoma cloths to other coverings; and (2) a 4 -week randomized trial was then performed to assess patient acceptability of cloths both alone and with an HME (N = 18). Results The <b>humidifying</b> capacity of the coverings tested varied widely. For stoma cloths, a <b>humidifying</b> capacity of 13. 7 mg/L was found to decrease to 8. 5 mg/L if air-leaks around the cloth occurred. Patients who used HMEs disliked stoma cloths because they interfered with voicing, they became soiled more easily, and were less effective at reducing coughing and mucus production. Conclusion Although less acceptable to patients who use an HME, stoma cloths do provide significant <b>humidifying</b> capacity and should be encouraged when HMEs are unavailable or inappropriate...|$|R

50|$|A {{seawater}} greenhouse is {{a greenhouse}} structure {{that enables the}} growth of crops in arid regions, using seawater and solar energy. The technique involves pumping seawater (or allowing it to gravitate if below sea level) to an arid location and then subjecting it to two processes: first, {{it is used to}} <b>humidify</b> and cool the air, and second, it is evaporated by solar heating and distilled to produce fresh water. Finally, the remaining humidified air is expelled from the greenhouse and used to improve growing conditions for outdoor plants. The technology was introduced by British inventor Charlie Paton in the early 1990s and is being developed by his UK company Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The more concentrated salt water may either be further evaporated for the production of salt and other elements, or discharged back to the sea. The seawater greenhouse is a response to the global water crisis and peak water.|$|E
50|$|Glanosuchus is the {{earliest}} known therapsid to possess maxilloturbinates, but it shares features with reptiles that suggest it was not fully endothermic. Choanae, two holes in the palate that connect the nasal cavity to the mouth, are positioned far forward in reptiles, early synapsids, and Glanosuchus. This shortens the nasal cavity, thereby reducing the ability to <b>humidify</b> incoming air. The choanae migrated farther back in the palate later in therocephalian evolution, suggesting that advanced forms like Bauria had high metabolic rates {{similar to those of}} mammals. As the choanae moved farther back, a secondary palate expanded in front of it. This expansion occurred in both therocephalians and the related cynodonts, indicating that the two groups were convergently acquiring mammalian characteristics in the Permian and Triassic. Although therocephalians died out by the Middle Triassic, cynodonts continued to diversify, giving rise to fully endothermic mammals in the Late Triassic.|$|E
