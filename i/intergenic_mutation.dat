40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is a surveillance mechanism of faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis. Budding uninhibited by benzimidazole-related- 1 (BubR 1) plays {{a central role}} in the SAC through inhibition of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity until all chromosomes have established proper attachment to the mitotic spindle. Loss-of-function mutations in the BUB 1 B gene, encoding BubR 1, cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder: premature chromatid separation (PCS) syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 176430), which is also known as mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome (MIM 257300) [1]. PCS (MVA) syndrome can also be caused by an <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutation</b> 44 -kb upstream of the BUB 1 B gene, which suppresses the transcription level of BUB 1 B [2]. PCS (MVA) syndrome is cytogenetically characterized by PCS in> 50 % of metaphase cells as well as the presence of mosaic aneuploidy [2]. Patients with the syndrome show an increased genetic predisposition to Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma, which may be attributed to the loss of SAC function. Patients also present with cataracts, uncontrollable chronic seizures, Dandy-Walker complex, polycystic kidneys and obesity. These clinical symptoms imply an additional function of BubR 1 other than SAC in the context of morphogenesis. The primary cilium is a hair-like, microtubule-based, nonmotile organelle formed on the surface of quiescent mammalian cells. It receives extracellular information and transmits signals required for cell proliferation, tissue development, and tissue homeostasis. Ciliary dysfunction is causally linked to the group of human disorders known as ciliopathies, which include Bardet-Biedl syndrome, nephronophthisis, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Oral-facial...|$|E

40|$|Comparative genomic {{analysis}} of a wild-type strain of the ovine pathogen Chlamydia abortus and its nitrosoguanidine-induced, temperature-sensitive, virulence-attenuated live vaccine derivative identified 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms unique to the mutant, including nine nonsynonymous mutations, one leading to a truncation of pmpG, which encodes a polymorphic membrane protein, and two <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutations</b> potentially affecting promoter sequences. Other nonsynonymous mutations mapped to a pmpG pseudogene and to predicted coding sequences encoding a putative lipoprotein, a sigma- 54 -dependent response regulator, a PhoH-like protein, a putative export protein, two tRNA synthetases, and a putative serine hydroxymethyl-transferase. One of the <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutations</b> putatively affects transcription of two divergent genes encoding pyruvate kinase and a putative SOS response nuclease, respectively. These observations suggest that the temperature-sensitive phenotype and associated virulence attenuation of the vaccine strain result from dis-rupted metabolic activity due to altered pyruvate kinase expression and/or alteration in the function {{of one or more}} membrane proteins, most notably PmpG and a putative lipoprotein.

40|$|After glucose, xylose is {{the most}} {{abundant}} sugar in lignocellulosic carbon sources. However, wild-type Escherichia cob is unable to simultaneously utilize both sugars due to carbon catabolite repression (CCR). In this paper, we describe GX 50, an engineered strain capable of utilizing glucose and xylose simultaneously. This strain was obtained by evolving a mutant from which araC has been deleted, and in which genes required for pentose metabolism are constitutively expressed. The strain acquired four additional mutations during adaptive evolution, including <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutations</b> in the 5 '-flanking region of xylA and pyrE, and missense mutations in araE (S 911) and ybjG (D 99 G). In contrast to wild type E. coli, GX 50 rapidly converts xylose to xylitol even if glucose is available. Notably, the strain grows well when cultured on glucose, unlike some well-known CCR-insensitive mutants defective in the glucose phosphotransferase system. Our work will advance efforts to design a metabolically efficient platform strain for potential use in producing chemicals from lignocellulose. (C) 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

40|$|Acinetobacter baumannii is an {{increasingly}} common multidrug-resistant pathogen {{in health care}} settings. Although the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance mechanisms has been extensively studied, much less is known about how genetic variation contributes to other aspects of successful infections. Genetic changes that occur during host infection and treatment {{have the potential to}} remodel gene expression patterns related to resistance and pathogenesis. Longitudinal sets of multidrug-resistant A.  baumannii isolates from eight patients were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed genes and link them to genetic changes contributing to transcriptional variation at both within-patient and population levels. The number of differentially expressed genes among isolates from the same patient ranged from 26 (patient 588) to 145 (patient 475). Multiple patients had isolates with differential gene expression patterns related to mutations in the pmrAB and adeRS two-component regulatory system genes, as well as significant differences in genes related to antibiotic resistance, iron acquisition, amino acid metabolism, and surface-associated proteins. Population level analysis revealed 39 genetic regions with clade-specific differentially expressed genes, for which 19, 8, and 3 of these could be explained by insertion sequence mobilization, recombination-driven sequence variation, and <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutations,</b> respectively. Multiple types of mutations that arise during infection can significantly remodel the expression of genes that are known to be important in pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Background Staphylococcus aureus is a {{major cause}} of {{healthcare}} associated mortality, but like many important bacterial pathogens, it is a common constituent of the normal human body flora. Around a third of healthy adults are carriers. Recent evidence suggests that evolution of S. aureus during nasal carriage may be associated with progression to invasive disease. However, a more detailed understanding of within-host evolution under natural conditions is required to appreciate the evolutionary and mechanistic reasons why commensal bacteria such as S. aureus cause disease. Therefore we examined in detail the evolutionary dynamics of normal, asymptomatic carriage. Sequencing a total of 131 genomes across 13 singly colonized hosts using the Illumina platform, we investigated diversity, selection, population dynamics and transmission during the short-term evolution of S. aureus. Principal Findings We characterized the processes by which the raw material for evolution is generated: micro-mutation (point mutation and small insertions/deletions), macro-mutation (large insertions/deletions) and the loss or acquisition of mobile elements (plasmids and bacteriophages). Through an analysis of synonymous, non-synonymous and <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutations</b> we discovered a fitness landscape dominated by purifying selection, with rare examples of adaptive change in genes encoding surface-anchored proteins and an enterotoxin. We found evidence for dramatic, hundred-fold fluctuations {{in the size of the}} within-host population over time, which we related to the cycle of colonization and clearance. Using a newly-developed population genetics approach to detect recent transmission among hosts, we revealed evidence for recent transmission between some of our subjects, including a husband and wife both carrying populations of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Significance This investigation begins to paint a picture of the within-host evolution of an important bacterial pathogen during its prevailing natural state, asymptomatic carriage. These results also have wider significance as a benchmark for future systematic studies of evolution during invasive S. aureus disease...|$|R

40|$|A gene with {{substantial}} sequence similarity to the mreB morphogene of Bacillus subtilis {{has been identified}} at 302 degrees on the chromosomal map by A. Decatur, B. Kunkel, and R. Losick (Harvard University; personal communication). Our characterization has revealed that the protein product of this determinant (termed mbl for mreB-like) is 55 and 53 % identical in sequence to the MreB proteins of B. subtilis and Escherichia coli, respectively. The protein is 86 % identical to a protein identified as MreB from Bacillus cereus, suggesting that the B. cereus protein is actually Mbl. Insertional inactivation of mbl indicated that this gene is not essential for cell viability or sporulation. Cells bearing mutant mbl alleles display a decreased growth rate and an altered cellular morphology. The cells appear bloated and are frequently twisted. <b>Intergenic</b> suppressor <b>mutations</b> which restore the growth rate to an approximately normal level arise within the mutant population.

50|$|A {{suppressor}} {{screen is}} used to identify suppressor mutations which alleviate or revert the phenotype of the original mutation, in a process defined as synthetic viability. Suppressor mutations {{can be described as}} second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation. If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as intragenic suppression, whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as extragenic suppression or <b>intergenic</b> suppression. Suppressor <b>mutations</b> are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways.|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{a complex}} genomic disease {{characterized}} by accumulation of somatic mutations over the lifetime of a patient. Identification of somatic driver mutations that contribute to tumorigenesis is a major goal of cancer genomics. With the recent advances in the sequencing technologies it became possible to study somatic mutations on the whole-genome scale in multiple cancers. While most of the cancer genomics studies were previously focused on identification of driver mutations affecting exons, several examples of driver events within the non-protein-coding regions of the genome were identified, including the recurrent TERT promoter mutations. Such findings have spurred searches for similar examples of recurrent non-coding mutations using computational cancer genomics. In my PhD thesis, I present several computational approaches aimedto identify somatic driver mutations with a specific focus on intergenic regions of the genome. The {{first part of this}} thesis focuses on the somatic mutational patterns along the cancer genome and addresses a fundamental problem of computational identification of recurrently mutated regions – regional mutational heterogeneity. Here I studied the correlation of specific genomic features with background somatic mutation rates and devised a background model that accounts for regional mutational heterogeneity. The second part of this thesis describes three different computational approaches designed to identify somatic driver events of functional relevance in cancer. The first approach integrates somatic mutation calls with gene expression data to identify variants associated with altered mRNA levels. The second approach is designed to predict changes in transcription factor binding sites in presence of recurrent somatic mutations. The third approach uses cross-validation scheme to enable parameter tuning in screens for recurrently somatically mutated regions in cancer genomes in an unbiased genome-wide manner. Using this approach, we identify several known cancer-relevant targets, both exonic (e. g., the TP 53, MYC, and SMARCA 4 genes) as well as non-coding regulatory regions (e. g., the TERT promoter) and uncover novel candidate regulatory driver regions. Among those, a cluster of recurrent <b>intergenic</b> <b>mutations,</b> occurring in an enhancer element near the FADS 2 gene, which encodes a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and has been previously implicated in cancer. Collectively, the computational approaches presented here helped in uncovering novel somatic candidate events of relevance in cancer and can be further used for various applications in cancer genomics...|$|R
40|$|The flaAII. 2, flaQ, and flaN {{genes of}} Salmonella typhimurium are {{important}} for assembly, rotation, and counterclockwise-clockwise switching of the flagellar motor. Paralyzed and nonchemotactic mutants were subjected to selection pressure for partial acquisition of motility and chemotaxis, and the suppressor mutations of the resulting pseudorevertants were mapped and isolated. Many of the <b>intergenic</b> suppressor <b>mutations</b> were {{in one of the}} other two genes. Others were in genes for cytoplasmic components of the chemotaxis system, notably cheY and cheZ; one of the mutations was found in the cheA gene and one in a motility gene, motB. Suppression among the three fla genes was allele specific, and many of the pseudorevertants were either cold sensitive or heat sensitive. We conclude that the FlaAII. 2, FlaQ, and FlaN proteins form a complex which determines the rotational sense, either counterclockwise or clockwise, of the motor and also participates in the conversion of proton energy into mechanical work of rotation. This switch complex is probably mounted {{to the base of the}} flagellar basal body and, via binding of the CheY and CheZ proteins, receives sensory information and uses it to control flagellar operation...|$|R
40|$|The nusA 11 {{mutation}} causes reduced transcription termination and temperature-sensitive {{growth of}} Escherichia coli. Suppressor mutations that restored growth of nusA 11 mutant cells were isolated and named sna <b>mutations.</b> The <b>intergenic</b> suppressor <b>mutation</b> sna- 10 {{was located in}} the rpoC gene at 90 min, which encodes the beta' subunit of RNA polymerase. sna- 10 complemented the defect in tR 1 termination caused by nusA 11 and by itself stimulated termination of transcription at the lambda tR 1 terminator. sna- 10 is specific to the nusA 11 allele and unable to suppress cold-sensitive growth of the nusA 10 mutant. nusA 10 carried two base substitutions at positions 311 and 634, causing two amino acid changes from the wild-type sequence. During these studies, we found three - 1 frameshift errors in the wild-type nusA sequence; the correct sequence was confirmed by the peptide sequence and gene fusion analyses. The revised sequence revealed that nusA 1 and nusA 11 are located in an arginine-rich peptide region and substitute arginine and aspartate for leucine 183 and glycine 181, respectively. The intragenic suppressor study indicated that the nusA 11 mutation can be suppressed by changing the mutated aspartate 181 to alanine or changing aspartate 84 to tyrosine...|$|R
40|$|SummarySister {{chromatid}} cohesion, {{which is}} {{mediated by the}} cohesin complex, is vital for faithful segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis (reviewed in [1]). Cohesion is established during S phase, and this process requires {{the function of the}} acetyltransferase Eco 1 /Ctf 7 [2 – 5]. The mechanism of the cohesion establishment is, however, still unclear. Here, we describe isolation and identification of genetic suppressors of budding yeast eco 1 - 1 temperature-sensitive mutant. By using a recently described microarray-based method [6], we successfully mapped 11 <b>intergenic</b> suppressor <b>mutations</b> in two genes, wpl 1 (also known as rad 61) and pds 5. Pds 5 is a known accessory factor of cohesin complex [7 – 11], and we show that Wpl 1 /Rad 61 protein forms a complex with Pds 5 and colocalizes with cohesin on chromosomes, as its presumed human homolog Wapl [12, 13]. Impaired function of Wpl 1 -Pds 5 complex makes Eco 1 dispensable for cell survival. We also provide evidence that Wpl 1 is required for efficient association of cohesin with G 2 phase chromosomes and that Eco 1 promotes dissociation of Wpl 1 -Pds 5 from cohesin via acetylation of Smc 3, a cohesin subunit. Taken together, the presented data suggest that Wpl 1 -Pds 5 complex is inhibitory for cohesion establishment and that Eco 1 establishes cohesion by hindering the function of Wpl 1 -Pds 5 temporally in S phase...|$|R

Under our experimental conditions neither biochemical complementation, interallelic complementation, nor recombination has been found to contribute to any significant extent toward the respiration measured in the diploids at early times. The test has been used to study the number of complementation groups represented by a large number of mit- mutants. Results of pairwise crosses of mutants in the oxi 1, oxi 2, oxi 3, cob 1, and cob 2 loci indicate that complementation occurs between the oxi and cob loci between different oxi loci but not between the two cob loci. The five loci have, therefore, been assigned to four different complementation groups...|$|R

These elements contain a gag-pol-like structure characteristic of retroviruses but {{have lost their}} ability to retrotranspose into the mammalian genome and {{are thought to be}} inactive relics of ancient retrotransposition events. One of these retrotransposon-like elements, PEG 11 (also called RTL 1) is located at the distal end of ovine chromosome 18 within an imprinted gene cluster that is highly conserved in placental mammals. The region contains several conserved imprinted genes including BEGAIN, DLK 1, DAT, GTL 2 (MEG 3), PEG 11 (RTL 1), PEG 11 as, MEG 8, MIRG and DIO 3. An <b>intergenic</b> point <b>mutation</b> between DLK 1 and GTL 2 causes muscle hypertrophy in callipyge sheep and is associated with large changes in expression of the genes linked in cis between DLK 1 and MEG 8. It has been suggested that over-expression of DLK 1 is the effector of the callipyge phenotype; however, PEG 11 gene expression is also strongly correlated with the emergence of the muscling phenotype as a function of genotype, muscle type and developmental stage. To date, there has been no direct evidence that PEG 11 encodes a protein, especially as its anti-sense transcript (PEG 11 as) contains six miRNA that cause cleavage of the PEG 11 transcript. Using immunological and mass spectrometry approaches we have directly identified the full-length PEG 11 protein from postnatal nuclear preparations of callipyge skeletal muscle and conclude that its over-expression may be involved in inducing muscle hypertrophy.

40|$|Lactobacillus plantarum is a {{lactic acid}} {{bacterium}} that produces a racemic mixture of l- and d-lactate from sugar fermentation. The interconversion of lactate isomers is performed by a lactate racemase (Lar) that is transcriptionally controlled by the l-/d-lactate ratio and maximally induced {{in the presence of}} l-lactate. We previously reported that the Lar activity depends on the expression of two divergently oriented operons: (i) the larABCDE operon encodes the nickel-dependent lactate racemase (LarA), its maturases (LarBCE), and a lactic acid channel (LarD), and (ii) the larR(MN) QO operon encodes a transcriptional regulator (LarR) and a four-component ABC-type nickel transporter [Lar(MN), in which the M and N components are fused, LarQ, and LarO]. LarR is a novel regulator of the Crp-Fnr family (PrfA group). Here, the role of LarR was further characterized in vivo and in vitro. We show that LarR is a positive regulator that is absolutely required for the expression of Lar activity. Using gel retardation experiments, we demonstrate that LarR binds to a 16 -bp palindromic sequence (Lar box motif) that is present in the larR-larA <b>intergenic</b> region. <b>Mutations</b> in the Lar box strongly affect LarR binding and completely abolish transcription from the larA promoter (PlarA). Two half-Lar boxes located between the Lar box and the - 35 box of PlarA promote LarR multimerization on DNA, and point mutations within one or both half-Lar boxes inhibit PlarA induction by l-lactate. Gel retardation and footprinting experiments indicate that l-lactate has a positive effect on the binding and multimerization of LarR, while d-lactate antagonizes the positive effect of l-lactate. A possible mechanism of LarR regulation by lactate enantiomers is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The use- 1 {{mutation}} in Salmonella typhimurium confers {{a complex and}} pleiotrophic phenotype which is primarily characterized as a temperature-dependent sensitivity to uracil. This sensitivity can be reversed by arginine or citrulline, but not by ornithine, suggesting that the use- 1 mutation affects the synthesis or the activity (or both) of carbamoylphosphate synthetase or ornithine carbamoyltransferase (or both). Activity measurements showed that use- 1 caused superrepression of both of these enzymes, especially when uracil was present in the medium. Dihydro-orotase and dihydro-orotate oxidase were also superrepressed, but aspartate carbamoyltransferase and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase were not. Lowered nucleotide triphosphate and guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate pools in use- 1 strains indicated that the mutation affected synthesis or breakdown {{of all of these}} phosphorylated compounds, but the UTP pool increased by a larger relative factor in use- 1 strains in the presence of uracil. The uracil-sensitive phenotype of the use- 1 mutation is a complex response to several environmental factors: temperature, aerobiosis, carbon sources, and uracil concentration. Uracil sensitivity was eliminated by alteration of {{one or more of these}} factors. Uracil sensitivity was suppressed by several genetic alterations. These include introduction into use- 1 strains of a multi-copy ColE 1 derivative which carries the structural gene(s) for carbamoylphosphate synthetase, episomes that carry use, mutations including argR and pyrH, and various unclassified <b>intergenic</b> suppressor <b>mutations.</b> These genetic changes increased significantly the expression of carbamoylphosphate synthetase or ornithine carbamoyltransferase (or both).

The mutations were deemed to define four {{genes in the}} order thrD-C-A-B at minute zero on the Salmonella linkage map. In the present study 12 of these mutants were reexamined together with eight new Thr− strains. The three phenotypes were: homoserine-requiring (Hom−); Thr−, feeders of Hom− strains; Thr−, nonfeeders. Exact correlation between these phenotypic groups and three complementation groups was confirmed by abortive transduction. No evidence was found for <b>intergenic</b> complementation between <b>mutations</b> in Hom− strains. It is proposed that thr mutations define three genes rather than four and that these be renamed thrA (Hom−), thrB (Thr− feeders), and thrC (Thr− nonfeeders) to correspond with the sequence of reactions in threonine biosynthesis. Double mutant trpRthr strains were used in reciprocal three-point transduction tests to establish the order of thr mutation sites. Although revisions {{were made in the}} classification or location of several mutations, there was an overall correlation of complementation group, phenotype, and map position.

In this paper, we have used flash-induced absorbance spectroscopy to study three strains that share identical amino acid sequences in the QB binding site, all of which lack the protonatable amino acids Glu-L 212 and Asp-L 213. These strains are the photosynthetically incompetent site-specific mutant Glu-L 212 /Asp-L 213 [...] >Ala-L 212 /Ala-L 213 and two different photocompetent derivatives that carry both alanine substitutions and an <b>intergenic</b> suppressor <b>mutation</b> located far from QB (class 3 strain, Ala-Ala + Arg-M 231 [...] >Leu; class 4 strain, Ala-Ala + Asn-M 43 [...] >Asp). At pH 8 in the double mutant, we observe a concomitant decrease of nearly 4 orders of magnitude in the rate constants of second electron and proton transfer to QB compared to the wild type. Surprisingly, these rates are increased to about the same extent in both types of suppressor strains but remain > 2 orders of magnitude smaller {{than those of the}} wild type. In the double mutant, at pH 8, the loss of Asp-L 213 and Glu-L 212 leads to a substantial stabilization (> or = 60 meV) of the semiquinone energy level. Both types of compensatory mutations partially restore, to nearly the same level, the original free energy difference for electron transfer from primary quinone QA to QB. The pH dependence of the electron and proton transfer processes in the double-mutant and the suppressor strains suggests that when reaction centers of the double mutant are shifted to lower pH (1. 5 - 2 units), they function like those of the suppressor strains at physiological pH. Our data suggest that the main effect of the compensatory mutations is to partially restore the negative electrostatic environment of QB and to increase an apparent "functional" pK of the system for efficient proton transfer to the active site. This emphasizes the role of the protein in tuning the electrostatic environment of its cofactors and highlights the possible long-range electrostatic effects...|$|R
40|$|Genome {{sequencing}} {{has identified}} an extensive repertoire of {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} among clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but {{the extent to which}} these differences influence phenotypic properties of the bacteria remains to be elucidated. To determine whether these polymorphisms give rise to phenotypic diversity, we have integrated genome data sets with RNA sequencing to assess their impact on the comparative transcriptome profiles of strains belonging to M. tuberculosis Lineages 1 and 2. We observed clear correlations between genotype and transcriptional phenotype. These arose by three mechanisms. First, lineage-specific changes in amino acid sequence of transcriptional regulators were associated with alterations in their ability to control gene expression. Second, changes in nucleotide sequence were associated with alteration of promoter activity and generation of novel transcriptional start sites in intergenic regions and within coding sequences. We show that in some cases this mechanism is expected to generate functionally active truncated proteins involved in innate immune recognition. Finally, genes showing lineage-specific patterns of differential expression not linked directly to primary mutations were characterized by a striking overrepresentation of toxin-antitoxin pairs. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial evolution, contribute to a systems level understanding of this important human pathogen, and more broadly demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art techniques to provide novel insight into mechanisms by which <b>intergenic</b> and silent <b>mutations</b> contribute to diversity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evolutionary {{rates are}} not {{constant}} across {{the human genome}} but genes in close proximity {{have been shown to}} experience similar levels of divergence and selection. The higher-order organisation of chromosomes has often been invoked to explain such phenomena but previously there has been insufficient data on chromosome structure to investigate this rigorously. Using the results of a recent genome-wide analysis of open and closed human chromatin structures we have investigated the global association between divergence, selection and chromatin structure for the first time. Results In this study we have shown that, paradoxically, synonymous site divergence (dS) at non-CpG sites is highest in regions of open chromatin, primarily {{as a result of an}} increased number of transitions, while the rates of other traditional measures of <b>mutation</b> (<b>intergenic,</b> intronic and ancient repeat divergence as well as SNP density) are highest in closed regions of the genome. Analysis of human-chimpanzee divergence across intron-exon boundaries indicates that although genes in relatively open chromatin generally display little selection at their synonymous sites, those in closed regions show markedly lower divergence at their fourfold degenerate sites than in neighbouring introns and intergenic regions. Exclusion of known Exonic Splice Enhancer hexamers has little affect on the divergence observed at fourfold degenerate sites across chromatin categories; however, we show that closed chromatin is enriched with certain classes of ncRNA genes whose RNA secondary structure may be particularly important. Conclusion We conclude that, overall, non-CpG mutation rates are lowest in open regions of the genome and that regions of the genome with a closed chromatin structure have the highest background mutation rate. This might reflect lower rates of DNA damage or enhanced DNA repair processes in regions of open chromatin. Our results also indicate that dS is a poor measure of mutation rates, particularly when used in closed regions of the genome, as genes in closed regions generally display relatively strong levels of selection at their synonymous sites. </p...|$|R
40|$|Acinetobacter PobR and PcaU are {{transcriptional}} activators {{that closely}} resemble {{each other in}} primary structure, DNA-binding sites, metabolic modulators, and physiological function. PobR responds to the inducer-metabolite p-hydroxybenzoate and activates transcription of pobA, the structural gene for the enzyme that converts p-hydroxybenzoate to protocatechuate. This compound, differing from p-hydroxybenzoate only in that it contains an additional oxygen atom, binds to PcaU and thereby specifically activates transcription of the full set of genes for protocatechuate catabolism. Particular experimental {{attention has been paid}} to PobR and PcaU from Acinetobacter strain ADP 1, which exhibits exceptional competence for natural transformation. This trait allowed selection of mutant strains in which pobR function had been impaired by nucleotide substitutions introduced by PCR replication errors. Contrary to expectation, the spectrum of amino acids whose substitution led to loss of function in PobR shows no marked similarity to the spectrum of amino acids conserved by the demand for continued function during evolutionary divergence of PobR, PcaU, and related proteins. Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the ability of mutant PobR proteins to bind to DNA in the pobA-pobR <b>intergenic</b> region. Deleterious <b>mutations</b> that strongly affect DNA binding all cluster in and around the PobR region that contains a helix-turn-helix motif, whereas mutations causing defects in the central portion of the PobR primary sequence do not seem to have a significant effect on operator binding. PCR-generated mutations allowing PobR to mimic PcaU function invariably caused a T 57 A amino acid substitution, making the helix-turn-helix sequence of PobR more like that of PcaU. The mutant PobR depended on p-hydroxybenzoate for its activity, but this dependence could be relieved by any of six amino acid substitutions in the center of the PobR primary sequence. Independent mutations allowing PcaU to mimic PobR activity were shown to be G 222 V amino acid substitutions in the C terminus of the 274 -residue protein. Together, the analyses suggest that PobR and PcaU possess a linear domain structure similar to that of LysR transcriptional activators which largely differ in primary structure...|$|R
