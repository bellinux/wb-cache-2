5|$|After Groundskeeper Willie {{takes away}} Bart's {{skateboard}} for destroying his leaf pile, Bart fills up Willie's shack with creamed corn {{as he is}} sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show {{to make room for}} a kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is not chosen at first, but is made sportscaster after <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> to Marge.|$|E
5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. <b>He</b> <b>complains</b> to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} spring, Johnny Town-mouse pays Timmy Willie a visit. <b>He</b> <b>complains</b> of the dampness {{and finds}} {{such things as}} cows and lawnmowers frightening. He returns to {{the city in the}} hamper of vegetables after telling Timmy country life is too quiet. The tale ends with the author stating her own preference for country living.|$|E

25|$|The {{writing of}} Patrick and Gildas (see below) {{demonstrates}} the survival in Britain of Latin literacy and Roman education, learning and law within elite society and Christianity, throughout {{the bulk of}} the 5th and 6th centuries. There are also signs in Gildas' works that the economy was thriving without Roman taxation, as <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> of luxuria and self-indulgence. This is the 5th century Britain into which the Anglo-Saxons appear.|$|E
25|$|Jaime {{lives in}} El Paso, Texas with his father, mother and little sister; his father owns a garage. Jaime offers {{to help his}} father at the garage, but his father feels Jaime should study and enjoy his {{childhood}} {{for as long as}} he can. Jaime has an acute sense of responsibility for his family and friends, though <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> about having to sort out their various problems. He derives strength and courage from his family's support.|$|E
25|$|The Yorkists regroup, {{and at the}} Battle of Towton, Clifford {{is killed}} and the Yorkists are victorious. Following the battle, Edward is proclaimed king, George is proclaimed Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> to Edward {{that this is an}} ominous dukedom. King Edward and George then leave the court, and Richard reveals to the audience his ambition to rise to power and take the throne from his brother, although as yet he is unsure how to go about it.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, Mister's son Harpo {{brings home}} Sofia, a strong-willed woman whom he later marries ("Dear God - Sofia"). When <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> {{that he is}} tired of Sofia bossing him around, Mister and Celie tell him {{the only way to}} get her to listen is to beat her. Harpo {{attempts}} to do so but ends up being beaten by Sofia ("A Tree Named Sofia"). After confronting Celie, Sofia learns the extent of Mister's cruelty and tells Celie to stand up for herself before leaving home to spend time with her sisters ("Hell No!").|$|E
25|$|Noteworthy is {{that while}} {{organizing}} assistance to the Estonian mission, Pope Alexander III was also closely following the situation in Finland, something that no previous Pope {{is known to have}} done. Eskil and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who had also been appointed to his high office by Eskil in 1164, were both close acquaintances with the Pope, having met in France while the Pope had been exiled there in the 1160s. In Pope's letter to Stefan in 1171 (or 1172), <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> how Finns only turned to God at the time of war, harassing preachers as soon as the peril was over. No Diocese or Bishop of Finland is mentioned in the papal letter, and no information survives, whether it prompted any actions. In the apparent shortage of missionaries, it can be speculated that the frustrated Pope may have organized Fulco to deal with the Finns as soon as his assistant Nicolaus could have taken over the missionary work in Estonia.|$|E
25|$|Bede is very uncomplimentary {{about the}} {{indigenous}} British clergy: in his Historia ecclesiastica <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> of their unspeakable crimes, {{and that they}} did not preach the faith to the Angles or Saxons. Pope Gregory I sent Augustine in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons, but Bede says the British clergy refused to help Augustine in his mission. Despite Bede's complaints, it is now believed that the Britons {{played an important role in}} the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. On arrival in the south east of England in 597, Augustine was given land by King Æthelberht of Kent to build a church; so in 597 Augustine built the church and founded the See at Canterbury. He baptised Æthelberht in 601, then continued with his mission to convert the English. Most of the north and east of England had already been evangelised by the Irish Church. However, Sussex and the Isle of Wight remained mainly pagan until the arrival of Saint Wilfrid, the exiled Archbishop of York, who converted Sussex around 681 and the Isle of Wight in 683.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
500|$|He finds he {{has arrived}} in the rainy season, seeing mainly mud and water. <b>He</b> <b>complains</b> that two months' work produce only 210 species of beetle, {{compared}} to 300 in three weeks at Amboyna. However one Cerambyx beetle was up to 3 inches (7.5cm) long, with antennae up to 5 inches (12.5cm) in length. He is amused at himself for finding his simple hut comfortable, once {{he has made a}} rough table and is in his rattan chair, with a mosquito net and [...] "large Scotch plaid" [...] to form a [...] "little sleeping apartment". He gets 17 new (at least for the Moluccas) species of bird including a new Pitta bird.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Marge {{notices that}} their dog Santa's Little Helper {{needs a new}} dog house. She wants to buy one, but Homer says that he can save money by {{building}} one instead. His attempts at building the house frustrate Homer, and he curses loud enough for Todd to overhear. After Todd says [...] "hell no" [...] and [...] "damn" [...] at dinner, his father Ned eventually discovers that he learned those words from Homer. <b>He</b> <b>complains</b> to Homer, who in turn criticizes Ned's mustache. Ned promises to shave off his mustache in return for Homer curtailing uses of profanity. He promises to put money in a [...] "swear jar" [...] - 25 cents for each curse.|$|E

500|$|Part two, [...] "La Femme sans cœur", is narrated as a {{flashback}} from Valentin's point of view. <b>He</b> <b>complains</b> {{to his friend}} Émile about his early days as a scholar, living in poverty with an elderly landlord and her daughter Pauline, while trying fruitlessly to win {{the heart of a}} beautiful but aloof woman named Foedora. Along the way he is tutored by an older man named Eugène de Rastignac, who encourages him to immerse himself in the world of high society. Benefiting from the kindness of his landladies, Valentin maneuvers his way into Foedora's circle of friends. Unable to win her affection, however, he becomes the miserable and destitute man found at the start of [...] "Le Talisman".|$|E
500|$|LaVey {{explains}} {{his reasons for}} writing The Satanic Bible in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors {{on the subject of}} magic, dismissing them as [...] "nothing more than sanctimonious fraud" [...] and [...] "volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy". <b>He</b> <b>complains</b> that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by [...] "right-hand path" [...] authors. He tells that The Satanic Bible contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, [...] "What you see may not always please you, but you will see!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hermann is {{described}} by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a [...] "huge, selfish, overbearing businessman" [...] and by Franz Kafka as [...] "a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [...] knowledge of human nature". On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely, {{and the children were}} reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship with his father is evident in his [...] (Letter to His Father) of more than 100pages, in which <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character; his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy. The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing.|$|E

500|$|The wolf, {{after some}} complaint, agrees {{to this and}} the two proceed through the woods after the prize—all the while the fox {{considers}} how to trick the wolf. Eventually, as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest, they arrive at a [...] with buckets on each end of a rope. Seeing {{the reflection of the}} moon in the water {{at the bottom of the}} well, the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up. When <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> that it is too heavy for him to lift alone, the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help. However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox has jumped, and so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens in}} the [...] "green reality" [...] (where Rex {{is alive and}} Hannah isn't), with John Cooper (Clifton Powell), a convict that Michael arrested 10 years ago, who is {{transferred}} to a medical clinic for dialysis because he is missing a kidney, by Nancy (Lolly Ward). As the guard takes Copper to the car {{to go back to}} prison, <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> that the prisoner is getting preferential treatment over his mother, who is on the waiting list. As they arrive at the van, Cooper uses a paralytic vial hidden in his bandages to knock one guard out. He takes his gun, and makes the other security guard shut the door. Cooper claims his has [...] "nothing to lose". Later, at home, while Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) takes him to tennis practice, Michael gets a call from Isaiah [...] "Bird" [...] Freeman (Steve Harris), his partner, that Cooper had escaped. Rex and Tara are talking about Rex's guilt about his father, when Cooper hits the car, and puts a chemical thing on Tara, and kidnaps Rex.|$|E
500|$|EX Media lauds Oda's art for its [...] "crispy" [...] {{monochrome}} pictures, [...] "great use {{of subtle}} shade changes" [...] on color pages, [...] "sometimes exquisite" [...] use of angles, {{and for its}} consistency. Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes {{to see just how}} crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama." [...] He praised Oda's artwork as [...] "imaginative and creative" [...] and comments that [...] "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [...] ". He also notes that [...] "Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast," [...] though <b>he</b> <b>complains</b> that the panels can sometimes get [...] "a little chaotic".|$|E
