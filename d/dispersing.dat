40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Disperse</b> dyes {{are common}} sensitizers, {{but are not}} {{currently}} included in the European baseline series. OBJECTIVES: To justify {{the inclusion of a}} textile dye mix in the European baseline patch test series. METHODS: A survey of the reported frequencies of contact allergy to textile dyes and textile dye mixes was performed by searching PubMed ([URL] last accessed 14 December 2014). The results from a multicentre study performed within the European Environmental Contact Dermatitis Research Group (EECDRG) and published in 2014 formed the final basis for the recommendation. RESULTS: The EECDRG study performed in Europe and the United States showed that 2. 1 - 6. 9 % of consecutively tested dermatitis patients reacted to a 6. 6 % wt/wt textile dye mix consisting of eight <b>disperse</b> dyes. The clinical relevance was ascertained in > 30 % of the positive cases. A high frequency of simultaneous sensitivity to <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3 (DO 3) and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) was seen. Active sensitization to the mix was not noted. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended to include a 6. 6 % textile dye mix consisting of eight <b>disperse</b> dyes in the European baseline series, even though one component, DO 3, may be superfluous, owing to its frequent cross-reactivity with PPD. Removal of DO 3 from the mix would need further study. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{spite of}} {{sporadic}} data {{pointing at the}} role of textile dyes as important contact allergens, only few studies have {{addressed the issue of}} the frequency of sensitization to textile dyes in populations of consecutive patients. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the prevalence of sensitization to <b>disperse</b> dyes, to investigate cross reactivity between azo dyes and para-amino compounds, to describe azo-dye-positive patients, and to study the correlation between clinical aspects and sensitization to different <b>disperse</b> dyes. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2000, 6, 478 consecutive patients were tested with 7 textile dyes: <b>Disperse</b> Blue 124, <b>Disperse</b> Blue 106, <b>Disperse</b> Red 1, <b>Disperse</b> Yellow 3, <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3 (DO 3), para-aminoazobenzene (PAAB), and para-dimethylaminoazobenzene (PDAAB). RESULTS: Of the above, 437 patients were allergic. The most common sensitizers were <b>Disperse</b> Blue (DB) dyes and <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3. Both the clinical aspect and the localization of the lesions were unusual in a fair percentage of cases, especially in DB-positive subjects. Involvement of skin folds was observed in 27 % of <b>disperse</b> dye-positive patients, mainly comprising DB-sensitive women. Cross-reactivity between azo-dyes and paraphenylenediamine (PPD) was frequent in DO 3 -, PAAB-, and PDAAB-positive subjects, but not in DB-allergic ones. Moreover, cross reactions between DB 106 and DB 124 were observed in 59 % of DB 106 - and/or DB 124 -positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of <b>disperse</b> dye allergy is higher than generally estimated.
