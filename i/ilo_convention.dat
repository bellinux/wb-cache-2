It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization (<b>ILO)</b> <b>Convention</b> 169. Chile ratified it in 2008. A Chilean court decision in November 2009 {{considered to be a}} landmark ruling on indigenous rights and made use of the convention.

In November 2008 the Supreme Court declared Article 41 of the Trade Unions Law unconstitutional and upheld {{the right of a}} workers' union lacking official legal recognition to elect its own delegates.

Article 86 of the Lebanese Labour Code however specifically states the need for authorization prior to trade union formation. Since there is no deadline for Ministry of Labour to either approve or disapprove the formation of a trade union the authorization process has been criticized to be depended on the political affiliation of the ministers of labour in charge. Article 4 of the Labour Law, and Decree No. 7993 of 1952 list domestic workers as one group of workers who are barred from forming trade unions. Even though article 7 and article 92 allows foreigners to join a union, they are denied to vote for trade union representatives and being elected into such a position.|$|E

Some of Haiti's efforts to combat modern day slavery include ratifying several key conventions, including the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UHDR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the International Labour Organization (<b>ILO)</b> <b>Convention</b> Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and the ILO Minimum Age Convention.

2500|$|Large {{numbers of}} Bolivian {{highland}} peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at {{the dissolution of}} communal landholdings and used legal recognition of [...] "empowered caciques" [...] to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953. While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged people identifying as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s. Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the <b>ILO</b> <b>Convention</b> 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories.

2500|$|Partly out of {{fear for}} the Tolkien tourism effect, on 25 October 2010, {{thousands}} of New Zealanders organised protest rallies imploring that production remain in New Zealand, arguing that shifting production to locations outside New Zealand would potentially cost the country's economy up to $1.5billion. After two days of talks with the New Zealand government (including involvement by Prime Minister John Key), Warner Bros. executives decided on 27 October to film The Hobbit in New Zealand as originally planned. In return, the government agreed to introduce legislation to remove the right of workers to organise trade unions in the film production industry, and to give money to big budget films made in New Zealand. The legislation reversed {{a decision by the}} New Zealand Supreme Court called Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd holding that under the Employment Relations Act 2000, a model maker named Mr Bryson was an [...] "employee" [...] who could organise a union to defend his interests. The Employment Relations (Film Production Work) Amendment Bill passed all three readings under urgency on 29 October 2010, 66 votes in favour to 50 opposed.

But Mah, who also investigates the role of labor standards on export performance, finds a negative association between the ratification of certain “core ” <b>ILO</b> <b>conventions</b> and performance. 2 Rodrik tries to explain manufacturing labor costs and finds that the number of con-ventions ratified is statistically significant. 3 Palley finds a positive association between economic growth and the ratification of the Freedom of Association Convention. 4 But Rama argues that the number of <b>ILO</b> <b>conventions</b> ratified is not significant as a determinant of growth performance in Latin America. 5 Throughout this empirical literature, therefore, the ratification of ILO con-ventions is assumed to provide information on labor standards adopted an...|$|R
2500|$|First, {{the meaning}} of a [...] "trade dispute" [...] under TULRCA 1992 section 244 is {{confined}} to mean a dispute [...] "between workers and their employer" [...] and must mainly relate to employment terms. In BBC v Hearn Lord Denning MR granted an injunction against a strike by BBC staff to stop broadcast of the 1977 FA Cup Final to apartheid South Africa. He reasoned that this was a political dispute, not a [...] "trade dispute", unless the union was requesting [...] "putting a clause in the contract" [...] to not do such work. Strikes against government legislation (rather than an employer), or privatisation, or outsourcing before it happens, have been held unlawful. However, at the least, any dispute over the terms or conditions on which workers do their jobs will allow protection. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 224 prevents collective action against someone who is [...] "not the employer party to the dispute". So called [...] "secondary action" [...] was lawful from the Trade Union Act 1871 until 1927, and again from 1946 till 1980. This makes the definition of [...] "employer" [...] relevant, particularly where a trade dispute involves a company group. A worker's written statement of the contract may purport to say that the only [...] "employer" [...] is a subsidiary, although the parent company carries out the employer's function of ultimately setting the contractual terms and conditions. There are a limited number of outright prohibitions on strike action, but in accordance with <b>ILO</b> <b>Convention</b> 87 this is only for workplaces that involve the truly essential functions of the state (for armed forces, police, and prison officers), and only when impartial arbitration is used as an alternative.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as having}} legal {{protection}} for workers rights, an objective of trade unions {{has been to}} organise their members across borders {{in the same way}} that multinational corporations have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strike internationally. However, this kind of coordination was halted in the European Union in two decisions. In Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this [...] "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in The Rosella, the ECJ also held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' [...] "right to strike" [...] in accordance with <b>ILO</b> <b>Convention</b> 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests. For this reason it has been questioned whether the ECJ's decisions were compatible with fundamental human rights, particularly the freedom of association guaranteed by article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.|$|E

40|$|Ratifying {{conventions}} {{adopted by}} the International Labour Organization creates legal obligations to improve labour standards in the domestic economy. Why do states choose to ratify them?

In this view, <b>ILO</b> <b>conventions</b> are devices for the prevention and mitigation of regulatory “races to the bottom” among trade rivals.
