5000|$|The Remington 788 has two {{distinguishing}} design features. The {{first is}} the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The bolt pictured is a pre-1975 locking model from a [...]308 Winchester caliber rifle. The locking bolt requires the safety {{to be in the}} [...] "fire" [...] or [...] "off" [...] position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged. The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt-action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller <b>feed</b> <b>opening</b> {{in the bottom of the}} receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well. When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength. These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter. A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.|$|E

It is evident that a change in mill throughput can be achieved by changing the mill speed or the work opening.

One of these characteristics is the <b>feed</b> <b>opening.</b> For a particular mill configuration there is a <b>feed</b> <b>opening</b> which results in the maximum throughput at the same speed.

40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a feed pipe. In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how the feed flow from such a feed pipe {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). The feed flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under the feed pipe. Measurements were performed with different <b>feed</b> pipe <b>openings</b> and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of the feed flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate the feed flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under the feed pipe, average values of several parameters characterising the feed flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under the feed pipe are the same for different <b>feed</b> pipe <b>openings</b> and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of the feed pipe. At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of the feed pipe. When the impeller speed is high, the shape of the feed pipe is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of the feed flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on the <b>feed</b> pipe <b>opening</b> and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

While much {{work has been done}} identifying motor pattern var-iations of this behavior among diverse groups of actinopterygian fishes, many ray-finned groups are still not represented. Further, the substantial amount of inherent variation in electromyography makes much of the pioneering work of suction feed-ing motor patterns in several basal groups insufficient for evolutionary compari-sons. Robust evolutionary comparisons have identified conserved qualitative traits in the order of muscle activation during suction <b>feeding</b> (jaw <b>opening.</b> buccal cavity expansion. jaw closing). However, quantitative traits of suction motor patterns (i. e., burst durations and relative onset times) have changed over evolu-tionary time among actinopterygian fishes. Finally, new motor pattern evidence is presented from a previously neglected group, the Elopomorpha.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} setting a milling unit is essentially {{based on the}} desire to achieve a particular bagasse moisture content or fibre fill in each nip of the mill. This approach relies on {{the selection of the}} speed at which the mill will operate for the selected fibre rate. There is rarely any checking that the selected speed or the selected fibre fill is achieved and the same set of assumptions is generally carried over to use again in the next year. The conventional approach largely ignores the fact that the selection of mill settings actually determines the speed at which the mill will operate. Making an adjustment with the intent of changing the performance of the mill often also changes the speed of the mill as an unintended consequence. This paper presents an alternative approach to mill setting. The approach discussed makes use of mill feeding theory to define the relationship between fibre rate, mill speed and mill settings and uses that theory to provide an alternative means of determining the settings in some nips of the mill. Mill feeding theory shows that, as the <b>feed</b> work <b>opening</b> reduces, roll speed increases. The theory also shows that there is an optimal underfeed opening and Donnelly chute exit opening that will minimise roll speed and that the current South African guidelines appear to be well away from those optimal values...|$|R
