5|$|Beatty had {{a concept}} for a <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> film in 1975. At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, {{who gave up}} his option from Tribune Media Services after he was {{unsuccessful}} in pitching <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing/distributing <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy.</b> Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). The deal fell through when Chester Gould insisted on strict financial and artistic control.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> had {{its premiere}} at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The film was {{released}} in the United States in 2,332 theaters on June 15, 1990, earning $22.54 million in its in opening weekend. This was the third-highest opening weekend of 1990. <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> eventually grossed $103.74 million in US totals and $59 million elsewhere, coming to a worldwide total of $162.74 million. <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> was also the ninth-highest-grossing film of America in 1990, and number twelve in worldwide totals.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> {{began on}} February 2, 1989. The filmmakers considered shooting the film on-location in Chicago, Illinois, but production designer Richard Sylbert believed <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> would work better using sound stages and backlots at Universal Studios in Universal City, California. Other filming {{took place at}} Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. In total, 53 interior and 25 exterior sets were constructed. Beatty, being a perfectionist, often filmed dozens of takes of every scene.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> was {{released}} in 1990 to mixed reviews, but was a success {{at the box office}} and at awards time. It picked up seven Academy Award nominations and won in three of the categories: Best Original Song, Best Makeup and Best Art Direction. A sequel was planned, but a controversy over the film rights ensued between Beatty and Tribune Media Services. The lawsuit was resolved in Beatty's favor in October 2013. However, no plans for a sequel or follow-up have been publicly disclosed. Beatty created The <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> TV Special in 2008, which featured him reprising the character to be interviewed by film critic Leonard Maltin.|$|E

5|$|Disney greenlit <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> in 1988 {{under the}} {{condition}} that Warren Beatty keep the production budget within $25 million, which began to rise once filming started. It quickly jumped to $30 million and then $47 million as its final production budget. Disney spent an additional $54 million on the marketing campaign, resulting in a total of $101 million spent overall. The financing for <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> came from Disney and Silver Screen Partners IV, as well as Beatty's own production company, Mulholland Productions. Disney was originally going to release the film under the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner, but chose instead to release and market the film under the adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures label leading up to the film's theatrical debut, because the studio felt it had too many mature themes for a Disney-branded film.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{had hoped}} <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> would launch a {{successful}} franchise, like the Indiana Jones series, but a disappointing box office performance halted Disney's plans. In addition, executive producers Art Linson and Floyd Mutrux sued Beatty {{shortly after the}} release of the film, alleging that they were owed profit participation from the film.|$|E
5|$|Beatty's {{reputation}} for directorial profligacy—notably with the critically acclaimed Reds (1981), {{did not sit}} well with Disney. As a result, Beatty and Disney reached a contracted agreement whereby any budget overruns on <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> would be deducted from Beatty's fee as producer, director, and star. Beatty and regular collaborator Bo Goldman significantly rewrote the dialogue but lost a Writers Guild arbitration and did not receive screen credit.|$|E

5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy,</b> Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|The Tribune {{believed}} the situation would be settled quickly and was {{confident enough to}} begin developing a <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> live action television series with Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Robert Newmyer and Outlaw Productions. The TV show {{was to have a}} contemporary setting, comparable to Smallville, and Di Bonaventura commented that if the TV show was successful, a feature film would likely follow. However, an August 2005 ruling by federal judge Dean D. Pregerson cleared the way for Beatty to sue the Tribune. The April 2006 hearing ended without a ruling, but in July 2006, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case can go to trial; Tribune's request to end the suit in their favor was rejected. The legal battle between Beatty and the Tribune continued to ensue.|$|E

In addition, Winston was nominated for his visual effects work. Depp was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost to Gérard Depardieu of Green Card. Edward Scissorhands was able to win the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. Danny Elfman, Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, and Atwood received individual nominations. Elfman was also given a Grammy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an {{interest}} in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced; Tummy Trouble played in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown with <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> and Trail Mix-Up was included with A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy,</b> {{directed}} by Warren Beatty {{and based on}} Chester Gould's comic strip. She received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Beatty later appeared in her 1991 documentary, , which showed {{behind the scenes of}} her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. It was the highest-grossing documentary of all time at that point. She also received positive reviews for her role in A League of Their Own (1992), which was centered on a women's baseball team during World War II. In 1993, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which performed poorly at the box office. Her subsequent films saw Madonna take on smaller roles, including a singing telegram girl in Blue in the Face (1995), a witch in Four Rooms (1995), and a phone sex company owner in Spike Lee's Girl 6 (1996). Madonna starred as Eva Perón in the 1996 film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita. Her performance was acclaimed by critics and won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{entered the}} 1990s {{with the release}} of the soundtrack, I'm Breathless (1990), which {{contained}} songs inspired by the film <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy.</b> She also released her first greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection, in the same year. The album has sold more than 30million copies, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist. It also became the second best-selling album by a female artist in the United Kingdom and her second certified diamond album in the United States. In 1991, she signed a $60million recording contract and business deal with Warner Bros. and Time Warner. As part of this, she founded Maverick Records, which became her main record company, with Sire and Warner Bros. as distributors of her music. Her next releases under Maverick were the studio albums, Erotica (1992) and Bedtime Stories (1994), as well as Something to Remember (1995), a collection of Madonna ballads. All of them reached multi-platinum status in the US and achieved commercial success. Her third soundtrack album, from the musical Evita, was released in 1996. The double-disc endeavor was certified five times platinum by the RIAA, recognizing 2.5million shipments throughout the United States. Madonna's seventh studio album, Ray of Light, was released in 1998 and has sold more than 16million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> {{made his}} film debut in <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> (1937), a 15-chapter movie serial by Republic Pictures {{starring}} Ralph Byrd. The Spider Gang {{was on the}} loose, tired of Dick Tracy's cunning skills. Through the 15-chapter serial, 15 different cases were solved, all plots by the Spider Gang. <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> was also in search for his missing brother, Gordon Tracy (Carleton Young). The <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> character proved very popular, and a second serial, <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> Returns, appeared in 1938 (reissued in 1948). Dick Tracy's G-Men was released in 1939 (reissued in 1955). The last was <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> vs. Crime Inc. in 1941 (reissued as <b>Dick</b> <b>Tracy</b> vs. the Phantom Empire in 1952).|$|E
