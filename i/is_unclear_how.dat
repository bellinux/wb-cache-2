A.laevigatum can be also found in temperate Eurasia, but it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> broadly this species is distributed in North America. A.areolatum is originally native in North Africa and Eurasia; it was however distributed through the 20th century in Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa {{as well as in}} South and North America. Only A.ferreum is originally native in the tropics and {{is common in}} Brazil and the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Constantine {{appears to}} have reorganised the border forces along the Danube, {{replacing}} the old-style alae and cohortes with new units of cunei (cavalry) and auxilia (infantry) respectively. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> the new-style units differed from the old-style ones, but those stationed on the border (as opposed {{to those in the}} comitatus) may have been smaller, perhaps half the size. In sectors other than the Danube, old-style auxiliary regiments survived.|$|E

Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> {{much of a}} {{concurrent}} {{increase in}} fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E
5|$|It was Johnson's {{practice}} to avoid interference with military decisions, however he supported Morgan's request for two light artillery pieces that became hallmarks of his command. By contrast, he consistently opposed {{the command of}} General Lloyd Tilghman, trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to have him removed. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> much military influence Johnson wielded in his position as governor, though he enjoyed a cordial relationship {{with most of the}} Confederate generals.|$|E

As late as 1821, {{she wrote to}} the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer, but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the {{leading role in the}} family business.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> common this was.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{played football}} for Mitchell Main {{in the winter}} of 1912â€“13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took their place in the First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> often he represented the club.|$|E

It <b>was</b> also <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> a convicted felon, having already fled prosecution once, was allowed out on bail without first having to surrender his passport. Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous analysis, You and Dodson find Chaoyangsaurus {{to be the most}} basal neoceratopsian, more derived than Psittacosaurus, while Leptoceratopsidae, not Protoceratopsidae, is recovered as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. This study includes Auroraceratops, but lacks seven taxa found in Xu and Makovicky's work, so it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> comparable the two studies are. Asiaceratops and Turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included. Along with Dong Zhiming, You described Magnirostris in 2003, but to date has not included it in any of his cladograms.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> {{initiation}} {{may have}} affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> strong Matilda's {{personal}} piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong {{preference to}} be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs. Like {{other members of the}} Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church. Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established Benedictine monastery of Cluny alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the Victorines and Premonstratensians. As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-VÅ“u near Cherbourg.|$|E

5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had {{no place in the}} Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{appeared}} for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW), in the ECW arena, on March 24, 2001 at March Madness Night 2, {{losing to}} Insane Dragon and Dixie in the opener. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how,</b> if at all, JAPW's {{ownership and management}} worked around Pennsylvania's child labor law, as both brothers were underage {{at the time of}} this and two subsequent appearances in the old ECW arena. They made three other appearances in JAPW in 2001, all against Insane Dragon & Dixie â€“ one a victory, one that ended in a no contest due to outside interference, and the last an unsuccessful challenge for Dragon and Dixie's JAPW Tag Team Championship on June 15 at Here to Stay.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
