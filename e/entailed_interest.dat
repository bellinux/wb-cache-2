We further developed three functional modules, namely “Group”, “Buy & Sell”, and “Forum” modules to provide services related to learning, living, and entertainment. OnCampus can significantly contribute in the following ways: through the creation of social circles based on interests mining, the provision of educational guidance based on emotion analysis, as an information-sharing platform, and by developing a secondary trading platform aimed at the optimal allocation of campus resources.|$|R

After a brief reconstruction of Malinvaud’s argument, it is shown that the result is far less encouraging for neoclassical theory than it might seem. The most important problem is not the fact that change in the interest rate affects the average period of production associated with a technique, despite the concern this aroused in Hicks and Malinvaud, but rather that it affects the ranking of techniques.

40|$|Abstract: We {{determine}} optimal {{monetary policy}} under commitment in a forward-looking New Keynesian model when nominal {{interest rates are}} bounded below by zero. The lower bound represents an occasionally binding constraint that causes the model and optimal policy to be nonlinear. A calibration to the U. S. economy suggests that policy should reduce nominal interest rates more aggressively than suggested by a model without lower bound. Rational agents anticipate the possibility of reaching the lower bound {{in the future and}} this amplifies the effects of adverse shocks well before the bound is reached. While the empirical magnitude of U. S. mark-up shocks seems too small to <b>entail</b> zero nominal <b>interest</b> rates, shocks affecting the natural real interest rate plausibly lead to a binding lower bound. Under optimal policy, however, this occurs quite infrequently and does not imply positive average inflation rates in equilibrium. Interestingly, the presence of binding real rate shocks alters the policy response to (non-binding) mark-up shocks...|$|R

40|$|We {{compute the}} optimal {{non-linear}} interest rate policy under commitment for a forward-looking stochastic model with monopolistic competition and sticky prices when nominal {{interest rates are}} bounded below by zero. When the lower bound binds, the optimal policy {{is to reduce the}} real rate by generating inflation expectations. This is achieved by committing to increase future interest rates by less than what purely forward-looking policy would suggest. As a result, there is a ‘commitment bias’, i. e., average output and inflation turn out to be higher than their target values. Calibrating the model to the US economy we find that the quantitative importance of the average effects on output and inflation are negligible. Moreover, the empirical magnitude of US mark-up shocks is too small to <b>entail</b> zero nominal <b>interest</b> rates. Real rate shocks, however, plausibly lead to a binding lower bound under optimal policy, albeit relatively infrequently. Interestingly, the presence of binding real rate shocks alters the optimal policy response to (non-binding) mark-up shocks.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades the {{scientific}} research has increasingly developed modelling tools to handle problems related to water quantity and quality. Concerning water pollution, modelling approaches have been developed ranging from simple statistical regressions to complex models. Watershed models have been developed firstly to deepen the understanding of water cycle and pollution dynamics, as they provide a simplified conceptualization of the processes involved, {{and then they have}} been progressively more used to evaluate the impacts on water quality of management options, mitigation measures and possible global changes. In addition, models have been employed for planning monitoring network and spatially target plans of intervention. So far modelling has been exclusively used by the scientific and practitioner communities. However, there is a shift to a combined used of models by the scientific, practitioner and stakeholders. Effective scientific research needs to address questions relevant for stakeholders and decision makers and to include their values and perspectives in the knowledge production process. This idea is at the basis of the participatory watershed modelling. Differently from the traditional one, participatory watershed modelling includes public and decision makers in the modelling process to support decisions involving complex environmental questions. Participatory modelling acts as platform for dialogue and integration between scientists, stakeholders and policy makers. For these reasons it results particularly pertinent to the objectives of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). A way to involve public participation in the water management is the development and use of scenarios. The development of scenarios and their evaluation through participatory watershed modelling involve many challenges, related to the choice and application of the modelling approach, the availability of data and adequate monitoring network, the practical involvement of stakeholders and the whole planning and implementation of the iterative process, which <b>entails</b> contrasting <b>interests</b> and communication barriers.

In his autobiographical essays from Der König verneigt sich und tötet (2003) and Immer derselbe Schnee und immer derselbe Onkel (2011), the anamnesis focusing the personal history as part of “the great history” – both being deeply influenced by the experience of terror displayed by the “cannibal” and mnemophobic ideology – is permanently backed up by the meditation on the totalitarian mechanisms (social, psychological, ideological). The main point of <b>interest</b> <b>entailed</b> by the identity discourse – generating an exemplary history – is different from “self-edification”, pointing to the revival of “another time when I have always wondered about what is mere happening and what framing up in my own life” [Müller, 2011 : 42], to the construction of a critical “meta-history” focusing the theme of mentally and behaviourally re- shaping the intellectual portrayed as “totalitarian subject. ” Being more than an existential testimony, Herta Müller's autobiographical essays play a radiographic role for the period, equally interpreting a history of terror - her approach is totally justified, as the author strongly believes that the socio-cultural context mirrors the Communist past from a political and ideological perspective...|$|R

40|$|This mixed-method {{analysis}} of three Nigerian states explores {{the ways in}} which a major policy shift has produced short-term peace outcomes in a vastly contested terrain <b>entailing</b> conflicting <b>interests.</b> The central argument of 2 ̆ 2 Paths to Peacebuilding, 2 ̆ 2 is that disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration can create peace in resource-conflicted societies when there is governmental will and community and citizen involvement in both the design and implementation of the program. The overriding concern was whether the DDR process was capable of contributing to tangible improvements in real and perceived safety on the ground as well as destroying the structures that both contributed to and sustained insurgency for over two decades. The disarmament process yielded over 3, 000 semi- and fully automatic weapons and other military style hardware. It also resulted in the demobilization of over 26, 000 former fighters. The DDR program generated important but geographically differentiated reductions in militant violence across the three states studied. The study analyzes survey and interview data from a random sample of 346 combatants and ex-combatants and other knowledgeable informants in three Niger Delta states - Rivers, Delta, and Bayelsa. The dissertation compared DDR success rates between individuals who entered the DDR program and those who did not. An examination of the programming determinants, controlling for non-programmatic factors including community exposure to pollution reveals some evidence of macro success and micro failure. While the program has created a new sense of peace that allows oil corporations to continue oil production unhindered leading to increased oil earnings for the Nigerian state, there is lack of local level support for the program or its participants. For example, findings of significant association between participation in the program and the successful disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants are moderated by participation effects. While evidence of some level of macro success is clearly indicated in addition to some level of impact on the lives of program participants, the failure to adequately link DDR to broad economic and social development programs may obviate the tentative gains made and plunge the region into potentially more devastating rounds of violent insurgency and counter-insurgency...|$|R
5000|$|Elasticity {{is defined}} as the degree of receptiveness in demand and supply in {{relation}} to fluctuations in price. If a curve is more elastic then lesser alterations in price will result to a higher change in quantity used up. If a curve is less elastic it will then cause higher deviations in price to affect a change in amount consumed. Price elasticity of demand is the extent of responsiveness in quantity demanded in relation to price. Utility on the other hand is the amount of contentment resulting from the consumption of a commodity or services at a particular period. Utility is a psychological satisfaction not inherent. It is dependent on the persons own subjective approximate of satisfaction to be acquired from the consumption of a commodity. Utility is further divided into marginal utility, total utility and maximizing utility. Marginal utility refers to the extra utility resulting from the consumption of one extra unit of a commodity, the consumption {{of the rest of the}} goods remaining unaffected. Total utility is refers to as the number of units of utility that a consumer gains from consuming a given quantity of a good, service, or activity during a particular time period. The greater a consumers total utility, the larger the customer’s level of consumption.The cost to any firm of producing any output evidently depends upon the physical amounts of real resources. For instance material, labour and machine hours used in production. As the larger output needs a larger amount of resources, the total cost for larger output becomes high. Whereas the smaller output requires the smaller resources. The total cost for smaller output becomes smaller. A company can produce at lower cost when it produces better new techniques to products. Production with traditional and old method implicates high cost. The maximisation of returns includes the use of a definite technique to produce that can facilitate the optimal combination of factors. Production cost {{is defined as}} the expenditures by a business in producing a commodity. There are several kinds of cost concepts, these are marginal cost, total cost and average cost.Total is the cost of producing a certain output of the product in question. Total cost can be classified into variable cost and fixed cost. Fixed costs is also known as overhead cost. These are costs which do not differ with output. The costs will be the same whether the output is ten or twenty or a thousand of a product. Fixed costs <b>entails</b> <b>interest</b> on bank loans, depreciation of machinery, insurance charges and rent of factory. Variable costs are also called prime cost. Variable costs differ with alterations in output. The greater the output, the bigger the variable costs. Average cost is the cost of each unit of output and is achieved by dividing the total cost by the level of output. It is further divided into two parts, average fixed cost and average variable cost.Marginal cost {{is defined as the}} extra cost incurred by increasing output by one unit. It is the added cost of producing an additional unit of output. Perfect competition is a market structure in which the following characteristics are met. All businesses trade the same commodity, all firms will have a comparatively small market share, all firms are price takers meaning they cannot control the market price of their goods, the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit, and buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm.Perfect competition is a hypothetical market structure. Under perfect competition there are numerous buyers and sellers and prices reveal supply and demand. Customers will have several substitutes when the commodity they wish to buy quality begins to reduce or if it becomes more expensive. News firms can as well simply enter the market, leading to an extra competition.Monopoly on the other hand is where there is only one supplier in the market. For the reasons of regulation, monopoly power occurs where a single business owns 25% or more of a particular market. Monopolies can form for a number of reasons. For example, government can grant a business monopoly powers, if a firm has exclusive ownership of a limited resource, producers may have patents over designs for instance, giving them rights to trade a good or a service and a merger of two or more firms would create a monopoly. Monopolies have basic characteristics such as, they can maintain super normal returns in the long run, a monopolist with no substitute would be able to develop the greatest monopoly power and with no close substitutes, the monopolist can therefore derive supernormal profits.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOne {{of the most}} important yet insufficiently researched dynamics of the European Union (EU) concerns its effectiveness in accommodating the security concerns of its members. With NATO dominating the collective security market of the old continent, the launch of the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) in 1999 generated an interesting security option, and silently partitioned the NATO members of the EU into a "euro-atlanticist" and a "euro-continentalist" group, with the nonduplication of NATO being the point of contention. With Greece's major security concern deriving from Turkey, a fellow NATO member, Athens holds a firm position in the latter group, seeking to turn the evolving European defense project into a counterweight to NATO in guaranteeing Greek national security. While Greek security priorities have remained remarkably consistent, the ambitious European defense project has undergone various fluctuations, reflecting the awkward development in its evolution. As a consequence, Greece's anticipations of a CSDP commitment in its national security concerns have oscillated accordingly: periods of positive signs succeeded periods of disillusionment and vice versa. Against this background, this paper attempts to elucidate Greek perceptions of its security providers and aims to give an answer to the following question: Are Greek security concerns reflected in the CSDP? In other words, is the EU an adequate security provider for Greece? This thesis argues that the territorial security concerns of the EU's member-states, especially those of Greece, cannot be fully assuaged under the CSDP auspices. More specifically, the CSDP does not adequately address Greek national interests, if defending these <b>interests</b> <b>entails</b> a European military response. Outstanding Thesi...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the discussion of how to design collaborative forms for urban commons. It does so by bridging the commons field with the participatory design tradition, which has almost 40 years of experiences in exploring and reflecting on the practicalities {{as well as the}} political aspects of collaboration among actors with diverse interest. In the growing discussion about urban commons, it has been pointed out how in designing collaborative forms for their management Ostrom’s design principles might not hold, due to the difference between urban commons and traditional commons (Foster 2011, Harvey 2011). Urban commons entail an active role of public authorities and they gather participants who have different understandings and perspectives over the commons. Diversity in participants’ <b>interests</b> <b>entails</b> a higher risk for ossification, meaning that a stable management form might hinder rather than support collaboration (Daniels 2007, Foster 2011). By building on Participatory Design theory and reflecting on three cases of collaborative management forms in Malmö (Sweden), the paper discusses how the notions of commoning and agonism might be at play in the design of collaborative forms for urban commons. The notion of commoning entails to understand collective use and management of commons as a located and ongoing socio-material practice that requires the creation of management forms able to change and evolve in time in relation to the diversity of interests. The notion of agonism, on the other hand, focuses on articulating the political dimension of commoning, that entails to consider to which extent diversity is present in the collaboration and how it could be further nurtured. The paper does not provide a definitive answer to how these collaborative forms are to be designed but it stresses the importance of considering both the practicalities as well as the political aspects of collaboration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{number of}} {{activities}} in aeronautical engineering {{rely on the}} availability of models to represent the real behavior of the aircraft. Let us quote, for example, the development of autopilots and synthesis of flight control laws, the study of the handling qualities, the fault monitoring process, the prediction of hazardous behaviors, or the implementation of simulators used to train the pilots and to validate hardware and software systems. The initial modeling derived from CFD, wind tunnel or ground tests is seldom reliable enough with respect to the requirements. Hence, the needed accuracy is finally achieved thanks to suitable identification techniques and to a set of peculiar flight tests. In addition, the complexity of the models has increased in recent years, along with more stringent accuracy requirements to satisfy the raising constraints of the new aeronautical devices which make use of these models; e. g., an increasing number of vibration modes in the low frequency range for flexible aircraft, or a larger complexity and non-linearity of the aerodynamical models in the rigid case. Hence, the variety of problems and models under consideration <b>entails</b> taking an <b>interest</b> {{in a wide range of}} identification techniques. These include basic methods, like least-squares or maximum likelihood and their variants, spectral analysis and estimators based on Kalman filtering, as well as more recent approaches like neural-based or subspace methods. Special care is given to the frequency domain formulation of the algorithms, especially in the flexible A/C case. Most of these methods are not directly usable as they are and need to be adapted to the peculiarities of aeronautics. Accordingly, this paper reviews the various issues related to the identification process when applied to such applications. These steps include data pre-processing, input design, time vs. frequency domain methods, model validation, etc., and are illustrated by industrial problems dealt with by Onera, for rigid as well as for flexible A/C modeling...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate over}} whether it serves or {{undermines}} the interests of justice for lawyers to temper the zeal of their advocacy based on considerations of morality or justice has largely been polarized between two camps: traditionalists and moralists. Traditionalists defend the amoral role of lawyers, arguing that lawyers should remain moral neutral in their representation of clients. Moralists propose alternative social justice lawyering models, which urge lawyers 2 ̆ 7 morally engagement in their choice of clients, their interpretation of law, and their counseling of clients. This article revisits the debate by recasting the question at its center. Instead of inquiring what a lawyer should do when asked to assist an immoral client, it asks what a lawyer should do when asked to assist a client with whom the lawyer fundamentally morally disagrees. By shifting the question, this article focuses attention on a subject that has been largely missing from the debate among lawyering theorists: the challenge of moral pluralism. Moral pluralism has been widely discussed in political and moral philosophy, but its implications for lawyering theory have been less fully explored. This article explores those implications by surveying what political and moral theorists say about the sources of moral pluralism, and demonstrating how those explanations lead {{to the creation of}} an internal moral perspective. The article then uses this analysis to examine the shortcomings of both the traditional model of morally neutral lawyering, and the alternative social justice lawyering models, in the face of moral pluralism. The shortcomings of each model are illustrated by applying each model to a hypothetical lawyer-client relationship in which a lesbian couple, hoping to duplicate the legal protections of marriage for the child they plan to parent together, seeks legal counsel from a lawyer who is morally opposed to homosexuality. The better alternative, proposed in this article, is to view fundamental moral disagreements as moral conflicts of interest, subject to the same protections for clients that traditional conflicts of <b>interest</b> <b>entail.</b> Although the building blocks for a moral conflict of interest analysis are already present in professional standards, the bar has been reluctant to fully embrace the idea of moral conflicts of interest. Underlying the bar 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance is a concern that permitting lawyers the prerogative of moral abstention will deleteriously affect representation for politically unpopular clients. However, the existence of moral pluralism also alleviates the concern that lawyers will act in moral concert, thus eliminating the logical aspects of the last lawyer in town problem, and leaving only logistical concerns with the provision of legal counsel...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the credit crunch in the {{aftermath}} of the Asian crisis has stimulated much debate. Indeed, some features of the East Asian economies, such as bank-based financial systems and high leverage, make them particularly vulnerable to monetary and financial shocks. Under such circumstances, the credit channel of transmission of these shocks is likely to lead to a credit crunch, affecting the flow of bank loans to those agents [...] households and small and medium-sized enterprises [...] for whom close substitutes for bank credit are unavailable. In turn, the disruption to the availability of finance for bank-dependent borrowers may stymie economic activity. In practice, however, it is difficult to detect the credit channel effects that lead to a credit crunch. Reliance on trends of credit aggregates alone is inadequate to prove that there has been an adverse shift in the supply of loans: even a decline or slowdown of credit could stem from a decrease or deceleration in demand. A frequently used methodology to overcome this problem focuses on both credit aggregates and the yield spread between bank loans and risk-free assets, such as government bonds. If this spread rises while credit aggregates slow down, one can conjecture that the supply of loans has either decreased more or increased less than demand. But further qualification is needed. The increase of the spread might simply reflect a rising risk premium triggered by the fact that the negative shock reduces the net worth of economic agents because of larger financial outlays. Accordingly, the relevant spread to capture the worsening credit conditions that affect bank-dependent borrowers is the spread between bank lending rates and corporate bonds. The yield spread corporate and government bonds measures the general risk premium. The study applies this methodology to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand, and shows that the credit crunch is widespread, while its negative impact particularly affects small banks and enterprises. On the basis of the findings, the authors claim that 1) a protracted and heavy reliance on tight monetary policy, <b>entailing</b> high real <b>interest</b> rates, appears inappropriate for restoring market confidence; 2) it is desirable to consider alternative policy instruments that do not place further stress on the banking sector and on its lending to the corporate sector; and 3) policy actions are warranted to alleviate the strain that the crisis has put on small banks and enterprises.

40|$|In a world {{characterized}} by increased global competition, and {{a rapidly changing}} business environment, companies and organization are forced to continuously reevaluate how they work. Since the first systematic studies of manual labor began during the last century, the focus have changed from a strict control of employees toward looser organizations, increased globalization, {{and the emergence of}} HRM-Human Resource Management during the 80 ’s. Research shows that employee compensation can account for as much as 70 - 80 percent of companies cost,but also show that the value of a company’s human capital can significantly affect the market value of the company. Studies also show that managers see non-monetary reward and recognition systems as very effective in reaching eight out of ten organizational objectives. Another problem facing international companies is establishing themselves in cultures vastly different from their own, in regards to organizational as well as national cultures being different. A company that has been highly regarded and are among the most valued companies in the world is General Electric, which established themselves in Sweden and Umeå when Amersham became GE Healthcare n 2004. This background led us to our problem formulation: How does GE Healthcare in Umeå use Reward and Recognition strategies and how do their co-workers perceive these strategies with a focus on motivation and jobsatisfaction? And our purpose: We want to examine potential gaps between evidence and practice on Reward and Recognition Strategies. Furthermore we want to develop and understanding of how co-workers perceive these strategies. We have chosen to use a case study to examine GE Healthcare Umeå, and we have interviewed twelve respondents, both managers, white-collar and blue-collar workers. We are using a hermeneutic stance, and our interviews are semi-structured and qualitative in approach. Furthermore we are using an abductive research process in performing our case study. We have chosen to use a theoretical framework based on soft and hard HRM, reward and recognition strategies, and motivation and job satisfaction. We found that GE is highly focused on individual reward and recognition systems, but that they have to some extent adapted to the Swedish collective working culture. GE Healthcare is still in a transition phase in Umeå, and we found that there are some dissatisfaction primarily amongst blue-collar workers with the new organizational structure and culture. Feedback and communication was seen as {{the most important factor in}} affecting motivation and job satisfaction, and this was seen as lacking, especially amongst blue-collar workers. We think that this will most likely change over time, as GE’s Session C and EMS systems are implemented throughout the organization and the communication has been further developed. Taking into consideration the loss of perspectives that our anonymity <b>entails</b> and the <b>interest</b> of the topic as such, we think that it would be interesting to conduct a more extensive study of GE Healthcare, two to three years from now...|$|R
