5|$|Meibomian glands, in the <b>eyelids,</b> secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the <b>eyelids</b> from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the <b>eyelids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the <b>eyelids,</b> nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the <b>eyelids</b> are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E

40|$|The gross {{anatomy of}} the lower <b>eyelid</b> is {{analogous}} {{to that of the}} upper <b>eyelid,</b> however, the lower <b>eyelid</b> has a more simplified structure with less dynamic movement. Common malpositions of the lower <b>eyelid</b> include entropion and ectropion, rehabilitative surgery of which requires a thorough understanding of lower <b>eyelid</b> anatomy. Furthermore, precise anatomic knowledge is a prerequisite for both reconstructive and cosmetic lower <b>eyelid</b> surgery in order for it to be performed appropriately. In this review, we present the clinical {{anatomy of the}} structures of the lower <b>eyelid,</b> as well as highlighting relevant surgical implications. Featured here are the structure of the different <b>eyelid</b> lamellae, the lower <b>eyelid</b> retractors and their relations, the orbital septum, fat pad compartments, and Lockwood ligament...|$|R

40|$|The lower <b>eyelid</b> {{retractors}} {{consist of}} double layers, the posterior layer {{of which is}} the main tractional component. Therefore, shortening of the posterior layer of the lower <b>eyelid</b> retractors causes lower <b>eyelid</b> retraction or cicatricial entropion. Based on this concept, we report a modified lower <b>eyelid</b> lengthening surgery involving complete recession of the posterior layer of the lower <b>eyelid</b> retractors by way of a transcutaneous approach that leaves the palpebral conjunctiva intact and inserts ear cartilage as a rigid spacer between the lower edge of the tarsal plate and the recessed anterior layer of the lower <b>eyelid</b> retractors. This procedure completely extirpated the preoperative maladjusted states of lower <b>eyelid</b> retraction and cicatricial entropion. Our procedure also prevented postoperative discomfort of the ocular surface due to the intact palpebral conjunctiva. As well, lower <b>eyelid</b> mobility and contour were good and within their respective permissible ranges. The lower <b>eyelid</b> lengthening surgery focusing on the posterior layer of the lower <b>eyelid</b> retractors using auricular cartilage via a transcutaneous approach is a useful procedure for lower <b>eyelid</b> retraction or cicatricial entropion...|$|R

40|$|Importance Transcutaneous lower <b>eyelid</b> {{blepharoplasty}} is {{a commonly}} performed procedure with a postoperative risk of <b>eyelid</b> malposition. Objective To quantify {{the change in}} lower <b>eyelid</b> position after transcutaneous lower <b>eyelid</b> blepharoplasty. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective medical record review describes patients who underwent transcutaneous blepharoplasty at a private facial plastic surgery practice. Patients with less than 3 months of follow-up, a history of periocular trauma, and concurrent midface lift were excluded. Interventions Bilateral skin-muscle flap lower <b>eyelid</b> blepharoplasties with possible tarsorrhaphy, canthopexy, or canthoplasty as indicated. Main Outcomes and Measures Lower <b>eyelid</b> position determined by measurement of preoperative and postoperative pupil to <b>eyelid</b> and lateral limbus to <b>eyelid</b> distances. Results Data from 100 consecutive patients (mean age, 56. 7 years; 92 female [92. 0 %]) undergoing bilateral skin-muscle flap lower <b>eyelid</b> blepharoplasty were analyzed. The mean increase in distance was 0. 33 mm (95 % CI, 0. 24 - 0. 42 mm) from the pupil to the lower <b>eyelid</b> margin and 0. 32 mm (95 % CI, 0. 23 - 0. 41 mm) from the lateral limbus to the lower <b>eyelid</b> margin at final follow-up. For both measurements, patients undergoing concurrent canthopexy had a significantly greater change in <b>eyelid</b> position (P[*]<[*]. 001). Men had a greater change in the distance of pupil to lower <b>eyelid</b> compared with women (0. 76 mm; 95 % CI, 0. 44 - 1. 08 mm, vs 0. 30 mm; 95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 39 mm, respectively; P[*]=[*]. 008) at final follow-up. Two patients required revision procedures secondary to <b>eyelid</b> malposition, and 25 patients had new onset of dry eye symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance Transcutaneous skin-muscle lower <b>eyelid</b> blepharoplasty with selective performance of canthoplasty or canthopexy causes a small, predictable <b>eyelid</b> position change in this population with a low rate of revision procedures.

50|$|<b>Eyelid</b> {{revision}} is {{a procedure}} that involves correcting or addressing any issues that have arisen from a previous <b>eyelid</b> surgery. The surgery {{is more difficult to}} perform and is more complicated than an initial <b>eyelid</b> revision surgery, since the site of the procedure has been operated on before. The reasons for <b>eyelid</b> revision surgeries include contour abnormalities, asymmetry and unusually high <b>eyelid</b> height. The procedure is known to have more complications and issues than initial <b>eyelid</b> surgeries due to the presence of excess scar tissue at the surgery site.|$|R

5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the <b>eyelids.</b> The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the <b>eyelids.</b> There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E

30|$|We {{present a}} facial {{wearable}} robot to support <b>eyelid</b> movement {{for patients with}} hemifacial paralysis. People with facial paralysis {{are not able to}} blink, which leads to dry eyes and could cause permanent damage to the cornea. To address this issue, we developed a robotic system to support <b>eyelid</b> movement on the paralyzed side based on voluntary <b>eyelid</b> movement on the healthy side. The robot has a novel mechanism for supporting <b>eyelid</b> movement and is made from soft material, which we call the <b>eyelid</b> gating mechanism (ELGM). We defined the requirements for <b>eyelid</b> manipulation. Then, we introduced design rules for the ELGM based on this definition, and conducted a deformation analysis. As a result, we could control deformation so that it is tailored to <b>eyelid</b> movement with simple rotational input at two hinged ends. This system provides appropriate support for <b>eyelid</b> movement in a non-invasive and gentle manner, based on voluntary <b>eyelid</b> movement on the healthy side. In this paper, we present a performance evaluation of the developed ELGM and the wearable facial robot. We confirm that ELGM could aid <b>eyelid</b> closure in 8 out of 10 patients. Further, we find that the time lag between <b>eyelid</b> closure detection and completion was 236.9 ¬± 19.4 ms.|$|R

40|$|Year] doi: 10. 1136 / bjophthalmol- 2014 - 305101 Aims To {{establish}} the novel {{concept of a}} functional <b>eyelid</b> centre to determine the optimal point for <b>eyelid</b> lifting in ptosis surgery. Methods This was a prospective study of 112 patients with congenital ptosis. The functional <b>eyelid</b> centre {{was defined as the}} point where the <b>eyelid</b> contour showed the best appearance when the upper <b>eyelid</b> was lifted manually. In patients who underwent frontalis suspension surgery using silicone rods, the postoperative outcome was assessed according to the fixation point of the rod. Results The average horizontal fissure width and the distance from the medial canthus to the mid-pupillary line were 21. 9 and 10. 1 mm, respectively. The functional <b>eyelid</b> centre was located 4. 28 ¬± 0. 98 mm temporal to the mid-pupillary line. The outcomes of silicone rod surgeries were excellent when the rod was fixated 4. 4 mm nasal and 3. 9 mm temporal from the functional <b>eyelid</b> centre. These positions corresponded to 0. 1 mm nasal and 8. 2 mm temporal from the mid-pupillary line. Conclusions The functional <b>eyelid</b> centre was located slightly temporal to the mid-pupillary line. A better <b>eyelid</b> contour in ptosis surgery is produced when <b>eyelid</b> lifting is centred around the functional <b>eyelid</b> centre...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} and {{present the results}} of a new surgical technique for patients with floppy <b>eyelid</b> syndrome, based on the medial upper <b>eyelid</b> stretching encountered in this condition. Methods: A case series of 24 patients with floppy <b>eyelid</b> syndrome who where found to have symptomatic predominately medial upper <b>eyelid</b> laxity was analyzed. The history, clinical features, histopathology, and outcome were reviewed after patients underwent medial upper <b>eyelid</b> shortening with or without upper <b>eyelid</b> skin reduction as the first surgical procedure. Results: Of the 24 patients, 18 were men (75 %) with a mean age at referral of 56 years, having ocular discomfort and conjunctival irritation/papillary conjunctivitis as the main complaints at presentation. Obesity was present in 96 % of cases, with lower <b>eyelid</b> laxityl/ectropion (50 %) and upper <b>eyelid</b> eyelash ptosis (29 %) in conjunction with the upper <b>eyelid</b> laxity. The affected side was related to sleeping habits or recurrent mechanical <b>eyelid</b> trauma. Histologic studies showed a nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltrate and loss of elastin with loose dermal connective tissue. After surgery, complete relief of ocular symptoms and good functional and cosmetic results were present in all cases after 18 months of follow-up. Conclusions: This new surgical approach is based on the presence of predominately medial upper laxity in patients with floppy <b>eyelid</b> syndrome. The excision of this stretched area stabilized the upper <b>eyelid</b> in an anatomic fashion, providing a good and stable long-term result. The possible mechanisms involved in the medial upper <b>eyelid</b> stretching are discussed...|$|R
