40|$|Abstract. White light {{interferometry}} {{has become}} an important method for measuring micro surface profiles with a long vertical range and nano-scale resolution. However, environmental vibration encountered in in-field optical inspection is usually unavoidable and it affects measurement performance significantly. Isolating vibration sources from the measurement system sometimes is not completely effective, especially within complicated in-field fabrication environment. Therefore, in this research we aim to develop a novel method in achieving white-light fringe-locking condition during vertical scanning processes. The developed optical system consists of white light source, a Mirau objective, a PZT vertical scanner, an optical band-pass filter and two <b>image</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>devices.</b> The developed system generates a high and a low coherent interferograms, simultaneously captured by two charged coupled devices (CCDs). The high coherent interferogram is employed to detect high-speed nano-scale displacement {{and direction of the}} external vibration. An innovative real time fringe-locking operation is performed and a new vertical scanning technique is performed accordingly to isolate vertical scanning from environmental disturbances. The feasibility of the anti-vibration VSI system is verified by performing some of industrial in-field examples. Based on the experimenta...|$|R

There are two widely used methods for moving object extraction: the frame differencing method and the background subtraction method. Although the background subtraction method usually generates superior results to the frame differencing method, {{it is difficult to}} implement this method in a VLSI because of the processing time, power consumption and hardware resources required for background image generation. In this paper, we propose a functional cell circuit that per-forms the background subtraction based on a merged analog-digital architecture. The operation of background subtraction circuit which is designed by using 0. 35 µm transistor parameters is verified by PSPICE simulation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} result of a pilot study using the author’s innovative real-time imageprocessing technology to reduce intersection traffic impacts including road crashes, air pollution andexcessive fuel consumption which arose as a result of long intersection delays. Implementation of thenew technology has resulted in substantial reductions in the number of traffic crashes, traffic pollutionand vehicle fuel consumption at these intersections. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} develop a new and innovative ITS technology for addressingtraffic impacts at signalized intersections caused by long delays; these impacts include intersectiontraffic crashes, traffic pollutions and wasteful fuel consumption. Specific objectives are to study theoptimization of cycle times under traffic synchronization, queue length, initial speed and final speedduring lane changing lane associated with the existing traffic signal control at the two adjacentintersections, to study drivers’ behaviour at intersection, such as red light running, speed anddangerous lane changing with the objective of reducing the number of crashes, to develop an ITStechnology including video <b>image</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> and new software for capturing vehicles passing anintersection and capable of counting 5 vehicle types for use in the calculation of PCU from newmodel,the technology also include the concept of trigger of virtual loop detector which can help toreduce the cycle times and improve the associated traffic control by traffic synchronization togetherwith another software. As a result, the intersection traffic impact such as speeding and lane changingbehaviour are mitigated, to study the effects of the implemented ITS technology on traffic impacts atthe case study intersections including the reduction in number of traffic crashes, reduced level oftraffic pollution and reduced fuel consumption and to study and produce a new hardware (InterfaceCard) for use with a traffic controller which can link the developed software with any trafficcontrollers in Thailand. This research is useful for Thai drivers as they can benefit from reduced travel times and feweraccidents after the complete installation of the ITS Technology. In addition, the researcher hasdeveloped a new set of equations for use by Thai traffic engineers in the study of environmentalimpact from traffic congestion at intersections based on the Stop and Go conditions. In case of fuelconsumption, the amount of fuel consumption between before and after situation decreasesubstantially.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} silicon (a-Si:H) thin film transistors (TFTs) {{are used as}} switching elements in large area active matrix liquid crystal displays and various <b>image</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>devices</b> for radiation detection. The noise inherent in the a-Si:H TFTs contributes to the overall noise figure of such devices and degrades the signal to noise ratio; therefore, the noise {{is an important factor}} in the design of the devices. The noise of the a-Si:H TFTs has been studied experimentally, but the origin of the noise is not understood. This work calculates the noise of the a-Si:H TFTs based on a simulation of operation of the TFTs and the hypothesis that the device noise is due to the intrinsic noise of the a-Si:H material. An a-Si:H TFT with an inverted-staggered structure has been simulated by numerically solving the fundamental transport equations for various gate and drain-source voltages. The drain-source curves derived from the simulation agree qualitatively with the experimental results: both the linear and saturated regions are observed. The low frequency noise was calculated based on the charge density distribution in the channel obtained from the simulation and the known dependence of the noise in the a-Si:H on the charge density, Hooge’s relation. The calculated noise power increases with the drain-source voltage and is inversely proportional to the gate voltage or the effective channel length. The curves agree qualitatively with the experimental results. The calculated noise power agrees quantitatively with the experiments when the scaling parameter in Hooge’s relation,, is set to. This value agrees with the experimentally determined value for a-Si:H. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the low frequency noise in the a-Si:H TFTs is due to the material itself...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{developing}} Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) {{is represented by the}} optimal utilisation of fertilisers and herbicidal to reduce the impact of Nitrates in soils and the environment. In traditional agriculture practises, these substances were provided to the soils through the use of chemical products (inorganic/organic fertilizers, soil improvers/conditioners, etc.), usually associated to several major environmental problems, such as: water pollution and contamination, fertilizer dependency, soil acidification, trace mineral depletion, over-fertilization, high energy consumption, contribution to climate change, impacts on mycorrhizas, lack of long-term sustainability, etc. For this reason, the agricultural market is more and more interested in the utilisation of organic fertilisers and soil improvers. Among organic fertilizers, there is an emerging interest for the digestate, a sub-product resulting from anaerobic digestion (AD) processes. Several studies confirm the high properties of digestate if used as organic fertilizer and soil improver/conditioner. Digestate, in fact, is somehow similar to compost: AD converts a major part of organic nitrogen to ammonia, which is then directly available to plants as nitrogen. In this paper, new analytical tools, based on HyperSpectral <b>Imaging</b> (HSI) <b>sensing</b> <b>devices,</b> and related detection architectures, is presented and discussed in order to define and apply simple to use, reliable, robust and low cost strategies finalised to define and implement innovative smart detection engines for digestate characterization and monitoring. This approach is finalized to utilize this “waste product” as a valuable organic fertilizer and soil conditioner, in a reduced impact and an “ad hoc” soil fertilisation perspective. Furthermore, the possibility to contemporary utilize the HSI approach to realize a real time physicalchemical characterisation of agricultural soils (i. e. nitrogen, phosphorus, etc., detection) could allow to set up “real time” selective fertilization strategies in order to obtain a safer culture production...|$|R
