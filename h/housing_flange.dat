50|$|The actual year of {{manufacture}} of any particular Lanchester can be found stamped in small almost indistinguishable numbers next to the crossed flags military proof mark {{on the top of}} the rearmost magazine <b>housing</b> <b>flange.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1965, the 200 engines were {{upgraded}} to seven main bearings to reduce harmonic vibrations and increase durability. The 1965 and later engine {{can be identified}} by five freeze (core) plugs {{on the side of}} the block and the casting code C5DE-H. Starting in 1966, a six-bolt bell <b>housing</b> <b>flange</b> block was introduced.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1980, {{the block}} was {{redesigned}} with a bell <b>housing</b> <b>flange</b> and a low-mount starter {{that is very}} similar to the small-block Ford V8. This version is easily identified by its low-mounted starter location down by the oil pan rail and {{is referred to as the}} Big Bell 200. The big bell design is uncommon but sought after by I-6 performance enthusiasts because it can be modified to accept a Ford small block V8 six bolt bell housing.|$|E
40|$|Shrink-fit {{stainless-steel}} insert {{in aluminum}} equipment housing allows electrical connectors {{to be replaced}} by soldering, without degrading hermeticity of housing or connector. Welding could destroy electrostatic-sensitive components and harm housing and internal cables. Steel insert avoids problems because connector soldered directly to it rather than welded to <b>housing.</b> Seals between <b>flange</b> and <b>housing,</b> and between connector and flange resistant to leaks, even after mechanical overloading and thermal shocking...|$|R
40|$|Examination {{revealed}} that misalignment {{in the assembly}} of the bearing resulted in the failure. Evidences suggest that {{the distance between the}} bearing <b>housing</b> and the <b>flange</b> of the shaft was smaller than that of the permissible limit. This has resulted in sliding of the balls on one of the shoulders of the groove of the inner and outer races. Because of this, there was severe stressing of the cage material leading to fracturing of the cage. Once this failure occurred, the balls and the outer race came out of the bearing assembly. No material abnormalities in the bearing assembly were responsible for the failur...|$|R
40|$|An inlet {{interface}} flange, inlet diffuser, fuel struts and nozzles, combustor liner, liner <b>housing</b> and exhaust <b>flange</b> {{comprise a}} system to be installed in an existing test facility. The system was designed for operation at 40 atmospheres inlet pressure, 900 K inlet temperature, and air flow to 80 kg/sec. Six penetrations are provided in the outer pressure housing. Adapters at the penetrations, permit use of various types of radiation instrumentation. Five total radiation radiometers and two heat flux gases were installed. Rotating exhaust instrumentation {{can also be used}} to determine combustor performance. Data are presented showing total radiation at three axial positions of the combustor, and comparison of total radiation with data from a heat flux gage...|$|R
40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} (POD) turbopump concept was reviewed and finalized. The basis for the POD was the configuration presented in the Aerojet proposal. After reviewing this proposal concept, several modifications were made. These modifications include the following: (1) the dual pump discharge arrangement was changed to a single discharge; (2) commonality of the turbine inlet manifold with the advanced launch system (ALS) liquid oxygen (LOX) TPA was dropped for this program; (3) the turbine <b>housing</b> <b>flange</b> arrangement was improved by relocating {{it away from the}} first stage nozzles; (4) a ten percent margin (five percent diameter increase) was built into the impeller design to ensure meeting the required discharge pressure without the need for increasing speed; (5) a ten percent turbine power margin was imposed which is to be obtained by increasing turbine inlet pressure if required; and (6) the backup concept, {{as an alternative to the}} use of cast impellers, now incorporates forged/machined shrouded impellers, rather than the unshrouded type originally planned...|$|E
40|$|Cracks at {{the seal}} fillet flange and the strut pilot groove of primary turbine drain {{passage of the}} space shuttle main engine (SSME) high {{pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) were observed and reported. Stress information for critical structural components in the SSME under actual conditions is necessary for design and life prediction analysis. However, little information is available about the stress distribution at this location under various combinations of loadings and environments. Thus, a stress analysis was conducted to determine an influence of the various operation and installation loads on the stresses of the HPOTP main mounting flange. To do this, a 3 -D finite element model of the HPOTP housing was generated. A fairly comfortable margin of stresses at the flange fillet with respect to the yield stress of Inconel 718 is shown. However, it was revealed that the bending stress arising from the <b>housing</b> <b>flange</b> bolt preloads could significantly affect the stress distribution at the strut pilot groove of primary turbine drain passage in the HPOTP housing. Consequently, the information obtained from the present 3 -D analysis results should be useful in guiding the development of the SSME HPOTP...|$|E
50|$|Rotary feeders {{are ideal}} for {{pollution}} control applications in wood, grain, food, textile, paper, tobacco, rubber, and paint industries, the Standard Series works beneath dust collectors and cyclone separators even with high temperatures and different pressure differentials. Rotary valves are available with square or round inlet and outlet <b>flanges.</b> <b>Housing</b> can be fabricated out of sheet material or cast. Common materials are cast iron, carbon steel, 304 SS, 316 SS, and other materials.Rotary airlock feeders are often available in standard and heavy duty models, the difference being the head plate and bearing configuration. Heavy duty models use an outboard bearing in which the bearings are moved out away from the head plate.Housing inlet and discharge configurations are termed drop-thru or side entry.Different wear protections are available such as hard chrome or ceramic plating on the inner housing surfaces.Grease and air purge fittings are often provided to prevent contaminants from entering the packing seals.|$|R
