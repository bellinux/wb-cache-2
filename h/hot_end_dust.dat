When heat {{is applied to the}} <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> a pressure builds up at the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> according to Eq.. This pressure drives the normal component from the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> to the cold end according toHere ηn is the viscosity of the normal component, Z some geometrical factor, and [...] the volume flow. The normal flow is balanced by a flow of the superfluid component from the cold to the <b>hot</b> <b>end.</b> At the end sections a normal to superfluid conversion takes place and vice versa. So heat is transported, not by heat conduction, but by convection. This kind of heat transport is very effective, so the thermal conductivity of He-II is very much better than the best materials. The situation is comparable with heat pipes where heat is transported via gas-liquid conversion. The high thermal conductivity of He-II is applied for stabilizing superconducting magnets such as in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a simple and {{low-cost}} experimental set-up through which science educators can demonstrate the Seebeck effect using a thermocouple and an instrumentation amplifier. The experiment {{can be set up}} and conducted during a 1 -hour laboratory session. When a temperature gradient is introduced along the length of a metal wire, electrons start to diffuse {{from one end to the}} other end of the wire (Chambers, 1977). The direction of electron diffusion depends on the electrical properties of the metal wire. By convention, if electrons diffuse from the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> towards the cool end of the wire, a negative thermoelectric emf is generated in the wire with respect to the <b>hot</b> <b>end.</b> Similarly, if electrons diffuse from the cool <b>end</b> towards the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> of the wire, a positive thermoelectric emf is generated in the wire with respect to the <b>hot</b> <b>end.</b> This phenomenon in metals, known as the Seebeck effect, was first observed by physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck (1770 - 1831). Seebeck observed that when two dissimilar metal wires are formed into a closed loop and its two junctions are held at different temperatures, it has the ability to deflect a galvanometer needle. The phenomenon was later attributed to electrical current through the wires...|$|R

40|$|A {{thermoelectric}} generator (TEG) device which uses solar energy as heat source would achieve higher efficiency {{if there is}} a higher temperature difference between the hot-cold ends. However, higher temperature or higher heat flux being imposed upon the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> will cause strong thermal stress, which will have a negative influence on the life cycle of the thermoelectric module. Meanwhile, in order to get high heat flux, a Fresnel lens is required to concentrate solar energy, which will cause non-uniformity of heat flux on the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> of the TEG and further influence the thermal stress of the device. This phenomenon is very common in solar TEG devices but seldom research work has been reported. In this paper, numerical analysis on the heat transfer and thermal stress performance of a TEG module has been performed considering the variation on the power of the heat flux being imposed upon the hot-end; the influence of non-uniform high heat flux on thermal stress has also been analyzed. It is found that non-uniformity of high heat flux being imposed upon the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> has a significant effect on the thermal stress of TEG and life expectation of the device. Taking the uniformity of 100 % as standard, when the heating uniformity is 70 %, 50 %, 30 %, and 10 %, respectively, the maximum thermal stress of TEG module increased by 3 %, 6 %, 12 %, and 22 % respectively.
