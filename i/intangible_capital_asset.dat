40|$|Abstract Nowadays {{knowledge}} is {{considered as a}} precious and strategic source and also an <b>intangible</b> <b>capital</b> (<b>asset).</b> Social capital {{is one of the}} important factors accelerating the transfer and share of know ledge and information in macro and micro level. Therefore, trust – based communications and interactions and norms among people in developing, creating, and applying knowledge have been emphasized. The {{purpose of this study is}} investigating the fashion of relationship of the impact of social capital on developing the organizational knowledge management in Telecommunication Company of Kashan and the amount of social capital effect (influence) on knowledge management in organization is tested. 96 subjects (people) from among managers and staffers form the statistical body of this study. From the viewpoint of applied purpose and the manner of (data) collection, this is a geodesic descriptive study and of integrative type. The results of co efficiency of correlation are in line with the hypotheses of the study. So it shows that there is a meaningful relationship between knowledge management and social capital and its different dimensions. But the correlation between different dimensions of knowledge management and those of social capital in this company is not at optimal level. The results show that the presented model in this study is approved. Key words Social capital, knowledge management, knowledge creation, knowledge establishment and stabilit...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} knowledge management and employee turnover, using the example of selected Slovenian organisations, in particular, technology parks. The {{purpose of this article}} is to point out statistical characteristics between employee turnover and certain selected independent variables. The empirical research was conducted on a population of 667 Slovenian organisations gathered from the subjects of an innovative environment database, and a further sample of 51 chosen technology parks from the A group. By implementing multivariate regression analysis, we sought to examine whether knowledge requirements and knowledge transfer paths in these organisations have a statistically significant influence on employee turnover. The aim of this article is to present the results of empirical research that defines the development of a conceptual framework for understanding the influence of knowledge management on employee turnover.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{determinants}} of exit by bankruptcy in industrial sectors in Sweden. The dataset which is used gives a complete picture of the pattern of exit by bankruptcy on industry level in both manufacturing and service sectors in Sweden during the period 2004 - 2008. The importance of some industry structural factors such as scale economies, profitability, tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>capital</b> intensity and industrial market growth rate for exit by bankruptcy are investigated. The use of two types of exit rates by bankruptcy (by firms and by employees) contributes to the current research. The two-way fixed effects model is used for the dependent variable of exit rate calculated by number of bankruptcies and total number of registered firms. The results show that only the long-term industrial market growth rate affects the exit rate by bankruptcy and it has a negative effect. The GLS in the two-way random effects model is used for the dependent variable of exit rate calculated by number of employees of bankruptcies. The results in this model, however, show that the existence of scale economies, more profitability, and investments in tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> all deter the number of bankruptcy...|$|R

On the basis of a multivariate regression analysis we wanted to present empirical findings, namely, whether communication technologies and the capability (ability) of the employed to access information sources influences KM.

40|$|National income {{accounting}} {{would be}} a relatively simple matter {{were it not for}} “capital. ” All flows of output would then be for immediate consump-tion, and labor would be the sole factor of production (and relatively undif-ferentiated labor at that, since there would be no investments in health and education to complicate matters). The question of how the boundary be-tween market and nonmarket activity should be defined {{would be one of the}} main issues of contention; how to measure the real output associated with intangible products like services {{would be a}}nother. However, both problems are essentially issues of implementation rather than of basic the-ory, since there is no conceptual reason to exclude the nonmarket use of economic resources from a complete set of national accounts, nor is there a controversy about the need to express inputs and outputs in both current and constant prices. When it comes to capital, however, it is more a question of what to do than how to do it. No issue has given economic theory more trouble, from Karl Marx and the Austrian capital theorists to Keynes and the Cam-bridge Controversies, and the ambiguity has only gotten worse with the in-creased theoretical focus on Schumpeterian uncertainty, partial informa-tion, imperfect competition, and the emerging literature on the importance of <b>intangible</b> <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> This unsettled state of affairs is obviously a problem for the design of national income accounts, since, as Griliches (1994) observed, it is hard to measure something when there is a funda...|$|R

The empirical results quantify the contribution of material, immaterial (information technology and advertising) and <b>intangible</b> (organization <b>capital)</b> <b>assets</b> to economic value of Spanish banks, separated from the contribution of market power. We find that intangible assets build up from adjustment costs of investments in IT and rents from market power split evenly the economic value of the bank above the replacement cost of material and immaterial <b>assets.</b> <b>Intangibles,</b> IT <b>capital,</b> adjustment costs, valuation of banks, investment of banks...|$|R

40|$|The {{qualifying}} {{aspect of}} the ongoing changes in firm growth processes {{seems to be the}} increased heterogeneity of size and a trend towards a broader fluctuation in average size. Exogenous factors (market size, demand trends, technological innovations, higher competition) determine a different impact on firms will to increase their own size, while endogenous variables play a greater role than in the past. The outcome is represented by a growth pattern that characterises some firms, but not all of them. Growth appear to be an asymmetric phenomenon, involving selectively but not casually a subgroup of firms. In the present paper it is hypothesized that growth stems from the asymmetric distribution of internalized resources (both material and immaterial), allowing some firms (regardless of the original size) to enter evolutionary paths that others don’t want or simply can’t enter.

In turn, the level and volatility of firm cash flow influences firm financing decisions.

However, empirical analysis has not extended to agricultural biotechnology firms. This research helps in understanding the role of knowledge <b>capital</b> and other <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> in <b>capital</b> structure decisions of U. S. agricultural biotechnology firms. Quantitative results indicate that leverage is negatively related to growth and nondebt tax shields. Asset tangibility, size, profitability, and uniqueness are positively related to leverage. Using various characterizations of leverage, our models explain up to approximately 75 % of the variation in leverage. Empirically generated elasticities buttress the importance of intangible assets such as knowledge capital and tax shields in capital structure choice.
