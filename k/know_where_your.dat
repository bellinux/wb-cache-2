500|$|After the 9th Armoured Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of the 6th New Zealand Brigade {{went ahead}} {{to survey the}} scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he {{approached}} him saying, 'Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> tanks are?' Currie waved his hand {{at a group of}} tanks around him, replying 'There they are.' Gentry was puzzled. 'I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?' Currie waved his arm and again replied, 'There are my armoured regiments, Bill.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Production for {{the film}} took {{seventeen}} months, with a budget of $4 million. Though limited by the $4 million budget, McKean viewed this as a good thing, saying [...] "It's very {{good to have a}} box to fight against, and to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> limitations are, because it immediately implies a certain kind of thing... a certain kind of shape... a certain approach to things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, my dear son, why did {{you ever}} leave us? After you had vanished, no one <b>knew</b> <b>where,</b> <b>your</b> poor wife grew more and more wretched, and would neither eat nor drink. Little by little she faded away, and a month ago we laid her in her grave, to hide her sorrows under the earth.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] he said, anxiously, [...] "don't speak loud. No {{one must}} <b>know.</b> <b>Where</b> do <b>your</b> people think themselves, I wonder? In a dock at home? And you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Married!" [...] exclaimed the sergeant-major, with a grim laugh. [...] "Married to {{a little}} tame bunny-rabbit! Not if I <b>know</b> it. <b>Where’s</b> <b>your</b> mother?" [...] he demanded, turning to the girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> ship is?' {{he asked}} with curiosity. `And you the second officer! Haven't you {{been working on}} board of her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you know}} so much," [...] she retorted, [...] "why don't you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> dishpan is instead of chasing around the country after it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I have earned the reward. I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> son is, and I know some, at least, {{of those who}} are holding him." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2) Track: Once you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> all <b>your</b> {{contracts}} are, {{the next}} step is to track any important data so you don’t miss any milestone. This affects both old contracts and newly signed contracts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> house was," [...] Beric said, [...] "and {{was glad}} {{to be able to do}} {{something}} in gratitude for your father's kindness at Massilia. But I must not lose a moment talking; I hope to make two or three more trips before the fire reaches your house. Your slaves have orders to return with us. Will you tell your steward to guide us back by a less frequented road than that we came by, and then we can keep together and shall not lose time forcing our way through the crowd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you get <b>your</b> figures," [...] she said, [...] "but I'm afraid they're wrong. I've just twenty-five {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really it {{is hardly}} worth while. It is nearly eight o'clock, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> {{portmanteau}} was put. Shall I get you a book?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{watching}} {{her face as she}} spoke, her--eyes cast down. [...] "One question more, Miss Affleck: do you happen to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> mother was born?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You do? Perhaps,' said Bounderby, staring {{with all}} his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-law, 'you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> {{daughter}} is at the present time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With all my heart; but I {{must get}} down here; I'm sent {{for one of}} Herbert's shirts. The good boy lets mamma and aunty manage them still! I believe their hearts would break {{outright}} if he took to shop ones, {{like the rest of}} them. Hush, Tartar, for shame! don't you <b>know</b> me? <b>Where's</b> <b>your</b> master?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Sowler rose, {{and tapped}} her smartly on the shoulder. [...] "Lies!" [...] she burst out. [...] "He <b>knows</b> no more <b>where</b> <b>your</b> {{daughter}} is than I do--and he's off with your money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go home!" [...] exclaimed the latter. [...] "Why, Mrs. Cliff, {{that would}} be {{impossible}} just now. You could not go to Plainton without letting people <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you got <b>your</b> money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{wherever}} {{anything of the}} kind is going on, of that you may rest assured. Do you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> uncle is at this moment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} you still don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> friend gets his money?" [...] he remarked to Robert one morning, as they walked {{together}} through the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "We wish to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> nephew Adam is, mistress," [...] now {{broke in}} de Chavasse roughly, [...] "the squire and I {{would wish to}} ask him a few questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't have an {{opportunity}} for showing what you can do. I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you got <b>your</b> utilitarian, radical views; but we'll keep to the point. Where {{do you think of}} going?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here now, Westly," [...] said Gashford, {{in a low}} {{suppressed}} voice, {{shutting the}} curtain of the tent and drawing a revolver from his pocket, [...] "you know something about this matter, and you know me. If you don't tell me all you <b>know</b> and <b>where</b> <b>your</b> chum has bolted to, I'll blow your brains out as sure as there's a God in heaven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor {{about your}} babies. Flitter, I'm ashamed of you. You are a poor kind of father," [...] {{declared}} Old Mother Nature severely. [...] "If you don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to find <b>your</b> family, I'll show you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Atherton {{stepped to}} his door, {{and gave the}} order {{forgotten}} before. Then he closed the door, {{and came back to}} Marcia. [...] "Don't you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> husband is, Mrs. Hubbard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, old chap,' said Frank, 'I {{may as well}} {{be honest}} with you. If this thing goes against me, I am stony broke. I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> costs are coming from.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{they are}} {{numerous}} enough: {{the difficulty is}} to find out where they lie. It is better to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> luck lies than where your talent lies: that's an old man's opinion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{creature}} {{come from}} nobody <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> is not <b>your</b> cousin! How {{do we know}} he is your cousin? He may be a valet who has taken his master's portmanteau, and run away in his postchaise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Austin {{agreed with}} a smile. [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you got <b>your</b> talents, and things do go well when Don Pancho resumes control. All the same, he's had enough and I am needed." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. [...] "My idees and your idees--or anyhow the idees you've got hold of--somewhere--somehow----I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you get <b>your</b> idees. We haven't {{got the same}} idees, anyhow. You got to keep order in these places--anyhow...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you are {{probably}} pretty well aware, Miss Harmer, we have not found it. And now {{let me ask you}} distinctly, do you, or do you not, <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> late brother's will is?" ...|$|E
60|$|The narrator's {{manner and}} tone had {{the stamp of}} truth, and his story made a great {{impression}} on all around. 'And do you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> brother is at the present time?' asked the magistrate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, sir. Don't {{talk to me}} in that way. As if I didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>your</b> heart was. What right had you {{to speak}} to me if you had an L. D. down in the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{expected}} {{too much}} of me," [...] I told him, and he bowed his head. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you brought <b>your</b> grand ideas {{of men and women}} from. I don't want to know," [...] I added hastily.|$|R
5000|$|On an {{interview}} with The Creative Independent she said that : [...] "America is a very strange place {{to be when you}} don’t <b>know</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>your</b> family comes from, or your language, or even the legacy of a black woman or an African woman. What is that? What does that mean? What’s the history of that? It’s part of my nature: wanting to know more, and knowing that the narrative has been controlled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blast 'em all!" [...] he {{suddenly}} broke out. [...] "Haven't I always said so--the infernal old cusses! I hope I an't swearing, now. Well! go ahead, George, go ahead; but be careful, my boy; don't shoot anybody, George, unless--well--you'd better not shoot, I reckon; at least, I wouldn't hit anybody, you <b>know.</b> <b>Where</b> is <b>your</b> wife, George?" [...] he added, as he nervously rose, {{and began walking}} the room.|$|R
