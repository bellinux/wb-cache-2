5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would <b>ingrain</b> the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to <b>ingrain</b> itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did.|$|E

[...] The complete soundtrack, titled PPPPPP, was released alongside VVVVVV and is sold as a music download or CD on Pålsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled MMMMMM which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy.

2500|$|The iMac was {{dramatically}} {{different from any}} previous mainstream computer. It was made of translucent [...] "Bondi Blue"-colored plastic, and was egg-shaped around a 15-inch (38.1cm) CRT display. The case included a handle, and the peripheral connectors were hidden behind a door {{on the right-hand side}} of the machine. Dual headphone jacks in the front complemented the built-in stereo speakers. Sir Jonathan Ive, currently Chief Design Officer at Apple, is credited with the industrial design. Its unique shape and color options helped <b>ingrain</b> itself into late 1990s pop culture. The iMac was the first computer to exclusively offer USB ports as standard, including as the connector for its new keyboard and mouse, thus abandoning previous Macintosh peripheral connections, such as the ADB, SCSI and GeoPort serial ports.|$|E

2500|$|The Talmud states, [...] "Cover {{your head}} in order that the fear of heaven may be upon you." [...] Rabbi Hunah ben Joshua never walked 4 cubits (6.6 feet, or 2 meters) with his head uncovered. He explained: [...] "Because the Divine Presence is always over my head." [...] This was {{understood}} by Rabbi Yosef Karo in the Shulchan Arukh as indicating that Jewish men should cover their heads and should not walk more than four cubits bareheaded. Covering one's head, such as by wearing a kippah, is described as [...] "honoring God". The Mishnah Berurah modifies this ruling, adding that the Achronim established it as a requirement to wear a head covering even when traversing fewer than four cubits, and even when one is standing still, indoors and outside. Kitzur Shulchan Aruch cites a story from the Talmud (Shabbat 156b) about Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak who might have become a thief had his mother not saved him from this fate by insisting that he cover his head, which instilled in him the fear of God. In many communities, boys are encouraged to wear a kippah from a young age in order to <b>ingrain</b> the habit.|$|E
