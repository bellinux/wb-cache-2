5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict {{with the people of}} the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1997 he {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Order of Merit; by this point <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> weak to travel to London to receive it, so instead a {{representative}} of the Queen travelled to Whitchurch to present it to him.|$|E

5|$|In March and April 1706, George {{was seriously}} ill.
