Rains had argued that prosecutors and detectives acted inappropriately when they interviewed Mehserle earlier in the case. Another hearing was set for March 26.|$|E

25|$|In Ong Kian Cheong, District Judge Neighbour did {{not treat}} free {{speech in the}} form of seditious speech as trumping the {{competing}} interests of ensuring freedom from offence, as well as protecting social harmony between ethnic and religious groups. He approved the view that offences involving community and/or race relations warrant general deterrence. Furthermore, the <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not deem the right of religious propagation guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution a mitigating factor because the accused persons, as Singaporeans, could not claim ignorance of the sensitive nature of race and religion in multiracial and multi-religious Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a buzz in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it {{comes at a time when}} the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E

This led to a court fight which included an attempt by Tiffany to have herself declared an emancipated minor. This was rejected by the court; however, the <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> allow her to move out of her mother's home due to obvious conflicts, and her grandmother (who supported and sided with Tiffany during the trial) became her temporary guardian. These legal battles took a toll on the singer's career.|$|E

Its opponents {{returned}} to court to ask for construction to be suspended. Their bid was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, who ruled that a separate motion would need to be filed. The opponents' subsequent motion to halt construction was denied by Corlew on June 13, but he ruled that the county could not issue the ICM with an occupancy certificate because he had previously voided the approval of the site plan. On June 22, the county appealed the judgment and requested that the court lift the injunction on issuing an occupancy certificate. The request was turned down on July 2, meaning that the full court process – taking up to a year – would be required.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, Patterson was criminally {{prosecuted for}} defrauding depositors, {{including}} {{encouraging people to}} deposit money when he knew {{that they would not}} be repaid. Foolishly, Patterson did not prepare for trial, hiring a lawyer at the last minute. Hungerford was the first witness to testify about the bank's beginnings. Later testimony showed that Patterson knew his bank was going to fail for the past five years. According to an auditor's report, in January 23, 1875, Patterson's bank had liabilities of $96,669.89, but only $5,931.30 of available resources and $36,498.47 of contingent resources, i.e., money in Patterson's individual account, leaving an overall shortage of $54,240.12. Patterson claimed that he was actually solvent at all times because bank investments in real estate covered any alleged shortages. The presiding <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not buy his story and found him guilty of fraud.|$|E
25|$|After her arrest, she {{was allowed}} to retire early from the LAPD; she {{was held in the}} Los Angeles County Jail. A bail hearing was not held for almost six months. Judge Robert J. Perry {{surprised}} both sides when he set the amount at $10 million in cash, well above what the defense had suggested and more than twice what prosecutors had proposed. The case against her was very strong, he said, and thus she might well be at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, said the <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{not guilty}} verdict, the two Inuit men {{were taken to}} Calgary in late August, where they were found guilty {{of the murder of}} Le Roux. This was the first time Inuit had been found guilty of murder in a Canadian court. The law at that time had a {{mandatory}} sentence of death for the crime of murder, yet the jury and the <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not wish for the pair to die for their crimes owing to the provocative nature of the priests' actions before their deaths. To avoid the death penalty, the judge sentenced the pair to death by hanging, with the execution date set as October 15. The sentence was immediately commuted to life imprisonment at a Fort Resolution police station. In 1919, the pair assisted police in establishing a new police contingent at Tree River, and in 1922 were released.|$|E
25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to find out what he might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E
500|$|The {{interpretation}} {{that he was}} mostly motivated by Middle Eastern politics has been criticized as an oversimplification that ignores Sirhan's deeper psychological problems. During his trial, Sirhan's lawyers attempted to use a defense of diminished responsibility, while their client tried to confess to the crime and change his plea to guilty on several occasions. Sirhan testified that he had killed Kennedy [...] "with 20 years of malice aforethought". The <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not accept this confession and it was later withdrawn.|$|E

5000|$|Iudex non calculat is a {{legal term}} that loosely {{translates}} as [...] "The <b>judge</b> <b>does</b> not calculate".

Judge Livingston held that the district <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech [...] "foreseeably create a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment", which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.

500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where he pulled off her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the <b>judge</b> <b>did</b> not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E
