5|$|Manju (Sripriya) {{was raised}} in a {{dysfunctional}} family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. <b>Into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E

Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn seems to have a mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E

25|$|Two {{investigations}} were conducted. The {{first by}} Ron Lieberman, her husband, and private investigator Ken Gallant, a former FBI agent, initially presumed her disappearance and possible death were {{unrelated to the}} attacks but later concluded {{it was the most}} likely outcome. A later investigation by New York City police delved <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> leading up to September 11 and found details of a double life, a history of marital problems, possible affairs with other women, job difficulties and alcohol and drug abuse by Philip, as well as a pending criminal charge against her, in the months before her disappearance. This led them to conclude it was just as likely that she had met a different fate.|$|E

It was written by Emeli Sandé, Naughty Boy and Stargate, with production done by the latter two. It is a chamber pop and R song that sees Rihanna deliver vocals in an [...] "experimental" [...] fashion. Its lyrics {{have been described as}} a [...] "personal essay", with lyrics that discuss Rihanna's unrepentant attitude in letting people <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> She references Oprah Winfrey in the line [...] "You saw me on the television". The song garnered positive reviews from music critics, some of whom felt that it is [...] "heartfelt" [...] and [...] "psychedelic". [...] Upon the release of Unapologetic, the song charted in Canada, France, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It debuted at number 10 on the UK R Chart.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{can also}} be seen as a story of revenge; it can be {{imagined}} that Christine has repressed the memory of her first boyfriend, and that he [...] "has come back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> seeking revenge". On this interpretation, the Stranger is the boyfriend, and causes the crash by stepping out in front of Christine's car. McDowall suggests that the oddness early in the episode suggests that the story may be about [...] "an obsessive ex [...] a stalker". There is also indication that the episode is a ghost story. While Boyd sees this as misdirection {{on the part of the}} writers, for Benji Wilson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the story is about ghosts, [...] "but not in the normal way – by the close you realised everyone's life is a ghost story, it’s just that your memories are the ghosts." ...|$|E

Walton also revealed more of Loretta's past saying, [...] "Adam confesses that Loretta was violent towards him, basically she did some awful things to him that she's doing to Jake now." [...] The storyline sought to explain all the unanswered questions left in her backstory with Walton saying, [...] "He [...] tries to talk her round, {{and at that point}} she reveals she was sexually abused when she was very young. It's supposedly the reason she went into stripping to have power over men." [...] Walton also defended Loretta's final actions, saying the character was confused and did not mean to hurt anyone. In Loretta's final scene she voluntarily admits herself into a psychiatric hospital after being convinced to by Jake.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} Fever chiefly focuses on themes {{of love and}} enjoyment. Thompson {{described}} the album to be [...] "all about dancing, fucking, {{and having a good}} time". In the song [...] "Love at First Sight", Minogue describes how {{she fell in love with}} her partner at [...] "first sight" [...] and how it led to good things happening for her. [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was termed a [...] "mystery" [...] as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists" [...] as her obsession. The production of [...] "Give It to Me" [...] contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to [...] "slow down," [...] but the beat [...] "goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Fragile" [...] are simple and aim directly at the [...] " [...] heart". [...] "Come into My World" [...] is a [...] "plea for love" [...] as Minogue invites her partner <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> On the other hand, [...] "Dancefloor" [...] focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by [...] "lose it in the music".|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The baby issue {{continue}} to haunt Pam, {{after learning that}} she is unlikely to carry a child past the third month of pregnancy. Her depression culminates in near-fatal tragedy: Pam tries to kill herself by jumping {{off the top of}} the place of her employment, The Store. However, Bobby stops her but it is clear that Pam needs psychiatric help. [...] She is admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she can get the help she needs. On a surprise visit to Southfork, Pam walks through the front door and sees Bobby with a baby boy in his arms. In soaring spirits, Pam quickly settles <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> as Christopher's mother, while Bobby handles the adoption proceedings. She and Bobby grow closer during this period. In May 1982, Bobby finally tells Pam about Jeff Faraday, Kristin Shepard and the fact that J.R. could be Christopher's father. Pam is shocked that Bobby had kept this from her but doesn't hesitate to fly to California with him to find the truth, preparing to fight whoever she had to in order to keep her son. As Rebecca, (Pam's mother), is leaving for Houston on business, the Wentworth jet was involved in a midair collision. Rebecca dies as a result of her injuries. Pam is devastated – and angry – blaming the contest between J.R. and Bobby for her mother's death. Pam leaves Bobby and they divorce in the fall of 1983.|$|E

500|$|After {{discovery}} that Alleca and Brown would be releasing the album, Aguilera started developments {{to sue the}} pair {{in an effort to}} stop the release. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the affiliates Platinum Recordings and JFB Music for [...] "improper use of her name and license on the upcoming album Just Be Free". Carla Christofferson, her lawyer at the time, explained that [...] "We're trying to stop them from releasing these early recordings which is not the quality she is associated with right now." [...] However, Warlock Records president Adam Levy felt that despite Aguilera disliking the material, he found it to be a look <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> at the time of recording. He stated [...] "It's a great look at what she was doing, We're pleased [...] I'm more pleased for the album's producers who wanted to get it out. I hope the fans can appreciate it." [...] Christofferson responded by alleging that Warlock Records tried to [...] "boot strap" [...] on Aguilera's success. In response to the lawsuit, Warlock Records filed their own lawsuit in an attempt to ensure the release of the record. During the proceedings, Aguilera agreed to let Warlock Records release Just Be Free after reaching a settlement with the company and its affiliates. [...] She allowed the release under the condition that the label would have to include a letter written by Aguilera in each album released. Since November 13, 2015, the album is available to stream on Spotify and Deezer.|$|E
500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she really would choose a guy who would do something like this to her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
