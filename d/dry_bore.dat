40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Aboriginal communities {{in remote areas}} of South Australia require access to bore water for their non-potable supplies due to the aridity of the region. This water is often found in deep, fractured rock aquifers. Due to the anisotropic and heterogeneous nature of fractured rock aquifers, {{there is a significant}} risk of drilling costly <b>dry</b> <b>bore</b> holes in the attempt to find water. This project is a pilot study to gauge the effectiveness of magnetotellurics - a geophysical method that images the distribution of electrical conductivity in the subsurface - in mapping and characterising fractured rock aquifers {{in order to reduce the}} risk of drilling <b>dry</b> <b>bore</b> holes. This survey was carried out in the Nipapanha Community, in the Northern Flinders Ranges, South Australia. There is a need for an increase in bore water supply from the local fractured rock aquifer. Geophysical, hydrogeological and structural research has been carried out in the area, which will act as a guide for this survey, so that knowledge and techniques learned may be applied in poorly constrained areas. Magnetotelluric data were recorded at 3000 Hz and 500 Hz over 40 sites around the target area in order to create a series of 5 2 D profiles as well as a map of phase tensors at various frequencies. Controlled source magnetotelluric data from a previous survey carried out by Zonge Engineering were obtained and reprocessed and inverted to create a series of 6 inversions in order to increase coverage of the survey. Interpretation of the inversions and phase tensors in conjunction with hydrogeological information was able to identify areas of anomalous apparent conductivity, possibly corresponding to increased water content. Predominant directions of conductivity, corresponding to fracture orientation throughout the area were also identified. Thesis (B. Sc.

Yet sidestepping consideration of these important issues of pedagogic intent and epistemological outcomes clearly limits the scope of understanding what digital technologies are being used for in higher education, and with what consequences. The ‘educational’ element of educational technology is not simply common-sense or implicit. We need to develop visions that go beyond conceptualising digital technology as an instrument within instructional design (what might be called the classic object of interest within the field of educational technology) or a systemic conditioner of education as a specialized communication process (Aagaard, 2018). Instead, discussions about the pedagogic underpinnings of the technologies being used in university teaching and learning are much-needed and long over-due.|$|R

40|$|KEY NOTE ADDRESS: One of the sparsely {{addressed}} {{stories of}} the century is {{the role played by}} Operations Management as an enabler of the realization of human, spiritual, and ethical values that not only do most of us cherish, but are essential for the survival of the planet, and indeed, the humanity. The stereotypical images of operations often include drawing boards, mechanical gadgets, machine and sheet-metal shops, welding equipment, gages, calipers, and an assortment of tool boxes! Similarly, stereotypical images of operations people encompass rugged, <b>dry,</b> <b>boring</b> individuals bent over machines and equipments in dirty, oil-drenched overalls, pushing products through a pre-configured sequence of workstations designed to deliver mechanical products. In short,, if one has to go by the stereotypical images of operations and their management, they would not appear even remotely related to the fine human, ethical, and spiritual values, let alone serving as potent enablers of these very values. Our goal in this article is to demonstrate that operations management presents and provides an outstanding plethora of skills, expertise, technologies, services, and products that are in the front and center of creating, fostering, and sustaining human, ethical, and spiritual values and that since the inception of Ford assembly lines in 1915, when the word operations became popular, there is no other discipline that comes even close to contributing to this task. We create a hierarchical structure of salient human values and explore the contribution of operations management in supporting, growing, and sustaining such values...|$|R
50|$|Ajanale has a farming economy, {{traditional}} crops include Pomegranate, Jawar. Farmers rely on {{rain water}} for farming needs. Pomegranates and effective water management {{has made the}} farmers of Ajanale very rich. Each has a house in his own farm. Although water to the household is less, there is always water on the farm. The yield of pomegranates is very high. The quality too is superior. This {{is the reason why}} now {{they do not have to}} send their produce elsewhere, but the markets themselves come here. They get excellent rates for their produce from the comforts of their own farm house. In fact, marketing of pomegranate has become such a good business that several youth in the village have entered it. They not only produce pomegranates but also deal with markets outside and sell produce from several farmers in the village to urban markets. As business grows so does the employment opportunity within the village. Hence, landed and landless, alike, are rising up the socio-economic ladder gradually but definitively. A few farmers from this village were invited to make a presentation on development of horticulture at the World Bank conference held in Pune in 2010. And the farmers agree that prosperity is possible only because of effective water management and the drip irrigation systems.It is important to have SCIENTIFIC/ Geological approach for solving the water problem in the area. The topographic feature is suitable for implementation of Integrated Watershed Development Programme. Rain water harvesting is less in area. The <b>dry</b> or failed <b>bore</b> wells can be used as 'RECHARGE SHAFTS' where roof water can be collected in these <b>dry</b> <b>bores</b> which will help recharging deeper water zones. The upper zones of water is limited to about 280 feet, but farmers take deeper bore wells that causes leakage of upper zone water into lower dry red bed 'geru' zones. If farmers collectively decide to not to exceed this depth, it will solve the problem to some extent and save their money that usually goes waste in taking deeper bore wells, costly/ high Hp pumps & the heavy cost on electricity bills.|$|R

Environmental education by both media and ENGOs is undoubtedly crucial in producing more ―green‖ citizenship {{that is well}} equipped with environmental knowledge and has a great attitude and practices on preserving and conserving the environment. This paper sought to discuss on how the Malaysian media, particularly The Star and Utusan Malaysia and the Malaysian ENGOs particularly World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Malaysia and Malaysia Nature Society (MNS) plays their vital roles in environmental education and the challenges faced by them in educating public about the environment. For {{the purpose of this}} study, a total of 24 interviewees encompassing 13 interviewees from Utusan Malaysia and The Star and 11 interviewees from WWF Malaysia and MNS were interviewed. The findings from interviews confirmed that both the Malaysian media and ENGOs have shared quite a similar role in environmental education, particularly in delivering environmental awareness and knowledge to public. However, the media is more focusing on educating the public about environment through their feature and news articles published on newspapers while the ENGOs‘ environmental education are not only via their newsletters but also through environmental programs like eco-school and eco-institute conducted by WWF Malaysia and School Nature Club (KPA) and KPA for youth conducted by MNS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the report is to advance the {{technical}} understanding of the groundwater system and inform resource management decisions in the Rakaia-Ashburton Plains area. The report also aims to provide information for stakeholders about possible groundwater system responses to various irrigation development scenarios. The scenarios evaluated in the report include: converting borderstrip irrigation to spray irrigation across the Ashburton-Lyndhurst Irrigation Scheme (ALIS); and increasing groundwater sourced irrigation across the Rakaia-Ashburton Plains area. The report recommends resource management strategies for managing the risk of irrigation development in the area. The report has been written {{in the context of}} applications to take groundwater for irrigation beyond the current allocation limit. However, the report is not intended to provide an audit or assessment of effects of these applications. This study describes the occurrence of groundwater across the Rakaia-Ashburton Plains, and uses an eigenmodel to explore the relationship between climate, abstraction, and dynamic groundwater behaviour. Estimates of irrigated area and land-surface recharge (LSR) are provided for sub-areas of the Rakaia-Ashburton Plains. Descriptions of groundwater occurrence and dynamics are provided in the context of local recharge sources. These datasets are subsequently correlated by calibrating the eigenmodel, and predictions of future abstraction and LSR scenarios provided using the eigenmodel. LSR, river recharge, and groundwater abstraction are water budget components which influence the dynamic behaviour of the groundwater system. The dynamic responses of groundwater levels reflect influences such as sporadic and seasonal LSR, damped responses to LSR, steady river recharge effects and groundwater abstraction. Some groundwater level records in the Rakaia-Ashburton Plains area show long-term declining trends, others do not. A pattern of higher piezometric head nearer the rivers and decreasing piezometric head toward the centre of the Rakaia-Ashburton Plains area was found. The increasing piezometric head around the rivers reflects significant local river recharge sources compared with LSR. Down plains of State Highway 1 piezometric heads reflect relatively low vertical hydraulic gradients compared with those up plains. A soil moisture water balance model was used to estimate LSR under dryland and spray irrigation conditions. A modified approach was applied to estimate LSR occurring across the ALIS to represent border-strip irrigation and to take account of records of the volume of water delivered to the scheme from the Rangitata Diversion Race (RDR). Estimates of the proportions of border-strip and spray irrigation LSR over time were considered together with conveyance efficiency and by-wash flows. The additional LSR caused by the ALIS is significant when compared with other areas. Irrigated area is an important factor when estimating LSR as rainfall recharge through the soil increases under irrigation. Very little information is currently available about irrigation water use, or about areas actually irrigated. Three sources of information have been used to estimate irrigated area: 1) areas listed as irrigated in the Environment Canterbury RMA Database; 2) land parcels associated with consents from the Environment Canterbury RMA Database; 3) remote sensing. Considerable differences were found between these three sources. The eigenmodel method characterises an aquifer in terms of a set of conceptual groundwater reservoirs. This method quantifies the dynamic behaviour of groundwater storage and groundwater discharge in response to time-series of recharge. Recharge includes that from land surface, rivers and pumped abstraction. There is consistency between the eigenmodel method and the more conventional numerical groundwater models; however, the eigenmodel method enables significant model simplification and accessibility. Using the eigenmodel, the recharge component from the ALIS is shown to be significantly “propping up” groundwater levels in the vicinity of and down gradient of the ALIS command area. As more efficient irrigation practices develop within the ALIS, it is likely that some groundwater users will face reduced reliability or even <b>dry</b> <b>bores</b> depending on their proximity to the ALIS. To minimise piezometric head reductions arising from more efficient irrigation, surface water supply for irrigation should be used over the widest area possible to minimise groundwater pumping demand and maximise the additional recharge of rainfall via soil percolation. Managed aquifer recharge options could also be investigated to augment groundwater levels currently “propped up” by border-strip irrigation. Groundwater development scenarios were tested using the eigenmodel. The scenarios looked at the change between status quo and full irrigation development. The scenario testing showed that the effect on piezometric head due to fully irrigating areas down-plains of State Highway 1 would be less than full development above SH 1. This is due to a combination of system dynamics and higher levels of current irrigation sourced from groundwater coastwards of SH 1. Further groundwater development coastwards of SH 1 is expected to have less of a cumulative effect on piezometric levels than development up-plains. Therefore, the preferred source for irrigation development up-plains of about SH 1 should be surface water, not groundwater. Arranging irrigation supplies in this way will provide higher productivity yields whilst minimising the piezometric response in the groundwater system. All groundwater takes will contribute to a reduction in coastal discharge from the groundwater system. Therefore, if further groundwater is developed and/or if surface water irrigation is made more efficient, additional resource management measures are recommended. Such measures could include: developing a coastal monitoring and trigger level system; managed aquifer recharge; up plains trigger levels for deep wells; improving water use and irrigated area information...|$|R

Acquiring expertise in research methods and statistics is not easy and poses a significant challenge for many students.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this study has been to investigate experimentally the forces and overturning moments produced by tsunamis on vertical walls. The experimental results are compared with several analytical and numerical models. Several types of waves were used in a horizontal tank including solitary waves, undular bores, turbulent bores, and surges on a <b>dry</b> bed. <b>Bores</b> produced from breaking solitary waves in a tilting wave tank were also investigated. Various measurements were made, including the incident wave celerity, the wave profile, the runup, force, overturning moment, and pressure time histories. The impact process of the bores in the tilting wave tank were recorded with high-speed movies. The wave profiles in the horizontal tank were defined using a laser induced-fluorescence system (LIF) which allows the free surface on a two-dimensional plane {{in the center of}} the wave tank to be recorded. This method was developed to measure accurately the surface elevation profile of turbulent high-speed flows which is difficult to measure reliably either with conventional flow visualization techniques or intrusive devices such as wave gages. The LIF method was also used to determine the runup on the wall. Strong vertical accelerations were shown to occur during the reflection of bores and steep solitary waves at a vertical wall. These reduced the force on the wall relative to a hydrostatic force computed from the maximum runup height on the wall. The accelerations also cause the maximum force to occur before and after the maximum runup for steep solitary waves and bores, respectively. For these cases, the maximum measured force and overturning moment were always less than computed from the maximum measured runup on the wall using hydrostatic considerations. The maximum force due to surges on a dry bed was also less than the hydrostatic force calculated from the maximum runup height on the wall. For all the dry bed cases studied, the maximum runup height on the wall was between 1. 46 and 1. 62 times the velocity head computed from the celerity of the incident surge. For the entire range of wave conditions of this study, the maximum relative runup occurred for a bore with a relative wave height of 1. 23, and produced a runup equal to 3. 8 times the velocity head computed from the wave celerity. The maximum measured water surface slopes along the front of long waves, <b>bores,</b> and <b>dry</b> bed surges were computed from the measured wave profiles. At the transition from undular bores to turbulent bores, there was a discontinuity in the maximum water surface slope where the slope increased by a factor of 2. 5 to three for turbulent bores. This discontinuity corresponded with a rapid increase in the measured runup, force, and moment on the wall. The properly normalized force on a vertical wall due to the impingement of a bore on a mildly sloping beach is shown to be equivalent to the force produced by a bore of constant volume on a horizontal bed. This implies the results from the horizontal wave tank experiments can be used to estimate the loads expected from bores propagating on mild beaches with slopes ranging up to 0. 02 m/m. Two numerical models were compared with the experimental results. A boundary integral element model, which solves the potential flow problem subject to the full nonlinear free surface boundary conditions, predicted the loads imposed on the wall due to steep solitary waves quite well. A finite difference model of the Navier-Stokes equations was also used to simulate the reflection of solitary waves and mild turbulent bores at a vertical wall. This finite difference model predicted the solitary wave loads quite well; however, it over-predicted the steepness of the incident bore profiles and produced a force-time history with a high amplitude and short-duration peak, which was not observed in the measurements. Except for this sharp peak, the agreement of the finite difference model with the experimental results was quite reasonable...|$|R

A sermon of Keble's at St. Mary's prompts the uneasy question, 'Are all Mr. Keble's opinions those of scripture and the church? Of his life and heart and practice, none could doubt, all would admire.' A good sermon is mentioned from Blanco White, that strange and forlorn figure of whom in later life Mr. Gladstone wrote an interesting account, not conclusive in argument, but assuredly not wanting in either delicacy or generosity.[42] 'Dr. Pusey was very kind to me when I was an undergraduate at Oxford,' he says, but what their relations were I know not. 'I knew and respected both Bishop Lloyd and Dr. Pusey,' he says, 'but neither of them attempted to exercise the smallest influence over my religious opinions.' With Newman he seems to have been brought into contact hardly at all.[43] Newman and one of the Wilberforces came to dine at Cuddesdon one day, and, on a later occasion, he and another fellow of Oriel were at a dinner with Mr. Gladstone at the table of his friend Philip Pusey. Two or three of his sermons are mentioned. One of them (March 7, 1831) contained 'much singular, not to say objectionable matter, if one may so speak of so good a man.' Of another,--'heard Newman preach a good sermon on those who made excuse' (Sept. 25, 1831). Of the generality of university sermons, he accepted the observation of his friend Anstice,--'Depend upon it, such sermons as those can never convert a single person.' On some Sundays he hears two of these discourses in the morning and afternoon, and a third sermon in the evening, for though he became the most copious of all speakers, Mr. Gladstone was ever the most generous of listeners. It was at St. Ebb's that he found really congenial ministrations--an ecclesiastical centre described by him fifty years later--under Mr. Bulteel, a man of some note in his day; here the flame was at white heat, and a score or two of young men felt its attractions.[44] He always remembered among the wonderful sights of his life, St. Mary's 'crammed in all parts by all orders, when Mr. Bulteel, an outlying calvinist, preached his accusatory sermon (some of it too true) against the university.' In the summer of 1830, Mr. Gladstone notes, 'Poor Bulteel has lost his church for preaching in the open air. Pity that he should have acted so, and pity that it should be found necessary to make such an example of a man of God.' The preacher was impenitent, for from a window Mr. Gladstone again heard him conduct a service for a large congregation who listened attentively to a sermon that was interesting, but evinced some soreness of spirit. A 'most painful' discourse from a Mr. Crowther so moves Mr. Gladstone that he sits down to write to the preacher, 'earnestly expostulating with him on the character and the doctrines of the sermon,' and after re-writing his letter, he delivers it with his own hand at the door of the displeasing divine. The effect was not other than salutary, for a little later he was 'happy to hear two sermons of good principles from Mr. Crowther.' To his father, October 27, 1830:--'Dr. Chalmers has been passing through Oxford, and I went to hear him preach on Sunday evening, though it was at the baptist chapel.... I need hardly say that his sermon was admirable, and quite as remarkable for the judicious and sober manner in which he enforced his views, as for their lofty principles and piety. He preached, I think, for an hour and forty minutes.' The admiration thus first aroused only grew with fuller knowledge in the coming years.|$|R
