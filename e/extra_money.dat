5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely <b>extra</b> <b>money</b> that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill. Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill.

Browne and his club-mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding. Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker said in an {{interview}} with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower state funding payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 to examine the effects of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this <b>extra</b> <b>money</b> whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E

5|$|During his NBA career, Bradley {{used his}} fame {{on the court}} to explore social as well as {{political}} issues, meeting with journalists, government officials, academics, businesspeople, and social activists. He also worked as an assistant to the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C., and as a teacher in the street academies of Harlem. In 1976, he also became an author by publishing Life on the Run. Using a 20-day stretch of time during one season as the main focus of the book, he chronicled his experiences in the NBA and the people he met along the way. He noted in the book that he had initially signed only a four-year contract, and that he was uncomfortable using his celebrity status to earn <b>extra</b> <b>money</b> endorsing products as other players did.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much <b>extra</b> <b>money.</b> Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E

At one point he pawned Helen's engagement ring, and he often asked her family for loans.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 purse {{was set at}} $150,000, {{but fewer}} than 15 mushers {{finished}} the race that year, meaning the money allotted for the final two prizes were distributed {{to each of the}} 13 mushers who finished. The purse peaked at $200,000 in 2007, and winner Lance Mackey took home $40,000. In 2014, the purse was $115,000, but only 11 mushers finished the race, fewer than the number of paying positions. Rather than distribute the <b>extra</b> <b>money</b> to the finishers, the race chose to roll over the unused prize money into the 2015 race. As a result, the 2015 Yukon Quest will have a purse of more than $127,000.|$|E

While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning <b>extra</b> <b>money</b> from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough.

5|$|Whale {{was born}} in Dudley, England, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought {{prosperity}} to the Brazilian economy. The government of Brazil used some of the <b>extra</b> <b>money</b> from this economic growth to finance a large naval building program in 1904, which authorized the construction of a large number of warships, including three battleships. The Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship Norge and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800longtons (12,000tonnes), have a speed of 19knots (22mph; 35km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9inches (23cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.|$|E
