40|$|ABSTRACTINTRODUCTION:Hydatidosis is {{the result}} of {{infection}} with the larval stages of some species of the genus <b>Echinococcus.</b> <b>Treatment</b> approaches for hydatid cysts include the use of albendazole, surgery, and/or medico-surgical procedures. The choice of the therapeutic surgical approach depends on the cyst number and localization, surgeon expertise, and presence of complications. The present study aimed to compare the outcomes of the following therapeutic approaches for the treatment of hepatic hydatid cysts: pericystectomy; the puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration (PAIR) technique; and the PAIR technique followed by deroofing, evacuation of cysts, and omentoplasty. METHODS:The 54 patients were divided into 3 groups: Group I (14 patients) who underwent pericystectomy, Group II (23 patients) who underwent the PAIR technique, and Group III (17 patients) who underwent the PAIR technique followed by deroofing and omentoplasty. The diagnosis of hydatid cysts was based on serological testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, abdominal ultrasound, and parasitological examination of the cyst contents. Morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS:Postoperative bleeding, infection, and recurrence were reported in Groups I and II; Group III did not experience postoperative infection and had shorter hospital stays. Recurrence and postoperative complications did not occur in Group III. CONCLUSIONS:The partial surgical procedure with deroofing, evacuation of the cysts, and omentoplasty, as performed in the present study, is recommended as a safe and effective method for elimination of the entire parasite with minimal possibility for intra-peritoneal spillage...|$|E
40|$|A case of hydatid cyst of the tibia, which {{manifested}} as a pathologic fracture {{is being}} reported. Pain and swelling of left lower limb with inability {{to bear the}} weight were the main features. Tender swelling was also noted at the upper and middle third of tibia. Open biopsy revealed the hydatid cyst wall and scolices of <b>Echinococcus</b> granulosus. Albendazole <b>treatment</b> was followed by curettage and bone grafting...|$|R
40|$|Harmonisation of {{regulations}} in the European Union and the European Economic Area, as of January 1, 2012, {{has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} of rescue dogs imported to Norway from Eastern European countries, in particular Romania. Today the only requirements for dogs entering Norway are rabies vaccination and prophylactic <b>Echinococcus</b> multilocularis <b>treatment.</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the antibody levels to rabies virus in vaccinated rescue dogs and to examine if the dogs had sufficient antibody response according to the recommended titre ≥ 0. 5 IU/ml by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). A significant proportion (53 %, 95 % CI (41 % to 65 %)) of imported rescue dogs from Eastern Europe were found to have inadequate titres after rabies vaccination. Moreover, 41 per cent of the dogs had antibody levels below or equal to 0. 2 IU/ml, and among these, 14 dogs had titres ≤ 0. 1 IU/ml, which is considered negative in the fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation assay. This study indicates that the present regulation increases the risk of introducing rabies from member states where rabies is still prevalent to countries considered free from rabies...|$|R
40|$|Mebendazole {{was given}} to four {{patients}} with hepatic hydatid disease. In three patients hydatidosis had remained after surgery, and in the fourth {{it could not be}} treated surgically. Mebendazole was given orally in maximum doses of 400 - 600 mg three times a day during courses lasting 21 to 30 days. Ultrasonic echotomography showed a complete regression of the intrahepatic cysts after four to 13 months in all four cases. In three patients the course of treatment had to be repeated. Mebendazole also induced clinical improvement and a progressive lowering of the concentration of specific IgE of <b>Echinococcus</b> granulosus. During <b>treatment</b> circulating blood levels of specific immune complexes of antigen 5 were increased. These observations indicate that mebendazole has a lethal effect on E granulosus cysts in primary hydatid disease in man and that the efficacy of chemotherapy can be assessed with ultrasonography and by measuring changes in the concentration of specific IgE of E granulosus and circulating immune complexes...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that prophylactic treatment with BCG protects cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) against experimental infections with <b>Echinococcus</b> multilocularis; this <b>treatment</b> can, however, induce granulomatous reactions. In an attempt to identify a minimum prophylactic dose of BCG which would not induce granulomas, cotton rats were treated intraperitoneally with various doses of BCG (10 (1) to 10 (7) colony-forming units [CFU]) and then inoculated intraperitoneally with one brood capsule of the parasite. Consistent and complete protection was obtained by the inoculation of as few as 10 (3) CFU of BCG. A dose of 10 (1) CFU gave no protection whatsoever, and 10 (2) CFU gave only partial protection. Doses larger than 10 (3) (10 (5), 10 (7) CFU) also afforded complete protection but gave rise to granulomatous lesions. At the time of the inoculation of the parasite, protection coincided with a general elevation of leukocytes, especially cells of the monocyte/macrophage series. It is proposed that these results support evidence for the macrophage being the principal potential effector cell in hydatid disease...|$|R
