Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> way she moved, the way she sang – just the way she was."

500|$|The novel Miracle at St. Anna {{was written}} by James McBride [...] {{originating}} from his late uncle's experiences as a World War II soldier. [...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> whole business of what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired." [...] The 92nd Division served as the basis for McBride's novel, which was published in 2003.|$|E

A number of the characters were recast until {{one of the few}} remaining original actors, Jaime Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> remaining cast, I realized I had two characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show," [...] Bell said.

In the comics—particularly those of the Frank Miller era in the early 1990s—there were detailed illustrations we endeavored to bring to life in a grounded, gritty, and updated way, with respect and a strong nod to the original characters. We wanted to pick up where the comics version left off. <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> illustrations from The Man Without Fear, Daredevil Yellow, and the issues of the 1960s, to which the newer collections pay homage. I wanted the costume design to reflect the illustrations of those volumes through a modern lens while maintaining a retro sensibility." [...] Joshua Shaw, who has also done design work on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., helped design costumes for several characters on Daredevil, while Lorraine Calvert took over as costume designer for the second season.|$|E

2500|$|Sheshet devoted {{much time}} to Biblical exegesis, and {{whenever}} he recapitulated his studies, as was his custom {{at the end of}} every thirty days, he used to say: [...] "Rejoice, my soul! rejoice, my soul! For thy sake have I read the Holy Scriptures; and for thy sake have <b>I</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> Mishnah and the baraitot" [...] (Pes. 68b). He took comparatively little interest, on the other hand, in the Aggadah, and he himself acknowledged his shortcoming in this respect, saying: [...] "I cannot dispute with Ḥana on the Aggadah" [...] (Suk. 52b, and Rashi ad loc.). Some of his haggadic interpretations of Biblical passages, referring for the most part to studies of the Law, have been preserved. Thus, he interpreted Prov. xi. 25 as implying that whoever teaches in this world will have the good fortune to teach in the world to come also (Sanh. 92a); and in Shab. 63a he explains Prov. iii. 16 as meaning that whosoever studies in the right manner receives as his reward length of days in addition to riches and honor, but that he who studies in a fashion not altogether unimpeachable receives riches and honor without length of days. He frequently elucidated Biblical passages by the application of well-known proverbs (Ber. 32a; Sanh. 105a).|$|E
