40|$|AbstractThe <b>epiphysial</b> {{region of}} the dorsal {{diencephalon}} is the first site at which neurogenesis occurs in {{the roof of the}} zebrafish forebrain. We show that the homeobox containing gene floating head (flh) is required for neurogenesis to proceed in the epiphysis. In flh− embryos, the first few <b>epiphysial</b> neurons are generated, but beyond the 18 somite stage, neuronal production ceases. In contrast, in masterblind− (mbl−) embryos, <b>epiphysial</b> neurons are generated throughout the dorsal forebrain. We show that mbl is required to prevent the expression of flh in dorsal forebrain cells rostral to the epiphysis. Furthermore, <b>epiphysial</b> neurons are not ectopically induced in mbl−/flh− embryos, demonstrating that the <b>epiphysial</b> phenotype of mbl− embryos is mediated by ectopic Flh activity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of cues that provide directional information for specific growth cones in the zebrafish brain was functionally assayed by transplanting <b>epiphysial</b> neurons to ectopic {{locations in the}} embryonic brain followed by determining the pathways taken by the donor axons. <b>Epiphysial</b> axons normally first extend ventrally from {{their position in the}} dorsal diencephalon and then turn and extend anteriorly in the ventral diencephalon. When transplanted to ectopic sites at other axial levels of the brain, where in principle the axons could extend in any direction, <b>epiphysial</b> axons consistently extended ventrally. Furthermore, following initial ventral extension ectopic <b>epiphysial</b> axons turned randomly in the anterior and posterior directions. These results suggest that the cues for ventral extension are widely distributed along the rostrocaudal axis of the zebrafish brain, but the cues for subsequent anterior extension are restricted to the site where the <b>epiphysial</b> axons normally turn longitudinally...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} studies on whether the amount of radioactive sulphur S^ accumulated in the <b>epiphysial</b> cartilage varies according to the differences in age, and on how it is affected by various hormones administered previously.

(2) The per cent dose of S^ per unit weight of the <b>epiphysial</b> cartilage of normal albino rats was in inverse proportion to their age (and their weight); the older (the heavier) the animal, the smaller was the value.

40|$|Little {{work has}} been {{recorded}} in this country on the interesting problem of {{the rate of growth}} of the skeleton in normal children. Most of the published papers have come from America, and of particular note are those of Anderson and Green (1948), who investigated the growth of the lower limb from the age of five years until the date of <b>epiphysial</b> closure, and who later investigated the rate of growth of the femur and tibia after epiphysiodesis for leg discrepancy. The basic purpose of this work is particularly in its application to those difficult orthopaedic problems of leg discrepancy, and paralytic and idiopathic scoliosis, and their attempted correction by growth arrest before <b>epiphysial</b> closure. in addition it is desirable that some figures on the subject of growth of British children should be put on record, as most of the tables of growth prediction are based on observations made on American children.

This study reports the changes in the <b>epiphysial</b> cartilage caused by the suppression of its blood supply. The changes caused by the interruption of the <b>epiphysial</b> blood flow will be described first and a description of the changes produced by interrupting the metaphysial circulation will follow. METHOD Forty six-weeks-old chinchilla rabbits, averaging 1, 100 grammes in weight, were used. Operations were done on both tibiae under general anaesthesia (Nembutal and ether). In the right tibia a small hole was drilled on the medial side of the tibial epiphysis, avoiding so far as possible any direct damage to the growth plate. A small flat spatula was introduced through the drill hole until it reached approximately to the centre of the epiphysis when it was moved in a circular sweep in a plane parallel to the <b>epiphysial</b> cartilage. The cavity thus produced was packed with a strip of polythene film to prevent revascularisation. The lateral side of the epiphysis was left undisturbed to serve as a control. In the left tibia a similar technique was used but the block was placed on the metaphysial side of the growth cartilage and at a sufficient distance to prevent direct damage to it.

40|$|A growing {{epiphysis}} {{contains a}} nucleus of bone which enlarges by endochondral ossification of adjacent cartilage. <b>Epiphysial</b> blood vessels are intimately concerned in this process, whereby avascular cartilage is destroyed {{and replaced by}} vascular bone. Interruption of the <b>epiphysial</b> blood supply is generally believed {{to be responsible for}} Perthes ’ disease of the femoral head and a number of similar disorders, collectively designated “ osteochondritis. ” Radiology is the principal investigation employed in the diagnosis of these diseases, and histological material is rarely available for study (Gall and Bennett 1942; Haythorn 1949). Consequently, pathological knowledge is incomplete. The purpose of the experiments described in this paper has been to produce infarction of a growing epiphysis and to study the resulting growth disturbance both radiologically and histologically. The epiphysis studied was that of the rabbit metatarsal, which was selected because it is accessible and may readily be infarcted.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} in order to clarify histological age changes in the femur of the mouse with special reference to the appearance of ossification centers {{and the growth of}} the distal metaphysial region. Observation was performed using 140 mice of the bc strain ranging in age from the 16 th day in fetal life to 336 days in postnatal life. Sections were prepared longitudinally as exactly as possible, being stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The presence of the thin perichondral bone plate and the ossification center in the diaphysis was already noticed as early as the 16 th day in fetal age. On the other hand, the formation of the ossification center in the distal epiphysis was observed to begin on 5 days after birth. During the course of development of the <b>epiphysial</b> ossificafion, the <b>epiphysial</b> plate was found to consist of three layers, a) resting cartilage cells, b) proliferating cartilage cells and c) hypertrophic cartilage cells. On 15 and 20 days of postnatal age, the <b>epiphysial</b> plate showed a maximum in width and decreased afterward. Although the resting cartilage cells disappeared on the stage of 60 days and the other cartilage cellular elements in the plate decreased in number progressively from this stage onward, even on 336 days, a time when was the final stage of the observation, afew cartilage cells were still seen remaining and the perforation of the <b>epiphysial</b> plate by the medullary cavity was still not found to occur. Alizarin red S stain, roentogenologic and histological methods have been extensively applied to the study of bone, and recently WIRTSCHAFTER (' 60) published an atlas entitled "Genesis of mouse skeleton" in which the former two methods were employed. Studies on normal age changes of bones by the use of histological method have already been made in mice (CHEN ' 52; SILBERBERG and SILBERBERG ' 41; ZORZOLI ' 48) as well as in rats. These studies, however, have been based on the observation of specimens obtained mainly from the tibia and sternum in mice, and there are some differences in the rate of skeletal growth in different bones.

Blount (1937) presented a personal series of thirten cases and reviewed fifteen cases from the literature. He called the condition tibia vara and suggested that the term osteochondrosis was more appropriate than osteochondritis. Further reports of single or small numbers of cases were followed by a review of twenty-three cases by Langenskiold (1952). Altogether nearly 100 cases have been published (Gailey 1956). This paper reviews a personal series of thirty-one cases, twenty-eight in infants and three in adolescents. Tibia vara seems to be particularly common and severe in the West Indies. In this series, unlike those of Blount and of Langenskiold, the condition affected boys (seventeen) more commonly than girls (eleven).
