5|$|The Shumen {{fortress}} (on Bulgarian language: Shumenska krepost), {{also known}} as the old town of Shumen, is an archaeological site. It was built over a hill which gives a commanding view of the Shumen city. The fortress is located within the park. The fortress formed the town of Shumen during the First and Second Bulgarian Empire (12th – 14th centuries). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> developed citadel during the 14th century. Thracians ruled over the territory from the 5th to 2nd century BC, followed by Romans who ruled from first century BC to 3rd century AD, and then by the early Byzantine from 4th to 6th century AD. The site consisted of refined residences, religious buildings, and defense fortifications. When the Ottomans took control of the fortress in 1444, the then King Władysław III of Poland (Varnenchik) (1440–1444) of Polish-Hungarian descent attempted an attack on the Ottomans which proved to be disastrous, as he was killed during the Battle of Varna. Following this battle the fortress was looted and gutted, and the Ottoman rulers eventually abandoned the fortress completely. It has since been partially restored.|$|E
