500|$|... 50 Cent told NME {{that the}} song is the one he wished he'd written: [...] "I had his poster on my wall. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> moonwalkin' around my bedroom. I'd love to have written any Michael Jackson song, so maybe start {{with one of the}} greatest." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{sold his}} {{construction}} company in 1978 {{to buy the}} Radici & Wise funny car operation. He initially {{did not have enough}} experience with funny cars to start the car. He had to get a friend with alcohol experience to start the car. He went across the United States for three months with Sid Waterman at California to learn about the car. Hofmann said, [...] "He wanted me to be a hands-on racer, not just a driver. So <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> take the engine apart and put it together about ten times. He felt it would help my driving if I had a better mechanical understanding of the car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{cared for}} <b>me,</b> why couldn't <b>he</b> <b>have</b> told <b>me</b> so at once, and not <b>had</b> <b>me</b> wait till <b>he</b> got to Venice? He knew I--" ...|$|R

2500|$|... “About {{this time}} the whole Carlisle School made a visit to Philadelphia. [...] A meeting was held in a large hall, and Captain Pratt spoke {{of the work of}} the school, and how all the Indian boys and girls were doing. [...] Then John Wanamaker had me come up on the stage. [...] He told the {{audience}} that I was working for him and that I was a Carlisle boy. [...] He stated that I had been promoted from one department to another, every month getting better work and better money, and {{in spite of the fact}} that he employed as many as one thousand people in his establishment, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me.</b> [...] That brought considerable applause, and Captain Pratt was very proud of me.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, Hall and the design team took a research trip to Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, where they met a team of DARPA-funded researchers who were pioneering the new field of 'soft robotics' using inflatable vinyl, which ultimately inspired Baymax's inflatable, vinyl, truly huggable design. Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot." [...] Hall stated that the technology [...] "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruno {{took the}} fight to Lewis, but Lewis won the first round. Bruno then went on the {{offensive}} and took the second round, with Lewis trying to use his left jab to win points. Bruno hit Lewis {{on the right of}} his head in the third round, which shook him. Lewis later said that [...] "It didn't hurt me", but the punch concentrated Lewis' efforts on the job in hand. At the end of the sixth round, both Castellano and Roth had the fight level at 57–57, with Morgan scoring the fight 59–55 in favour of Bruno. At the start of the seventh round Bruno hit Lewis with a left jab and continued with a series of short punches. Lewis said [...] "He thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me...</b> but actually I just lost my footing. I saw every punch coming". Lewis then hit Bruno with a looping left hook which staggered him, and continued with a series of head punches. Lewis said [...] "I saw him drop his right hand and just came out with my left hook". In a momentary break during the onslaught, Lewis was warned by Vann for stiff-arming with his left hand. Upon resuming Lewis finished off Bruno, who was by then staggering on unsteady legs and completely unable to defend himself. Vann stopped the fight one minute and twelve seconds into the seventh round.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes;--Mr. Greystock. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> asked <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> asked <b>me</b> {{to be his}} wife. I {{thought he}} loved me. I hoped he did, at least. Oh dear, I did so hope it! And he does!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought this}} very convincing and attentive. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> taken <b>me</b> {{in up to}} that point about the light, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{certainly}} taken <b>me</b> in.|$|R
60|$|After this {{we walked}} along {{in silence for}} a few feet. Now that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> he was evidently at a loss what to do next.|$|E
60|$|In another instant <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> by the throat. His grasp {{was that}} of a band of steel, and I thought for a surety my last hour had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{man said}} they had no rooms vacant at the Commercial Hotel," [...] said the coach driver. [...] "So <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> drive the party to Dr. Karley's Private Sanitarium." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] I begged. [...] "Oh, don't.

6000|$|... --O, don't be talking! she said. He's a {{caution to}} rattlesnakes. He's in there now with his lawbooks finding out {{the law of}} libel. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>me</b> heartscalded. Wait till I show you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Build a house {{whenever}} we wish!" [...] he repeated, with that astonished look which threatened {{to become the}} permanent expression of his face--so long as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> to talk with, at any rate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Phew! {{but that}} was a narrow escape and no mistake," [...] was the comment of the big youth, after he could catch his breath. [...] "I thought sure <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> by the foot!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> on the hip; for Città di Castello {{had been}} among {{the first of the}} towns to lose its liberty, and, unlike others, had borne its {{servitude}} with more equanimity than was honourable.|$|E
50|$|My soul shall {{rejoice in}} the Lord, for <b>He</b> <b>has</b> clothed <b>me</b> with a robe of {{salvation}} and covered {{me with a}} tunic of happiness; <b>He</b> <b>has</b> crowned <b>me</b> as a bridegroom and adorned me with jewels as a bride.|$|R

60|$|In vain I {{tried to}} break away from him. He exerted all of his strength, and being but a boy, I was no match for him. In another moment <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> hard against the rail.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw through}} his game of getting {{satisfaction}} out of John Paul thro' goading me, and determined {{he should have}} his fill of it. For, all in all, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> mad enough to fight three times over.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess not," [...] Payne replied. [...] "Mr. Brandon's name is there, but {{the entry}} is against myself. It was a {{straight}} fight when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> fired, {{and he took}} me back when he found I was down and out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for my father, {{the very}} threats which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> used make <b>me</b> {{conscious}} that I {{have only to}} measure the price. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> told <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> will stop my allowance." ...|$|R
5000|$|He said, [...] "Lo, I am God's servant; God <b>has</b> given <b>me</b> the Book, {{and made}} me a Prophet.

6000|$|... "Bah! I am {{not afraid}} of him. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> foul over to the Golden Pick, but I'll be careful when next we meet. But I'll not waste time with you here, Rasco. I've got you alone and 'dead men tell no tales.'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>me.</b> I wasn't {{stopping}} at any hotel, and, since I {{did not know}} the name of a hotel in the place, I could not claim residence in any of them. Also, I was up too early in the morning. Everything was against me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I will." [...] He {{gripped the}} sill, {{and had his}} knee on it in an instant. [...] "Now, Roddy, give me your hands." [...] With a pull <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> up beside him, {{and a moment later}} we were both in the haunted house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what you must do, mamma. You mustn't stir from this at all. You must give up going to Caversham altogether, unless he {{promises}} to bring us back. I won't stir;--unless <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>me</b> carried out of the house.' ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{recovered}} my consciousness, I {{was lying}} on the couch in my own study.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said hurriedly, [...] "I {{knew what}} you would say; it was against the Queen's Regulations--and--there was his {{sensitive}} nature which shrinks from even a harsh word; but I did it, and of course <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>me</b> in his power." ...|$|R
