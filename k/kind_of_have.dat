He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the backspace key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to {{go back and look at}} your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|E
500|$|Brad Renfro stars {{alongside}} McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, {{and by the end}} of the picture he had to become this empty vessel." [...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, [...] "It's a trip I have to take. People just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to leave me alone when I'm doing it. It's my job."

500|$|The Virginia Tech defense {{looked to}} recover from its slide during the last five games of the regular season. During the Hokies' first eight games (all wins), Tech gave up averages of 10.5points, 267.5total yards and 40.8rushing yards per game. In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack.

500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, vocalist and pianist Andrew McMahon and Partington had discussions on what they wanted the album to sound like. They decided they wanted it to [...] "sound like a winter album", in {{contrast}} to Leaving Through the Window which they felt sounded like a [...] "summer album". Partington elaborated: [...] "We really wanted it to feel, not sad and somber really but just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> a broody feeling." [...] McMahon and Partington wrote songs separately. Partington had written six songs on the album before entering the studio. While touring Europe, the US went to war in Iraq. According to Partington, the group did not [...] "want to be playing a show when there's something so much more important going on." [...] As a result, the band cancelled {{the remainder of the}} tour, and returned to the US. Partington recalled that he and McMahon did [...] "a lot of writing" [...] together, and were [...] "really happy with the songs we had" [...] going into the studio.|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Keith Wallen and bassist Aaron Bruch {{performed}} all of {{the background}} vocals on Dark Before Dawn, unlike previous albums on which Burnley performed his own. Burnley stated that background vocals were worked on the most in regard to producing, elaborating on That Metal Show, [...] "Because, guitars are guitars, you know, I mean, what are you gonna do, you can tune them and all these things, but singing is a totally different animal so that's where {{we spent a lot}} of time. Because when you're playing guitar you can kinda let your style come through, but if you're singing [...] somebody you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> to sound like them for it to really gel, so they really altered, I guess their personality."

[...] She also added [...] "Right now we're working on collecting and creating the sound first before we even start working on the lyrical direction or melodies. I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> an idea though, and it's very rough right now. So I'm very eager to start that." [...] Sean Garrett spoke on the album's sound saying it was [...] "a great mish-mash of genres". Rihanna revealed during an interview with GQ's [...] "Men of the Year" [...] that she wanted her music to be uplifting saying [...] "I want to make music that’s hopeful, uplifting. Nothing corny or supersentimental. I just want it to {{have the feeling that}} brings you out of whatever you’re going through. I want it to spark that fire. I want it to be real, authentic, and raw." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is {{specifically}} about dealing with time apart in relationships and familial issues whilst on the road. The album's more serious tone {{has been attributed to}} the developing family life of the band (including new marriages and children). Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Catalyst marked a move toward slightly more mature and serious material about relationships and life issues That lyrical direction is even more pronounced on Coming Home." [...] The band were particularly inspired by early Beatles records, seeing Chad Gilbert working on penning lyrics alongside Pundik and primary lyricist Steve Klein for the first time. Gilbert explained that, [...] "I've always {{been a part of the}} music and I've always written the music for the band, but I've never been a part of the lyrics. This time I just kind of felt like in order to <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> the best record, we had to do things different. That's what made it stand out like that." [...] Regarding the album title, Gilbert detailed that the songs [...] "are all sort of tied together by this theme of wanting to go home", while drummer Cyrus Bolooki said that the title track was one of the first songs written for the album and after assessing the lyrics [...] "it was a phrase that sat well with we wanted the record to communicate." ...|$|E
