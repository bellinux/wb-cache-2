5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E

25|$|Oddly enough, the Annals of Joseon Dynasty never {{mentions}} the map although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> a national project. Another interesting {{fact is that}} this map uses the Ming Chinese era name Jianwen. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to Zhu Di in a civil war, the new emperor banned {{the use of the}} era name Jianwen in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name Hongwu, not Jianwen. However, the era name Jianwen can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.|$|E

Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E
500|$|According to Emily Mackay of NME, [...] "Million Reasons" [...] {{serves as}} a [...] "potent, sky-clutching {{reminder}} of Gaga's way with a bare-bone ballad". Idolator's Patrick Bowman agreed and {{described it as a}} [...] "country-tinged [...] quiet ballad" [...] while Stephen L. Betts from Rolling Stone called it a pop song which had a country music appeal, similar to singer Beyoncé's [...] "Daddy Lessons". Michael Cragg from The Guardian found this reminiscent of Carrie Underwood's characteristic style, which he called country balladry. Lyndsey Parker from Yahoo! Music joked that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> written by country music artists. In the composition, the singer's vocals are layered among [...] "faintly strummed guitars" [...] and varying degrees of percussion.

500|$|With the film's {{critical}} and financial success, Disney and Spielberg felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> {{time to plan}} a second installment. J. J. Abrams says that he met Spielberg in 1989 to discuss working on a sequel, {{to the extent of}} preparing an outline and storyboards. [...] More substantial work was done by Nat Mauldin, who wrote a prequel titled Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon, set in 1941. Similar to the previous film, Toon Platoon featured many cameo appearances by characters from the golden Age of American animation. It began with Roger Rabbit's early years, living on a farm in the Midwestern United States. With human Richie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi Germany broadcasts. Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe accompanied by several other toons in their Army platoon. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother, and father: Bugs Bunny.|$|E
500|$|While {{the book}} Lone Survivor chronicles Marcus Luttrell's 1999 {{enlistment}} and training, {{as well as}} his 2005 deployment to Afghanistan, Berg decided that the film adaptation would focus mainly on the events of the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, as well as the bonding and camaraderie of Luttrell and his fallen teammates. Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. [...] "My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed", he said. [...] "I went to New York and met the Murphys. I went to Colorado and met the Dietzes, and I went to Northern California and met the Axelsons. After spending time with them, you realize that these kids were the best and the brightest; they were the stars of the families. The grief and the wounds are still very raw. You would have to be inhuman to not feel the responsibility when that kind of grief gets shared with you." [...] Berg also expressed that he was motivated by the families to make the story as realistic as possible; his goal was [...] "to put [...] into the experience of what these guys went through. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> a traumatic and violent and exhausting experience".|$|E

500|$|The PC and Xbox One {{releases}} of Fragments of Him received [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, {{according to the}} review aggregator site Metacritic. On Steam, the game varies between 80% and 90% positive reviews. Reviewers said {{that because of the}} graphics, as well as the slow pace of the game, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> created for casual gamers. Bob Richardson of the website RPGFan said that it might not be for everyone, and would appeal to those who like relaxing video games. He said that the design of the graphics might be too minimalistic for today, although he liked it and thought that it worked well with the game. He said that it was worth trying out and that the time the creators had put into making the game was obvious. Jose Rodriguez of the website IGN praised the [...] "deep and realistic" [...] story and said that the game gave priority to the narrative, and that it will appeal to casual gamers because of its realism and leisurely gameplay. Rodriguez criticised the duration of the game saying, that it is quite short for its price. Andrea Maderna, also from IGN, said that the game was not suited for everybody, but that those who appreciate games based on interactive storytelling should try playing it.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges' view of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{was taken}} up by H. W. Garrod in his 1926 {{analysis}} of Keats's poems. As Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944, Garrod believed that the problem within Keats's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem. When describing the fourth stanza of the poem, Maurice Ridley, in 1933, claimed, [...] "And so comes the stanza, with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes, one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which Keats fires the most ordinary material." [...] He later declared of the seventh stanza: [...] "And now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet whiter heat, the stanza that would, I suppose, by common consent be taken, along with Kubla Khan, as offering us the distilled sorceries of 'Romanticism'". He concluded on the stanza that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any reader who has watched Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes, and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining, will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which, in the draft we have, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> written down." [...] In 1936, F. R. Leavis wrote, [...] "One remembers the poem both as recording, and as being for the reader, an indulgence." [...] Following Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, in a 1938 essay, saw the poem as [...] "a very rich poem. It contains some complications which we must not gloss over if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged." [...] Brooks would later argue in The Well-Wrought Urn (1947) that the poem was thematically unified while contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem.|$|E
