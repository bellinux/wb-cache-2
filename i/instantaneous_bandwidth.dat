5000|$|In {{practice}} an electrically small antenna is {{one that}} is operated at a frequency below its natural resonance. [...] Small antennas are characterised by low radiation resistance and relatively high reactance, so that a tuning component must be added in series with the antenna to cancel its reactance and assist matching to the circuit to which it is connected. The addition of this extra component creates a tuned circuit, with a Q-factor that potentially limits the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>bandwidth</b> available for signals passing through the antenna. This is a fundamental limit that sets a minimum size for any antenna used at a given frequency and with a given required bandwidth.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{point of}} {{contrast}} is the expected bandwidth {{of the signal}} and local oscillator. Typically, an RF local oscillator is a pure frequency; pragmatically, [...] "purity" [...] means that a local oscillator's frequency bandwidth is much {{much less than the}} difference frequency. With optical signals, even with a laser, it is not simple to produce a reference frequency sufficiently pure to have either an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>bandwidth</b> or long term temporal stability that is less than a typical megahertz or kilohertz scale difference frequency.

40|$|Abstract—We {{formulate}} a Bayesian congestion control problem {{in which a}} source must select the transmission rate over a network whose available bandwidth is modeled as a timehomogeneous finite-state Markov Chain. The decision to transmit at a rate below the <b>instantaneous</b> available <b>bandwidth</b> results in an under-utilization of the resource while transmission at rates higher than the available bandwidth results in a linear penalty. The trade-off is further complicated by the asymmetry in the information acquisition process: transmission rates that happen to be larger than the <b>instantaneous</b> available <b>bandwidth</b> result in perfect observation {{of the state of}} the bandwidth process. In contrast, when transmission rate is below the <b>instantaneous</b> available <b>bandwidth,</b> only a (potentially rather loose) lower bound on the available bandwidth is revealed. We show that the problem of maximizing the throughput of the source while avoiding congestion loss can be expressed as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).
