5|$|The gangsters/gun-runners {{who own the}} {{ammunition}} dump arrive and block {{the road in front}} of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. The gangsters threaten the family, but Commander Pott throws the switch which transforms the car into an aeroplane and they take off, leaving the gangsters in helpless fury. The Potts stay overnight in a hotel in Calais. While the family sleeps, the gangsters break into the children's room and kidnap them and <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> towards Paris. Chitty tracks the gangsters' route, wakes Commander and Mrs. Pott, and they <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{achievement}} of {{a convoy of}} merchants not only escaping without loss from a French squadron, but {{going so far as}} to attack, <b>drive</b> <b>off,</b> and then pursue their would-be predators, was widely hailed as a signal victory.|$|E

5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th. Unable to break square to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> the French infantry {{because of the presence of}} French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.|$|E
5|$|Helped by Draco's Union Corse, Bond mounts an air assault {{against the}} clinic and Blofeld. Whilst the clinic is destroyed, Blofeld escapes down a bobsled run and {{although}} Bond gives chase Blofeld escapes. Bond flies to Germany where he marries Tracy. The two of them <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> on honeymoon and, a few hours later, Blofeld and Bunt drive past, machine gunning them: Tracy is killed in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tate, {{still in}} love with Violet, is {{concerned}} that she is lonely. He attempts to kill Gabriel Ramos (Brennan Mejia), thinking he might be a better boyfriend for Violet, but she stops Tate, and gives him a goodbye kiss, allowing the boy to escape. Gabriel and his family flee the home, while the Harmons happily watch them <b>drive</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

5|$|While this {{duty was}} {{relatively}} uneventful, Balch did twice encounter German submarines. On 29 January 1918, while steaming off Liverpool, she dropped two depth charges over a diving U-boat, without effect. Then, on 12 May, the destroyer joined other escorts in depth-charging a U-boat spotted near convoy HS 60, with Balch dropping 12 depth charges that helped <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> the submarine.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came within range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E

5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1974 season, pitching to a 3–8 win-loss record and 4.54 ERA through July 10. Subsequently he won eight consecutive games and nine out of ten, pitching seven completed games in that ten-game stretch. A line <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> of the bat of Willie Montañez fractured the fifth metacarpal bone in Ellis' pitching hand on September 10, prematurely ending his season. Ellis had the seventh best walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio (1.155). The Pirates won the NL East, but they lost the 1974 NLCS three games to one to the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|Megan and Dolph {{infiltrate}} the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham {{to join them}} as well, but Graham nervously declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over. They <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents (Mink Stole and Bud Cort) attending a PFLAG meeting {{to come to terms}} with their daughter's homosexuality.|$|E

50|$|When the car finally slows down, {{the actor}} accuses Bill {{of trying to}} steal the Tourist car. The two men fight while the family regains the car and <b>drives</b> <b>off.</b> Bill realizes {{that they are in}} danger, and follows after them to warn them. The Stack family <b>drives</b> <b>off</b> the road into a fence, and all are fine. They are at their home.|$|R
5000|$|When {{used for}} many {{industrial}} processes, bituminous coal {{must first be}} [...] "coked" [...] to remove volatile components. Coking is achieved by heating the coal {{in the absence of}} oxygen, which <b>drives</b> <b>off</b> volatile hydrocarbons such as propane, benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons, and some sulfur gases. This also <b>drives</b> <b>off</b> a considerable amount of the contained water of the bituminous coal.|$|R
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} a ship that was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. Lastly, in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had been carrying wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, General Walton Walker, {{in command}} of the Eighth Army, {{dispatched}} part of the 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th US Infantry Division, to attack north from the 25th Division's zone to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> 4th North Korean Division troops moving into Yongsan. Simultaneously, Church assembled all the combat service support soldiers he could and formed them into a combat unit to block further penetration of North Korean forces, which were setting up roadblocks on the roads from Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|Rowley, {{stationed}} at Saint-Paul {{to the west}} of Saint-Denis, received word that Africaine had arrived at Saint Denis and immediately sought to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> the French blockade. Sailing eastwards, Boadicea came within sight of Bouvet's squadron at 15:00 and the British flagship followed by the small brigs HMS Otter and HMS Staunch. Corbet recognised Rowley's intention and joined the attack, embarking 25 soldiers from the 86th Regiment of Foot to replace his losses at Grand Bay. The French, still believing Africaine to be Boadicea, assumed that Boadicea was an East Indiaman named Windham in disguise, and fell back towards Isle de France before the British force.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of P'ohang-dong was an {{engagement}} between the United Nations and North Korean forces {{early in the}} Korean War, with fighting continuing from 5–20 August 1950 around the town of P'ohang-dong, South Korea. It {{was a part of}} the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after their forces were able to <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> an attempted offensive by three North Korean divisions in the mountainous eastern coast of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{action was}} the first of two in this {{campaign}} in which lone British frigates were briefly overwhelmed by superior French forces as they sailed independently to join Rowley's squadron. On each occasion however, Rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and <b>drive</b> <b>off</b> the French attackers. Corbet's action was particularly violent, British casualties totalling 49 killed and 114 wounded, including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked. Africaine was seriously damaged and would not be ready to return to active service for some months. French losses were less severe, Astrée suffering one killed and two wounded, Iphigénie nine killed and 33 wounded.|$|E
