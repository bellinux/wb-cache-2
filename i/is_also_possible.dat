5|$|Although no {{polynomial}} time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm {{can be used to}} list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to list them in {{polynomial time}} per clique.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age barrows at Selworthy Beacon and an Iron Age {{enclosure}} at Furzebury Brake, west of {{the town}} show evidence of prehistoric occupation of the area, although there <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> evidence in the intertidal area, where {{the remains of a}} submerged forest still exist.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to explain}} why zero is even without {{referring}} to formal definitions. The following explanations {{make sense of the}} idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E
5|$|The Cygwin {{emulation}} {{layer is}} another way of running Perl under Windows. Cygwin provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, and both Perl and CPAN are available as standard pre-compiled packages in the Cygwin setup program. Since Cygwin also includes gcc, compiling Perl from source <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

5|$|A , or , is one {{of three}} senior members of the Yamayuri Council, {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to generally speak of {{all the members of the}} Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E
5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E

5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|According to Pausanias {{he was the}} son of Diotimus. Ancient {{commentators}} mention {{an association}} between Milo and the philosopher Pythagoras, who lived at or near Croton for many years. Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of Samos, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award, the prize is {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one right fielder. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions.

5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible,</b> but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
