A (2) Hj. Noor Maulidiyah, M. A This study {{identified}} the word split at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> on national column on “The Jakarta Pos” editorial. The {{purposes of this}} research are; to identify the way the Jakarta Post editorial splits the words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line,</b> to find the approach that the Jakarta Post applies in splitting the words and to find the words split in national column on The Jakarta Post editorial based on its approach and frequency, so {{this can be a}} sharing forum in improving the quality of English language in the future. To collect the data, the writer used one method: library-based research and two techniques: reading and online. The data were processed through editing, coding, classification, and interpretation of data. Then, all data were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. It can be concluded that actually the words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> on national column on The Jakarta Post are split in a proper way. It uses hyphen (-) in splitting the words and applies a proper approach, but the writer found there are some words including proper names are split at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> not based on either (phonetic and morphological) and it is better not to divide a proper name at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line.</b> The Jakarta Post editorial applies two approaches in splitting the words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line,</b> they are phonetic and morphological. Phonetic is dividing the word in term of syllable structure while morphological is dividing the word in term of word structure. In this research the writer takes 20 editions of The Jakarta Post editorial and find there are 1. 031 words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> are split in phonetic approach, 429 words at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> are split in morphological approach and 428 words including proper names at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> are split not based on either...|$|R

This paper deals with design and evaluation of a novel nonlinear control scheme based on input output feedback linearization technique for improving power transmission line dynamics. The simulation results indicate that with proposed nonlinear control, the C-UPFC is capable of independently controlling the active and reactive power flows at the both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> and the magnitude of AC voltage at line mid point.

40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} of line continuum with new matrices of elastic and inertia stiffness is introduced in this research. The matrices were developed using Ritz method and assumed six term Taylor’s series shape function. Two deformable nodes were introduced at the centre {{and at the}} <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> continuum which brings the number of deformable node to six. The six term Taylor’s series shape function assumed was substituted into strain energy equation and into inertia work (Kinetic energy) equation. Their resulting functional were minimized, resulting in 6 x 6 elastic stiffness matrix and 6 x 6 inertia stiffness matrix respectively, for vibration analysis. The two matrices were employed, {{as well as the}} traditional 4 x 4 matrices in classical free vibration {{analysis of}} four line continua with different boundary condition. The results from the new 6 x 6 matrices of elastic and inertia stiffness were very close to exact results, with average percentage difference of 0. 212425421 % from exact solution. Whereas those from the traditional 4 x 4 matrices and 5 x 5 matrices differed from exact results with average percentage difference of 14. 72352281 % and 0. 275 % respectively. Thus the newly developed 6 x 6 matrices of elastic and inertia stiffness are suitable for classical free vibration analysis of line continu...|$|E

30|$|In [18], {{support vector machine}} (SVM) {{has been}} used for fault {{detection}} but it has the demerits of large training data and more memory requirements. The limitations of method suggested in [19] are that it requires large training data and AC section faults are not realized. Several artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used for AC lines [20, 21] but detection of fault in DC lines from onshore wind has not been discussed. Four-terminal HVDC system during wind speed and power variations with onshore grid faults has been discussed in [22]. It focused on fault ride through capability and not on section identification. Wavelet techniques suggested in [23] for wind farm protection requires high sampling frequency which is practically difficult to analyze. It also depends on information from both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>line.</b> It uses detail coefficients which has the disadvantage of small standard deviation [23]. In [24, 25, 26], detailed modeling of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) has been studied. Its properties are compared with asynchronous and synchronous machines. In [27], a protection system for multi-terminal system based on the supplemental inductor placed {{at both ends of the}} DC line has been proposed. Drawback of the scheme is that main protection may not identify the high-resistance faults. Hence back up protection is required which needs data from both ends.|$|E
40|$|Detection and {{localization}} {{problem of}} extended small-scale objects with different shapes appears in radio observation systems which use SAR, infra-red, lidar and television camera. Intensive non-stationary background {{is the main}} difficulty for processing. Other challenge is low quality of images, blobs, blurred boundaries; in addition SAR images suffer from a serious intrinsic speckle noise. Statistics of background is not normal, it has evident skewness and heavy tails in probability density, so {{it is hard to}} identify it. The problem of extraction small-scale objects is solved here on the basis of directional filtering, adaptive thresholding and morthological analysis. New kind of masks is used which are open-ended at one side so it is possible to extract <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments with unknown length. An advanced method of dynamical adaptive threshold setting is investigated which is based on isolated fragments extraction after thresholding. Hierarchy of isolated fragments on binary image is proposed for the analysis of segmentation results. It includes small-scale objects with different shape, size and orientation. The method uses extraction of isolated fragments in binary image and counting points in these fragments. Number of points in extracted fragments is normalized to the total number of points for given threshold and is used as effectiveness of extraction for these fragments. New method for adaptive threshold setting and control maximises effectiveness of extraction. It has optimality properties for objects extraction in normal noise field and shows effective results for real SAR images...|$|E
40|$|Shapes - {{taken as}} {{well-defined}} collections of lines - are fundamental building blocks in architectural drawings. From doodles to shop drawings, shapes {{are used to}} denote ideas and represent elements of design, many of which ultimately translate into actual objects. But because designs evolve, the shapes representing a design are seldom static - instead, they are perpetually open to transformations. And since transformations involve relationships, conventional methods of describing shapes as sets of discrete endpoints may not provide an appropriate foundation for schematic design. This paper begins with {{a review of the}} perception of shapes and its significance in design. In particular, it argues that juxtapositions and inter-relationships of shapes are important seedbeds for creative development of designs. It is clear that conventional representation of shapes as sets of discrete lines does not cope with these -emergenti subshapes, the most basic of which arise out of intersecting and colinear lines. Attempts to redress this by using “reduction rules” based on traditional point-and-line data structures are encumbered by computational problems of precision and shape specification. Basically, this means that some “close” cases of sub-shapes may escape detection and their specifications are difficult to use in substitution operations. The paper presents the findings of a computer project - Emergence II - which explored a'relational'description of shapes based on the concept of construction lines. It builds on the notion that architectural shapes are constructed in a graphic context and that, at a basic compositional level, the context can be set by construction lines. Accordingly, the interface enables the delineation of line segments with reference to pre-established construction lines. This results in a simple data structure where the knowledge of shapes is centralized in a lookup table of all its construction lines rather than dispersed in the specifications of line segments. Taking this approach, the prototype software shows the ease and efficiency of applying “reduction rules” for intersection and colinear conditions, and for finding emergent sub-shapes by simply tracking the construction lines delimiting the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segments...|$|E
