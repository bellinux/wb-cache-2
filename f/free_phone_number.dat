5000|$|In New Zealand, both [...] "0800" [...] or [...] "0508" [...] prefixes are {{referred}} to variously and interchangeably as [...] "free phone" [...] or [...] "toll-free". Originally these [...] "Oh-eight-hundred" [...] numbers were provided by Telecom NZ and [...] "0508" [...] by rival company Clear (now Vodafone New Zealand), although now both numbers can be provided by either company. Some older toll bar services designed to restrict toll calls (including long distance or calls to mobile phones) will also block calls to these <b>free</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers,</b> although this has become less common since the mid-1990s. A limited number of companies utilizing toll-free numbers will not accept calls from mobile <b>phones.</b> Some other <b>free</b> <b>phone</b> services exist, such as [...] "*555" [...] ("star five five five"), which can be dialled from cellular phones to report traffic conditions and incidents of dangerous driving.|$|R

5000|$|In Portugal, the <b>free</b> {{of charge}} <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> for {{emergency}} medical service is the Europe wide 112 (emergency telephone number).

In continental Portugal medical emergency calls are directed to one of INEM's urgent patient guidance centers (centro de orientação de doentes urgentes) or CODU's. There are four regional CODU's; Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Faro. Additionally, there is the CODU-Mar that responds to maritime medical emergencies.|$|R
40|$|All states {{allow the}} public to {{anonymously}} report suspicions of child abuse or neglect to a toll <b>free</b> central <b>phone</b> <b>number.</b> An extensive examination of the policy and practices behind anonymous reporting hotlines indicates that they are widely unregulated and susceptible to abuse. The possible repercussions of an anonymous phone call create costs to the family and society which do not outweigh the potential benefit of allowing anonymous public reports. Under the guise of protecting children, the law has developed {{in such a way}} that it infringes on the fundamental rights of parents and children. At the same time, anonymous reporting overburdens the system, causing us to overlook some child maltreatment that can be, and is otherwise, addressed through confidential and mandatory reporting. Given the severity of the rights and lives at stake, it is time to abolish anonymous public reporting of suspected child maltreatment...|$|R
50|$|A {{major issue}} for the XBAND service was <b>free</b> long-distance <b>phone</b> calls.

40|$|Globally, {{there is}} a {{shortage}} of health workers in rural areas. Effective health systems depend on having sufficient, accessible health workers with the right skills. In countries like Nepal, highly skilled health workers often prefer to work overseas or in urban centres, and therefore, in the short term, it may be pragmatic to focus on ensuring support and skills development of mid level or paramedical health workers. Information technology has the potential to support these health workers. We describe a pilot intervention undertaken in Gulmi District, whereby all mid level health workers in the district have been provided with a <b>free</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> to call three General Practitioner Doctors (GPs) in the District Hospital. The intervention aims to increase appropriate referral, and increase connectivity between the District centre and peripheral health facilities. We hope that our intervention will provide support to rural health workers, and, if implemented as part of a package of interventions, may increase retention. We present some initial findings from discussions with health workers and analysis of call-log data, and describe our next phase evaluation and possible scale-up. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Keywords: human resources; mobile phone; mhealth; Nepal; retention; rural...|$|E
40|$|A {{counterfeit}} medicine is {{one which is}} deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to identity or source. Counterfeiting apply to both branded and generic product which include products with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients. According to WHO, 25 % of medicines consumed in poor countries could be counterfeit or below standard. An estimate suggests that these drugs are a $ 200 billion industry worldwide. India could be {{an easy target for}} counterfeits, as the manufacturing costs is 40 % cheaper here as compared to other countries. Deputy drug controller general of India says, {{counterfeit medicine}}s often resemble the originals in chemical composition, but he thinks the biggest problem is in the packaging. A committee set up by the Indian Ministry of Health has approved a proposal to put 2 D bar codes and scratch-off labels on medicines. The user scratches off the cover and tests what is underneath to a <b>free</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> to find out if a pill is real. Quick Response (QR) codes are also being tested. These printed squares are an advanced version of the 2 D bar codes. Anyone with a camera-enabled phone and web access can scan the code and be taken instantly to the pharmacy company website to authenticate the drug. The uses of holograms, tracers, traggants and inks, plastic tags, radio frequency identification, mass encryption technology are some other techniques to limit the counterfeiting of drugs...|$|E

40|$|In 2011, a {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} in southeastern West Virginia to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live recombinant human adenovirus (serotype 5) -rabies glycoprotein vaccine (ONRAB®) in wild raccoons and skunks. ONRAB® was selected for evaluation based on the success achieved in eliminating raccoon rabies from Ontario and Quebec, Canada, through the integration of this vaccine into rabies management strategies and significantly higher sero-positivity in comparison to Raboral V-RG® in studies along the U. S. -Canada border. The field trial site was composed of forested and agricultural habitats {{in an area where}} raccoon rabies is enzootic and oral rabies vaccine (ORV) has never been used as a management strategy. The ULTRALITE bait is composed of a small blister pack that contains the ONRAB® vaccine with a waxy coating matrix of sweet attractants, impregnated with tetracycline biomarker, camouflaged by a khaki green dye. Approximately 80, 000 baits were distributed at 75 baits/km 2 mostly by fixed wing aircraft along parallel flight lines spaced at 750 m intervals. There were no phone calls related to human or pet bait contacts reported through the affixed, legible toll <b>free</b> <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> on each bait. Relatively low human population density in the study area and bait attributes that may make them less attractive to dogs could have been contributing factors resulting in no reported bait contacts. Histopathology results from up to 23 tissue types from diverse target and nontarget wildlife species samples pre (n= 290) and post-ORV (n= 300) with ONRAB® will be provided under a separate cover once the analysis is completed. No differences were observed between control and treatment captive animals, including cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), and eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestri) that received a 10 x ONRAB® dose in a companion histopathology study conducted at the Wildlife Services (WS), National Wildlife Research Center. These species that have not been previously evaluated for potential ONRAB® effects are common to the West Virginia field trial site. The proportion of raccoons categorized as sero-positive was significantly higher in (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) the post-ORV ONRAB® baiting period (49. 4...|$|E
