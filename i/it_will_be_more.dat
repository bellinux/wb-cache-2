5|$|On July 28, 2007, UN {{officials}} announced the complex would undergo a $1 billion renovation {{starting in the}} fall. Swedish firm Skanska AB won a bid to overhaul the buildings which including the Conference, General Assembly and Secretariat buildings. The renovations, {{which will be the}} first since the complex opened in 1950, are expected to take about 7 years to complete. When completed the complex is also expected to be more energy efficient and have improved security. Work began on May 5, 2008 but the project was delayed for a while. By 2009 the cost of the work had risen from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion with some estimates saying it would take up to $3 billion. Officials hope the renovated buildings will achieve a LEED Silver rating. Despite some delays and rises in construction costs, renovation on the entire UN headquarters is progressing rapidly. As of 2012, the installation of the new glass facade of the Secretariat Building is completed. The new glass wall will retain the look of the original facade but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> energy efficient. The renovation of the Secretariat building has been complete and the UN staff moved into the new building in July 2012.|$|E

They may also start to exploit other periphery countries {{to continue to}} better themselves. One of the biggest impacts of this rise of status is the effects it has {{on the people of}} these countries. Health care {{is one of the first}} major improvements these countries will see, people will no longer die en masse from diseases such as malaria and will be better treated for non-communicable diseases.|$|E
25|$|All viperids have {{a pair of}} {{relatively}} long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs {{that are used to}} inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is {{at the front of the}} mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Secondarily, it is used for self-defence, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve their precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, it takes time to replenish, leaving the snake vulnerable.|$|E

According to Paul himself, it will not cost a thing, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, [...] "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to the Ron Paul Liberty Report, {{and that is what we}} do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news." [...] Paul went on to say that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California.|$|E
500|$|Kristin Booker of {{the fashion}} website Refinery29 {{described}} the scent as a [...] "voluptuous, sexy floral". Kathleen Hou writing for New York opined that the perfume's best part {{was that it was}} inspired by a poem by Angelou. Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and vetiver extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good". With a similar opinion, Treye Green of the International Business Times noted more masculine notes with the addition of woods, cashmere, musk. She hailed Rise as a [...] "sweet treat" [...] for her fans along her self-titled album's surprise release a week earlier and noted, [...] "Beyoncé's definition of feminism has stirred quite the debate following her new album's release. But maybe her perfume version of <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> openly embraced – plus who can deny the genius of a Maya Angelou-inspired scent." [...] Madison Lafayette in an article for VIBE Vixen praised Beyoncé's decision to release Rise [...] "capitaliz off" [...] her success and [...] "giving us another reason to talk about her".|$|E
500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers {{did not want to}} build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I hope <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Sacha Tarkovsky advises women to {{not use the}} missionary {{position}} when having sex for the first time, stating, [...] "You are not in control, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> painful and you cannot do anything but lay [...] there and take it." [...] Tarkovsky recommends positions such as woman on top that allow the woman to control the speed and pressure at which she loses her hymen. However, {{it may not be}} necessary to completely forgo missionary the first time; Alphonso Sirtle suggests starting with woman on top until the hymen is torn, and then possibly switching to missionary or whatever other position is preferred.|$|E
2500|$|A {{very early}} stage of viral {{infection}} is viral entry, when the virus attaches to and enters the host cell.

2500|$|In April 1913, [...] "preshocks" [...] of the Rift's {{opening in}} [...] "End of Days" [...] {{manifested}} as ground tremors. Before {{the dawn of}} time, as with the Beast, Biblical demon Abaddon had been sealed away in Earth, using the Rift {{as a means for}} his imprisonment. This suggests that it happened [...] "before the universe's creation" [...] as with the Beast, and that the Beast's captors, the [...] "Disciples of Light" [...] may have had a hand {{in the formation of the}} Rift as they did with the gravity field in [...] "The Impossible Planet".

2500|$|Lúcia {{declared}} that the Third Secret could be {{released to the public}} after 1960.

[...] Instead, in 1960 the Vatican published an official press release stating that it was [...] "most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal." [...] This announcement triggered widespread speculation. According to the New York Times, speculation over the content of the secret ranged from [...] "worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} reform {{met with}} opposition {{not because it}} would invite outside opinion on the university's financial and academic decisions, {{but because of the}} impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university's academic reputation. Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much {{power in the hands of}} the vice-chancellor. Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions. [...] Lord Patten of Barnes has stated that without reforms to Oxford's governance <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult to raise money that the university needs to advance, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds. Similarly, Hood has stated that the issue is not [...] "whether there has to be change, but what kind of change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Delacroix {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} by his fellow Parisien Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa, a painting for which he himself modeled as the young man at the front with the outstretched arm. The pyramidal arrangement that governs Géricault's painting is similarly seen with the figures in the foreground of The Massacre at Chios. On this unlikely layout of characters, Delacroix commented, [...] "One must fill up; if it is less natural, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> beautiful and fécond. Would that everything should hold together!" [...] The dense assembly of characters at the front is {{in marked contrast to}} the open and dispersed spaces behind them. Land and sea, light and shade run appear as bands of drifting colours listlessly running into each other, and Delacroix appears to abandon the laws of perspective altogether with his rendering of clouds. The complete effect of this background is to suggest a constant opening out, dissolution and centrelessness. Aesthetician Heinrich Wölfflin identified this technique, and classified it atectonic form.|$|E
2500|$|Trump 101: The Way to Success {{is a book}} imparting {{advice and}} {{motivation}} from the authors about Trump's business acumen. The book is split into approximately twenty sets of aspirational genres, including: advising the reader to strive to better themselves, recognizing the right business opportunities when they come along, trying new things, the art of negotiation, how to gain wisdom from one's intuition, learning from failures, maintaining a sense of motivation, keeping lofty goals, and dropping efforts which do not give one passion. The authors caution about the element of risk during investing, [...] "Frequently, the risk will be well worth the gamble, but sometimes <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than you can afford". The book advises to deal with conflict prior to issues developing into larger problems. Readers are told they should practice taking onus for oneself for difficulties quickly after they ensue. The work criticizes those who constantly blame others for their problems.|$|E
