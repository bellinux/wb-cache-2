40|$|The {{performance}} of radiant heating systems (floor <b>heating,</b> <b>ceiling</b> panels) is relatively well documented. Water based systems, where pipes {{are embedded in}} the building structure, are now being increasingly used for cooling purposes. Several theoretical studies based {{on the use of}} computer simulations have been published, but very little is reported on the actual performance in existing buildings. There are still uncertainties on how such systems operate and on how well the space temperatures under varying external and internal load is kept within the comfort range. To study this aspect, field measurements of thermal comfort conditions were made in several buildings with radiant surface cooling systems. The systems comprise floor cooling, wall cooling and cooling with pipes embedded in the concrete slabs between each floor in a multi storey building. Long term measurements of operative, air, surface, system and external temperatures have been carried out. The analysis of the data shows that, for the major part of the time of occupancy, the operative temperature is inside the comfort range. The analysis has been lead for different classes of comfort according to existing standards. The data show an increase in space temperature during the day, which is counterbalanced by a corresponding decrease during the night. This study shows that hydronic radiant cooling systems in many buildings are an interesting alternative to full air conditioning systems, for obtaining acceptable indoor thermal environments during summer. 1...|$|E

40|$|Wind washing is {{a general}} term {{referring}} to diminished thermal control caused by air movement over or through a thermal barrier. The primary focus {{of this paper is}} towards a specific type of wind washing where wind can push attic air into the floor cavity between first and second stories of the home through ineffective (or missing) air barriers separating attic space from the floor cavity. A second type of wind washing studied in this project involved insulation batts on knee walls where space between the batts and the wall board allowed air movement against the gypsum wall board. During hot weather, the first type of wind washing pushes hot air into the floor cavity (between the first and second stories) thereby <b>heating</b> <b>ceiling,</b> floor, and interior wall surfaces (see Figures 1 and 2). Condensation may occur on cold supply duct surfaces within the floor cavity resulting in ceiling moisture damage. In cold climates, cold air from wind washing can chill surfaces within the interior floor space and result in frozen water pipes. Through the summer of 2009, a field study tested thirty-two two-story homes and found significant wind washing potential in 40 % of the homes. Part I of this paper will highlight the evaluation methods used and the extent of wind washing found in this study. Repairs and energy monitoring were completed in six of these homes to evaluate retrofit methods and cost effectiveness of retrofit solutions. These results are discussed in Part II of this paper.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of a {{european}} project dealing {{with the issue of}} transport safety improvement in fog conditions, a new experimental building is being constructed on the FUL campus, {{in the southern part of}} Belgium. This building hosts a climatic chamber in which a given indoor climate is to be maintained (temperature and relative humidity) whatever the external climate. Control of the internal climate will be performed by means of a specific HVAC plant. The general environmental context of the project led to the selection of non conventional solutions for the plant: solar collectors (both thermal and photovoltaic) are associated with a reversible heat pump in order to either heat or cool the building. In some circumstances, simultaneous heating and cooling of different rooms of the building will be necessary and possible. Energy distribution within the building will be made possible by different systems: - floor heating and/or cooling - cooling or <b>heating</b> <b>ceiling</b> - ventilation and Air handling Unit The paper reports on the use of building and HVAC system simulation in order to support the design of the plant. Simulation is carried out in the TRNSYS environment and gathers the following components: building, reversible heat pump, thermal solar collectors, photovoltaic solar collectors, floor heating, cooling ceiling, Air Handling Unit, storage tanks. Parameters identification for the different components will be developed. The paper will focus on specific problems connected to the simultaneous control of both temperature and relative humidity in situation close to the saturation state.

40|$|Even unsubstituted {{butadiene}} adds to {{sulfur dioxide}} in the hetero-Diels-Alder mode more rapidly than in the chelotropic mode. The sultine {{can be observed in}} equilibrium with the diene and the sulfur dioxide only at low temperature and in the presence of CF 3 COOH. Crystals of the 4, 5 -dialkyl-sultine resulting from the SO 2 addition to 1, 2 -dimethylidenecyclohexane have been obtained at - 60 °C and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Quantum chemistry calculations have shown that hyperconjugative interactions within the sulfinyl moiety are responsible for the anomeric effects observed in sultines that prefer pseudo-chair conformations with pseudo-axial S=O bonds. Mixing of sulfur dioxide and methylidenecyclopentane leads to the formation of alternating copolymer poly(methydilenecyclopentane sulfone) and isomerization of methylidenecyclopentane to 1 -methylcyclopentene. Polysulfones are known to equilibrate with radicals upon <b>heating</b> (<b>ceiling</b> temperature of polysulfone formation). These sulfonyl radicals can abstract a hydrogen atom from methylidenecyclopentane (and from other 2 -alkylalk- 1 -enes) to give an allyl radical type intermediate and sulfinic acid. The intermediate allyl radical abstracts an hydrogen atom from sulfinic acid and gives isomerized product (1 -methylcyclopentene). Diphenyldisulfone or solid polysulfones are mild and efficient organic catalysts for selective cleavage of methylprenyl (2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -en- 1 -yl), prenyl (3 -methylbut- 2 -en- 1 -yl), and methallyl (2 -methylallyl) ethers. Our reaction conditions are compatible with the presence of other protecting groups such as acetals, acetates, and allyl, benzyl, and TBDMS ethers. Exposure of 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -en- 1 -yl and 3 -methylbut- 2 -en 1 -yl ethers to diphenyldisulfone or solid polysulfones {{led to the formation of}} 2, 3 -dimethylbuta- 1, 3 -diene and isoprene, respectively. 2 -Methylallyl ethers undergo isomerization to 2 -methylpropenyl ethers, which are easily hydrolyzed into the corresponding free alcohols and isobutyraldehyde. We discovered that (2 -methoxyprop- 2 -en- 1 -yl) silyl sulfinates are very effective agents for the silylation of alcohols and oximes.

40|$|The {{different}} {{technologies of}} passive cooling concepts {{have to rely}} on a good thermal coupling between a building’s thermal mass and indoor air. In many cases, the ceiling is the only surface remaining for a good coupling. Further research is necessary to investigate discrepancies between existing correlations. Therefore, the overall aim of the work described in this thesis is the investigation of heat transfer at a <b>heated</b> <b>ceiling</b> in an experimental chamber. Acoustic baffles obstruct the surface of the <b>ceiling</b> and impede <b>heat</b> transfer. However, there is nearly no published data about the effect of such baffles on heat transfer. Available results from simulations should be verified with an experimental investigation. Consequently, one of the primary aims of this work was to experimentally determine the influence of such acoustic baffles. A suitable experimental chamber has been built at Biberach University of Applied Sciences. The thesis describes the experimental chamber, the experimental programme as well as results from five different test series. With a value of ± 0. 1 W/(m² K) for larger temperature differences, uncertainty in resulting convective heat transfer coefficients for natural convection is comparable to that of results from an existing recent experimental work often recommended for use. Additionally, total heat transfer (by convection and radiation) results are presented. Results are given for natural, forced and mixed convection conditions at an unobstructed <b>heated</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Furthermore, results for acoustic baffles in both an unventilated and a ventilated chamber are shown. Natural convection results show a very good agreement with existing correlations. Under mixed convection conditions, convective heat transfer at an unobstructed ceiling decreases to the limiting case described by natural convection. Installation of acoustic baffles leads to a reduction in total heat transfer (convection and radiation) between 20...|$|R
40|$|Radiant {{heating and}} cooling has a {{reputation}} of increasing the comfort level and reducing the energy consumption of buildings. The main advantages of radiant {{heating and cooling}} are low operational noise and reduced fan power cost. Radiant heating and cooling has been supplied in several forms, including floor <b>heating,</b> <b>ceiling</b> heating and cooling, radiant panels and fa?ade heating and cooling. Among them, fa?ade heating and cooling is the most recently developed system. This dissertation provides a comprehensive study of several technical issues relative to radiant heating and cooling systems that have received little attention in previous research. The following aspects are covered in this dissertation: First, a heat transfer model of mullion radiators, one type of fa?ade heating and cooling, is developed and verified by measured performance data. The simulation demonstrates that the heating or cooling capacity of mullion radiators is a semi-linear function of supply water temperature and {{is affected by the}} thermal conductive resistance of mullion tubes, the room air temperature, the supply water flow rate, and the outside air temperature. Second, the impact of the positions of radiators on energy consumption and thermal comfort is studied. This dissertation compares the heating load and comfort level as measured by uniformity of operative temperature for two different layouts of radiators in the same geometric space. The air exchange rate has been identified as an important factor which affects energy saving benefits of the radiant heating systems. Third, the infiltration and the interaction of infiltration and mechanical ventilation air to produce moisture condensation in a radiantly cooled office are examined. The infiltration of the studied office is also explored by on-site blower door measurement, by analyzing measured CO 2 concentration data, and through modeling. This investigation shows the infiltration level of the studied office to range between 0. 46 and 1. 03 air changes per hour (ACH). Fourth, the integrated sensible heating and cooling system is simulated and compared with a single duct variable air volume (VAV) system. The results show that, at the current infiltration level, the studied sensible heating and cooling system with an integrated active desiccant ventilation unit consumes 5. 6 % more primary energy than a single duct VAV system; it would consumes 11. 4 % less primary energy when the system is integrated with a presumed passive desiccant ventilation unit...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} axisymmetric heat transfer from a small scale fire and resulting buoyant plume to a horizontal, unobstructed ceiling during {{the initial stages of}} development. A propane-air burner yielding a heat source strength between 1. 0 kW and 1. 6 kW was used to simulate the fire, and measurements proved that this heat source did satisfactorily represent a source of buoyancy only. The ceiling consisted of a 1 / 16 " steel plate of 0. 91 m. diameter, insulated on the upper side. The ceiling height was adjustable between 0. 5 m and 0. 91 m. Temperature measurements were carried out in the plume, ceiling jet, and on the <b>ceiling.</b> <b>Heat</b> transfer data were obtained by using the transient method and applying corrections for the radial conduction along the ceiling and losses through the insulation material. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient was based on the adiabatic ceiling jet temperature (recovery temperature) reached after a long time. A parameter involving the source strength Q and ceiling height H was found to correlate measurements of this temperature and its radial variation. A similar parameter for estimating the <b>ceiling</b> <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient was confirmed by the experimental results. This investigation therefore provides reasonable estimates for the heat transfer from a buoyant gas plume to a ceiling in the axisymmetric case, for the stagnation region where such heat transfer is a maximum and for the ceiling jet region (r/H ≤ 0. 7). A comparison with data from experiments which involved larger heat sources indicates that the predicted scaling of temperatures and heat transfer rates for larger scale fires is adequate. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{transient}} heat and mass transfer model {{was developed to}} predict <b>ceiling</b> <b>heat</b> gain/loss through the attic space in residences and to accurately estimate savings in cooling and heating loads produced {{by the use of}} radiant barriers. The model accounted for transient conduction, convection and radiation and incorporated moisture and air transport across the attic. Environmental variables such as solar loads on outer attic surfaces and sky temperatures were also estimated. The model was driven by hourly weather data which included: time, outdoor air temperature, horizontal sun and sky radiation, wind speed and direction, relative humidity (dew point), and cloud cover data. The outputs of the model were <b>ceiling</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes, inner and outer heat fluxes from all surfaces, inner and outer surface temperatures and attic air temperatures. Transient conduction was modeled using response factors. Response factors were calculated for each attic component based on construction type. Convective heat transfer was modeled using ?flat plate? correlations found in the literature and radiative heat transfer was modeled using radiation enclosure theory. Moisture was incorporated via a condensation/evaporation model. A new procedure was developed to account for attic air stratification. Both forced and natural attic ventilation patterns were added to the model for three types of louver combination arrangements. An iterative technique was used to solve a set of simultaneous heat balance equations.
