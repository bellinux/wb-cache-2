5|$|Gallagher {{has said}} that he used only 100-watt Marshalls early in his career. After Definitely Maybe, he began using smaller amps, {{singling}} out <b>Fenders</b> (Princeton and Bandmaster), and also a combo made by Clark Amplification, which builds amplifiers based on vintage Fender and Marshall amps.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{collaborated with}} other {{companies}} to produce Halo-themed merchandise and promotions at retailers and vendors. PepsiCo created {{a variant of}} Mountain Dew called Game Fuel. 7-Eleven sold a Slurpee version of the drink. Burger King announced a special promotion starting September 24, 2007 featuring Halo designs and characters on food wrappings. Microsoft sponsored the #40 car driven by David Stremme for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Dover 400 Nextel Cup Series. The racecar featured a Halo 3 inspired paintjob featuring the title for the game printed prominently on the hood and rear bumper, as well as large pictures of Master Chief {{on each of the}} rear <b>fenders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front <b>fenders</b> and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E

5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, <b>fenders</b> and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling paint was also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and <b>fenders,</b> which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the hood ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Audi installed low-downforce setups on its No. 7 and 8 cars while their third entry used a version observed at the Silverstone race. The design was optimised to omit downforce, thereby reducing drag, for better preparation for competing on high-speed tracks. This was done by modifying the car's side pods and openings on the inside surface of its <b>fenders.</b> New cooling techniques were achieved by creating new suspension solutions to restrict spring displacement which also reduced underside turbulent airflow. Porsche chose to use high downforce configurations on all three of their 919 Hybrid cars as they did previously at Silverstone. The ByKolles CLM P1/01 was further developed and had a new front nose equipped after it completed a shakedown test on 24 April.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fender</b> Contemporary {{models were}} the first <b>Fender</b> Japan models to be {{exported}} as <b>Fender</b> Stratocasters and Telecasters. The previous <b>Fender</b> Japan models exported from Japan were all <b>Fender</b> Squier models. The <b>Fender</b> Contemporary models were manufactured from 1984 to 1987 by FujiGen Gakki and these Stratocasters were designed to be Superstrats (Super Strat) with humbucking pickups and Floyd Rose like tremolos made by Schaller and Kahler. There was a lower priced <b>Fender</b> Contemporary Squier model produced as well. The <b>Fender</b> Contemporary Stratocaster and Telecaster models {{were part of the}} <b>Fender</b> Japan E series model range.|$|R
5000|$|On the album, Gatton used a 1990 <b>Fender</b> Telecaster (his {{signature}} {{version with}} Joe Barden pickups), a <b>Fender</b> acoustic, a Martin D-28-32, a 1954 Gibson ES 295, a Gibson RB800 5 string banjo, a 1950 <b>Fender</b> 6-string lap steel, and a 1958 5-string <b>Fender</b> Precision Bass. [...] For amplification, {{he used a}} 1963 <b>Fender</b> Vibrolux, a 1963 <b>Fender</b> Super Reverb, a 1958 <b>Fender</b> Twin, a 1964 <b>Fender</b> Deluxe, and a 1958 <b>Fender</b> Bassman. Shannon Ford used a Drum Workshop kit with Sabian cymbals. John Previti's basses were the 5-string <b>Fender</b> Precision Bass, a Gibson Ripper and an unspecified upright bass. The keyboards—used by Bill Holloman and Tommy Lepson—were a Hammond B3, a Yamaha DX7, and a Roland D50.|$|R
50|$|Pierre plays {{a variety}} of <b>Fender</b> Telecasters from <b>Fender</b> Telecaster Deluxes, to <b>Fender</b> Telecaster Customs to American <b>Fender</b> Telecasters. He has also played a Gibson SG in the past.|$|R
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the <b>fenders</b> of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
25|$|Early models {{used the}} manufacturer's {{commercial}} cab, <b>fenders,</b> and specific hoods, making the two models look different. The -A1 models had open military cabs, flat <b>fenders,</b> and similar hoods, making all look the same.|$|E
25|$|The 1958 Rambler Rebel and Rambler Six shared revised styling {{with new}} grille, front <b>fenders</b> {{containing}} quad headlamps, {{as well as}} a new hood design while the rear received new <b>fenders</b> with impressive tailfins.|$|E
50|$|When CBS sold <b>Fender</b> to {{its current}} owners in 1984 there was a {{transitional}} period from 1984 to 1987 with limited <b>Fender</b> USA production resulting in mostly <b>Fender</b> Japan and leftover stock being sold. There are also <b>Fender</b> Contemporary Telecaster models with HSS or HH pickup configurations and switches for selecting pickup options. The <b>Fender</b> Contemporary Telecaster models used the same tremolo systems as the <b>Fender</b> Contemporary Stratocaster models. Black Francis used a <b>Fender</b> Contemporary Telecaster in the Pixies.|$|R
50|$|The Lead Series were {{manufactured}} at <b>Fender's</b> Fullerton, California {{plant and}} priced below the Stratocaster {{models of the}} time (approx. $495.00). They were eventually replaced in <b>Fender's</b> line up by the <b>Fender</b> Japan Squier JV model in 1982 as <b>Fender</b> expanded its operations by starting <b>Fender</b> Japan.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>Fender</b> Deluxe was {{a common}} <b>Fender</b> model name, also used for an {{unrelated}} series of <b>Fender</b> combo amplifiers produced from the 1940s to the present day, see <b>Fender</b> Deluxe Reverb.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Fender</b> Stratocaster XII is the 12 string {{version of}} the <b>Fender</b> Stratocaster {{electric}} guitar made by <b>Fender.</b> It was introduced in 1985 and re-issued 20 years later after a brief discontinuation in 1996. Unlike the <b>Fender</b> Electric XII, it uses a Strat-style body. <b>Fender</b> discontinued the Strat XII in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Nate Bott uses <b>Fender</b> Deville {{amplifiers}} with no effects pedals. He uses <b>Fender</b> Stratocaster and <b>Fender</b> Jaguar guitars.|$|R
25|$|The {{external}} appearance and equipment of the VAM Pacer {{consisted of a}} full bright molding package (wheel lips, top edges of the hood and <b>fenders,</b> window surrounds, rocker panels), bright rear panel between the taillights and the rear licence plate housing, protective side moldings, front and rear bumper guards, bumper nerfing strips, five-mile-per-hour bumpers with recovering shocks (only VAM car with this characteristic along with the Matador-based Classic line), five-spoke in-house VAM wheels, trim rings and full cover volcano center caps on the wheels, ER78x14 radial tires, driver's side manual remote mirror, radio antenna on the passenger's side fender, squared VAM logo emblems on the <b>fenders,</b> Pacer emblems on the <b>fenders</b> and bright rear panel and a two-step hood latch.|$|E

25|$|The Regal {{utilizes}} unibody construction with {{galvanized steel}} front <b>fenders,</b> hood, roof and door panels and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) bumper covers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fender</b> Deluxe Reverb is {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} made originally by <b>Fender</b> Electric Instruments which became <b>Fender</b> Musical Instruments in early 1965 {{when the company}} was purchased by CBS, and now by <b>Fender.</b> It was first introduced in 1963 by incorporating an onboard spring reverb tank to the newly redesigned <b>Fender</b> Deluxe amplifier.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fender</b> Musical Instruments {{released}} {{their version}} of modeling guitar, <b>Fender</b> VG Stratocaster, coined [...] "Roland-ready": a <b>Fender</b> Standard-Series Stratocaster that directly integrates the Roland GK-2 hardware. Note that, although GK hardware {{is built into the}} <b>Fender</b> VG Stratocaster, no GK interface is provided. <b>Fender</b> also offered a short-lived American-Series version in the mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fender</b> Bass VI, {{originally}} {{known as}} the <b>Fender</b> VI, is a six-string electric bass guitar made by <b>Fender.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1940 the Sport Scout gained full-skirt <b>fenders,</b> a lower {{seat height}} and {{increased}} fork rake, and in 1941 Indian added plunger-style rear suspension.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Fender</b> Swinger (also {{known as}} the <b>Fender</b> Musiclander and <b>Fender</b> Arrow - as the [...] "Swinger" [...] emblem is usually missing from the headstock) was a {{short-lived}} electric guitar model released by <b>Fender</b> in 1969, with few made. The Swinger was an attempt by CBS (which had bought the company in 1965) to extract cash from inventory by combining unused bodies from the failed <b>Fender</b> Bass V with parts from the <b>Fender</b> Musicmaster. Another use of surplus stock was the <b>Fender</b> Custom (a.k.a. <b>Fender</b> Maverick). The Swinger was marketed as another cheaper, short-scale 'student' guitar, but never seriously promoted, with resulting low popularity.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, <b>Fender</b> was facing {{competition}} from lower priced Japanese-made guitars. The higher priced <b>Fender</b> guitars {{were made in}} the United States and could not compete with the lower prices of Japanese-made <b>Fender</b> copies. In Japan, <b>Fender</b> was also losing sales to Japanese guitar brands such as Tōkai, Greco and Fernandes. Since Japanese labor and production costs were much lower than in America and to compete with the Japanese made guitars, <b>Fender</b> moved the lower priced <b>Fender</b> guitar production from America to Japan. <b>Fender</b> began negotiations with several Japanese musical instrument distributors.|$|R
