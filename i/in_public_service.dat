40|$|This Ph. D. {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} study the work motivation of employees {{in the delivery of}} <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> The questioning on work motivation <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> not new but it becomes central for governments which are now facing unprecedented public debts. The objective of this research is twofold : First, we want to see if the work motivation of employees <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> is a continuum (intrinsic and extrinsic motivations cannot coexist) or a bi-dimensional construct (intrinsic and extrinsic motivations coexist simultaneously). The research <b>in</b> <b>public</b> administration literature has focused on the concept of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> motivation, and considered motivation to be uni-dimensional (Perry and Hondeghem 2008). However, no study has yet tackled both types of motivation, the intrinsic and extrinsic ones, in the same time. This dissertation proposes, in Part I, a theoretical assessment and an empirical test of a global work motivational structure, by using a self-constructed Swiss dataset with employees from three <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> the education sector, the security sector and the <b>public</b> administrative <b>services</b> sector. Our findings suggest that work motivation <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> <b>in</b> not uni-dimensional but bi-dimensional, the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations coexist simultaneously and can be positively correlated (Amabile et al. 1994). Our findings show that intrinsic motivation is as important as extrinsic motivation, thus, the assumption that employees <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> are less attracted by extrinsic rewards is not confirmed for this sample. Other important finding concerns the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> motivation concept, which, as theoretically predicted, represents the major motivational dimension of employees in the delivery of <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> Second, the theory of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> motivation makes the assumption that employees <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> engage <b>in</b> activities that go beyond their self-interest, but never uses this construct as a determinant for their pro-social behavior. In the same time, several studies (Gregg et al. 2011 and Georgellis et al. 2011) bring evidence about the pro-social behavior of employees <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> However, they do not identify which type of motivation is at the origin of this behavior, they only make the assumption of an intrinsically motivated behavior. We analyze the pro-social behavior of employees <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> and use the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> motivation as determinant of their pro-social behavior. We add other determinants highlighted by the theory of pro-social behavior (Bénabou and Tirole 2006), by Le Grand (2003) and by fit theories (Besley and Ghatak 2005). We test these determinants on Part II and identify for each sector of activity the positive or the negative impact on pro-social behavior of Swiss employees. Contrary to expectations, we find, for this sample, that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors {{have a positive impact on}} pro-social behavior, no crowding-out effect is identified in this sample. We confirm the hypothesis of Le Grand (2003) about the positive impact of the opportunity cost on pro-social behavior. Our results suggest a mix of action-oriented altruism and out-put oriented altruism of employees <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> These results are relevant when designing incentives schemes for employees in the delivery of <b>public</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
