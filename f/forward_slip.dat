50|$|While {{aircraft}} slipping and skidding {{are often}} undesired in a usual turn that maintains altitude, slipping {{of the aircraft}} {{can be used for}} practical purposes. Intentionally putting an aircraft into a slip is used as a <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> and a sideslip. These slips are performed by applying opposite inputs of the aileron and rudder controls. A <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> allows a pilot to quickly drop altitude without gaining unnecessary speed, while a sideslip is one method utilized to perform a crosswind landing.|$|E

40|$|Slipping {{biomechanics}} {{was investigated}} on both non-contaminated and oil-contaminated surfaces during unconstrained straight-line walking (‘walking’), turning, gait initiation and termination. In walking, backward slipping was more frequent, whereas <b>forward</b> <b>slipping</b> was more frequent when turning. Stopping and gait initiation engendered only <b>forward</b> and backward <b>slipping,</b> respectively. Based on slip distance and sliding velocity, severity of <b>forward</b> <b>slipping</b> was least in walking {{than for the}} other gait tasks, whereas the tasks had similar effects on backward slipping. Relative to the dry surface, heel and foot contact angles reduced and heel contact (HC) velocity increased for all gait tasks on the contaminated surface. Ground reaction forces were generally lower on the contaminated surface, suggesting kinetic adaptation immediately following HC. Required coefficient of friction (RCoF) did not correlate with slip distance suggesting that RCoF {{may not be a}} useful kinetic parameter for assessing slipping risk on contaminated surfaces...|$|R

5000|$|With the Rotax 447 engine, the {{aircraft}} can take-off in under 100 ft, as one owner explained: [...] "You'd better be ready when you advance the throttle because the plane will {{jump off the}} ground within the next three seconds!" [...] Landings in crosswinds {{have been described as}} [...] "easy with a <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> and touchdown on one main wheel". A full rudder slip will produce a descent rate of 2000 feet per minute (10 m/s).|$|E
50|$|To {{execute a}} <b>forward</b> <b>slip,</b> the pilot banks {{into the wind}} and applies {{opposing}} rudder (e.g., right aileron + left rudder) {{in order to keep}} moving towards the target. If you were the target you would see the plane's nose off to one side, a wing off to the other side and tilted down toward you. The pilot must make sure that the plane's nose is low enough to keep airspeed up. However, airframe speed limits such as VA and VFE must be observed.|$|E
50|$|Of equal {{importance}} to short ground run {{is the ability}} to clear obstacles, such as hills, on both take off and landing. For takeoff, large power/weight ratios and low drag result in a high rate of climb required to clear obstacles. For landing, high drag allows the aeroplane to descend steeply to the runway without building excess speed resulting in a longer ground run. Drag is increased by use of flaps (devices on the wings) and by a <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> (causing the aeroplane to fly somewhat sideways through the air to increase drag).|$|E
50|$|Forward {{displacement}} of a proximal vertebra {{in relation to}} its adjacent vertebra in association with an intact neural arch, and {{in the presence of}} degenerative changes is known as degenerative spondylolisthesis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis narrows the spinal canal and symptoms of spinal stenosis are common. Of these, neural claudication is most common. Any <b>forward</b> <b>slipping</b> of one vertebra on another can cause spinal stenosis by narrowing the canal. If this <b>forward</b> <b>slipping</b> narrows the canal sufficiently, and impinges on the contents of the spinal column, it is spinal stenosis by definition. If there are associated symptoms of narrowing, the diagnosis of spinal stenosis is confirmed. With increasing age, the occurrence of degenerative spondylolisthesis becomes more common. The most common spondylolisthesis occurs with slipping of L4 on L5. Frymoyer showed that spondylolisthesis with canal stenosis is more common in diabetic women who have undergone oophorectomy (removal of ovaries). The cause of symptoms in the legs can be difficult to determine. A peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes can have the same symptoms as spinal stenosis.|$|R

50|$|Without flaps or {{spoilers}} it {{is difficult}} to increase the steepness of the glide without adding significant speed. This excess speed can cause the aircraft to fly in ground effect for an extended period, perhaps running out of runway. In a <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> much more drag is created, allowing the pilot to dissipate altitude without increasing airspeed, increasing the angle of descent (glide slope). Forward slips are especially useful when operating pre-1950s training aircraft, aerobatic aircraft such as the Pitts Special or any aircraft with inoperative flaps or spoilers.|$|E
50|$|A forward-slip {{is useful}} when a pilot {{has set up}} for a landing {{approach}} with excessive height or must descend steeply beyond a tree line to touchdown near the runway threshold. Assuming that the plane is properly lined up for the runway, the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> will allow the aircraft track to be maintained while steepening the descent without adding excessive airspeed. Since the heading is not aligned with the runway, forward-slip must be removed before touchdown to avoid excessive side loading on the landing gear, and if a cross wind is present an appropriate sideslip may be necessary at touchdown as described below.|$|E
50|$|As {{the runway}} drew near, it became {{apparent}} that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast, raising the danger of running off the runway before it could be stopped. The lack of hydraulic pressure prevented flap/slat extension that would have, under normal landing conditions, reduced the stall speed of the aircraft and increased the lift coefficient of the wings to allow the aircraft to be slowed for a safe landing. The pilots briefly considered a 360-degree turn to reduce speed and altitude, but decided {{that they did not have}} enough altitude for the manoeuvre. Pearson decided to execute a <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> to increase drag and lose altitude. This manoeuvre is commonly used with gliders and light aircraft to descend more quickly without increasing forward speed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{defect in}} the pars interarticularis in spondylolysis and {{spondylolisthesis}} is most often the re-sult of repeated trauma, stress, and factors other than acute fracture. These fatigue fractures develop early in life, may have a strong hereditary basis, and most often represent incidental roentgenographic findings. Atten-tion {{should be given to}} the youngster or adolescent with low-back pain and paraspinal muscle spasm. If these pa-tients are followed closely, the incidence of pars interar-ticularis defect is higher than appreciated. The lesion in some of these individuals may progress to significant vertebral slipping. If the developing defect is recognized early, treatment can be quite satisfactory. Spondylolisthesis is defined as <b>forward</b> <b>slipping</b> of a vertebral body on the one below it. Spondylolysis is define...|$|R

5000|$|Depending on the country, {{there may}} be a {{requirement}} for some minimum number of training hours to have been completed by the student pilot before he or she is allowed to solo. In most countries, it is assumed that such students will be familiar with (and may have to pass an examination on) the relevant Air Laws or Regulations, and will have completed exercises in handling aircraft in normal conditions, and also what to do in the case of engine failure on takeoff, in flight, and before landing.In the United States, for most aircraft, there is no FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) requirement for a minimum number of hours. Per FAR Part 61 SFAR 73 section 2, Robinson helicopters have a 20-hour requirement to solo. However the regulations do require that a student pilot show competency in several specific skills to include, for example, the ability to <b>forward</b> <b>slip.</b> [...] In practice, competence is mostly a judgment call of the Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) responsible for the student. Typically, it takes from 10 to 30 hours of flight time before a pilot has the instinctive feel of an aircraft to be safe flying solo in other than perfect (no wind) weather.|$|E

40|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> in strip rolling {{was defined}} as the {{relative}} difference between the roll surface speed and strip exit speed. It was always an important parameter because of its significant influence on friction and tension control. In this study a Phantom V 3. 0 digital high speed image acquisition and motion analysis system was used to record the movement of the roll and the workpiece during rolling. The pictures captured were analyzed to obtain the speeds of the roll and the workpiece along the roll bite, which then yielded the <b>forward</b> <b>slip.</b> The measurement accuracy has been validated by the mass conservation. The maximum relative error of the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> was only 1. 6 %. The results have shown that the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> increased as the reduction increased for both dry and lubricated rolling. The roll speed did not change the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> in the case of dry rolling, but the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> was significantly reduced with roll speed when lubricated...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the contact pressure and local sliding in a cold rolling process is an essential step towards the prediction of the roller’s life due to wear damage. This investigation utilized finite element analysis to quantify the local contact pressure and local sliding over the rolling bite in a plate cold rolling process. It was the first study to quantify the local sliding distance in a rolling process using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The numerical {{results indicate that the}} local contact pressure over the rolling bite demonstrates a hill profile, and the peak coincides with the neutral plane. The local sliding distance over the rolling bite demonstrates a double-peak profile with the two peaks appearing at the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> and backward slip zones respectively. The amplitude of sliding distance in the backward slip zone is larger than that in the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> zone. A stick zone was confirmed between the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> and backward slip zones. According to a parametric study, the local contact pressure and sliding distance decrease when the thickness reduction is reduced or the diameter of the roller is decreased. The location of the neutral plane always presents at the rolling exit side of the rolling bite’s center. The size of the stick zone enlarges and the sizes of slip zones shrink significantly when the friction coefficient is increased. Finally, a novel concept of wear intensity was defined to examine the wear of the roller based on the local contact pressure and local sliding distance. The results show that a two-peak wear response exists in the backward and <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> zones. The magnitude of the wear in the backward slip zone is larger than that in the <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> zone. For a given roller and blank material combination, using a smaller thickness reduction, a smaller diameter roller and a higher friction coefficient condition can reduce the wear of the roller for a single rolling cycle. The current paper develops an understanding of rolling contact responses to the wear of the roller in rolling process. The research method can also be applied to study other rolling or sliding wear problems...|$|E

Using Newton-Raphson iterative calculation to solve the non-linear equations, the reverse calculation values can be calculated. The actual <b>forward</b> <b>slip</b> obtained from the measured strip rolling speed using laser meter makes it possible that the deformation resistance of strip and friction coefficient can be uncoupled for model adaptive learning calculation.

40|$|Falls {{threaten}} {{the quality of}} life of older adults and are associated with tremendous economic costs. Slips and trips are the two major causes of falls during locomotion and each requires a different postural response to prevent falling. However, a critical requirement in maintaining balance in either is the ability to generate proactive postural adjustments. Older adults have been shown to adopt proactive postural adjustments through repeated exposure to novel perturbations. However, the extent to which such learning abilities applied to perturbed and novel gait was unknown. This dissertation investigated reducing the incidence of falls in older adults through learning to better recover from perturbed gait based on a systems model theory. Potential associations between aging and anticipatory postural strategies when repeatedly exposed to <b>forward</b> <b>slips</b> were studied. <b>Forward</b> vs. backward walking slips were also compared to examine the impact of gait novelty on the ability to generate proactive adjustments. We also desired to know whether knowledge of the type of perturbation impacts the ability to generate proactive adjustments and whether such adjustments change with experience and when the nature of the perturbation is unknown. Subjects were exposed to multiple slip and trip perturbations to investigate these differences and to compare how young and older adults optimize their proactive adjustments. As anticipatory behavior improves perturbation recovery outcomes, changes in measures of severity with increased exposure were also analyzed. This study found young and older adults capable of adopting optimal proactive postural adjustments when repeatedly exposed to <b>forward</b> <b>slips</b> and their central nervous system was able to make internal representations applicable to a novel task. Awareness of a perturbation proved sufficient to induce proactive adaptations and with experience, adaptations became perturbation specific to reduce slip and trip risk in both age groups. Perturbation recovery improved with multiple exposures in both age groups as decreases in severity measures were observed. This study opens the door to studies evaluating the retention of postural control motor skills adapted through training and prior experiences and sheds light on the benefits of a systems model theory based fall intervention program for slips and trips...|$|R
