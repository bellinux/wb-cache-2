40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on the new role of African union (AU) as regional player in conflict resolution in Africa. Created in 2000 as heritage organisation after the not very successfull Organisation of african unity, AU took several measures {{in order to become}} a more effective actor in collective security and better suited for conflict resolution. In order to evaluate the perspectives and viability of AU as regional player in the security dimension, the thesis evaluates the case of the conflict in Darfur where AU plays {{a leading role in the}} efforts of the international community. Based on the theoretical framework of conflict resolution theory, it {{concentrates on}} the role of AU as regional player in conflict resolution and gives a glace into the topic of <b>african</b> <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> and their role in conflict resolution...|$|R

The thesis also shows the development of the relations between the AU and other <b>African</b> <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> so as the relations between the AU and the UN in the security area. It also analyses the positive and negative aspects of this mutual cooperation. The end of the thesis is dedicated to the concrete approach to the solution of the humanitarian crises in Darfur. It shows the cooperation with the UN {{in the form of a}} hybrid mission UNAMID and the challenges and problems which have to be currently faced by the mission...|$|R
40|$|African {{states have}} responded to the {{challenges}} of the post-Cold War international system mostly by collectively promoting subregional and continental-wide initiatives in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. Admittedly, the existence of many violent conflicts in Africa, as well as their ‘domino’ effects at thesub-regional level, contributed significantly to the growing desire for collective security systems and conflict management mechanisms. The broadening of the role and functions of <b>African</b> <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> to include responsibility for peacebuilding and conflict management generally adds credence to the efficacy of regional integration. Many issues, however, present themselves in the engagement of RECs with the peacebuilding process in Africa. Although primarily set up to promote economic integration, Africa’s RECs have increasingly taken up a prominent role in conflict resolution and peace support operations, as evident in the recent peace processes in Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Mali, Congo DRC, Sudan, and South Sudan, among others. In spite of the challenges they face, RECs are capable of playing important roles with regard to peace mediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding...|$|R
40|$|A {{discussion}} {{that focused on}} topics that ranged from {{the role of government}} and the private sector in combating terrorism and transnational organised crime to infrastructure development and professional services. Executive summary The second Australia–Africa Dialogue was held at the Royal Zambezi Lodge in Zambia from 11 to 14 September 2015, co-hosted by the Brenthurst Foundation and ASPI. Participants included representatives from government, civil society and the private sector. Discussion focused on topics that ranged from the role of government and the private sector in combating terrorism and transnational organised crime to infrastructure development and professional services. The dialogue is a platform for governments and the private sectors in Australia and Africa to exchange frank views on many issues, build relationships and identify recommendations for further cooperation. It provides a mechanism to support public diplomacy, create links between influential stakeholders and strengthen ties between the two continents. Participants in the 2015 Aus-Africa Dialogue identified several areas where Australia and <b>African</b> <b>regional</b> <b>organisations,</b> countries, businesses and civil society could deepen engagement. They acknowledged our shared interests in strengthening peace and security, supporting the resilience of governance and justice institutions, developing infrastructure and spurring economic growth...|$|R

50|$|The African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) is an {{international}} organisation which provides a platform for cooperation among African tax authorities. First conceived during a meeting of 30 African tax commissioners {{with representatives of the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in August 2008, it was launched in November 2009 in Kampala, Uganda. Through mutual cooperation between member states, ATAF works towards increasing the level of voluntary tax compliance whilst combating tax evasion and avoidance. ATAF is supported by a group of donors including the UK's Department for International Development, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, the African Development Bank, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, Irish Aid, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands), the OECD, and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.

40|$|As much as {{developing}} {{states are}} blessed with natural resources capable of transforming their economies into a positive direction, the imposed World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) mores continue to relegate {{them to the}} status of underdevelopment. The consequences of this on investment, trade and finance in Third World States (TWSs), especially Africa, are disarticulation of the economy, exploitation, disinvestment, unemployment, political instability and unavailability of relevant technology to move TWSs forward, among others. The intention {{of this paper is to}} situate the problems of biopiracy in Africa in terms of its associated western international regimes of intellectual property rights (IPRs), geographical indications (GIs), prior informed consent (PIC), and access and sharing benefits (ASB). This gives rise to the politics behind Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) patenting (a medicinal plant found only in South Africa) by various multinational corporations (MNCs). There is a need for a regional regime such as <b>African</b> <b>Regional</b> Intellectual Property <b>Organisation</b> (ARIPO), on indigenous knowledge (IK) to patent the continental biodiversity resources.
