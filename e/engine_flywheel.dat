50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel</b> requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel</b> while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, Volvo {{announced}} a flywheel system fitted {{to the rear}} axle of its S60 sedan. Braking action spins the flywheel at up to 60,000 rpm and stops the front-mounted <b>engine.</b> <b>Flywheel</b> energy is applied via a special transmission to partially or completely power the vehicle. The 20 cm, 6 kg carbon fiber flywheel spins in a vacuum to eliminate friction. When partnered with a four-cylinder engine, it offers up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption versus a comparably performing turbo six-cylinder, providing an 80 hp boost and allowing it to reach 100 km/h in 5.5 seconds. The company did not announce specific plans to include the technology in its product line.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel,</b> thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering [© IMECHE]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] and experimental investigations shed light on the root causes leading to the emergence and persistence of an acute metallic noise in rear wheel drive light truck drivelines. Sudden demands in engine output torque combined with the presence of lash zones give rise to a phenomenon that is onomatopoeically referred to as clonk. Its multi physics nature requires a comprehensive study, which includes rigid multi-body dynamics, flexible body oscillations, and noise radiation computation. The verification of numerical results is achieved through the design and implementation of a transient dynamic experimental rig, which comprises the complete drivetrain from the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel</b> to the rear axle. Parametric studies reveal high-frequency contributions in the driveline vibration response of certain structural modes of the driveshaft pieces, which are induced by remote impact of meshing transmission teeth through backlash. The numerically predicted spectrum of vibration is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements. Combined study of the aforementioned results reveals the components that amplify the clonk noise...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an optimal Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a low-cost mechanical-hybrid powertrain. It uses mechanical components only a flywheel, clutches, gears, and a continuously variable transmission for its hybrid functionalities of brake energy recuperation, reduction of inefficient part-load operation of the engine, and engine shutoff during vehicle standstill. This powertrain has mechanical characteristics, such as a relatively small energy storage capacity {{in the form of}} the compact flywheel and multiple driving modes to operate the powertrain because of the use of clutches. The optimization problem is complex because it is twofold: (i) to find the optimal sequence of driving modes and (ii) to find the optimal power distribution between the <b>engine,</b> <b>flywheel,</b> and vehicle. Dynamic programming is used to compute the globally optimal EMS for six representative driving cycles. The main design criterion is the minimization of the overall fuel consumption, subject to the systems kinematics, dynamics, and constraints. The results provide a benchmark of the fuel saving potential of this powertrain design and give insight in the optimal utilization of the flywheel system. In addition, the complexity (and computation time) of the problem is reduced by a priori (static) optimization of the power distribution for each driving mode. Static optimization of a dynamic optimization problem yields a sub-optimal solution; however, the results show that the consequences on the fuel saving are small with respect to the optimal one (the difference is 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 8...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to the engine cylinder is essential for internal combustion, engine simulation, especially under motored conditions. If the heat loss rate is correctly estimated, it is then easy {{to determine if a}} low maximum compression pressure is due to increased blowby or not. This paper proposes a method to determine the heat flux rate to the combustion chamber walls of a motored DI diesel engine and evaluate the heat transfer model used. The method is based on processing the measured pressure diagram Li the engine cylinder using a time step equivalent to 0. 15 ° CA. The measured pressure diagram is a P-t diagram, and thus the TDC (top dead centre) of the engine must be determined precisely in order to be converted to a P-V diagram. The TDC is measured using a magnetic pickup device mounted on the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel</b> and is also determined, in cases where this is impossible, using a modified version of a thermodynamic method developed by the author. The heat flux determination method is applied on a modified Ricardo E- 6 engine in the author's laboratory over a range of engine speeds under cold and warm conditions. There is very good coincidence between the measured and calculated heat flux rates at all speeds examined, revealing the validity of the heat transfer model used. The results are promising and compare very well with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{starting}} {{systems for}} marine gas engines. Large combustion engines are usually started {{by means of}} pneumatic starting arrangements. The most common ways of starting a combustion engine with compressed air, are to use a pneumatic engine coupled to the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel,</b> or to inject the air directly into the engine cylinders through a valve in the cylinder air. Pneumatic starting engines are prefered for gas engines with a prechamber. The main challenge related to starting of gas fueled engines, is to avoid ignitable consentrations of gas outside the engine cylinders. Gas engines have an increased emission of unburned gas during starting and stoping. If the consentration of unburnes gases in the exhaust system of the combustion engine gets to large, the gas can be ignited by hot spots or sparks. In addition, we are conserned with the air consume of the starting system. The capacity of the starting system is regulated by class rules. To {{reduce the cost of}} the system, we want to reduce the air consume per start. In this thesis, mathematical models of the combustion engine and the starting system are developed and validated against experimental results from starting tests of the real system. The objective is to give means for investigating, by using computer simulations, if the existing starting system can be improved. The validation showed that the model captures the main dynamics of the system. To avoid large concentrations of unburned fuel mixtures in the exhaust system, the starting system is used to purge the engine before allowing fuel to the engine cylinders. In practice, the combustion engine is operated as an air pump which pumps air from the charge air system, via the engine cylinders, and to the exhaust system. A way of improving the safety of the starting sequence by purging the engine for a fixed number of rotations, is proposed. This method gives stricter control of the purged volume, but increases air consume. To reduce air consume, it is advantegous to keep the engine speed low during purging. Three concept for reducing the engine speed are explored. The simulations indicate that the best performance is obtained by using an electrically controlled pressure control valve, in combination with a Proportional-Integral- Derivative feedback controller, to regulate the engine speed. This concept is extensively tested by means of simulations, to evaluate its robustness with regards to system uncertainties and different plant dimensions. </p...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A very short and disagreeable audible and tactile response from a vehicle driveline may be excited when the throttle is abruptly applied or released, or when the clutch is rapidly engaged. The condition is most noticeable in low gear and in slow moving traffic, when other background engine and road noise levels are low. This phenomenon is known as clonk and {{is often associated with}} the first cycle of shuffle response, which is a low frequency longitudinal vehicle movement excited by throttle demand. It is often reported that clonk may coincide with each cycle of the shuffle response, and multiple clonks may then occur. The problem is aggravated by backlash and wear in the drivetrain, and it conveys a perception of low quality to the customer. Hitherto, reported investigations do not reveal or discuss the mechanism and causal factors of clonk in a quantitative manner, which would relate the engine impulsive torque to the elastic response of the driveline components, and in particular to the noise radiating surfaces. Crucially, neither have the issues of sensitivity, variability and non-linearity been addressed and published. It is also of fundamental importance that clonk is seen as a total system response to impulsive torque, in the presence of distributed lash at the vibro-elastic impact sites. In this thesis, the drivetrain is defined as the torque path from the <b>engine</b> <b>flywheel</b> to the road wheels. The drivetrain is a lightly damped and highly non-linear dynamic system. There are many impact and noise emitting locations in the driveline that contribute to clonk, when the system is subjected to shock torque loading. This thesis examines the clonk energy paths, from the initial impact to many driveline lash locations, and to the various noise radiating surfaces. Both experimental and theoretical methods are applied to this complex system. Structural and acoustic dynamics are considered, as well as the very important frequency couplings between elastic structures and acoustic volumes. Preliminary road tests had indicated that the clonk phenomenon was a, very short transient impact event between lubricated contacts and having a high frequency characteristic. This indicated that a multi-body dynamics simulation of the driveline, in conjunction with a high frequency elasto-acoustic coupling analysis, would be required. In addition, advanced methods of signal analysis would be required to handle the frequency content of the very short clonk time histories. These are the main novelties of this thesis. There were many successful outcomes from the investigation, including quantitative agreement between the numerical and experimental investigations. From the experimental work, it was established that vehicle clonk could be accurately reproduced on a driveline rig and also on a vehicle chassis dynamometer, under controlled test conditions. It then enabled Design of Experiments to be conducted and the principal causal factors to be identified. The experimental input and output data was also used to verify the mathematical simulation. The high frequency FE analysis of the structures and acoustic cavities were used to predict the dynamic modal response to a shock input. The excellent correlation between model and empirical data that was achieved, clearly established the clonk mechanism in mathematical physics terms. Localised impact of meshing gears under impulsive loads were found to be responsible for high frequency structural wave propagation, some of which coupled with the acoustics modes of cavities, when the speed of wave propagation reached supersonic levels. This finding, although previously surmised, has been shown in the thesis and constitutes a major contribution to knowledge...|$|E
