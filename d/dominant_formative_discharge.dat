40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{spectrum}} of perturbations of flow and sediment transport experienced by rivers {{as a result of}} hydrologic variations, the paradigm of morphodynamic equilibrium has long been present in the geomorphological literature where it is traditionally associated with the semiempirical notion of <b>formative</b> <b>discharge,</b> whereby the unsteady forcing is taken as morphologically equivalent to some effective steady forcing. Here we investigate the mechanisms responsible for maintaining a quasi-equilibrium bed profile of a river reach sufficiently short to have no significant tributary inputs. More importantly, we assume the channel banks to be fixed, hence, the case we have in mind is that of rivers protected by levees which cannot respond to hydrologic forcing by changing their width like natural rivers. Employing a 1 -D model of river morphodynamics, we first determine the equilibrium profile of the river reach for given steady forcing conditions and discuss the capability of this approach for interpreting bed profiles observed in the field by applying it to the terminal reach of the Magra River, Italy. Field observations turn out to be reasonably well fitted by the equilibrium profile associated with a steady effective discharge, which however differs from the typical <b>formative</b> <b>discharge</b> (mean[*]annual flood) for natural channels with erodible banks. Finally, we clarify how fluctuations of the hydrodynamic forcing associated with the recorded historical sequence of hydrologic events of variable intensities have acted to maintain the river equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Cosmogenic nuclide burial dating {{was used}} to {{determine}} the age of ancient alluvial terrace deposits in the lower Vaal River catchment, and thus provide an absolute fluvial chronology. A poor chronological framework has been the primary shortcoming of previous fluvial history studies as there was no accurate way to evaluate or correlate the proposed driving mechanisms with the fluvial events themselves. Cosmogenic nuclide burial dating has shown that there have been three periods, each of both river incision and alluvial gravels and fines aggradation, in the Pliocene. Burial dating determined that periods of bedrock incision have occurred relatively rapidly over short periods of time, following lengthy periods of net aggradation. It has been proposed that the lower Vaal River catchment provided the ideal situation for rapid bedrock incision to pro- ceed sporadically. The Vaal River in its lower reaches is largely confined to pre-Karoo valleys that are filled with soft, easily erodible Karoo rocks. When these rocks are at least partially exposed along the river channel/valley, rapid bedrock erosion and incision occurs through the action of saltating resistant clasts abrading the channel. It has been argued that these incision events oc- cur only when suitable climatic conditions develop that allow for the complete erosion of alluvial gravel deposits lining the Vaal River channel/valley (i. e. fre- quent and large <b>formative</b> <b>discharges</b> are needed to achieve this). Periods of gravel aggradation have been attributed to an increase in coarse sediment sup- ply, primarily through the erosion of older alluvial deposits in the valley during periods of reduced vegetation cover. Periods of fine sediment aggradation are the net result of a reduction in the capacity of <b>formative</b> <b>discharges,</b> a direct result of a drying climate. It is thus apparent that climate change has played the most important role in controlling the fluvial evolution of the Vaal River. Climate controls fluvial events by determining the Vaal River’s net transport ability. Various combinations of changes in transport and erosion potentials, in both the river and surrounding landscape, have resulted in varying fluvial outcomes. In conclusion, the fluvial evolution of the lower Vaal River catch- ment is unique due to a number of aspects. The structure of the pre-Karoo surface and readily available resistant clasts from older terrace deposits and tillite, in conjunction with climate change, have proved crucial in shaping the Vaal River’s fluvial history...|$|R
40|$|Rivers {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of discharges. It is nowadays acknowledged that is not realistic to assume that the morphology of a river is influenced by only a single <b>formative</b> <b>discharge.</b> Rather, it is the full range of flows that are able to move sediments and erode banks that affect the fluvial morphology. Thus, the channel morphology emerges from the interactions between different competent discharges. A goal that has still not been completely achieved in geomorphology is the understanding of the role of discharge variability on river morphological processes. In this paper, we present the results of an experimental investigation concerning the impact of the sequencing of two competent discharges on a self!forming pseudomeandering pattern. The inception of the pattern, the bar dynamics, and the bend erosion are investigated. A comparison of the experiments performed with steady and unsteady discharges has indicated the key role of the discharge variability in promoting and sustaining the pseudomeandering channel. These experimental findings shed light on some important morphological processes (bar deformation, low!flow channel incision, and triggering of the bend inception) that are affected by discharge variations to a great extent, in agreement with some field studies and conceptual model...|$|R
40|$|Lethe Vallis is an {{approximately}} 230 km-long and 1. 5 km-wide channel connecting several shallow basins in the Elysium Planitia {{region of}} Mars. It sits within a distinctive morphological unit {{defined by a}} platy-ridged-polygonized texture. We have documented the geomorphology of the system, and constructed topographical long profiles of the channel thalweg and the contacts of the platy-ridged-polygonized material. The Lethe thalweg is shallow (with a slope of about 0. 0001) but contains steeper sections that match the locations of observed cataract systems. The contact profiles suggest that the small basins linked by Lethe progressively ponded and over-spilled as the system developed, the cataracts being associated with this over-spill. Other landforms observed in the system include streamlined islands, anastomosing distributary systems, fluvial hanging channels and terraces on the channel margins. There are also possible dunes and/or antidunes within the channel. These all point to catastrophic fluvial flooding. Estimates of <b>formative</b> <b>discharge</b> are {{of the order of}} 1 × 10 4 – 5 × 10 4 m 3 s − 1, similar to the discharge of the Mississippi River.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{temporal}} elements of the REFORM hydromorphological framework, illustrating these elements with an analysis of information from the lower Tagliamento river, Italy. It presents an analysis of historical channel adjustments at segment and reach scales {{over the last two}} centuries, reflecting human pressures that are summarised but not fully developed in this paper, and an analysis of data from aerial photographs, topographic surveys, and river flow records. This is followed by an assessment of likely future changes over the period 2012 – 2035 based upon both a conceptual model founded on the historical analysis and numerical modelling. The Tagliamento river has gone through three main phases of adjustment. The first two phases, characterized by narrowing and incision, were driven primarily by human interventions (i. e. sediment mining and channelization). The most recent phase represents an attempt of the river to achieve a new equilibrium condition and is mainly controlled by flow regime (i. e. frequency and magnitude of <b>formative</b> <b>discharges)</b> and vegetation establishment. As for future channel evolution, both models showed that slight width changes are likely to occur over the period 2012 – 2035. Channel widening, that could be expected as a response to an excess of unit stream power, will be hampered by vegetation establishment. Finally, the ‘‘no intervention’’ strategy seems to be the best option for leading the river towards a new equilibrium condition and to achieve different goals (e. g. flood mitigation, conservation or improvement of ecological status) ...|$|R

30|$|Experiences with pTA {{were also}} {{fundamentally}} different between Switzerland and Austria. pTA seems {{to fit the}} Swiss way of policy-making {{much better than the}} Austrian. Despite the similarities between the two small western democracies and although both countries are concordance democracies, there are remarkable differences between the two that distinguish them in terms of being prepared for participatory exercises. Whereas Swiss concordance democracy emphasizes pluralism and a higher distribution of power between a larger number of actors, Austrian concordance democracy is characterized by a dominance of a small number of organized actors which try to pervade society and involve citizens by means of mandatory membership. The most striking and important difference between Switzerland and Austria, however, is the veto power of its citizenry, which is particularly strong in Switzerland but remarkably weak in Austria. In the Swiss context, pTA seems functional to avoid potential resistance from the public. Unlike Austria, there is an emphasis in Swiss policy-making on including minorities. Moreover, there is an emphasis on rationality and matter-of-factness in public discourse, which is contrasted in Austria by a strong role of taboo that is meant to avoid the controversial and emotional debates experienced in the past. There are also differences between the two countries regarding the <b>dominant</b> <b>formative</b> group of society. Whereas in Switzerland the idea of an independent citizenry in policy-making is a powerful image of self-perception, in Austria it is state bureaucracy with its roots in enlightened absolutism, in which citizens are perceived as subjects to be guided.|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of channel {{changes is}} not always {{straightforward}} since it requires a detailed reconstruction of the evolutionary trajectory of channel morphology, a quantitative analysis of controlling factors and, finally, identification of links between evolutionary trajectories and controlling factors. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explain channel adjustments and controlling factors in the Tagliamento River, a large gravel-bed river in northeastern Italy. Traditional methods for studying historical channel changes (i. e., use of aerial photos, topographic data) were employed, but numerical modelling turned out to be very useful for the quantification of bedload transport and for supporting interpretation of past changes and likely future channel evolution. River channel underwent three main phases of adjustment over the last 200 years. The first two phases, from the end of the nineteenth century to the early 1990 s, were characterized by narrowing (channel width decreased from 1250 to 540 m) and incision (about 1 m); and the third phase, from the 1990 s to present day, by widening (from 540 to 600 m) and slight aggradation (about 0. 2 m). Combining evolutionary trajectories of channel morphology and analysis of controlling factors we argue that the long-term channel evolution of the Tagliamento River was driven mainly by human intervention at the reach scale (i. e., sediment mining and channelization). Changes in sediment supply in the catchment area had no, or minor, effects in the study reach. The most recent changes (i. e., widening and slight aggradation) are explained as a response to past disturbances that have produced a remarkable change of channel geometry and an increase of unit stream power in the reach. Magnitude and frequency of <b>formative</b> <b>discharges</b> are a key driving factor of the intensity of recent changes, while this was not the case during the previous phases of adjustment...|$|R
40|$|After its formation, a rill {{may remain}} {{in the field for}} months, often {{receiving}} lower flow rates than the <b>formative</b> <b>discharge.</b> The objective of this work was to evaluate the rill flow transport capacity of soil aggregates at discharges unable to erode the rill, and to analyse the influence of the rill macro-roughness on this transport process. A non-erodible rill was built in which roughness was reproduced in detail. In order to assess only the rill macroroughness, a flat channel with a similar micro-roughness to that in the rill replica was built. Rill and channel experiments were carried out at a slope of 8 degrees and at six discharges (8. 3 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the rill, and eight discharges (1. 6 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the channel. Non-erodible aggregates of three sizes (1 - 2, 3 - 5 and 5 - 10 mm) were released at the inlet of the rill/channel. The number of aggregates received at the outlet was registered. The number and position of the remaining aggregates along the rill/channel were also determined. The rill flow was a major sediment transport mechanism only during the formation of the rill, as during that period the power of the flow was great enough to overcome the influence of the macro-roughness of the rill bed. At lower discharges the transport capacity in the previously formed rill was significantly less than that in the flat channel under similar slope and discharge. This was determined to be due to local slowing of flow velocities at the exit of rill pools. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} the morphological {{response of}} a gravel-bed river to discharges of different magnitude (from moderate events that occur {{several times a}} year to a 12 -year flood) and so defines the range of <b>formative</b> <b>discharges</b> for single morphological units (channels, bars, islands) and a range of magnitude of morphological activity from the threshold discharges for gravel transport and minor bar modification up to flows causing major morphological changes. The study was conducted on the Tagliamento River, a large gravel-bed river in north-eastern Italy, using two different methods, analysis of aerial photographs and field observation of painted gravel particles. The available photographs (five flights from August 1997 to November 2002) and the two commissioned flights (June 2006 and April 2007) do not define periods with a single flood event, but the intervals are short enough (11 to 22 months) to have a limited number of flood events in each case. The fieldwork, which involved cross-section survey, grain-size analysis and observation of painted sediments, complemented the aerial surveys by allowing analysis of channel response to single flood events. Substantial morphological changes (e. g. bank erosion of several tens of metres up to more than 100 m) associated with flood events with a recurrence interval between 1 · 1 year and 12 years have been documented. Multiple forming discharges were defined based on the activity of different morphological units. Discharges equal to 20 – 50 % of the bankfull <b>discharge</b> are <b>formative</b> for the channels, whereas the bankfull discharge (1 · 1 year flood in this case of the Tagliamento River) is formative for low bars.

The <b>dominant</b> <b>formative</b> image of the G 20 has been that of a 21 st C concert of powers. Yet, as witnessed by the ongoing dynamics of the summit process, the G 20 has become fragmented. As the G 20 has moved away from its apex function, {{it has become a}} nexus forum/networked focal point. Of key importance in this context {{is the role of the}} BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. At the same time as this major challenger is increasingly embedded at the hub of global governance represented by the G 20, it is also engaged in a diverse array of parallel initiatives. In terms of their informal modes of operation, the G 20 and the BRICS share some marked similarities. As the roles of networked fora are consolidated, the diversity of activities expands to incorporate a range of state and non-state actors. However, at the same time the club culture of both the G 20 and the BRICS is contested, reducing the like-mindedness associated with traditional concerts of power. The conceptual arguments developed in this paper are illustrated and reinforced by recent practices, including the Hangzhou G 20 and the Goa BRICS summit. The global system is in the midst of a protracted period of discontinuity characterized by profound and intense tension between the push for a consolidated form of institutional synergy (with the G 20 as the hub focal point) and the pull towards potential fragmentation (with the BRICS as the core agent of change).

40|$|The Po River, in {{the last}} century, has {{undergone}} significant altimetrical and planimetrical changes, mostly induced by a progressively increasing human pressure. The extensive protection and regulations works carried out {{to reduce the risk}} of flooding, the narrowing of the river for improving the navigation, the local interruption of sediment transport caused by a large mobile barrage built for hydropower purposes and the intense sand mining caused huge alterations of the river morphology. These changes were ini- tially very fast and determined a significant and generalized deepening of the middle water course. In the last few decades, however, the pressure induced by human activities on the river decreased signifi- cantly and, consequently, a dynamic equilibrium condition tended to be re-established along most of the reaches, as suggested by topographic surveys spanning a period of about twenty years. The present con- tribution investigates this equilibrium condition by means of a one-dimensional movable bed model, with reference to a 98 kmlong reach located between the confluence with the Oglio stream and the gaug- ing section of Pontelagoscuro, for which an up to date stage-discharge relationship is available. Consid- ering steady forcing conditions, we estimate the <b>formative</b> <b>discharge</b> producing the observed river topography and the corresponding sediment transport capacity. The field surveys of cross section geom- etry used to investigate the possible existence of an equilibrium morphology span a period (1982 – 2005) of about twenty years. In the presence of fixed banks, the rived bed morphology appears to be controlled by relatively moderate discharges, quite close to the mean yearly discharge and significantly smaller than both the ordinary flood discharge and the maximum annual discharge. Even though significant deviations from equilibrium are produced by the sediment waves triggered by larger floods, deposition occurring during lower stages and the continuous reworking of the bed due to less intense but more frequent dis- charges implies a tendency of the river to recover its equilibrium profil...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{tests were}} {{undertaken}} {{to establish the}} formative mechanism for steps and pools in steep mountain streams. They indicated that the formation of steps and pools is associated with high intensity, low return interval events and the processes of armouring/paving and antidune formation. Lower than <b>formative</b> <b>discharges</b> give the structures their step-pool appearance, and under such discharges they are extremely stable. Step-pool streams may be modelled by a succession of artificial steps or weirs. Wooden steps were placed in a laboratory channel for this purpose, and clear water flow, clear water scour, and sediment transport tests undertaken {{for a range of}} discharges and channel slopes. Three distinct flow regimes were observed for the clear water flow and clear water scour tests. They were stable tumbling flow, unstable tumbling flow, and shooting flow. Sediment transport complicated the regimes from low transport rates. Unstable tumbling flow (clear water flow) at a low slope was shown to be caused by the breaking of standing waves at a theoretical maximum of 0. 142. For higher slopes (and including clear water scour tests), unstable tumbling flow was shown {{to be associated with the}} physical system geometry preventing the submerged hydraulic jump from developing fully. However, unstable tumbling flow was also caused at lower discharges by sediment waves which were a feature of some test runs with sediment transport. Even so, unstable tumbling flow is likely to occur under field conditions only rarely. With clear water scour, the scour dimensions corresponded to the ultimate static limit. That is, no sediment remains suspended by jet action as occurs for the dynamic limit of scour. For clear water flow and clear water scour, resistance to flow may be predicted by logarithmic equations. Resistance to flow with sediment transport correlated strongly with the average scour hole size. A sudden increase in average (and maximum) velocities indicated that with sediment transport, the erosive ability of a step-pool system may increase sharply as pools become drowned by sediment. For a given discharge, increasing the sediment transport rate beyond this drowning led to net deposition, but no real increase in average velocity. With sediment transport, sediment waves and water waves occurred (independently) despite steady inputs of both water and sediment. This behaviour parallels reports of sediment movement as waves in mountain streams. This tendency toward non-uniformity of water and sediment motion suggests that such behaviour may be explicable in terms of recent advances in nonlinear thermodynamics...|$|R

Within the study reaches, the grain size distribution of the sediments is significantly different between riffles and pools, being coarser in the former. The downstream fining tendency is evident as well, whereas the armour ratio seems more influenced by differences in sediment supply conditions rather than the downstream trend. A comparison of cross sections measured in 1997 and 2009 revealed an incision trend in {{the upper part of}} the study reach (which is 21 km long) and a sedimentation tendency in the lower part. This trend is confirmed by a numerical simulation which reveals a downstream reduction of shear stress, thus allowing sediment erosion (bank erosion and slight incision) in the upper portion of the reach and sedimentation downstream.

40|$|Abundant {{evidence}} exists for lakes on Mars both from orbital observations [e. g., 1 - 3] and in situ exploration [e. g., 4 - 5]. These lakes {{can be divided}} into two classes: those that were hydrologically closed, so their source valley(s) terminated at the basin [3], and those that were hydrologically open, where there was sufficient flow from inlet valley(s) to cause the lake to breach and form an outlet valley [2]. It is easier to be confident from orbital data alone that a standing body of water must have existed in open basins, because {{there is no other way}} for their perched outlet valleys to form. The majority of basins fed by valley networks, rather than by isolated inlet valleys, are open [6], with some important exceptions (e. g., Gale Crater). Jezero crater (Fig. 1) is one of the most well-studied open basin paleolakes on Mars, with a breach that re-mains well above the lowest part of the crater floor, and two sedimentary fans at its northwestern margin that are likely deltaic in origin [7 - 9]. CRISM observations of these sediments indicate they host a variety of alteration minerals [9 - 11], including smectite and carbonate, and both the mineralogy of the sediments and their settings suggest they have a strong potential for preserving organic materials [10]. As a result, Jezero is a strong candidate landing site for the Mars 2020 rover. Approximate <b>formative</b> <b>discharges</b> have been estimated for its well-preserved western fan (Q approximately 500 m 3 /s) [7], but to our knowledge, no estimates for the dis-charges associated with formation and incision of its outlet valley have been presented. Indeed, only a few studies [e. g., 12 - 14] have attempted to reconstruct the formation of outlet breaches broadly similar to Jezero anywhere on Mars, despite the apparent commonality of basins with large outlets [e. g., 2]. The outlet valley formed as a dam breach when the lake overflowed. In such an event, the growth and incision of the breach is directly coupled to flood discharge. In the case of Jezero, the discharge through the breach eventually lacked the energy needed to erode through the dam further, preventing complete drainage of the lake. After the initial flood, further incision can take place if additional water flows into, and thus out of, the hydrologically open lake, though the rate of this erosion occurs under more typical fluvial conditions. Despite this qualitative understanding of the process, it is useful to explore numerically what range of model parameters are potentially consistent with obser-vations of the outlet. We ultimately seek to address questions that include: (1) What was the flood hydro-graph?, (2) What sediment transport processes were involved and what can we infer about the erosion process? (3) Can most or all of the Jezero outlet's morphology be explained as a consequence of catastrophic formation, or is additional longer-term erosion required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{results are}} {{presented}} of investigating temporal and spatial development of electrical glow discharge in a neon filled tube under 4 mbar pressure. Linear increasing voltage (at 5 V/s increasing voltage rate) {{is applied to the}} gas diode. Time dependence of 585. 2 nm line light emitted from negative glow is observed from various positions in the diode during formation of electrical discharge. The results show that the development of glow discharge starts in the gap, and propagates to the cathode and in the space around and behind the cathode. An unexpected two-step current rise is found. In the stationary regime, most of the emitted light occupied the cathode carrier rod. This indicates the position where the secondary electron emission is intensive. It corresponds to the second step in the current increase app. 3 ms after the breakdown has already taken place. It is assumed that this step originates from different surface characteristics of the rode material. The analysis of time dependencies of the current and light from the negative glow, from different positions in the gas diode, suggests that the observation of deexcitation processes in gas can be used for determination of early <b>discharge</b> <b>formative</b> processes, as well as processes that lead to the stationary regime in the gas diode tube...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a study of Pieris’ {{theological}} writings {{with a focus on}} his particular contribution to the post-Vatican II development of the theology of religions and its implication for a renewed understanding of divine revelation/salvation and Christ in the context of religious pluralism and poverty in Sri Lanka. The main objective of this project is to bring to attention Pieris’ notion of the Word-Crucified, a central notion of his theology of religions, as a catalyst and a compass to set the right direction with a reverential attitude towards other religions in the Sri Lankan context. The reason for this undertaking is the reality of Christianity’s place as “stranger” and “intruder” (foreignness) in the context of Sri Lanka. Hence, the Sri Lankan Church is in need of a language to communicate the credibility of revelation in the process of becoming a Church of Sri Lanka with a sound theology that views other religions as co-partners within God’s one single but progressive and holistic economy of salvation for humanity. Here, we underscore that Buddhism, from the time of its introduction to Ceylon in the third century B. C. has been a <b>dominant</b> <b>formative</b> factor in the Sri Lankan historical and cultural transformation. Hence, we need to recognize the importance of perceiving the Word-Crucified through the soteriological perspectives of non-Christian religions, particularly, Buddhism. A critical analysis of the development of Sri Lankan theology would show that the renewal of the Sri Lankan Church after Vatican II Council was basically worked out within the framework of adaptation. This model is associated with an infiltration of the faith into a culture. This approach deprives the culture of its own religious content. Hence, the Church failed to enter effectively into the religio-cultural fabric of Sri Lanka. This scenario shows that the Catholic Church did not possess a relevant theology that considered local contextual realities as its resources to back its renewal programme. It had traces of the “triumphalistic” ecclesiology of the colonial era. This search for a proper theological idiom is a challenge against the historical background of centuries of cultural estrangement during the colonial period and {{in the context of the}} present religio-cultural awakening. Here, we argue that the Sri Lankan Church should relentlessly engage in a Triple-Dialogue that would allow her to nurture the essence of faith in Jesus Christ while separating it from the trappings of the colonial experience. This is a call for inculturation understood in terms of the local Christian Church getting involved in the local people’s struggle for full humanity. This will eventually deepen the roots of the Sri Lankan Church in the life and culture of the people, most of whom are non-Christians. As for the most effective model of inculturation we propose the “monastic model” of participation in a non-Christian spirituality. In Chapter One we examine the religious heritage of Sri Lanka as predominantly Buddhist, which reshaped its national and cultural identity. The overall purpose of this chapter is to set the background to think anew the credibility of Christian revelation from within the religious pluralism and abject poverty of Sri Lanka. In this chapter we discuss the religio-cultural alienation brought about by the aggressive evangelization of the missionaries during the colonial period which caused the rise of “Protestant Buddhism. ” It also marked the height of positive Buddhist revivalism. This chapter briefly studies a few pioneering efforts to overcome the foreignness of Christianity. Chapter Two investigates the theological and spiritual journey of Pieris in order to shed light on his theological originality. It takes into account an overview of Pieris’ childhood and family atmosphere, his vocation as a Jesuit and his academic formation. It highlights the unique background of Pieris to show his moral authority and obligation for a fresh “Sri Lanka’s/Asia’s search for Christ” centered on Christ’s mission of love which he articulates in his paradigm of Covenant Christology. The main text examined is Pieris’ unpublished autobiography. Chapter Three examines in detail Pieris’ notion of the Word-Crucified, the foundation of his paradigm of Covenant Christology. This main chapter of the dissertation intends to provide the direction and the basis for a relevant theology of revelation and Christology for Sri Lanka. This chapter brings to light Pieris’ unique theological contribution which fills a lacuna in the present theological thinking in Sri Lanka in the context of religious pluralism. It also endeavours to show how the notion of the Word-Crucified gives the Sri Lankan Church and its theology a credible and necessary basis for a much needed Triple-Dialogue. Chapter Four presents Pieris’ Asian paradigm of theology of religious pluralism built on his Covenant Christology. The principal aim of this chapter is to highlight and appreciate the unique theological contribution of Pieris to the Sri Lankan Church as she finds her way in a context of religio-cultural pluralism that is predominantly Buddhist. This chapter also discusses his “integral approach” to religious pluralism, which can be applied to the wider Asian Context. On the basis of this study, we maintain in the General Conclusion that the Sri Lankan Church needs to participate in the local cultural ethos and soteriological nucleus of its religions in becoming a Church of Sri Lanka. It would provide the point of re-entry to Christ while the Church would regain its lost ‘authority’ and local recognition that comes with being a Church of the poor. The concluding remarks ends with an indication of the possible areas of further study and a guiding theological orientation to the Sri Lankan Church...|$|R

Quantitative research methodologies were utilized to describe the perceptions of formative assessment {{in a sample of}} North Carolina school district professionals and tested for any statistically significant relationships to EOG, EOC, and AYP proficiencies.   The findings provided preliminary data on the perceptions of formative assessment in North Carolina school districts. Each district was able to be statically placed in a cluster and then evaluated for relationships with student and district proficiencies.   It was found that differences between clusters were statistically significant; however, the parametric statistic was extremely sensitive to the large sample size of the study. Due to the small differences and the large sample sizes, it was determined that the differences were practically insignificant. The findings indicate the lack of a <b>dominant</b> perception about <b>formative</b> assessment and may suggest North Carolina education professionals are unsure or unaware of formative assessment implementation. A major implication from the study that is relevant to state educational policymakers and school leaders is the importance of communicating a clear, coherent formative assessment implementation plan consistent with the purpose.   Over time, future research studies on the perceptions of formative assessments may build a more comprehensive picture of school professionals' perceptions of formative assessment and how they affect school improvement in North Carolina. Such research could include qualitative inclusive case studies focusing on specific districts that have a cohesive perception of formative assessment. This work could also include a methodological component that quantifies the relationship between perceptions of formative assessment and student proficiencies.   Ed. D...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{predicting}} {{the effects of}} width variability and the controls on width adjustment in rivers has {{a key role in}} developing management approaches able to account for the physical, ecological and socio-economical dimensions of a river system. Width adaptation in a river occurs due to erosion and accretion of banks, within various geomorphic, environmental and anthropogenic contexts, which set the most relevant factors controlling the morphological dynamics of the river corridor. In turn, changes in channel width imply alterations of the river channel morphodynamics at a variety of space and time scales, implying, for instance, modifications of important controlling parameters, like the width-to-depth ratio, which is closely related to the planform morphology of alluvial rivers. Width adaptation bears crucial implications for river management: on one hand, channel widening may result in loss of valuable land and in the increase of the damage risk of infrastructures in surrounding areas, which are often subjected to increasing pressures related to human settlements and economic activities. On the other hand, several approaches to river restoration are based on the concept of “giving more room to the river”, and thus allow the banks to erode and widen, to increase morphological and physical habitat diversity. In view of these implications, the prediction of width adaptation, understanding of its main causes and controlling factors, and quantification of the riverbed morphodynamic response to width variability is of crucial importance to support effective river management. The practical and engineering interest on stable cross-sections of alluvial channels has attracted a considerable amount of scientific research since late 19 th century. Much of the research has focused in developing width prediction tools mostly based on empirical approaches and methods based on extremal hypothesis and to lesser extent on mechanistic methods. In the past two decades, research has advanced in developing numerical models including geotechnical as well as fluvial processes to simulate bank failure mechanism more accurately. Despite significant development on the width predictors, research in controls on width evolution of river channels cannot still be considered a fully settled issue. The study of the morphodynamic response of the riverbed to width variability in space and time is somehow more recent, and has focussed on the dynamics of large-scale bedforms (river bars) that produce a variety of riverbed configurations and planform morphologies. The effect of spatial width variability on river bars has mainly been based on assessing the role of such planform forcing effects to the bed topography, both in case of straight and meandering river channels. The amplitude of width variability has been related to fundamental questions as those behind the transition between single- and multi-thread river morphologies, and most studies consider regular spatial variations of the channel width. Research on the response of channel bed to spatial width variability has mostly consisted of modelling and theoretical approaches, which point out the limit cases of a purely “free” system response, associated with morphodynamic instability, an of purely “forced” bedform pattern by spatial planform non-homogeneity. The large spectrum of mixed configurations between those two theoretical limits has been so far seldom investigated, despite its strong relevance for real river systems. The limits of what can actually be considered a “planform forcing” effect, or has instead a too small variability have never been clarified, a well as its role on the resulting channel morphodynamics. For instance, the effects of small amplitude width variations on straight channels, which may be due to imperfect bank lines or protrusion due to vegetations, on morphodynamics of river bed has been neglected so far. This study has two main scientific goals. The first goal is to quantitatively investigate the role of potentially controlling factors on the width evolution of bedload-dominated straight river channels, including the initial channel width, the flow regime and the sediment supply regime. The major question driving the research is whether a river would attain the same width independently of the initial conditions and whether this would be true for all types of discharge regimes of water and sediment supply. The study is carried out using both laboratory experiments (Chapter 3), analytical model (Chapter 4) and numerical model (Chapter 5) tested with reference to real river data. Integrating the results of the experiments with those of analytical and numerical models allows deriving a more robust and complete understanding of the processes involved, including transient width evolution, time scales to morphodynamic equilibrium, equilibrium conditions and role of each controlling factor. In Chapter 3 a set of controlled laboratory experiments have been performed to study channel adjustments in a movable-bed, erodible-bank channel under different flow and sediment regimes and different initial widths. The long-term width evolution is observed to be independent of initial channel width under uniform <b>formative</b> <b>discharge</b> without upstream sediment supply. Width evolution rate is observed to depend on the initial channel width when the sediment is supplied from upstream with the narrowest initial channel evolving at the highest widening rate and resulting into the widest channel. A physics based analytical model of channel adjustment (Chapter 4) has been applied to some of the experiments described in Chapter 3. Furthermore, in Chapter 5 a field scale numerical model was setup using the flow and topographic data of gravel bed reach of Upper Severn River near Abermule (UK). The trend of width evolution computed by analytical model is also qualitatively in agreement with the observations in the experiments. The results of numerical modeling have further supported the observations in the experiments which reinforce the findings in agreement with laws of physics. The second goal of the present PhD research is to analyze the morphodynamic response of the riverbed to small-scale spatial variability of the channel width, focusing on alternate bars. The main question driving the investigation (Chapter 6) is to which extent small-amplitude, irregular width variations in space affect the morphodynamics of river bars, the fundamental riverbed patterns at the scale of the channel width. The key theoretical question behind this investigation is to which extent “small amplitude” width variations can be considered as a planform forcing, for the channel bed morphodynamic response, and whether it is possible to establish a threshold amplitude below which they may act as a near bank-roughness element. The study is based on hydraulic conditions typical of bedload-dominated piedmont streams, often having flows with Froude numbers around 1 or higher at bar-forming or channel-forming conditions. The study is developed through a numerical modeling approach. Because of the considered hydraulic conditions (close to critical-Froude number) first, a comparison is made between one semi-coupled numerical morphodynamic model, expected to be most suitable for sub critical flows, and one fully-coupled numerical morphodynamic model which can handle Froude-critical flows to assess the potential shortcomings of applying a semi-coupled model under close-to-critial Froude conditions. Such test, (Appendix B) supports the use of both models, and the semi-coupled model is eventually preferred for the advantages in computational speed. Such model is used for the numerical investigations performed in Chapter 6 and to some extent also in Chapter 5. The comparison is based on the reproduction of alternate bars morphodynamics observed in existing sets of flume experiments with fixed banks and super-critical flow conditions. The results of numerical modeling have shown that the small width variations have accelerated the development of the steady bars suppressing the free bar instability. Further investigations reveal that the effects of small width variations to a certain extent can be captured by parameterizing them in the form of increased roughness close to the banks or as small obstructions along the banks. ...|$|R
