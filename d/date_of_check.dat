40|$|Sixty-nine Chiropsalmus quadrigatus medusae were {{collected}} from Okinawa Island, Japan, in June-August 2000. The bell height ranged from 2. 5 to 97. 6 mm. The numbers of fine rings on polished statoliths were counted, and the coefficient of variation for the within-individual counts for the four statoliths was 3. 3 ± 1. 9 % (mean::tSD, n= 17). The slope of the linear regression {{of the number of}} rings against collecting date in 61 medusae was near 1. 0, suggesting that the statolith rings are daily increments. The relationship between bell height and number of rings fitted a logistic growth curve. And, the relationship between statolith length and number of rings fitted the Gompertz growth curve. A check ring was present at a position of 5 - 10 rings from the center of each statolith. The backcalculated <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>check</b> ring formation <b>dated</b> mainly from early to mid June, suggesting that the polyp of C. quadrigatus finished the metamorphosis to medusa and the medusa was liberated from a substratum during this period...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the response of}} consumption expenditures to the monthly receipt <b>of</b> Social Security <b>checks.</b> Since the amount and arrival <b>date</b> <b>of</b> these <b>checks</b> are known to the recipients, the basic Life-Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis (LCPIH) predicts that consumption should {{not respond to the}} receipt <b>of</b> these <b>checks.</b> Using daily diary data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, this paper finds evidence that both the dollar amount and probability of expenditures increase immediately following the receipt <b>of</b> this <b>check.</b> Most relevant to testing the LCPIH, categories of instantaneous consumption expenditure such as food away from home increase on the check arrival date. The response is found primarily amongst households for whom Social Security is the primary source of income. However, the magnitude of the estimated responses are relatively small and do not suggest that the utility losses are large from this non-smoothing behavior. ...|$|R

Failure criteria {{should be able to}} detect solder joint failure as early as possible, while minimizing the probability of false detection. The failure mechanism under study is cracks due to thermal fatigue. The most common method to estimate failure due to cracks is to monitor the resistance during testing, because solder imaging and cross-sectioning methods are destructive. Current industry failure criteria do not adequately demonstrate the relationship between the size of the crack and the resulting change in resistance. This project analyzes data from a thermal fatigue reliability study of low-silver ball grid array spheres. Traditional quality control charts are used to estimate the time-to-failure of the solder joints, as well as observe common failure trends. These time-to-failure estimates ar...|$|R

The need for such an analysis arises due to the following policy proposal : the Turkish government considers increasing the lump-sum amount that drawee banks are legally responsible to pay per bad check. We show that banks will tend to restrict the quantity <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> {{as a response to}} such a policy action. We report that a percentage increase in banks' obligation per bad check could lead up to a 1. 7 % decline in the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> on the margin. We establish that the extent of the monopoly distortion depends on three main factors : (i) the elasticity <b>of</b> demand for <b>checks,</b> (ii) how fast the fraction <b>of</b> bad <b>checks</b> increase with the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks,</b> and (iii) the degree <b>of</b> preference heterogeneity. <b>Checks,</b> regulation, monopoly power, preference heterogeneity. ...|$|R

The study ends by speculating on why checks are used more than less-costly alternatives and by encouraging policymakers to wait for researchers to adequately answer that question before intervening in the market for payment instruments.
