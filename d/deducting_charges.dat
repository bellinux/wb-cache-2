After three months of unproductive negotiations between the employers of the Winnipeg builders exchange and the union, worker frustration grew. The city council's new proposal to the workers was unsatisfactory to the four departments, electrical workers took action and a strike was established. Waterworks and fire department employees joined a few days later. Strikers were labelled as Bolsheviks who were attempting to undermine Canada. The city council viewed this as unacceptable and thus dismissed the striking workers. This did not discourage the latter; instead, other civic unions joined the strike out of sympathy, which was an important feature of twentieth century social history.|$|R

Management of the crossing was contracted to Le Crossing Company Limited on behalf of the Highways Agency. In September 2009 the Highways Agency made a new contract with Connect Plus (M25) Limited. As well as maintaining the crossing, the contract required the company to widen around 40 miles of the M25 and to refurbish a tunnel on the A1(M) at Hatfield. In October 2009, the Government announced its intention to sell the crossing as part of a public sector deficit reduction strategy. The announcement was unpopular with local residents, who encouraged drivers to sound their horns in protest when using the crossing. [...] After the change of government following the 2010 Election, the new prime minister David Cameron announced that the crossing might still be sold, despite local opposition, particularly from Gareth Johnson, member of parliament for Dartford. Subsequently, the chancellor George Osborne announced that charges would be increased instead to cover the budget deficit. Pre-pay accounts for the crossing were introduced around this time; drivers held an electronic device called a DART-Tag in the vehicle that automatically <b>deducted</b> the <b>charge</b> at payment booths.

40|$|The {{financial}} implications of manipulating nitrogen (N) inputs and management strategies for beef production systems were assessed. One-hectare grassland farmlets were grazed to a target sward height by beef steers; herbage surplus to grazing requirements was cut for silage. Three systems were compared: ‘CN’, conventional mineral N application to a grass monoculture and broadcast slurry; ‘TN’, tactical mineral N application at fortnightly intervals to a grass monoculture with slurry injection {{and the early}} housing of cattle; ‘GC’, a mixed grass/white clover sward with no mineral N addition and slurry injection. Comparisons were made on two contrasting soil types: a freely-draining sandy loam (site 1) and a poorly drained clay (site 2). Financial budgets for 1999 - 2000 show that estimated gross profit margins (gross outputs minus variable costs), after <b>deducting</b> contractor’s <b>charges</b> for sward preparation and fertiliser spreading, were highest for treatment CN at both sites Î(€ 1552, € 1356 and € 1461 ha- 1 for site 1 and € 1562, € 1281 and € 1287 ha- 1 for site 2, for treatments CN, TN and GC, respectively). Treatment TN was penalised by increased costs associated with an extended housed period {{and the need to}} purchase additional silage for winter feeding which cost € 242 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 250 ha- 1 at site 2. Savings in N fertiliser for TN in comparison with CN (€ 44 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 39 ha- 1 at site 2) were more than offset by the increased costs of fortnightly fertiliser applications (€ 54 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 46 ha- 1 at site 2). Treatment GC benefited from zero costs for the purchase and spreading of mineral N fertiliser but was penalised by increased variation in forage DM production which resulted in a shortfall in winter fodder requirements with a replacement cost of € 250 at site 1 and € 435 at site 2. The best overall economic performance after the allocation of all possible relevant costs (variable, fixed and capital) in terms of the relative net profit margin, was for GC at site 1 and for CN at site 2 (-€ 1358, -€ 2399 and -€ 1304 ha- 1 at site 1 and -€ 1122, -€ 2810 and - € 1380 ha- 1 at site 2, for CN, TN and GC, respectively). The opportunity costs of reducing N surpluses at the gross profit margin level (after contractor’s charges) for treatments TN and GC over treatment CN were calculated at € 2. 29 kg- 1 N surplus for TN and € 0. 67 kg- 1 N surplus for GC at site 1, with corresponding values of € 4. 91 and € 1. 57 at site 2.

The data used in this analysis were the confidential documents produced by the Karafuto government and the local newspaper, 2 ̆ 7 Karafuto nichinichi shinbun 2 ̆ 7, which were obtained from the diplomatic record office of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Hakodate city library and the National Diet Library. The results of the paper can be summarized as follows. The employment of Chinese workers was caused by the need to develop the colony and the severe shortage of labor in Sakhalin. Namely, after world war I, in Sakhalin, a paper manufacturing industry developed, but labor to construct plants and infrastructure was in short supply. Therefore, the Karafuto government considered the use of Chinese workers. When the Karafuto government recruited Chinese workers, they assigned a quota to companies and contractors which expected to employ them and the authorities forced these employers to abide by this rule. Furthermore, the authorities prepared a detailed outline to manage Chinese workers and forced employers to abide by these laws. The main aspects of this outline were as follows: (1) to employ Chinese as seasonal workers in order to prevent them from permanent residence; (2) to force Chinese workers from having as little contact as possible with Japanese people, and (3) to gather Chinese workers from the same region or village in order to link friends and relatives which would serve as a deterrent to escape. Thus, Chinese workers were employed as seasonal workers from 1923 to 1927. They were gathered from around the province of Shandong in Northern China and were employed in various undertakings, such as railroad construction, plant construction, mining, and so on. Among these undertakings, the largest was the construction work of the Karafuto east coastal railroad leading from Otiai to Siritori. During construction, about 1, 500 Chinese workers were employed. However, some local residents started movements against the use of Chinese workers on this project. Merchants in Toyohara, Maoka, and Tomarioru districts were especially opposed to the use of Chinese workers, on the grounds that they would not contribute to the local economy due to their tendency to save money and send wage remittances to China. In addition, labor disputes were often raised by Chinese workers regarding their employment. The main reasons for these disputes were poor working conditions, such as a low wage level, nonpayment of wages, contract discrepancies and charges paid to middlemen for their passage to Sakhalin. In those days, the wage levels of Japanese workers who were employed in the construction and labor sectors were 2. 0 to 3. 5 yen a day, and those of Korean workers, who were colonized under Japan, were 1. 8 to 2. 5 yen a day. However, those of Chinese workers were about 1 yen a day at first, but their wages were later raised by 0. 2 to 0. 3 yen. Furthermore, from their wages employers <b>deducted</b> food expenses, <b>charges,</b> and so on, thus reducing their net wage to only 0. 6 to 0. 7 yen per day. In spite of these movements against Chinese workers and the labor disputes raised by them, the Karafuto government allowed companies and contractors to employ Chinese workers for five years in order to attempt to halt the increasing population of Korean workers. According to the results of the national census taken in 1930, the Korean population in Sakhalin was 8, 301, which accounted for 2. 81 percent of its total population. Compared with the Korean population in 1920, which were 934, the number increased rapidly in 1930. The Karafuto government attempted to accomplish these employment policies toward Chinese workers on the grounds that Chinese workers were easier to manage as seasonal workers. China was not a colony of Japan so that they could if necessary be deported, which differentiated them from Koreans who were under colonial rule. Hence, while the Karafuto government had a policy of accepting Korean workers and excluding Chinese workers, which previous studies have clarified, the government in fact altered its policies toward Chinese and Korean workers arbitrarily, according to local conditions...|$|R

These terms and conditions, as here set forth, when the said district shall become a separate and independent state, shall, ipso facto be incorporated into, and become and be a part of any constitution, provisional or other, under which the government of the said proposed state, shall, at any time hereafter, be administered; subject however, to be modified, or annulled, by the agreement of the legislature of both the said states; but by no other power or body whatsoever." ...|$|R
