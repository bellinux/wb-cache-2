2500|$|The Internal Revenue Code {{states that}} [...] "gross income means all income from {{whatever}} source derived," [...] and gives specific examples. [...] Gross income {{is not limited}} to cash received. [...] "It includes income realized in any form, whether money, property, or services." [...] Gross income includes wages and tips, fees for performing services, gain from sale of inventory or other property, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, pensions, alimony, and many other types of income. [...] Items must be included in income when received or accrued. [...] The amount included is the amount the taxpayer is entitled to receive.

2500|$|During the English tour of Australia in 1876–77, the Australian all-rounder and {{impresario}} John Conway met the English captain James Lillywhite in Melbourne {{and discussed}} the potential profitability of an Australian team visiting England. Lillywhite {{agreed to take}} soundings at home {{and see if the}} major English teams would consider hosting a team of [...] "the best cricketers in the colonies". During the 1877 English season, Lillywhite made enquiries and was encouraged by the feedback. He contacted Conway to report interest and, with the possibility of [...] "good money", offered to arrange a fixture list. Conway negotiated with Dave Gregory who had captained the [...] "Combined XI from Sydney and Melbourne" [...] against Lillywhite's professionals in what latterly became recognised as the first two Test matches. It was agreed that the players would form a private company by contributing £50 each to cover expenses, profits to be shared accordingly although Conway as manager would take 7.5% of <b>gross</b> <b>proceeds.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While {{appearing}} humorous and kind-hearted in public, by {{all accounts}} Van Vliet was a severe taskmaster who abused his musicians verbally and sometimes physically. Vliet once told drummer John French he had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and thus he would see inexistent conspiracies that explained this behaviour. The band were reportedly paid little or nothing. French recalled that the musicians' contract with Van Vliet's company stipulated that Van Vliet and the managers were paid from <b>gross</b> <b>proceeds</b> before expenses, then expenses were paid, then the band members evenly split any remaining funds—in effect making band members liable for all expenses. As a result, French was paid nothing at all for a 33-city US tour in 1971 {{and a total of}} $78 for a tour of Europe and the US in late 1975. In his 2010 memoir Beefheart: Through The Eyes of Magic French recounted being [...] "...screamed at, beaten up, drugged, ridiculed, humiliated, arrested, starved, stolen from, and thrown down a half-flight of stairs by his employer".|$|E

2500|$|In 1878, Mullan {{approached}} California Governor William Irwin, {{offering to}} seek compensation {{from the federal}} government for a flaw in the California statehood act. Traditionally, when admitting new states to the union, the federal government agreed to give the state 5 percent of the <b>gross</b> <b>proceeds</b> from the sale of federal land in that state. [...] California's statehood act, enacted in 1850, neglected to include this provision. The state legislature passed a resolution in 1858 asking the federal government to pay, but no action on the resolution ever occurred. Mullan, who had {{spent a great deal of}} time in the past five years in the national capital working on his land business, now proposed to represent California in Washington, D.C., to secure these missing funds. In return, the state would pay Mullan 20 percent of the funds he collected. The state legislature passed a resolution authorizing the governor to appoint an agent, and Irwin appointed Mullan on November 1, 1878. The states of Nevada and Oregon, in similar straits as California, had by 1881 also hired Mullan as their agent to seek payment {{from the federal government}}. The Washington Territory did so as well in 1886.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{establish}} the determinants of IPO survival on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE). Using the Kaplan-Meier test, this study established that firms less than five years prior to listing on the JSE have a significant smaller mean survival time; firms with a <b>gross</b> <b>proceed</b> less than the median have a significant shorter mean survival time; overpriced IPOs have a significant higher survival time; IPOs listed during the hot market period on the JSE have a significant smaller mean survival time and IPOs with return on asset, operating profit margin, and return on equity {{less than or equal to}} zero have a low mean survival time. Also, being in the internet industry significantly shortens the mean survival time of an IPO. Moreover, based on the Cox Proportional Hazard model, it was established that the determinants of IPO survivability on the JSE are the firms’ age, size, market period, return on equity and operating profit margin are. These findings provide investors and companies in the JSE with empirical evidence of the determinants of IPO survivability of the JSE. As such, investors are advised to consider these factors when selecting their portfolio...|$|R

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) This {{purpose of}} this study is to measure the {{voluntary}} disclosure of intellectual capital information in Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses for companies that listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2008 and 2009. Content analysis was conducted in calculating the disclosure score, which was based on an intellectual capital (IC) framework with 81 items. Correlations and regressions were used to test the relationships between disclosure index, underpricing, and subcategories of intellectual capital with different variables including retained ownership, auditor reputation, sponsor prestige, solicitor prestige, leverage, executive compensation, <b>gross</b> <b>proceed</b> amount, age, size, partial allocation of proceeds to research and development area, managerial forecast, and pre-listing profitability. Eight hypotheses were developed to test the relationships between these variables with underpricing (H 1), intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) (H 2), human resource capital (H 3), strategic capital (H 4), customer capital (H 5), information technology capital (H 6), process capital (H 7), and research and development capital (H 8). The results showed an average of 9. 99 % for underpricing and an average disclosure score of 27. 94 % for the two years. Hypotheses 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 were accepted as the independent variables were not found to have any significant influence on underpricing, IC disclosure, strategic capital disclosure, customer capital disclosure, or information technology capital disclosure. Hypotheses 3, 7, and 8 were rejected, which stated that the reputation of the auditor had significant influence on human resource capital; that the company’s age had significant associations with process capital; and that executive compensation, company size, and proceeds directed to research and development had significant relationships with research and development capital. Since the content analysis was conducted by one person, the results may not be completely objective, and the quality of disclosure had not been taken into the score calculation. The results may provide insights that assist local regulatory bodies to formulate regulations on mandatory information disclosure or on drafting guidelines on voluntary disclosure for IPOs...|$|R
