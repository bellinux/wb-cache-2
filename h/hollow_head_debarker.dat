50|$|The {{heads were}} {{discovered}} initially as a surface find {{by a young}} boy named Ludwig Von Bezing while playing on his fathers farm. The material was later collected when Ludwig was a teenager. He went back in both 1962 and 1966 to excavate the area and during {{this time he was}} able to find several pieces of pottery that proved to be seven <b>hollow</b> <b>heads</b> when assembled, two of which can fit over a child's head; only one out of the seven heads resembles an animal.|$|R

5000|$|Glove puppetry (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pò͘-tē-hì; Traditional Chinese: 布袋戲, {{literally}} [...] "cloth bag opera") {{is by far}} {{the best-known}} opera form of Hokkien origin. It originated in Hokkien in around 17th century, and is a form of opera that uses cloth puppets and music to tell stories. Puppets used in glove puppetry have <b>hollow</b> <b>heads</b> carved with wood. Their palms and feet are also made of wood, but the torso and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. During a performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet's costume and make it move. The puppets used in these shows used to strongly resemble cloth sacks, hence the name [...] "cloth bag opera".|$|R
500|$|Gryposaurus was a saurolophine (hadrosaurine {{of older}} references) hadrosaurid, {{a member of}} the {{duckbill}} subfamily without <b>hollow</b> <b>head</b> crests. The general term [...] "gryposaur" [...] is sometimes used for duckbills with arched nasals. Tethyshadros was once thought to fall into this group as well, before it was described (then known under the nickname [...] "Antonio"). A subfamily, Gryposaurinae, was coined by Jack Horner {{as part of a larger}} revision that promoted Hadrosaurinae to family status, but is not now in use. A rough equivalent is Kritosaurini, as used by Alberto Prieto-Márquez. The main difference between the two is and age (Kritosaurus comes from slightly younger rocks than Gryposaurus). Otherwise, the skull of Kritosaurus is incompletely known, lacking most of the bones in front of the eyes, but very similar to that of Gryposaurus.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{components}} of the TMNT realm is the radioactive slime Retromutagen Ooze, which mutated the Ninja Turtles from common house pets to [...] "mean, green, fightin' machines." [...] Thus, even Ooze was produced for the interaction with TMNT figures in 1989. The green slime was sold in a small container which also included a glow-in-the-dark Ninja Turtle in mid-mutation. Aside from the classic [...] "Turtle Green," [...] a [...] "Purple Foot" [...] variation would also become available in 1993. Ooze was an essential component to playsets such as the Flushomatic, and action figures like Muckman, who could have it run from his <b>hollow</b> <b>head</b> and out his mouth. Depending on their features, occasional figures and accessories came with their own smaller canister of Ooze to fulfill the playtime experience.|$|R
40|$|Two {{retrieved}} Moore type hip prostheses of cast Co-Cr-Mo-alloy {{were examined}} after metallic failure. The first case concerns a fatigue fracture in {{the stem of}} the prosthesis due to an abrupt change in the cross-sectional area {{and the presence of}} inappropriate welding beads in the stem. The abrupt change occurring at a transition from an I-beam into a rectangular profile gives rise to stress concentrations thus increasing chance of fatigue crack initiation. The second case is a fracture of the <b>hollow</b> <b>head</b> of the prosthesis through a weld. The two parts of the cast femoral head were incompletely welded. Comparison with similar welds in other femoral heads of prostheses of the same type reveals a poor welding uniformity. Hence, both fractures are associated with the welding process. A critical investigation is needed to find optimal welding conditions for Co-Cr-Mo-alloy prostheses. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|It is {{yet another}} steep and rocky climb up the eastern slope of Plateau Mountain. A good spring can be found about a quarter-mile from the <b>hollow</b> (<b>headed</b> up the mountain), and the 3,855-foot (1,175 m) summit itself is just off-trail 0.75 mi later. The newly rerouted Long Path also comes in from the South on Plateau. The ensuing walk across the aptly named Plateau is seen as another {{attraction}} of the trail. While there are no views, the 2.25 mi are the longest high-elevation level walk in the Catskills, surrounded entirely by boreal forest, with only 200 feet (62 m) of elevation loss (or gain) along the way. It {{comes to an end}} shortly after Danny's Lookout to the northeast, at another spectacular view to the west, Orchard (sometimes Orchid) Point. Here Hunter, Southwest Hunter Mountain and West Kill Mountain loom ahead, across the depth of Stony Clove Notch.|$|R
60|$|This is what Grace Bentham {{proceeded}} to do. Arriving in Dawson {{with a few}} pounds of flour and several letters of introduction, she at once applied herself {{to the task of}} pushing her big baby to the fore. It was she who melted the stony heart and wrung credit from the rude barbarian who presided over the destiny of the P. C. Company; yet it was Edwin Bentham to whom the concession was ostensibly granted. It was she who dragged her baby up and down creeks, over benches and divides, and on a dozen wild stampedes; yet everybody remarked what an energetic fellow that Bentham was. It was she who studied maps, and catechised miners, and hammered geography and locations into his <b>hollow</b> <b>head,</b> till everybody marveled at his broad grasp of the country and knowledge of its conditions. Of course, they said the wife was a brick, and only a few wise ones appreciated and pitied the brave little woman.|$|R

25|$|Pachelbel {{employed}} white mensural notation {{when writing}} out numerous compositions (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias); a notational system that uses <b>hollow</b> note <b>heads</b> and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). The system had been widely used since the 15th century but was gradually being replaced {{in this period}} by modern notation (sometimes called black notation). In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity.|$|R

5|$|Excavations on Glastonbury Tor, {{undertaken}} {{by a team}} led by Philip Rahtz between 1964 and 1966, revealed evidence of Dark Age occupation during the 5th to 7th centuries around the later medieval church of St. Michael. Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker's forge, two burials oriented north-south (thus unlikely to be Christian), fragments of 6th century Mediterranean amphorae (vases for wine or cooking oil), and a worn <b>hollow</b> bronze <b>head</b> which may have topped a Saxon staff.|$|R
5000|$|The series starred Milton the Monster, a Frankenstein-looking monster with a flat-topped, {{seemingly}} <b>hollow</b> <b>head</b> which emitted various {{quantities of}} white steam or smoke {{based on his}} mood or situation. He was created by mad scientist Professor Montgomery Weirdo and his assistant Count Kook, {{who lived in a}} haunted house on Horror Hill. Milton is a smiling, good-natured fellow, thanks to the Professor having used too much [...] "tincture of tenderness" [...] as explained in the opening theme of each individual Milton the Monster segment. Milton was created not of individual body parts, but rather in a mold from such liquids as [...] "essence of terror" [...] and [...] "sinister sauce." [...] Out of fear of his creation destroying him, Professor Weirdo intended to add just a touch of the aforementioned tincture of tenderness to the mold, but Count Kook bumped the Professor's elbow, resulting in too much of the tincture being added to the mix. Milton's voice, which was based on the southern accent used by Jim Nabors in his television role as Gomer Pyle, was provided by Bob McFadden who also provided voices for Professor Weirdo's resident monsters: ...|$|R

40|$|The Tama Hills, {{located in}} {{the western edge of}} the Kanto Plain, are mainly {{composed}} of semi- or unconsoidated shallow marine sediments of Plio-Pleistocene age, which, named the Kazusa Group, consist of several clay-silt, sand and gravel beds, On the hilltop gentle slopes in the western part of the Tama Hills, the mid-Pleistocene Gotentoge Gravel Bed rests unconformably upon the Kazusa Group. And the Hills are covered with airborne tephras named the Kanto Loam. The lower part of the Kanto Loam is full-weathered and rich in clay. The purpose of the present study is to clarify the distribution and formation of detailed- to micro-scale landforms composing small tributary basins, in connection with the hydro-geologic conditions in the western part of the Tama Hills. In valley-head areas, <b>head</b> <b>hollow</b> and <b>head</b> floor defined by Tamura(1974) are distributed and their location seems to be controlled by the hydro-geologic conditions. The maximum height of each <b>head</b> <b>hollow</b> and the position of springlet correspond well to the height of bedding plane of clay-silt bed in the Kazusa Group or the lower part of the Kanto Loam, both of which have less permiability. Head floor develops on the surface of less-permeable beds. Because of the less permiability, surface and sub-surface flow often occurs and marsh is sometimes formed on this slope unit. Locations of valley-head slopes on the hillsides are also affected by the distribution of lesspermeable beds. Here the development of the slopes seems to have been initiated by the landslides. Present <b>head</b> <b>hollows</b> were formed by slide-type failure. Each mass movement occurs along the bedding plane upon the less-permeable beds. Valley-head slopes are considered to have been formed by surface failures occurred during heavy storms. In addition to the occurrence of pipeflow and returnflow which are also related to hydro-geologic condiions, groundwater itself seems to pllay an important role in landforming process accompanied by surface failure. It is concluded that the distribution and formation of slope units in the Tama Hills are strongly controlled by the hydro-geologic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The methanogenic {{bacterium}} strain Gö 1 harbors a high-molecular-weight enzyme complex containing methyl coenzyme M methylreductase as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. This complex {{consists of a}} spherelike, <b>hollow</b> <b>head</b> piece, in the wall of which a number of copies of the methyl coenzyme M methylreductase are located. It is named Rc (c indicates collector). Intimately bound to it {{is a group of}} additional subunits of unknown composition referred to as Rm (m indicates mediator). Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples indicated that Rm contains a functional pore or channel which connects the internal volume of Rc with the outside. The RcRm complex is named Rs (s indicates spherelike). This complex was often found detached from the inside of the cytoplasmic membrane when membrane vesicles were investigated. However, Rs was also seen attached to a third component of the complex located in the membrane, the attachment being mediated by Rm. This membrane part of the complex is designated Rt (t indicates translocator). It consists of subunits with unknown composition. When Rs is attached to the membrane, the pore in Rm appears to be plugged by Rt. This indicates that the internal volume in Rc is in contact, via the pore in Rm, with Rt. The RcRmRt complex is referred to as methanoreductosome. Functional implications of the structural organization of the methylreductase system are discussed in view of methane formation {{and the creation of a}} transmembrane proton gradient used by the cell for ATP synthesis...|$|R
