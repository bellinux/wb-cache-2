After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to swell.|$|E

5|$|Inside the {{lacrimal}} {{bones were}} depressions {{that may have}} held glands, such as salt glands. Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as Ceratosaurus and Marshosaurus; {{they may have been}} related to the sense of smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve thermoregulation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.|$|E
5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the other}} great boons to Australian heavy metal music was the Metal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brain</b> festival. Established by Armoured Angel’s drummer Joel Green {{to raise funds for}} a friend {{severely}} brain-damaged after an assault, the first concert in 1991 featured six Canberra bands in the afternoon with a later performance by some punk bands including the Hard Ons. By the end of the decade, the event had stretched out to a 12-hour festival featuring 18 groups from around the country and by 2000 was so big it was forced to move to a larger venue. When the final Metal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brain</b> festival closed in November 2006, more than 100 different bands from every major centre in Australia and several from overseas including Voivod had appeared at some time.

25|$|Alchemist was an Australian {{progressive}} metal {{band from}} Canberra whose style combined death metal, progressive rock, psychedelic, Eastern, Aboriginal and electronic influences. The band formed in 1987 and released six studios albums, an EP and a compilation album. Work began {{on a new}} EP in 2010 but the band went on an indefinite hiatus. They are the only group to appear at every Metal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brain</b> festival, an event they ran and organised from 1996.

25|$|In {{spite of}} such successes, Australian heavy metal {{continues}} {{to remain a}} fringe underground culture still widely ignored by the mainstream industry and media. When it was announced in mid-2006 that the annual Metal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brain</b> festival {{would be no more}} after a final event on 4 November, no regular news service outside of Canberra carried word of it, even though it had often attracted up to 3000 people and had been running as long as the Big Day Out.

25|$|The {{concept of}} motor {{redundancy}} is explored in numerous studies, usually {{with the goal}} of describing the relative contribution of a set of motor elements (e.g. muscles) in various human movements, and how these contributions can be predicted from a comprehensive theory. Two distinct (but not incompatible) theories have emerged for how the nervous system coordinates redundant elements: simplification and optimization. In the simplification theory, complex movements and muscle actions are constructed from simpler ones, often known as primitives or synergies, resulting in a simpler system <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to control. In the optimization theory, motor actions arise from the minimization of a control parameter, such as the energetic cost of movement or errors in movement performance.|$|E

The Stallions lost house show matches to The Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) in May, then dropped multiple encounters to The Bolsheviks the following month. Roma & Powers even lost to The Conquistadors on a house show in Warwick, Rhode Island on July 3, {{and by the end of}} the summer had lost all momentum, losing multiple encounters to The Killer Bees.

25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain is}} an ever-changing, plastic, model of {{information}} sharing and processing. In order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to incorporate new experiences into a refined schema it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information. Synaptic plasticity {{can be described as}} the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neo-natal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant size reduction in areas such as the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth and thus anatomical size reduction is observed. Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an fMRI, Maquet et al., 2003, found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right dentate nucleus of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right superior temporal sulcus was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed {{it was found that the}} dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate movement patterns in order for recreation of the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. Neuroplasticity has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli.|$|E
