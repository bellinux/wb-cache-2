5|$|These suppressions, {{as well as}} the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, in turn {{contributed to}} more general {{resistance}} to Henry's reforms, most notably in the Pilgrimage of Grace, a large uprising in northern England in October 1536. Some 20,000 to 40,000 rebels were led by Robert Aske, together with parts of the northern nobility. Henry VIII promised the rebels he would pardon them and thanked them for raising the issues. Aske told the rebels they had been successful and they could disperse and go home. Henry saw the rebels as traitors and did not <b>feel</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> keep his promises with them, so when further violence occurred after Henry's offer of a pardon he was quick to break his promise of clemency. The leaders, including Aske, were arrested and executed for treason. In total, about 200 rebels were executed, and the disturbances ended.|$|E

Bruce was not interested he {{was the head of}} one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might <b>feel</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E

Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, {{they are doing it}} secretly, therefore the anti-Semites <b>feel</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character." ...|$|E

[...] But Treanor is not just concerned with growth and reputation. [...] Like the law deans of Harvard (which built a state-of-the-art law student gym, limited class size to 80 students, and mandated individualized written feedback for every student in every course throughout the semester), and Yale (which abandoned the traditional law school grading system, does not rank its students, and has only one semester of required classes), Treanor has attempted to address the students' quality of life. [...] In a 2006 interview, Treanor reported instituting free cupcakes and ice cream to alleviate the intensity of law school finals. [...] Gifts to students, though, are in the offing: At the end of the 2006 academic year, Treanor worked for the purveyance of free flip-flops with Fordham's imprint on the bottom. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> make the Fordham experience for our students as special as possible," [...] said Treanor.

The failure of Heaven's Gate led several critics to revise {{their positions on}} The Deer Hunter. Canby said in his famous review of Heaven's Gate, [...] " [...] fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter, and the Devil has just come around to collect." [...] Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of Heaven's Gate, [...] "I'm a little surprised {{that many of the}} same critics who lionized Cimino for The Deer Hunter have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm." [...] Sarris added, [...] "I was never taken in... Hence, the stupidity and incoherence in Heaven's Gate came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in The Deer Hunter."

2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not <b>feel</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E
2500|$|One Life Stand {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 34 reviews. The Observers Gareth Grundy {{wrote that the}} album [...] "not only sees [...] back on track, it's also their best work, paring down those past excesses and unifying them into an extraordinarily lovely whole." [...] Huw Jones of Slant Magazine described it as [...] "a smooth, sleek, and splendid pop record" [...] where [...] "ach individual track sticks to its own tone and theme, while the group gracefully sashays through several shifts in tone and tempo." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic noted that [...] "their sensitive side dominates One Life Stand—they don't sound ready for the floor, they sound ready to settle down. Even the most energetic songs feel tempered compared to the neon energy of Made in the Dark and The Warnings hits." [...] She added that [...] "hough this emotional nakedness is an unusual move after Made in the Dark pushed Hot Chip {{to a new level}} of attention and acclaim, it also shows they're in it for the long haul." [...] Nick Annan from Clash deemed it [...] "different to Made In The Dark but a more cohesive and more heartfelt effort too. One Life Stand sees Hot Chip let us into their hearts as well as their thoughts." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now commented that [...] "t's not that they've completely reinvented their sound as much as they've simply focused and polished it up. The real shift is in their attitude, which allows them to embrace earnestness and write some straightforward love songs. It's a strategy that could have backfired, but instead it has inspired their strongest and most consistent album so far." [...] Uncuts Andrew Mueller believed that the album [...] "contains little trace of the discordant outings or rather rigidly utilitarian dance grooves they seemed to <b>feel</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> deploy on previous albums. This is an album that sees Hot Chip freeing themselves of the surly bonds of their more orthodox dance and electronic influences and settling comfortably into the orbit of New Order and Pet Shop Boys." ...|$|E
