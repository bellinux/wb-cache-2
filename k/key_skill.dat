25|$|Firstly, a batsman needs {{good eye}} {{reflexes}} which {{are considered to}} be a <b>key</b> <b>skill</b> when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate beforehand what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{golf swing}} is {{outwardly}} similar {{to many other}} motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat; however, unlike many of these motions, {{the result of the}} swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed, to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path, the clubface is in line with the swing path, and the ball impacts the centre or [...] "sweet spot" [...] of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs {{with a wide range of}} shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a <b>key</b> <b>skill</b> for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Life in the Resistance {{was highly}} {{dangerous}} {{and it was}} imperative for a good résistant to live quietly and never attract attention to themselves. Punctuality was key to meetings in public as the Germans would arrest anyone who was seen hanging around in public {{as if waiting for}} someone. A major difficulty for the Resistance was the problem of denunciation. Contrary to popular belief, the Gestapo was not an omnipotent agency with its spies everywhere, but instead the Gestapo relied upon ordinary people to volunteer information. According to the Abwehr officer Hermann Bickler, the Germans needed 32 000 indicateurs (informers) to crush all resistance in France, but he reported in the fall of 1940 that the Abwehr had already exceeded that target. It was difficult for Germans to pass themselves off as French, so the Abwehr, the Gestapo and the SS could not have functioned without French informers. In September 1940, the poet Robert Desnos published an article titled [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] in the underground newspaper Aujourd'hui appealing to ordinary French people to stop denouncing each other to the Germans. Desnos's appeal failed, but the phrase [...] "J'irai le dire à la Kommandantur" [...] ("I'll go and tell the Germans about it") was a very popular one in occupied France as hundreds of thousands of ordinary French people denounced each other to the Germans. The problem of what the French called indics or mouches as informers were known was compounded by the corbeaux (poison pen letters). The writers of the corbeaux was inspired by a mixture of motivations such as envy, spite, greed, anti-Semitism, and sheer opportunism as many ordinary French people wanted to ingratiate themselves with what they believed to be the winning side. Ousby noted [...] "Yet perhaps the most striking testimony to the extent of denunciation came from the Germans themselves, surprised at how ready the French were to betray each other". The problem of denunciation was always the most serious handicap for the resistance as there were a seemingly endless number of ordinary French people who were desperate to denounce anyone they suspected of engaging in resistance. In occupied France, one had to carry at all times a huge cache of documents such as an ID card, a ration card, tobacco voucher (regardless if one was a smoker or not), travel permits, work permits, and so on. For these reasons, forgery become a <b>key</b> <b>skill</b> for the resistance as the Germans regularly required the French to produce their papers, and anyone whose papers seemed suspicious would be arrested.|$|E

40|$|Report of a CELT {{project on}} {{supporting}} students through innovation and researchThe University’s Learning and Teaching Strategy (UoW 2000) recognises {{that the development}} of <b>key</b> <b>skills</b> and the diagnosis of <b>key</b> <b>skills</b> are central concerns. A <b>Key</b> <b>Skills</b> Strategy has been developed by the School of Health as a central theme in the School’s draft Learning and Teaching Strategy. The <b>key</b> <b>skills</b> have been seen as {{a major part of the}} curriculum in Higher Education for some years. The emphasis upon <b>key</b> <b>skills</b> development has been underlined by the Dearing Enquiry (1997). The school has completed a 2 year research project funded by HEFCE under the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) 3 initiative. The project sought to develop information technology (IT) and numeracy skills using technology support learning(TSL). This project identified that nursing and midwifery students had significant deficits in IT and numeracy skills. The project built upon work completed on the TLTP 3 Project.

Rituals are performed from books or scrolls, unlike spells, rituals are not learned and are not restricted by class, a ritual can be performed by any character who has the Ritual Caster feat and meets the ritual's level requirement. Using a ritual scroll halves the time required to perform a specific ritual, however doing so expends the scroll, causing it to crumble to dust once the ritual has been performed.|$|E
