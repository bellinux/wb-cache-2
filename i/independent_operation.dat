5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> of individual spoilers.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{estimates}} of technical efficiency based on USDA data for 1997 through 2001 indicate that <b>independent</b> <b>operations</b> {{were significantly more}} efficient than contract operations. Preliminary estimates also indicate that both types of operations exhibited increasing returns to scale with contract operations appearing to exhibit significantly higher returns to scale than <b>independent</b> <b>operations,</b> but that larger contract and <b>independent</b> <b>operations</b> exhibit roughly comparable returns to scale. Our {{estimates of}} excess nutrients that derive from both commercial fertilizer and manure, comparing the performance of production contract <b>operations</b> and <b>independent</b> <b>operations</b> indicate that, in general, levels of excess nutrients per acre of land are significantly higher on contract <b>operations</b> than <b>independent</b> <b>operations.</b> The results suggest that adjusting the performance measures to include excess nutrients as a "bad output" would tend to favor independent producers over contract operations compared to performance measures that ignore pollution.

5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E

25|$|SA-15 is {{the project}} {{name for a}} series of icebreaking {{multipurpose}} cargo ships built in Finland for the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The ships, capable of <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> in all prevailing arctic ice conditions, were the first merchant vessels designed for year-round operations in the Northern Sea Route. For this purpose they have hulls that resemble those of polar icebreakers and propulsion systems capable of withstanding ice loads.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware and Hudson {{was one of}} (if not) {{the longest}} {{operating}} Class I railroads in American history. While in <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> the railroad was well managed. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, D President L.F. Loree ordered many of the railway's larger locomotives to {{be taken off the}} mainline and serviced with the sole reasoning being to keep men working so they didn't lose their jobs. Most of these engines were in excellent condition and didn't need repairs. Also, in 1939, the railroad experimented with welded rail before many other railroads.|$|E
25|$|MV Captain Kurbatskiy (Капитан Курбацкий) was a Russian SA-15 class {{cargo ship}} {{originally}} known as Nizhneyansk (Нижнеянск) after a port {{of the same}} name.

These ships, designed to be capable of <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> in arctic ice conditions, were of extremely robust design and had strengthened hulls resembling those of polar icebreakers.|$|E

25|$|Abu Nidal's first <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> {{took place}} on September 5, 1973, when five gunmen using the name Al-Iqab ("The Punishment") seized the Saudi embassy in Paris, taking 11 hostages and {{threatening}} {{to blow up the}} building if Abu Dawud was not released from jail in Jordan, where he had been arrested in February 1973 for an attempt on King Hussein's life. Following the incident, Mahmud Abbas of the PLO took flight to Iraq to meet Abu Nidal. In the meeting Abbas became so angry, that he stormed out of the meeting, followed by the other PLO delegates, and from that point on, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as a mercenary.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|E
500|$|Henri Mirguet {{writing for}} L'Aérophile {{magazine}} in January 1912 {{said that the}} new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage, the frame and the wing of Coandă's 1910 design, but did not keep the turbo-propulseur or [...] "the wooden wingloading surface including the forward longitudinal ribs". The aircraft was flown on 21 October 1911, but with modest results as the latest modifications, especially those related to the powerplant, did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft.

500|$|The {{physical}} effects {{used to create}} the deformed child have been kept secret. The projectionist {{who worked on the}} film's dailies was blindfolded by Lynch to avoid revealing the prop's nature, and he has refused to discuss the effects in subsequent interviews. The prop—which Nance nicknamed [...] "Spike"—featured several working parts; its neck, eyes and mouth were capable of <b>independent</b> <b>operation.</b> Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop, at times stating that [...] "it was born nearby" [...] or [...] "maybe it was found". It has been speculated by The Guardian John Patterson that the prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb fetus. The child has been seen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as John Merrick's make-up in 1980's The Elephant Man and the sandworms of 1984's Dune.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of July 2, Longstreet did not follow his usual custom of meeting Gen. Lee at his {{headquarters}} to discuss the day's battle, claiming {{that he was too}} fatigued to make the ride. Instead, he spent part of the night planning for a movement around Big Round Top that would allow him to attack the enemy's flank and rear. (Longstreet, despite his use of scouting parties, was apparently unaware that a considerable body of troops from the Union VI Corps was in position to block this move.) Shortly after issuing orders for the attack, around sunrise, Longstreet was joined at his headquarters by Lee, who was dismayed at this turn of events. The commanding general had intended for Longstreet to attack the Union left early in the morning {{in a manner similar to}} the attack of July 2, using Pickett's newly arrived division, in concert with a resumed attack by Ewell on Culp's Hill. What Lee found was that no one had ordered Pickett's division forward from its bivouac in the rear and that Longstreet had been planning an <b>independent</b> <b>operation</b> without consulting with him. Lee wrote with some restraint in his after-battle report that Longstreet's [...] "dispositions were not completed as early as was expected." ...|$|E
