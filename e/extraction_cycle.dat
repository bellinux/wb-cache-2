To develop a highly selective and efficient method for the facile removal of pesticide residues, the subcritical butane extraction (SBE) technique was employed, and three variables involving temperature, time and <b>extraction</b> <b>cycles</b> were studied.

These results indicate that SBE is a useful method to efficiently remove the bifenthrin, and as appearance is not relevant in the production process, tea leaves should first be crushed and then extracted in order that residual pesticides are thoroughly removed...|$|R

40|$|The Brownian {{motion of}} a quantum {{particle}} in a harmonic confining potential and coupled to a harmonic quantum thermal bath is exactly solvable. It is shown that at low enough temperatures the stationary state is non-Gibbsian {{due to an}} entanglement with the bath. In physical terms, this happens when the cloud of bath modes around the particle starts to play a non-trivial role. Indeed, equilibrium thermodynamics of the total system, particle plus bath, does not imply standard equilibrium thermodynamics for the particle itself at low T. Various formulations of the second law {{are found to be}} invalid at low T. First, the Clausius inequality can be violated, because heat can be extracted from the zero point energy of the cloud of bath modes. Second, when the width of the confining potential is suddenly changed, there occurs a relaxation to equilibrium during which the entropy production is partly negative. Third, for non-adiabatic changes of system parameters the rate of energy dissipation can be negative, and, out of equilibrium, cyclic processes are possible which extract work from the bath. Conditions are put forward under which perpetuum mobile of the second kind, having one or several work <b>extraction</b> <b>cycles,</b> enter the realm of condensed matter physics. Fourth, it follows that the equivalence between different formulations of the second law (e. g. those by Clausius and Thomson) can be violated at low temperatures. These effects are the consequence of quantum entanglement {{in the presence of the}} slightly off-equilibrium nature of the thermal bath, and become important when the characteristic quantum time scale ħ/k_BT is larger than or comparable to other timescale of the system.
