25|$|The {{pressure}} regulator adjusts and controls the gas {{pressure in the}} cuff bladder. Older, non-computerized tourniquet systems utilize valves that attempt to respond mechanically to changes in pressure. For example, if pressure in the cuff bladder falls, a valve may open to allow more gas to enter the regulator from the gas source; if pressure exceeds a certain level, the pressure may force a release valve to open and expel gas into the environment. Sometimes, the pressure levels at which these two valves turn on and off are quite different and cuff pressure may fluctuate within a certain range {{above and below the}} selected pressure. Due to the sensitive mechanical components of these systems, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding frequent testing, and calibration and to perform these checks before each surgical procedure as recommended. In general, tourniquet systems with mechanical regulators are now considered to be inaccurate, unreliable, and are not suitable for incorporation with modern tourniquet safety features.|$|E

500|$|As {{with any}} other organic compound, it is prudent to {{characterize}} synthetic oligonucleotides upon their preparation. In more complex cases (research and large scale syntheses) oligonucleotides are characterized after their deprotection and after purification. Although the ultimate approach to the characterization is sequencing, a relatively inexpensive and routine procedure, the considerations of the cost reduction preclude its use in routine manufacturing of oligonucleotides. In day-by-day practice, it is sufficient to obtain the molecular mass of an oligonucleotide by recording its mass spectrum. Two methods are currently widely used for characterization of oligonucleotides: electrospray mass spectrometry (ES MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). To obtain informative spectra, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> exchange all metal ions that might {{be present in the}} sample for ammonium or trialkylammonium [...] ions prior to submitting a sample to the analysis by either of the methods.|$|E

Although this contribution has often been considered to be constant over the spectrum, because it is generated simultaneously with the resonant response, the two responses must compete for intensity. This competition shapes the nonresonant contribution in the presence of resonant features by resonant attenuation. Because it is not currently known how to adequately correct for nonresonant interferences, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> experimentally isolate the resonant contributions from any nonresonant interference, often done using the technique of nonresonant suppression.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{problem of}} the parts-per {{notation}} {{is that it may}} refer to mass fraction, mole fraction or volume fraction. Since it is usually not stated which quantity is used, it is better to write the unit as kg/kg, mol/mol or m3/m3 (even though they are all dimensionless). The difference is quite significant when dealing with gases and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> specify which quantity is being used. For example, the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas CFC-11 in air. For volume fraction, the suffix [...] "V" [...] or [...] "v" [...] is sometimes appended to the parts-per notation (e.g., ppmV, ppbv, pptv). Unfortunately, ppbv and pptv are also often used for mole fractions (which is identical to volume fraction only for ideal gases).|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to expressing {{the variability of}} a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions. [...] For example, {{the margin of error}} in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. [...] This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the [...] "standard error" [...] of the estimate or [...] "standard error of the mean" [...] when referring to a mean. [...] It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note that the standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population (such as the mean) are quite different but related (related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviation—the half-width of a 95 percent confidence interval. [...] In science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant—normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations. [...] The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment {{is a measure of the}} volatility of the investment.|$|E
