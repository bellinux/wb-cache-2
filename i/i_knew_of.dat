500|$|During an {{interview}} from The Worst era, Lamounier {{was asked to}} comment on Sepultura's well-publicized break-up, when Max Cavalera left the band in January 1997. Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out {{the way they did}} as, in his words, [...] "with what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to get what they want. So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating a friend... For money, I'll bet they're capable of anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>of</b> course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E
500|$|The club officials, {{including}} Turner, had to {{be removed}} from office and Norwich were ousted from the amateur game {{at the end of the}} season. The response was swift: at a meeting two days later, it was resolved to find a place in professional football. On 30 May 1905, they were elected to play in the Southern League, in place of Wellingborough. By then the club had secured their first professional manager, John Bowman. [...] Bowman served two years in the role. [...] He also has a place in Norwich City history for making the first recorded link between the team and its nickname [...] "Canaries", although at this time the club nickname was [...] "Citizens". The earliest recorded link between the club and canaries, came in a 1905 newspaper interview with Bowman, quoting him saying: [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the City's existence... I have... heard of the canaries." [...] At the time, this was a reference to Norwich's link to breeding canaries; the club's canary colours and crest would follow the adoption of the nickname.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the case}} of JonBenét, Douglas contends that John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter. Of the case, he said: “Many crimes are tried {{in the court of}} public opinion long before they reach a court <b>of</b> law. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which the {{majority}} of people have decided the solution based on statistics. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which the public substantially believes what has been reported in the tabloids. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which the mainline media have let the tabloids take the lead and then reported on their reporting. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which largely respectable television programs have so tried to outdo each other in sensationalism.” ...|$|R

My father died very young, {{and there were}} {{certainly}} two, or more branches of the family, as ours was quite wealthy: we had in Lodz several domestics, two governesses (French and German) living with us etc. [...] My father had a sister who settled in Israel and married there. [...] I met her family on my [...] tours in Israel. ... My family was, as far as religion is concerned, quite liberal, not practicing.
