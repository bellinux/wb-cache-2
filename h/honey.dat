Abstract Forty stingless-bee and 21 Apis mellifera <b>honeys</b> from Venezuela were {{analysed}} for their essential composition. The stingless bees comprised 3 Melipona and 5 Trigona species. The moisture {{content of the}} <b>honeys</b> from the different stingless-bee species {{was significantly higher than}} that of the A mellifera <b>honeys.</b> Generally, the stingless-bee <b>honeys</b> had a higher acidity than the A mellifera <b>honeys.</b> The <b>honeys</b> from the Melipona species had lower diastase activity than the Trigona species. There were also differences in the acidity and the ash and nitrogen content of the <b>honeys</b> of the different stingless-bee species, but these differences might also be due to a different floral origin. While the A mellifera <b>honeys</b> fulfilled the quality requirements set by the Codex Alimentarius, the <b>honeys</b> from the stingless bees failed to do so for several parameters, especially the quality factors such as water content, reducing sugars, acidity, and ash content. vit@ula. veStefan.

40|$|Australian stingless bee <b>honeys</b> {{have been}} shown to exert {{antioxidant}} and in vitro antimicrobial properties; however their bioactive factors remained unidentified. This study investigated the antibacterial properties of phenolic extracts from Tetragonula carbonaria <b>honeys.</b> <b>Honeys</b> were harvested from beehives in three sites of South East Australia. Liquid-liquid extractions yielded the phenolic concentrates, for analyses by liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Antibacterial assays were conducted against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae by in vitro agar diffusion and broth dilution assays. The phenolic extracts averaged to 5. 87 mg/ 100 g of raw <b>honeys,</b> and constituents were 3 -phenyllactic acid, lumichrome, diglycosyl flavonoids, norisoprenoids. The <b>honeys</b> did not contain methylglyoxal, dihydroxyacetone or phenolics characteristic of Leptospermum nectars. Hydrogen peroxide content amounted up to 155. 8 μM in <b>honeys.</b> Beside the bactericidal effects of hydrogen peroxide at 760 μM, other antibacterial factors were the phenolic extracts of "sugarbag" <b>honeys</b> that were active at minimum bactericidal concentrations of 1. 2 - 1. 8 mg/mL. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{rheology}} of 10 Australian <b>honeys</b> {{was investigated}} at temperatures - 15 C to 0 C by a strain-controlled rheometer.

G/G 2 ̆ 7 and omega are quadratically related, and the crossover frequencies for liquid to solid transformation and relaxation times were obtained. The composition of the <b>honeys</b> correlates well (r(2) > 0. 83) with the viscosity, and with 24 7 data sets (Australian and Greek <b>honeys),</b> the following equation was obtained: mu = 1. 41 x 10 (- 17) exp [- 1. 20 M + 0. 01 F - 0. 0 G + (18. 6 X 10 (3) /T) ] The viscosity of the <b>honeys</b> showed a strong dependence on temperature, and four models were examined to describe this.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of nine unprocessed Australian <b>honeys</b> was investigated for {{the applicability of}} the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) model. The viscosity of the <b>honeys</b> was obtained over a range of shear rates (0. 01 - 40 s(- 1)) from 2 degrees to 40 degreesC, and all the <b>honeys</b> exhibited Newtonian behaviour with viscosity reducing as the temperature was increased. The <b>honeys</b> with high moisture were of lower viscosity, The glass transition temperatures of the <b>honeys,</b> as measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), ranged from - 40 degrees to - 46 degreesC, and four models (WLF. Arrhenius, Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF), and power-law) were investigated to describe the temperature dependence of the viscosity. The WLF was the most suitable and the correlation coefficient averaged 0. 999 +/- 0. 0013 as against 0. 996 +/- 0. 0042 for the Arrhenius model while the mean relative deviation modulus was 0 - 12 % for the WLF model and 10 - 40 % for the Arrhenius one. With the universal values for the WLF constants, the temperature dependence of the viscosity was badly predicted. From non-linear regression analysis, the constants of the WLF models for the <b>honeys</b> were obtained (C- 1 = 13. 7 - 21. 1 : C- 2 = 55. 9 - 118. 7) and are different from the universal values. These WLF constants will be valuable for adequate modeling of the rheology of the <b>honeys,</b> and they can be used to assess the temperature sensitivity of the <b>honeys.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of rheological measurements conducted on three types of Polish honey: rape, multi-floral, and buckwheat <b>honeys.</b> The investigations involved identification of the properties of the <b>honeys</b> in both liquefied (by heating) as well as crystallised states. Both steady shear as well as dynamic rheological tests were performed. As a result, it was possible to show that the liquefied <b>honeys</b> behave like Newtonian fluids. Good agreement of the results between the rotary shear and oscillation rotary tests was observed, thus fulfilling the Cox-Mertz rule. The structure of the <b>honeys</b> was subjected to qualitative scrutiny by analysing photographs of the crystals taken in the conditions of shearing interferometry. The quantitative analysis was made by presenting a numerical distribution of crystal colonies with reference to the maximum dimensions of individual crystals. The geometric measurements of the crystals were carried out using analiSIS software. In the crystallised form, the media showed a thixotropic effect, and their apparent viscosity was many times higher than the dynamic viscosity in the liquid state. After plasticising by deformation with an increasing shear rate of up to 450 s− 1, the equilibrium melting curves of the crystallised <b>honeys</b> were described by the Ostwald-de Waele model. One particular reason for the research was to show that the results obtained for the <b>honeys</b> crystallised by the steady shear method, were qualitatively different from the results obtained in the dynamic measurements. The Cox-Mertz rule cannot be applied for the crystallised <b>honeys...</b>|$|R
