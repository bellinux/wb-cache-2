5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes {{and levels of}} complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety of}} play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> getting too high, but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or for healing purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may be reached, for example, by being the last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E

Originally, the term only referred to the aft port section of the ship, but eventually came {{to refer to the}} entire back of a vessel. The stern end of a ship is indicated with a white navigation light at night.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stupid", especially, {{looks to}} Gasparoli {{as if it}} might have been written {{separately}} from the other words, as it is written much more clearly and off to the side. The swash extending leftward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> on the [...] "P" [...] in [...] "STUPID", struck him as unusually distinctive. [...] " [...] looks quite different, much more precise than any other letter in the note," [...] he says. It seems to Gasparoli to suggest a female writer, or at least one calmer and more intelligent than the lettering elsewhere on the note.|$|E

6000|$|The barmaid sighed again, {{and raised}} {{one of her}} hands <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> on which they rested to scratch the {{smallest}} surface of her face with the smallest of her fingers.

60|$|She broke off. Ossipon <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> {{issued a}} warning: “Don’t shout like this,” then seemed to reflect profoundly. “You did this thing quite by yourself?” he inquired in a hollow voice, {{but with an}} {{appearance}} of masterful calmness which filled Mrs Verloc’s heart with grateful confidence in his protecting strength.|$|E
60|$|With another sigh Mr Knag took up {{the kitchen}} candles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and preceded the ladies with mournful steps to a back-parlour, where a charwoman, {{employed}} {{in the absence of}} the sick servant, and remunerated with certain eighteenpences to be deducted from her wages due, was putting the supper out.|$|E

60|$|The bottle oscillates {{from one}} to the other, {{continues}} to do so, and is not removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> The bartender sees two emaciated invalids dispose of enough Kentucky Belle to floor a dozen cowboys, without displaying any emotion save a sad and contemplative interest in the peregrinations of the bottle. So he is moved to manifest a solicitude as to the consequences.|$|E
