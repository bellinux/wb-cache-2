5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank. Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank {{showing up on}} Mindy’s boat. While listening to the phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E

She learns that Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) know what {{happened}} to Carl and tells Roxy the truth, who accepts Ronnie's explanation of the incident. Carl's family put pressure on Ronnie as they ask about Carl's whereabouts. When they realise that Ronnie <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his disappearance, Carl's brother, Adam White (Ben Wigzell), snatches Lola Pearce's (Danielle Harold) daughter, Lexi Pearce, while she is in the care of Ronnie and Roxy. Ronnie and Phil track her down and Ronnie hires Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) to beat Adam up. The following month, Ronnie accidentally runs Lola over, in the same spot where Danielle died. Ronnie is full of remorse for her actions and Lola soon forgives her, realising that Ronnie never intended to harm her.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a common}} theme was not purposefully {{established}} for the album, some journalists noted similar feelings of travel and adventure when listening to the record. Lindstrøm has recommended people listen while traveling, and believes his travels may have influenced the album: [...] "I don't particularly like traveling, but I've realised that it's perfect for listening to whole albums... I'm sure the way I'm listening to music now ... <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the music I'm writing."

500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It {{was one of those things}} where we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but it <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender".|$|E
500|$|Emma Thomas has co-produced all of {{his films}} (including Memento, in which she is {{credited}} as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that it <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow {{able to look at}} my ideas and flip them around in a way that's {{just a little bit more}} twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
500|$|Another critic, Maria Tatar, {{notes that}} there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a [...] "linguistic virtuoso", a {{creature}} who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
500|$|More modern {{reception}} for Vampyr {{has been more}} positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 30, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing." [...] Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, stating that [...] "Vampyr isn't the easiest classic film to enjoy, even if you are a fan of 1930s horror movies...If you're patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of Vampyr, you'll find that this film offers many striking images" [...] and that although the film is [...] "not exciting in terms of pacing, it's a good choice {{if you want to see}} a film that establishes a compelling mood". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The greatness of Carl Dreyer's [...] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Dreyer's radical recasting of narrative form". J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that [...] "Vampyr is Dreyer's most radical film—maybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director". Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, comparing it to the silent vampire film Nosferatu, stating that it is [...] "lesser known (but in many ways superior)" [...] and that the film is [...] "a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer's eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare".|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the new free daily {{newspaper}} has been imitated by other publishers.

[...] However, Canby did find the acting top-rate and noted the realism they bring to their tasks. He added: [...] "Mr. Nava does not patronize his 'little people.'

2500|$|Thus, as many recent {{scholars}} have argued, the spiritualities {{of male and}} female mystics were different, and this difference <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the body. Women were more apt to somatize religious experience and to write in intense bodily metaphors; women mystics were {{more likely than men to}} receive graphically physical visions of God; both men and women were inclined to attribute to women and encourage in them intense asceticisms and ecstasies. Moreover, the most bizarre bodily occurrences associated with women (e.g., stigmata, incorruptibility of the cadaver in death, mystical lactations and pregnancies, catatonic trances, ecstatic nosebleeds, miraculous anorexia, eating and drinking pus, visions of bleeding hosts) either first appear in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries or increase significantly in frequency at that time.

2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's {{been going on in}} your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E
