60|$|The vulgar {{and obvious}} {{criticism}} {{on all this}} is that it is utopian, that such households do not generally exist, because neither masters nor servants possess the qualities needed to maintain these relations of unbroken order and friendliness. Perhaps not; and masters and servants will be more and more removed from the possession of such qualities, and their relations further distant from such order and friendliness, if writers cease to press the beauty and serviceableness of a domesticity that is at present only possible in a few rare cases, or to insist on the ugliness, the waste of peace, the deterioration of character, that are the results of our present system. Undoubtedly it is much easier for Rousseau to draw his picture of semi-patriarchal felicity, than {{for the rest of us}} to realise it. It was his function to press ideals of sweeter life on his contemporaries, and they may be counted fortunate in having a writer who could fulfil this function with Rousseau's peculiar force of masterly persuasion. His scornful diatribes against the domestic police of great houses, and the essential inhumanity of the ordinary household relations, are both excellent and of permanent interest. There is the full breath of a new humaneness in them. They were the right way of attacking the decrepitude of feudal luxury and insolence, and its imitation among the great farmers-general. This criticism of the conditions of domestic service marks a beginning of true democracy, as distinguished from the mere pulverisation of aristocracy. It rests on the claim of the common people to an equal consideration, as equally useful and equally capable of virtue and vice; and it implies the <b>essential</b> <b>priority</b> of social over political reform.|$|E

In this framework, the authors present a first analysis of the seismic reliability of a number oflow-rise ordinary masonry buildings, sorted with different geometrical and mechanical properties anddifferent ages. The analysis is then repeated by considering the main shear walls of the buildings strengthenedwith fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) reinforcements. Typically, masonry shear wall systems behavelike a low-ductility parallel systems, which exhibit a somewhat redundancy. When structural reinforcements with brittle behavior like FRP are introduced, the system ductility decreases together with the residual redundancy, and the reliability outcome does not increase as expected.

This is a pragmatic and crucial factor that influences a school community. ^ This research examined {{the ways in which}} three Catholic elementary school principals fostered a positive school climate in schools serving economically poor students where achievement is relatively high and climate is positive. Its purpose was to answer two central questions: What are the principal attitudes and behaviors, evidenced in the interactions and relationships that occur in the typical routines and unexpected situations of the school day, that help to sustain a positive school climate? What are the characteristics of principal practices that teachers and students identify, from their stakeholder perspectives as contributing to a positive school climate and that they especially value and appreciate as supportive of them? This investigation uncovered what was really going on in the daily realities of these principals. ^ I reviewed standardized test scores from the economically lowest Catholic elementary schools in a large Northeastern city. I selected five schools that evidenced current 8 th grade good relative student achievement. I administered a school climate survey to faculty and a sampling of 6 th, 7 th and 8 th grade students to distinguish schools having a high degree of perceived positive climate. Through a quantitative analysis, I selected three achieving schools with reported strong positive climate. A within-case (i. e. school) and cross-case analysis of qualitative data yielded firsthand descriptive information to confirm what these principals did to maintain a positive environment. Themes of personal regard, a caring-competency dynamic, belief in students, and a safety framework that fosters social trust emerged as central to their practices. ^ Through its rootedness in participants 2 ̆ 7 voices, this research provides a credible and motivational catalyst for principals in making personal decisions about their commitment to <b>essential</b> <b>priorities.</b> Attention to school climate characterizes effective intentional and responsive leadership.

The group was charged with the responsibility to promote a homogeneous approach to safety and quality in the design of Generation IV systems and define the framework for safety design and evaluation methodology which could be applied to all reactor systems. It was recognized that development of advanced and enhanced safety assessment methodologies might be needed for this purpose.
