5|$|<b>Flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> (FOC) is a {{business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> to reduce operating costs or avoid the regulations of the owner's country. The closely related term open registry, which describes a ship register that will register foreign-owned ships, also exists.|$|E
5|$|International {{regulations}} for the maritime industry are promulgated by {{agencies of the}} United Nations, particularly the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. Flag states adopt these {{regulations for}} their ships by ratifying individual treaties. One common criticism against <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> countries is that they allow shipowners to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> system. One is that these flag states have {{insufficient}} regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E

25|$|In February 1991, Wall became {{president}} of a new group, the International Organization of Professional Seamen. Wall formed the group to organize workers aboard U.S.-owned vessels flying under a foreign <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience.</b> However, the Seafarers International Union and International Longshoremen's Association both vehemently opposed the group, as its jurisdiction would conflict with their own. The collapse of the unionization effort led Wall to retire from union life.|$|E

25|$|Formed in 1909 as {{a section}} of the Secret Service Bureau specialising in foreign intelligence, the section {{experienced}} dramatic growth during World War I and officially adopted its current name around 1920. The name MI6 (meaning Military Intelligence, Section 6) originated as a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> during World War II, when SIS was known by many names; it is still commonly used today. The existence of SIS was only officially acknowledged in 1994 with the introduction of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (ISA), which placed the organisation on a statutory footing {{for the first time and}} provides the legal basis for its operations. Today, SIS is subject to public oversight by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.|$|E

25|$|The {{debate over}} the future {{structure}} of British Intelligence continued at length {{after the end of}} hostilities but Cumming managed to engineer the return of the Service to Foreign Office control. At this time, the organisation was known in Whitehall by a variety of titles including the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Secret Service, MI1(c), the Special Intelligence Service and even C's organisation. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience,</b> the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.|$|E
25|$|The ship's owners {{changed her}} name from Loudoun to Imperial Eagle {{as an attempt}} to evade paying for trading {{licenses}} from the East India Company and the South Sea Company, which together held a monopoly on all British trade in the Far East and Pacific. The East India Company controlled British trade in Asia and the South Sea Company controlled the Pacific trade on the west coast of the Americas. British traders wanting to work within the companies' domains were legally bound to acquire licenses. The cost was exorbitantly expensive. In the late 18th century a number of independent British traders, notably John Meares, sailed under false flags in order to evade paying for the required licenses. It was akin to flying a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> but due to the company monopolies, it was illegal for British traders to do so.|$|E
25|$|Historic rivalries, {{regional}} alignments {{during the}} Cold War era and domestic socio-economic considerations have instilled {{a sense of}} paranoia in most Asian countries {{when it comes to}} border issues. Fishermen operating in historic fishing grounds frequently have their boats and equipment impounded by maritime agencies from India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh for fishing in disputed coastal waters. The smuggling of contraband items (especially arms & ammunition by militias and separatist outfits), the 2008 Mumbai attacks by sea-borne terrorists, the appearance of privately contracted armed security personnel (PCASP) and loosely regulated floating armouries in the Indian Ocean region has made India adopt a rigid stance on matters of maritime security and transport of weapons. Increased militarisation of the Indian Ocean has seen the Government of India reassert jurisdictional control over maritime boundaries and review the operational management of sea-lanes and maritime zones. While India has consistently endorsed the freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, it has demanded improvements in the management of legitimate air/sea traffic and stricter monitoring of vessels flying a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience.</b>|$|E

These critics of the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>convenience</b> system argue that many of the FOC flag states lack the resources or the will to properly monitor and control those vessels. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) contends that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) vessels use flags of convenience to avoid fisheries regulations and controls. Flags of convenience help reduce the operating costs associated with illegal fishing methods, and help illegal operators avoid prosecution and hide beneficial ownership. As a result, flags of convenience perpetuate IUU fishing which has extensive environmental, social and economic impacts, particularly in developing countries. The EJF is campaigning to end the granting of flags of convenience to fishing vessels as an effective measure to combat IUU fishing.|$|E
