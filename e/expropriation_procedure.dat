40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the necessary interaction between expropriation and the cadastre. We investigate first {{the role of}} expropriation in modern society and the stake holders and then analyze the interaction with land registration and cadastre. The “simple cadastre ” framework allows a treatment independent of national particulars. A simple cadastre is a minimal model that satisfies {{the needs of the}} users of the cadastre and abstracts from non-essential aspects, any national legislation is full of. In this paper we investigate how a cadastre supports expropriation and what the necessary interface is. We conclude that the <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedures</b> need access to registration data and a process to register a transfer of ownership effectuated by a court judgment, but no special arrangements that would only serve <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|In China, {{due to the}} {{adoption}} of collective landownership, the power of land expropriation is endowed to the state by the Constitution to satisfy the needs of national and local economic construction projects. With little restriction of state power, the exclusion of farmers is a reality. In fact, in countries that either adopt private landownership or state-owned land system, this power as a constitutional right of the state is not denied. The crucial question is how to restrict this power in law to protect the legitimate rights and economic interests of the affected people. The establishment of farmers’ participatory rights is not only conducive to the effective and rational use of agricultural land resources and the protection of farmers’ rights and interests, but also guarantees the legitimacy and legality of agricultural land <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper introduces four local pilots of the land expropriation reform with a common feature of experimenting participatory approaches for the affected farmers.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure</b> of Finland {{differs from}} almost all other {{countries}} in the world. An administrative body, the National Land Survey of Finland (NLS), is responsible for this task. The judicial system becomes involved only if the parties to the so called ‘expropriation survey ’ appeal to the Land Court. The <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure</b> is also quite popular among the Finnish public agencies utilising expropriation, even though other land acquisition means are available and even recommended by legislation. This paper presents the quality management system associated with the expropriation processes carried out by the NLS. By way of a background a short description of the legal procedure is described. After some institutional facts about the NLS and the volume of expropriations, the concepts of what constitutes good quality in respect to the expropriation processes are outlined. Most of these are related to customer needs. The ‘tools ’ of NLS quality management are introduced comprehensively: clear process and quality responsibilities; and detailed process and product descriptions, process instructions, manuals and standards. These utilize the process databases and systems, audit reports and regular customer satisfaction studies. They are also dependent on continuing training of the personnel and the transparency of the process with both the NLS personnel and customers. Finally the methods of measuring and improving the expropriation process quality measures are described as part of the NLS’s process development circle. The conclusions of the paper suggest that the sound reputation of the NLS as the expropriation authority is, among other things, based on the strong process based quality management system...|$|E

50|$|At {{dawn of the}} Perestroika in 1986 {{when there}} was a {{prospect}} of access to the large soviet market, professor Eckstein founded his own consulting company “Eckstein & Partner” primarily responsible for legal and accounting services, as well as trust management.

Eckstein's legal practice covers a wide range of violations of companies' Convention rights, such as violations taking place in the framework of criminal investigations, corporate raiding, failure of the state to protect against interferences by third parties, searches and seizures, asset freezing orders, tax disputes, shareholders disputes, licenses and permits <b>procedures,</b> <b>expropriations,</b> bankruptcy proceedings, and investment protection.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{estimating}} the compensation for the expropriation or easement of land {{to be used as a}} wind farm and the infrastructure essential for its activity. Bear in mind that the construction of a wind farm requires the acquisition (through expropriation, or amicable agreement of the surface rights) of at least the land that must be transformed for the realization of the windmill support, while other land could be encumbered with easements. Areas identified by the ground projection of the blades are, in fact, affected by overflight easements, and all transport infrastructures linked to the wind farm generate easements (underground conduits or power lines). The issue involves many aspects and takes place in a changing regulatory framework. The case law, in relation to the frequency of cases (expropriation is certainly much more frequent than easements), has developed a well-established approach that makes specific reference to the expropriation of the entire property and not merely of the right of fruition. If one pays attention to urban planning, there is a profound difference between the two cases. In the case of easement, unlike <b>expropriation,</b> the <b>procedure</b> does not require a change in the urban destination of land. A land intended for agricultural use remains as such even if it houses a plant for the production of alternative energy. This, without a thorough analysis of the principles that underlie the decisions of the judges, could also lead to profound inequality in terms of compensation payments. The issue is therefore considered by trying to transfer those principles already established with regard to the expropriation of property, even in the case of easements, where in both cases the beneficiary is a private individual, who by virtue of the possession of land, reaps a profit...|$|R

40|$|The {{alterations}} {{caused by}} the realization of large scale, linear infra-structure have repercussions that similarly disrupt the land market. The market is still not perfect and has all the inherent problems connected to estimation of the compensation due for expropriation. In general, the latter doesn’t compensate the expropriated party sufficiently for the impact that {{the construction of a}} new infra-structure can have on the land in question. The result is that the expropriated party not only loses possession of their own estate, but also receives nothing in recognition of its plus/minus value compared to the non-expropriated party. The effect on the land market created by the <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure</b> itself is not factored into the estimated compensation. Another question is the standardization of the method used to determine  the additional compensation due, calculated by means of the Vam, which does not make provisions for the instance of a farming company headed by an entrepreneur with above-average business skill, nor does it consider  the agricultural and  pedoclimatic quality. Lastly, the drafting of a new system for calculating compensation for expropriation is deemed as necessary, one that would incorporate the quid of the land productivity factor within the business initiative “infra-structure for public use”. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} and analyses the expropriation laws {{and practices in}} Ethiopia. The objective of the thesis is to analyze and describe the land rights and expropriation laws in Ethiopia and to compare them with the practice {{in order to determine}} the fairness of compensation. The study is made against the Ethiopian Constitution and other subsidiary legislations which provide the basic land rights and the nature and details of expropriation. The basic argument made in this thesis is that even if the Ethiopian Constitution provides and guarantees common ownership of land (together with the state) to the people, this right has not been fully realized whether in terms of land accessibility, enjoyablity, and payment of fair compensation in the event of expropriation. The reasons have to do either with the faulty nature of the laws or with their implementation by public authorities. From the outset, the constitution excludes land as a subject of compensation. For this reason, land is being excluded from the compensation package and hence it has no value for the holder. Urban land holders are denied location value of their property, which they can collect it otherwise during sale, and hence the compensation becomes unfair. Similarly, rural farmers are denied compensation for the complete loss of their farm land. The denial of compensation for the value of the land is categorically in contradiction with the very principle of joint ownership of land by the people and the state. There are also other reasons which are related to the law or its practical applicability, such as valuation process which reduces the amount of compensation. There are also property interests which are not included as compensable interests. Payment of compensation is one factor for secure property right and hence sustainable development. To ensure fair compensation in the event of compensation, a legal and policy level reform is necessary to address and amend the existing problems. Further, to harmonize the laws and practices is imperative to reduce the amount of injustice existed in today’s <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure</b> in Ethiopia. QC 20131122 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of the Italian agrarian reform defies the dominant view in today's development literature that the redistribution of agricultural land to the rural poor is not feasible under democratic regimes. This pessimistic view {{is based on the}} slowness and inefficiency of many expropriation and settlement schemes in the developing world, which have fallen victim of the undue influence of the landowners and of the technical complexities of implementation. This bleak generalization ignores the case of the Italian agrarian reform of the 1950 s, which took place {{in the context of a}} newly restored democracy, and yet has effectively expropriated and redistributed hundreds of thousands of hectares to the rural poor in only three years. Despite its limited geographical coverage, agrarian reform has been able to end to a decades- long rural conflict; to eliminate the backward production system based on absentee latifundia; has re-vitalized land markets and promoted family farming. The following factors explain the unexpected effectiveness of the Italian agrarian reform. First, the concessions that the government chose to make to the landowning class - necessary within a democratic power-sharing system - consisted in a reduction of the territorial area covered by the program, but not in the relaxation of the <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure,</b> whose automatism and objectiveness left few chances to the landowners to influence the process at the implementation stage. (cont.) Second, the mobilization of the landless against the government, that the international experience recognizes as key to the formation of a redistributive political will, in the Italian case also helped the reform's implementation, thanks to the role of an advocate for the rural poor and of a watchdog of the program's performance that the Communist party played. Third, the agronomists employed in the reform administration have protected it against the abuse of the reform benefits by the forces in power for the pursuit of rent-seeking and patronage. These agronomists' strong professional bond and shared technical values contributed to the independence of the reform administration from segments of society interested in stopping the progress of redistribution. by Tito Bianchi.

40|$|In Arun Property Development (Pty) Ltd v Cape Town City the Constitutional Court awarded {{compensation}} for land that vested in the City of Cape Town {{in terms of}} a regulatory framework. The regulatory framework, sections 25 and 28 of the Cape Land Use Planning Ordinance of 1985 (LUPO), provides that land needed for public streets and places and indicated as such on a subdivision plan should vest in the local authority concerned, but without compensation if that land is based on the normal need of providing the particular development with such public streets and places. The appellant argued that since land in excess of the normal need also vested in the City, it had a right to be compensated for the excess land that vested in the City. The Court, overturning two Supreme Court of Appeal decisions, awarded compensation. The Court hinted that the compensation was for the expropriation of the appellant's land that was excess to the normal need. In the absence of a formal <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure,</b> this case note investigates whether the compensation could have been awarded for statutory expropriation or constructive expropriation. Therefore, the question that is posed is whether the alleged expropriation for which the Court awarded compensation can be classified as either statutory expropriation or constructive expropriation. It is pointed out that the Court accepted that section 28 of the LUPO constitutes a development contribution for the land based on the normal need. In terms of the notion of development contributions, a developer has to donate land to the local authority concerned if that land is required to provide the particular development with public streets and places. A development contribution, as part of the administrative process of approving developments, is regulatory in nature and its validity is judged in terms of the requirements for a valid deprivation of property. It is argued that since the Court interpreted section 28 of the LUPO to provide for development contributions, the alleged expropriation cannot be classified as statutory expropriation. Statutory expropriation occurs when legislation expropriates property directly through mere promulgation. In this case, the excess land vested in the City only after an administrative action was taken to approve a subdivision plan. It is also argued that statutory expropriation cannot be recognised in South African law, due to the constitutional requirements for a valid expropriation in section 25 (2) of the Constitution...|$|E
40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an <b>expropriation</b> <b>procedure.</b> One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project. Tutkimuksesta yleensä Tutkimuksessa on pyritty hakemaan vastausta siiten, miten Suomeen voitaisiin luoda maakaasumarkkinat rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla rakentamalla putki Norjasta Ruotsin läpi Suomeen. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat erityisesti projektiyhtiön maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien rakentamista varten ottaman projektilainan vakuudet ja pankkikonsortion vakuusoikeudellinen asema. Tämä pääkysymys huomioiden tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeuden yleisiä oppeja ja sen mahdollistamia oikeudellisia instrumentteja voitaisiin hyödyntää siten, että projektin rahoittava pankkikonsortio saisi lainalleen kattavat vakuudet. Maakaasuputken vaatimat kiinteisöt Tutkimuksen viitekehys muodostuu kiinteistöjen osalta tarkasteltavien maiden kiinteistöjärjestelmien erojen ja yhtäläisyyksien sekä kiinteistön ulottuvuuden selvittämisestä. Kiinteistön ulottuvuudella on merkitystä sen suhteen, mitä omaisuutta kuuluu kiinteistö- tai laitoskiinnityksen piiriin ja mikä osuus on vakuutena yhtiön varoihin vahvistetun yrityskiinnityksen nojalla. Maakaasuputken rahoittajien asema Maakaasuputken rakentaminen toteutetaan projektilainalla/(-lainoilla), jonka myöntää yleensä pankkikonsortio. Senioriluotonantaja, jonka saatavalle junioriluotonantajan saatava on alistettu, on kohdeyhtiön varoja jaettaessa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä muita rahoittajia edellä, joten huonommassa asemassa olevien juniorilainojen pääoma ja korot voidaan maksaa pääsääntöisesti silloin, kun senioriluoton pääoma ja korot on maksettu. Mezzanine-instrumentit ovat sopimuksellisesti tai rakenteellisesti alisteisia suhteessa seniorilainoihin. Mezzanine-velkojat luetaan junioriluotonantajiin. Ne tulevat velkojien keskenään sopimassa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä senioriluotonantajien jälkeen, mutta ennen muita junioriluotonantajia. Tutkimuksessa tullaan perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että tarkoituksenmukaisinta olisi mieltää velkojien välinen alistamissopimus saatavan panttaukseksi tai siirroksi (vaikka sitä kansainvälisessä luotonannossa ei näin jäsennetäkään), taikka vaihtoehtoisesti omaksi vakuusmuodokseen, johon voitaisiin analogisesti soveltaa velkakirjalain määräyksiä. Urakkasopimuksen rakenteen vaikutus ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuuteen sekä ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuus maakaasuputken tuottaman kassavirran panttaukseen Ansaintaperiaatteella tarkoitetaan panttioikeudellisessa mielessä, ettei saamista koskeva panttaus sido pantinantajan ulosmittausvelkojia ja konkurssivelkojia, ennen kuin pantatun saamisen perusteena olevan pantinantajan suoritusvelvollisuus on täytetty. Ansaintaperiaatteen vaikutusta projektirahoituksessa tarkastellaan tässä tutkimuksessa silmällä pitäen urakoitsijan mahdollisia taloudellisia vaikeuksia ja näiden vaikutusta projektilainan vakuuksiin. Sillä, toimiiko urakoitsija rakennuttajana omaan lukuunsa niin, että maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien omistusoikeus luovutetaan projektiyhtiölle vasta niiden valmistuttua vai rakennetaanko putki suoraan projektiyhtiön lukuun niin, että omistusoikeus maakaasuputkeen ja kompressoriasemiin siirtyy sitä mukaa kuin ne valmistuvat, on ratkaiseva merkitys. Ansaintaperiaatetta on perinteisesti tutkittu ja oikeuskäytännössä sovellettu kassavirran panttaamisen yhteydessä. Maakaasun siirtomaksuista kertyvä kassavirta on projektiyhtiön tärkein omaisuuserä. Maakaasua siirtävän projektiyhtiön kassavirran panttaamiseen ansaintaperiaate soveltuu hyvin alalla noudatetun käytännön vuoksi. Tässä tutkimuksessa ansaintaperiaatteen sovellettavuutta tutkitaan kuitenkin myös rakennutettavien esineiden omistusoikeuden siirtymisen kohdalla. Projektiyhtiön pankkitilien panttaus Pankkitilien panttausta koskeva sääntely on tässä tutkimuksessa soveltuvilta osiltaan Pohjoismaissa hyvin samankaltaista. Sillä sijaitsevatko projektiyhtiön pankkitilit pankkikonsortiopankeissa vai jossain näiden ulkopuolisissa pankeissa on kuitenkin merkitystä Ruotsissa. Ruotsin konkurssilaissa ei nimittäin ole erityistä kieltoa pankille kuitata saatavansa pankkitilillä olevia saatavia vastaan, vaikka kuittaus konkurssin ulkopuolella olisikin sopimuksen nojalla kielletty. Ruotsissa tilipankissa olevien varojen on katsottu olevan pankin omaisuutta ja sen käytettävissä kuittaukseen panttauksesta huolimatta. Velkoja voi kuitata velallisen konkurssissa sekä siinä tapauksessa, että hänen oma velkansa on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen että siinä tapauksessa, että velallisen velka on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen. Suomessa pankkien eriarvoisuudesta johtuvat ongelmat on huomioitu konkurssilaissa. Ongelma esiintyy ainoastaan tilanteessa, jossa projektilainanvakuudet täytyy jakaa pankkikonsortion jäsenten kesken. Käytännössä kuitenkin projektilainan vakuuksia hallinnoi aina vakuusagentti kaikkien pankkikonsortion jäsenten lukuun ja pankkikonsortion jäsenten kuittausoikeus on sopimusoikeudellisesti estetty velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen (intercreditor agreement) kuittauskielloilla. Tutkimuksessa päädytään perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että vakuusagentin käyttö ja velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen määräykset ovat välttämättömiä erityisesti Ruotsissa, jotta vältetään tilipankin kuittausoikeuden aiheuttama ongelma. Osakekantapantti ja kontrollifunktio Osakekantapantti on projektirahoituksessa takauslain mukainen vierasvelkapanttaus. Pankkikonsortio kontrolloi projektiyhtiön hallintoa tälle annetun valtakirjan ja hallituksen tarkkailijajäsenten avulla. Osakekantapanttiin liittyvä kontrollioikeuden käyttäminen ei merkitse ainoastaan vaikuttamista osakekantapantin kohteena olevaan yhtiöön, vaan kontrollioikeudella säädellään myös osakekantapantin realisointiajankohtaa. Mahdollinen maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaus Kansainvälisiä sijoittajia voisi houkutella sijoittamaan suomalaisiin/Pohjoismaalaisiin hankkeisiin mahdollistamalla maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäytön. Esimerkkiä lupien vakuuskäytölle löytyy muun muassa kaivosluvan vakuuskäytöstä sekä Norjasta, missä putken operoimiseen ja rakentamiseen myönnettyä lupaa voidaan käyttää vakuutena operointia ja rakentamista varten otetulle lainalle. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisen mahdollistaminen ei aiheuttaisi suurta hallinnollista taakkaa maakaasumarkkinaviranomaisena toimivalle Energiamarkkinavirastolle sen vuoksi, ettei Suomeen tule useita maakaasuputkihankkeita. Kyse olisi todennäköisesti muutamasta luvasta. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisella olisi ehkä enemmänkin merkitystä maakaasuputkihankkeen vakuuskokonaisuuden kannalta. Olisi varmasti oikeuspoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaista, mikäli maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäyttö sallittaisiin, samassa yhteydessä muuttaa lakia/maanmittauslaitosten kirjaamisohjeita mahdollistaen pakkolunastetun käyttöoikeuden luokitteleminen rasitteeksi. Näiden kahden vakuusoikeuteen liittyvän muutoksen avulla pantin kohteena olisi projektiyhtiön harjoittama maakaasuverkkotoiminta sekä toiminnan edellyttämä kiinteistöomaisuus kokonaisuutena. ...|$|E
