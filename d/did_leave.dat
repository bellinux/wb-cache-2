5|$|Richard and Gloucester's {{campaign}} of 1392 never happened, but Richard <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> for Ireland in 1394 {{with a large}} army, accompanied by John Othelake, who had succeeded Chandos as Ireland King of Arms in 1393. No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although he certainly had a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381. The historical evidence does not even make clear how long Othelake served in the position.|$|E
5|$|Walker's {{successor}} Bruce Rioch lasted {{two seasons}} and departed {{in the summer}} of 2000. While Rioch failed to gain promotion, his time at Norwich <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> a lasting impact in his man-management of Iwan Roberts, who had been struggling to perform. Roberts himself has ascribed his difficulties to being overweight; the turnaround was, according to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch. Roberts scored 23 goals in the 1998–99 season, and is now in the club's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E

5|$|In November 1882, he {{left the}} Inconstant, spent Christmas in Darmstadt, and in March the {{following}} year visited his younger brother, Prince Alexander, in Bulgaria. Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879 {{with the approval of}} Europe's Great Powers. Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to Turkey, and then on a tour of Cyprus and the Holy Land with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was appalled at the lack of seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast so as not to get lost; when they <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for Jaffa. On its return journey the ship on which they had travelled ran aground.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E
5|$|Wormull and Sigere {{made their}} debuts in the opening-day defeat to former club Rushden & Diamonds, making Eastbourne the fifth club– {{following}} Rushden, Stevenage, Hornchurch and Lewes– where they played alongside each other. After just one {{season with the}} club, in which he scored six goals from 37 appearances in all competitions, Wormull's contract was cancelled by mutual consent. He <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> with a winners' medal, earned as an unused substitute in the Sussex Senior Cup final in May 2009, in which Eastbourne beat a Brighton & Hove Albion reserve team 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Lugosi was not {{prone to}} fits of swearing, {{particularly}} {{in front of}} women and did not perform his own water stunt in Bride of the Monster. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep. Also, when Ed Wood talks to George Weiss about making I Changed My Sex!, Weiss mentions Chained Girls, implying that Chained Girls was made before Glen or Glenda, when in fact Chained Girls was made afterwards.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two <b>did</b> <b>leave,</b> it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 31, about 54 hours {{prior to}} landfall, the Government of Mexico issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo {{in the southern}} Baja California peninsula. A state of emergency was declared in five districts of Baja California Sur requested via the local government. In La Paz, residents rushed to get groceries before the stores closed and residents boarded up windows. In Los Cabos, residents frantically stocked up on supplies before the tropical cyclone struck. On August 31, civil defense authorities in Los Cabos announced {{that they would have}} to evacuate 20,000families from their homes. Officials urged a total of 10,000 people to evacuate from shacks. Most people evacuated; however, they feared that there items would be stolen if they had left. While they did struggle with evacuations, officials managed to evacuate 15,000 people living in hurricane prone areas. However, many people such as tourists and the poor failed to evacuate, though 2,000 foreigners <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> the Los Cobos area. On August 30, Robbie Berg from the National Hurricane Center noted that the hurricanes remnants may help fire relief in California and also interests Baja California should monitor the progress of the system.|$|E

25|$|Green <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> a valid will, but his executors {{had either}} died or {{were unwilling to}} act.

25|$|Soon {{after his}} father's {{marriage}} in Pavia, Liudolf left Italy {{and returned to}} Swabia. Archbishop Frederick of Mainz, the Primate of Germany and Otto's long-time domestic rival, also returned to Germany alongside Liudolf. Disturbances in northern Germany forced Otto to return {{with the majority of}} his army back across the Alps in 952. Otto <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> a small portion of his army behind in Italy and appointed his son-in-law Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, as his regent and tasked him with subduing Berengar II.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no record}} of the Estrela outside Portugal prior to 1972. While some {{undoubtedly}} <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> the country, they were probably interbred, with no effort to maintain the breed. In 1972 and 1973, pairs were imported to the US. Others were probably imported into the US since then, {{but it was not}} until 1998 that the first papered dog was imported into the United States. The United Kingdom was the first country to establish the breed outside Portugal in 1972. Today the Estrela can be found in many countries.|$|E
25|$|While {{little is}} known with {{certainty}} about his life, {{he may have been}} associated with the French royal court, since he wrote at least one motet for them. Most likely he lived and worked in Paris, based on evidence of his print editions, which were prepared there. Since later in his career he set verse by Huguenot poet Guillaume Guéroult, as well as Clément Marot, he may have either become a Protestant or had Protestant sympathies; this could explain his disappearance from Paris around 1570. If he <b>did</b> <b>leave</b> the city then, his destination is unknown. No record of him after that year has been found.|$|E

Philip Kearny's 3rd Division of the III Corps at about 2:30p.m. Kearny ostentatiously rode his horse out in front of his picket lines to reconnoiter and urged his men forward by flashing his saber with his only arm. The Confederates were pushed off the Lee's Mill Road and back into the woods and the abatis of their defensive positions. There, sharp firefights occurred until late in the afternoon.|$|E
