5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present.

He will assume control of your cities and nations. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who has to visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> read at The Waldorf Astoria.

5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the station, what <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, what <b>he</b> {{thought he had}} done, and what <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. To all of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R

5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{propose to}} Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars {{to stay awake}} for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses {{to let him go}} because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, {{he is capable of}} serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and says that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E

5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash.

Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E

When Tracy appears to be {{ignoring}} his cue cards, Jenna informs Liz of the situation, and realizes that Tracy might be illiterate, citing an earlier promo cue card mishap ("The Aftermath") as an example. Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits that he is illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that he was using the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is {{not going to take it}} anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.|$|E
5|$|With one day {{left before}} {{his meeting with}} Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they {{apparently}} have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears {{the sound of the}} mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police.
