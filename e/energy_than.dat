5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding <b>energy</b> <b>than</b> 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of <b>energy</b> <b>than</b> if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E

5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more <b>energy</b> <b>than</b> predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.

Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less <b>energy</b> <b>than</b> previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying <b>energy</b> <b>than</b> radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E

There, he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. He discovered the nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons).

5|$|Linus Pauling {{estimated}} the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, {{the same as}} caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, {{but there are no}} experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization <b>energy</b> <b>than</b> caesium, 392.811(4)kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.|$|E
