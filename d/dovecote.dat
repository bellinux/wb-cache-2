5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a <b>dovecote</b> may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced <b>dovecote</b> with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant <b>dovecote.</b> There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a <b>dovecote</b> in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile <b>dovecote</b> in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the <b>dovecote</b> even after it was displaced.|$|E
5|$|The canons {{built an}} {{octagonal}} <b>dovecote</b> {{a short distance}} {{to the west of}} the west range. The <b>dovecote</b> is extant, though it cannot be visited and is not part of the priory grounds. Built in the 14th century, it was modified in the mid-18th century with the addition of a pyramidal roof tiled with Welsh slate and capped with an open-sided timber cupola. The original nesting boxes have been removed and the <b>dovecote</b> is used as a garden store.|$|E
5|$|Other {{buildings}} {{constructed by}} David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, {{known locally as}} The Douche. This is a saltwater shower building with a <b>dovecote</b> on top. A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea, the building {{is now in a}} serious state of disrepair, with roofing slates missing and the <b>dovecote</b> in danger of collapsing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dovecotes</b> Primary School {{is located}} within the {{neighbouring}} estate of <b>Dovecotes.</b> There are pupils from Pendeford who also attend this school. <b>Dovecotes</b> Infants School opened in 1978 with <b>Dovecotes</b> Junior School being built in 1979.|$|R
50|$|The oldest <b>dovecotes</b> {{are thought}} to have been the {{fortified}} <b>dovecotes</b> of Upper Egypt, and the domed <b>dovecotes</b> of Iran. In dry regions, the droppings were prized by farmers and were thus collected for fertilizing their arid fields.|$|R
5000|$|There's also a small {{shopping}} centre on <b>Dovecotes</b> Estate named 'The Haymarket', with a Premier Store named Pendeford Superstore (previously Spar), a Chinese take-away, fish & chip shop (Pendeford Fish Bar) and a chicken shop selling {{to the public}} (<b>Dovecote's</b> Poultry)[...]|$|R
5|$|The Bruton <b>Dovecote</b> is a {{limestone}} tower {{that was}} built between the 15th and 17th century in Bruton in the English county of Somerset. The structure was once used as a <b>dovecote,</b> {{and may have been}} a watchtower or prospect tower prior to this. It is a Grade II* listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dovecote</b> {{which forms}} {{part of the}} {{property}} of the Holnicote Estate, was donated to the National Trust by Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, 15th Baronet in 1944. It was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1949 and designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1969. Repairs were undertaken to the <b>dovecote</b> in 1993. The building is used as a store by the neighbouring farmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of the <b>dovecote</b> was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875. The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, founded between 1078 and 1102 {{although it is not}} known if the construction of the <b>dovecote</b> was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh (squab), and dung.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dovecotes</b> were {{included}} {{in several of the}} villa designs of Andrea Palladio. As {{an integral part of the}} World Heritage Site [...] "Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto", <b>dovecotes</b> such as those at Villa Barbaro enjoy a high level of protection.|$|R

50|$|There {{is a small}} {{shopping}} parade within <b>Dovecotes</b> {{known as}} The Haymarket. There is a Premier Store named Pendeford Superstore (Previously Spar), a Chinese take away, fish & chip shop, and a wholesale poultry factory (<b>Dovecotes</b> Poultry Products), {{there was once a}} Newsagent, Bookmaker and more but these have long closed.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{the site}} of Noel Park was {{virtually}} uninhabited. The 1619 Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham shows the area as forming the historic Duckett's (<b>Dovecote)</b> Manor; as {{with the rest of}} the Moselle valley, the land consisted almost entirely of woodland and pasture, with the only building shown in the area which was to become Noel Park being <b>Dovecote</b> House itself, dating from 1254 and the earliest recorded property in Wood Green. The small village of Wood Green itself is shown a short distance to the north-east. The manor itself was situated on the ancient arterial road of Green Lanes. The last recorded occupancy of the manor was in 1881, shortly before the site was cleared for the construction of Noel Park.|$|E
5|$|The coach house, <b>dovecote,</b> {{and garden}} walls {{received}} Grade II listed status on 6 September 1974. Ecological surveys have found fifty types {{of trees in}} the gardens, and numerous species of birds, mammals and insects have been recorded. The gardens received the Green Flag Award in September 2011 following an earlier inspection.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylindrical}} stone <b>dovecote</b> has a cone shaped roof. It contains over 300 nest boxes. The pigeons {{would have}} been domesticated for food, possibly by Montacute Priory or by the local lord of the manor. It is now owned by the National Trust and used as a store for the neighbouring farm.|$|E

5|$|In 1920 Neubronner {{found that}} {{ten years of}} hard work and {{considerable}} expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile <b>dovecote</b> (described below), had proved its worth in the war. Neubronner's panoramic camera is displayed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin and the Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{remaining}} listed structures are in the listed historic landscape of Lever Park, created for William Lever by Thomas Mawson in the early 20thcentury or the country park. They include an unfinished replica of Liverpool Castle, overlooking the Lower Rivington Reservoir, and Rivington Gardens, the remains of Lever's private gardens, which include the Pigeon Tower, a large folly and former <b>dovecote.</b> The landmark tower built in 1733 for Robert Andrews {{is at the top}} of Rivington Pike.|$|E
5|$|The walled garden, coach house, and <b>dovecote</b> were {{retained}} at the public's request {{when the house}} was demolished. On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within the beds, each was lined by box in 1983.|$|E

5|$|A quarry on Ivythorn Hill {{produced}} {{stone for}} Street Manor in 1403. Ivythorne Manor is a Grade II* listed building {{which was built}} as a monastic dwelling in the medieval era and rebuilt in 1488 by John Selwood, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey. It later became a country house and was revised and extended from the 16th to 20th centuries by the Marshall and Sydenham families which owned it. Within the grounds is a <b>dovecote</b> which was probably built around 1578 for John Sydenham.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact <b>dovecote</b> (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Neubronner {{completed}} his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at Tegel using only his mobile <b>dovecote.</b> Almost 10 years of negotiations {{were scheduled to}} end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dovecotes</b> had {{nesting boxes}} lining the {{interior}} and a potence or ladder-like wooden structure that gave {{easy access to the}} nest holes.|$|R
50|$|Striped maned pigeons {{were brought}} to the Ural region in the 18th century. These pigeons were bred at the Count Orloffs' <b>dovecotes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Inland, many of {{the attractions}} are small towns and villages or linked to the river valleys, such as the ancient clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the Snowdrop Valley near Wheddon Cross, which is carpeted in {{snowdrops}} in February and, later, displays bluebells. Withypool {{is also in the}} Barle Valley, the Two Moors Way passes through the village. As well as Dunster Castle, Dunster's other attractions include a priory, <b>dovecote,</b> yarn market, inn, packhorse bridge, mill and a stop on the West Somerset Railway. Exford lies on the River Exe.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile <b>dovecote</b> {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
5|$|Since the 19th century archaeological {{excavations}} {{have taken}} place in the priory grounds, though a substantial part of the site has not yet been investigated. In addition to the east window, surviving visible fragments of the complex include the lower courses of the west range, a vaulted undercroft, a gateway and a 14th-century <b>dovecote</b> still in use today. The adjoining Priory Gardens, laid out by the Chaloners in the 18th century, are under restoration by a volunteer group. The priory ruins and gardens {{are open to the public}} throughout the year.|$|E
