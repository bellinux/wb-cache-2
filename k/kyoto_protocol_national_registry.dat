40|$|The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> sets <b>national</b> quotas on {{the global}} {{pollutant}} CO 2 and allows for international emissions trading {{as a way to}} obtain air quality standards at least costs. The economic efficiency of the system depends on firms being able to buy and sell permits, with incidental transactions costs and at competitive prices. We study the reliability of prices generated by different policy-relevant allocation rules for CO 2 allowances under the EU emissions trading system (EU-ETS). We consider gratis allocation (grandfathering), auctions, and their combination in so-called hybrid systems. Regarding the auctions, we also inquire for the ”appropriate design ” for carbon auctions. In a theoretical approach, where agents bid according to their marginal abatement costs, we show that the hybrid system of grandfathering and a one-sided auction (which is taken into account in the EU-ETS) does not generate reliable price signals, which should reflect the actual market scarcity of the allowances. This requirement, however, is met, if in the hybrid system the one-sided auction is replaced by a double auction or if a one-sided auction is used exclusively. The results of a laboratory experiment persuasively support our theoretical findings with respect to correct price signals...|$|R
40|$|With the {{adoption}} of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> in 1997 <b>national</b> leaders have started investigating options for reducing carbon emissions within national borders [1]. Despite confronting similar energy issues, every country that adopted the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> has a unique energy strategy [1, 2] -being characterized by a different context, social, economic or environmental that influences the way different nations deal with climate change and other energy-related issues. Finding that currently available energy models are often too detailed or narrowly focused to inform longer-term policy formulation and evaluation holistically [3], the present study proposes the utilization of an integrated cross-sectoral medium to longer-term research and modeling approach, incorporating various methodologies to minimize exogenous assumptions and endogenously represent the key drivers of the system analyzed.

Unbiased estimates of carbon (C) stocks and changes in New Zealand’s planted and natural forests are required to meet international reporting commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The <b>national</b> inventory of planted forest provides data for developing carbon yield tables, which are derived from a modelling system called the Forest Carbon Predictor (FCP) (Beets et al. 2011). The FCP estimates the dry matter content of live tree components, which is converted to carbon by applying a carbon fraction. The amount of carbon (i.e. the carbon fraction) in biomass components is currently assumed to be 0.50 [*]g C per gram of dry matter (g− 1 dm), which differs slightly from default fraction in the IPCC guidelines (IPCC 2006), which is 0.51 in temperate and boreal conifers. Given the importance of planted forests as a carbon sink in New Zealand, it is important to develop New Zealand-specific carbon fractions.|$|R

40|$|Egypt {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} countries to climate change due to the expected detrimental impacts on coastal zones, agriculture, water security as well as indirect social and health impacts. Egypt is responsible for 0. 57 % of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although Egypt is a non-annex I country not requiring any specific emission reduction or limitation targets under the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol,</b> its <b>National</b> plans have included mitigation measures to reduce its greenhouse gases. The main sectors contributing to climate change in Egypt are energy, industry, agriculture and waste. Waste, on the other hand, has been accumulating in the streets of Egypt and along its water banks causing considerable air, soil and water pollution and indirect detrime ntal health impacts. However, this waste which is composed of organic municipal waste, agricultural residues, agro-industrial waste, animal manure and sewage sludge are valuable biomass resources. Utilizing the waste resources of Egypt especially the biomass or the organic comp onent of this waste will not only solve some of the pressing economic needs of Egypt such as animal fodder, fertilizer and fuel but will also all eviate environmental burdens through decreas ing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in the sector of waste as well as those of energy, industry and agriculture.

40|$|Atmospheric {{emissions}} from road transport have increased {{all around the}} world since 1990 more rapidly than from other pollution sources. Moreover, they contribute to more than 25 % of total emissions in the majority of the European Countries. This situation confirms the importance of road transport when complying with emission ceilings (e. g. <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> and <b>National</b> Emissions Ceilings Directive). A methodology has been developed to evaluate the effect of transport measures on atmospheric emissions (EmiTRANS). Its application to Spain in the horizon of 2020 allows the quantification of the effect of several measures on emission reductions. This quantification was done through scenario development. Several scenarios were calculated considering technical measures (e. g. vehicle scrapping systems, higher penetration of hybrid and electric vehicles, fuel substitution, etc.) and non-technical measures (mileage reduction, implementation of Low Emission Zones and/or Congestion Charges in main cities, reduction of average speeds, logistical improvements that affects heavy duty vehicle load factors, etc.). The scenarios show the effect of each measure on NOx, SO 2, CO, PM 10, PM 2. 5, VOC, CO 2 and CH 4 emissions. The main conclusion is the necessity to combine both technical and non-technical measures to increase global effectiveness. In the analysis of specific pollutants, there is a great dispersion on reductions effect: technical measures are more effective to reduce air pollutants while non-technical measures are better options to reduce greenhouse effect gases (even though they also reduce air pollutants in a less efficient way) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{seriousness}} of {{the negative consequences of}} climate change depends on the number of countries that decide to ratify and implement the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol.</b> The collective interest is best served by the scenario in which all countries decide to ratify. However, there are some countries that decided to reject the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol.</b> Apparently, the <b>national</b> interest of these countries is not served by ratification. Therefore, it seems that the decision whether or not to ratify the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol</b> constitutes a social dilemma for some countries. Social dilemmas are decision situations in which the outcome of the decision also depends on what other people do and in which individual and collective interest are in conflict. There are different types of social dilemmas, that differ fundamentally. For instance, a country that is confronted with a so-called Prisoner’s Dilemma will prefer to reject the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol,</b> independent of the behaviour of other countries. The optimal strategy for a country that is confronted with a so-called Chicken Dilemma depends on the decisions by other countries. Such a country prefers to do the opposite of what all other countries decide to do. Goal of this research is to identify solutions to promote ratification of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol.</b> Since the effectiveness of such solutions may depend on the type of social dilemma countries are confronted with, we formulated the following research questions: Are countries confronted with a social dilemma when they have to decide between ratification or rejection of the Kyoto treaty? If countries are confronted with a social dilemma, what type of social dilemma would that be? Which country characteristics determine if and what type of social dilemma a country is confronted with? Are the solutions to promote cooperation in social dilemmas, that {{have been shown to be}} effective at the level of individuals, also applicable and effective for promoting ratification of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol?</b> To answer the first three questions, we created a model. This model implies that the choice whether or not to ratify the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol</b> is dependent on four country characteristics: the country’s developmental status, its costs for abating greenhouse gas emissions, its vulnerability to climate change and its fraction in the global greenhouse gas emissions. The model is applied to 10 countries that vary systematically on these four country characteristics. It turns out that the choice whether or not to ratify the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol</b> constitutes a social dilemma for most, but not all countries studied. For two countries the choice does not constitute a social dilemma at all. Seven of the other eight countries are confronted with a Prisoner’s Dilemma and only one country with a Chicken Dilemma. In general it turns out that a country will not be confronted with a social dilemma if its vulnerability to climate change is lower or equal to the costs for abating greenhouse gas emissions. If a country’s vulnerability to climate change is much higher than the costs for abating greenhouse gas emissions, it will be confronted with a Chicken Dilemma. A country that has an intermediate ratio between the vulnerability to climate change and the costs for abating greenhouse gas emissions will be confronted with a Prisoner’s Dilemma or a Chicken Dilemma, depending on the country’s fraction in the global greenhouse gas emissions. On the basis of these findings and literature regarding social dilemmas at an individual scale, we formulated solutions that can possibly promote ratification of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol.</b> Some of these solutions affect decisions in the different types of social dilemmas differently. Our analysis shows that these solutions are not amongst the most effective solutions to promote ratification of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol.</b> There are three solutions that do show a high potential to promote ratification, for all countries. Firstly, additional research may decrease the environmental uncertainty. A second potentially effective solution is dividing the countries into subgroups, which may have a favourable effect on the country’s efficacy, group identity and the believe in future reciprocal exchanges. Thirdly, these factors can be stimulated even more by extending the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol</b> with other (environmental) treaties. Therefore, a combination of these three solutions probably will have the highest potential to promote ratification of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>protocol.</b> ...|$|R
