40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} and features of symptomatic <b>degenerative</b> lumbar <b>osteoarthritis</b> in adults. Summary of Background Data. Lumbar osteoarthritis adversely affects individuals {{and is a}} heavy burden. There are limited data on the prevalence of lumbar osteoarthritis. Methods. A representative, multistage sample of adults was collected. Symptomatic <b>degenerative</b> lumbar <b>osteoarthritis</b> was diagnosed by clinical symptoms, physical examinations, and imaging examinations. Personal information was obtained by face-to-face interview. Information included the place of residence, age, sex, income, type of medical insurance, education level, body mass index, habits of smoking and drinking, type of work, working posture, duration of the same working posture during the day, mode of transportation, exposure to vibration, and daily amount of sleep. Crude and adjusted prevalence was calculated. The features of populations were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression in total and subgroup populations. Results. The study included 3859 adults. The crude and adjusted prevalence of lumbar osteoarthritis was 9. 02 % and 8. 90 %, respectively. There was no signifi cant difference in the prevalence of lumbar osteoarthritis between urban, suburban, and rural population...|$|R

40|$|Degenerative knee {{osteoarthritis}} is {{a painful}} dis-ease and 33 % {{people of the}} age of 63 to 94 years old have it(1).

It has been reported that knee joints get <b>degenerative</b> <b>osteoarthritis</b> more easily than other joints because of support weight and the increase of attack rate as one gets older(3). <b>Degenerative</b> <b>osteoarthritis</b> is caused by damage of joint cartilages and it happens for two reasons. First, joint tissues are damaged by excessive loads. Second, in the case of weak of joint cartilage or bone, degen-erative osteoarthritis happens easily(4). <b>Degenerative</b> <b>osteoarthritis</b> patients go through great pain and the decrease of extremity especially in quadriceps,mobility, stiffness of joint, limitedmove-ment, and proprioception(5).
