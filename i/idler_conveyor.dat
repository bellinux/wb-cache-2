Precise {{determination}} of the time-to-failure for <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> allows the planning of regular conveyor system maintenance and well-timed replacement of worn conveyor garlands. Incidental delays in power plant coal supply leads to {{a significant reduction in}} overall thermal power plant efficiency. This paper describes a test stand for the laboratory testing of <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers,</b> under the influence of different radial loads, which was developed by the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Belgrade. Data acquisition and processing are also considered, which includes control, monitoring and automatisation of the test stand. Machine protective systems, which ensure a high level of machine safety, were specifically redesigned due to the importance of operator safety and health...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{indentation}} rolling resistance of steel cord conveyor belt and compares the results with those for fabric reinforced conveyor belt. Due to the steel cables imbedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution between the belt and a <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> roll is not uniform. The fluctuating pressure {{means that a}} two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model - which is suitable {{for the analysis of}} fabric belt - cannot be readily applied to the analysis of steel cord belt. To cope with this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler.</b> The pressures determined by the finite element analysis are compared with experimental results found with the Tekscan pressure measurement system, and the reaction loads are used in the two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model developed by Wheeler [2]. The results from Wheeler's model are summed to determine an overall indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt...|$|R
5000|$|Conveyor {{production}} {{delays and}} reliability issues are generally {{a result of}} a failure in one of the three main components of a conveyor system. The belt, drives/gearboxes or the conveyor rolling elements. Of which - <b>Conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> are the most numerous component on the conveyor system. It has been shown that conveyor roller failure in underground coal mines is the premier cause of fires. This presents a significant hazard to coal mine workers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{two most}} often used methods for rolling {{bearings}} condition monitoring are thermographic inspection and vibrodiagnostic. However, analysis of the relevant literature has shown that so far there is no established correlation between rolling bearings surface temperatures and measured radial vibration intensities. These variables also strongly depend on rolling bearing’s service life and it’s environmental operating conditions, especially in case of open pit coal mine <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler’s</b> rolling bearings; where high concentration of debris particles (such as surface dust, dirt and excavated coal) is present. Taking into account previously listed facts; the main goal of the presented research results was to establish statistically significant correlation between listed variables: rolling bearings surface temperatures, radial vibration intensities, service life and concentration level of debris particles in bearing grease. In order to achieve this goal, specific experimental methodology was developed and implemented. Obtained results were then processed using standardized statistical software and appropriate correlation was generated and later verified in praxis. At this moment, developed experimental methodology is applied only to open pit coal mine <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler’s</b> rolling bearings, but its principles are universal, so with minor modifications {{it could be used}} for prediction of any of listed variables for different kinds of rolling bearings, operating in different environments...|$|R

40|$|The University of Newcastle has {{undertaken}} a systematic research program to identify, model and measure key design elements {{to reduce the}} energy consumption of belt conveyors. Research outcomes include the development of theoretical models to accurately predict the main resistances of belt conveyors, in parallel with developing extensive test facilities to verify the new models and to provide industry with data {{that can be used}} directly in the design process. This paper discusses the application of these models and test results for conveyor design, demonstrating the advantages of informed component selection to not only reduce energy consumption, but also total cost of ownership. In particular, the combination of design parameters is discussed in relation to the rotating resistance of <b>idler</b> rollers, <b>conveyor</b> belt indentation rolling resistance and conveyor belt and bulk material flexure resistance. Through a combination of theoretical models and measured data, trends are identified to assist in the design of energy efficient belt conveyor systems...|$|R

The outcomes will improve the methods used to calculate the loads on <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> rolls and predict the energy loss due to the flexure of the bulk solid. The research involved simulated laboratory experiments and tests on a moving belt conveyor where the pressure acting {{on the surface of the}} conveyor belt through interaction with the bulk solid was measured. The experimental results are compared to existing theoretical methods and to simulations undertaken using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This work aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel cord conveyor belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> roll is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> roll. The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress distribution undertaken using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 124 - 131). Overland {{conveyor belt}} systems form {{a vital part}} of modern transportation systems in the mining and mineral processing industries. It is vital that the system is well maintained in order to minimise system downtime and maximise profit. The conveyor belt is the single most expensive item in the system. It must be monitored to pick up potential problems before they cause belt failure. The majority of conveyor belt monitoring methods identify belt failure events rather than belt failure causes. The purpose of this project was to research and design a belt condition monitoring board which could be physically embedded in the conveyor belt. This would then be used to monitor the condition of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> whose failure can result in major system damage. The venture was split into two areas of research: the design of a vibration data logging board and the design of a power generation system. The thesis focused on the design of a DSP vibration data logging prototype board, while S. A. Williams investigated the design of a power generation system...|$|R
40|$|Transporting coal {{by means}} of {{conveyor}} belts is common in Australian underground coal mines. Major conveyor belt–related mining incidents are now relatively infrequent {{as a result of}} recent improvements in engineering standards and the use of fire-resistant materials. However, conveyor belts are still a potential cause of personal and structural damage. In addition, any unexpected breakdown of rolling components or failure of belts creates a significant interruption to production, which is a major concern for operators, who are responsible for achieving optimum mining production. This project aimed to develop a fibre optic–based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system to monitor the temperature change of malfunction <b>idlers</b> for heavy-duty <b>conveyor</b> belts in underground coal mines. Specifically, the objective of the project was to investigate various installation options for fibre-optic cable along the conveyor belt in order to identify the most effective design. The project was consisted of site trials and laboratory experiments to examine the performance of the DTS system for different cable installation designs and to characterise the behaviour of the DTS system...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report {{outlines the}} research completed, methodology used and details of an Idler Management Program that support smart <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> maintenance practices. Modern conveyor belts are becoming larger, faster {{and capable of}} transporting increasingly larger volumes of product as demand increases. Finding a balance between performance and reliability {{is an area that}} the mining industry has been struggling with for a long time now. High coal prices have meant that production gets preference over maintenance, this is largely due to the time taken to perform most condition monitoring practices. However, recent times have seen large fluctuations in the demand for coal and as a result many mines have had to make every penny count so to speak. Improving conveyor maintenance practices can account for large savings for any mine site. The main objective of this project was to develop idler management software that does improve conveyor maintenance practices and can assist in making significant savings for the mine. To reach this objective a staged approach was taken by first completing large amounts of research, then defining what the software should be capable of, and finally product development where many iterations of the software were tested and refined. The final product works by automating the process of analysing the data collected from condition monitoring, saving considerable time and identifying trends that would otherwise be missed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing ball bearings service life is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and ball bearings dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of ball bearings also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of ball bearings thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of solid contaminant particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between ball bearings temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants. Applied experimental methodology included thermographic inspection, as well as usage of custom designed test rig for ball bearings service life testing. Finally, by obtained experimental data processing in advanced software, statistically significant mathematical correlation between mentioned bearings characteristics was determined and applied in commonly used internal radial clearance equation. That is the most important contribution of performed research - the new equation and methodology for ball bearings internal clearance determination which could be used for eventual improvement of existing bearings service life equations.
