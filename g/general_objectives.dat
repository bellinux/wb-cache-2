5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its <b>general</b> <b>objectives</b> are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E

25|$|Urban planning, the {{application}} of forethought to city design, involves optimizing land use, transportation, utilities, and other basic systems, {{in order to achieve}} certain objectives. Urban planners and scholars have proposed overlapping theories as ideals for how plans should be formed. Planning tools, beyond the original design of the city itself, include public capital investment in infrastructure and land-use controls such as zoning. The continuous process of comprehensive planning involves identifying <b>general</b> <b>objectives</b> as well as collecting data to evaluate progress and inform future decisions.|$|E
25|$|Al-Qaeda, for example, uses a {{different}} form of swarming than those of advanced militaries, in which the <b>general</b> <b>objectives</b> of operational cells are agreed in a manner coordinated, but not continuously controlled by the core organization. Once the {{decision has been made}} on the general targets, the operational cells cut positive control links from the core, although they may still receive financial and other support. A signature of al-Qaeda operations has been multiple, near-simultaneous attacks, such as the several hijacked airliners in the 9/11 attacks, the closely spaced bombings aimed at US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and attacks on buses and trains in London. The attacks on trains in Spain had an additional dimension: not all the swarms were associated with al-Qaeda.|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} {{assessments of the}} battle involve the performance of Lee's subordinates. The dominant theme of the Lost Cause writers and many other historians is that Lee's senior generals failed him in crucial ways, directly causing {{the loss of the}} battle; the alternative viewpoint is that Lee did not manage his subordinates adequately, and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings. Two of his corps commanders—Richard S. Ewell and A.P. Hill—had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to Lee's style of command, in which he provided only <b>general</b> <b>objectives</b> and guidance to their former commander, Stonewall Jackson; Jackson translated these into detailed, specific orders to his division commanders.

40|$|The <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> of {{the project}} {{described}} in {{this paper is to}} build a process-centred environment kernel, providing assistance and active guidance to its users. Thanks to an hybrid approach of process modelling, both task-oriented at a coarse grain level, and decisionoriented at a fine grain level, it can be customized to support a broad range of collective design activities. The concept of issue is central to the modelling approach, both on the design side, for decision-oriented modelling of creative activities, and on the cooperation side, for modelling collective conflict resolution tasks. The paper reports some initial experiences with the current prototype (CPCE), customized for supporting collective code inspections. This experiment demonstrates the concrete feasibility of the approach. 1.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} manufacturing environment and marketplace of today, {{the selection and}} evaluation of an appropriate manufacturing policy is a vital issue. However, {{this is a difficult}} task for decision-makers because manufacturing objectives are multiple, complex, conflict and often vague. This paper presents a methodology for a satisfaction assessment of multi-objective schedules with results from a scheduling simulator. In addition, a <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> structure appropriate for multi-objective manufacturing scheduling is also proposed for use in satisfaction assessment methodologies. The <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> structure is a hierarchical structure of the scheduling objective that consists of a goal, subgoal and criteria. The assessment methodology was based on a neural network and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which is a common technique for multi-attribute decision-making problems. This paper extends TOPSIS by using fuzzy logic to deal with inaccurate and linguistic attributes in the <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> structure and a neural network for the weight calculation of inter-attribute importance. close 192...|$|R
