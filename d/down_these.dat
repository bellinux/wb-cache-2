5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut <b>down.</b> <b>These</b> closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces {{successfully}} besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling <b>down</b> <b>these</b> defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished {{and the top of}} the motte landscaped to its current form.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira's teachings were {{compiled}} by his Ganadhara (chief disciple), Gautama Swami. The sacred canonical scriptures comprised twelve parts. According to the Digambaras, Āchārya Bhutabali {{was the last}} ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. Later, some learned Āchāryas started to restore, compile, and write down the teachings of Mahavira that were {{the subject matter of}} the Agamas. Āchārya Dharasena, in the 1stcentury CE, guided Āchārya Pushpadant and Āchārya Bhutabali as they wrote <b>down</b> <b>these</b> teachings. The two Āchāryas wrote on palm leaves, Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgamaamong the oldest known Digambara Jain texts.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata {{tells the}} story of Manasa's marriage. Sage Jagatkāru practised severe austerities and had decided to abstain from marriage. Once he came across a group of men hanging from a tree upside <b>down.</b> <b>These</b> men were his ancestors, who were doomed to misery as their {{children}} had not performed their last rites. So they advised Jagatkāru to marry and have a son who could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies. Vasuki offered his sister Manasa's hand to Jagatkāru. Manasa gave birth to a son, Astīka, who freed his ancestors. Astika also helped in saving the Nāga race from destruction when King Janamejaya decided to exterminate them by sacrificing them in his Yajna, fire offering.|$|E
5|$|ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a {{platform}} video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions {{and published by}} Sega in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt <b>down</b> <b>these</b> Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' <b>down.</b> <b>These</b> are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla was {{not subject}} to a proper damnatio memoriae after his assassination; while the Senate disliked him, his {{popularity}} with the military prevented Macrinus and the Senate from openly declaring {{him to be a}} hostis. Macrinus, in an effort to placate the Senate, instead ordered the secret removal of statues of Caracalla from public view. After his death, the public made comparisons between him and other condemned emperors and called for the horse race celebrating his birthday to be abolished and for gold and silver statues dedicated to him to be melted <b>down.</b> <b>These</b> events were, however, limited in scope; most erasures of his name from inscriptions were either accidental or occurred as a result of re-use. Macrinus had Caracalla deified and commemorated on coins as Divus Antoninus. There {{does not appear to have}} been any intentional mutilation of Caracalla in any images that were created during his reign as sole emperor.|$|E
5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break <b>down</b> <b>these</b> toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, though, was {{not happy}} with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held {{responsible}} for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy. Warkworth's Chronicle describes him as condemning these grants to him as 'a pyes] nest.' Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470. Following unrest in Lincolnshire and the subsequent Lincolnshire rebellion, the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the Battle of Empingham. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at Doncaster. Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion. The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put <b>down</b> <b>these</b> risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais. On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy. Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick and Clarence had landed in Dartmouth.|$|E

25|$|White ginseng {{is fresh}} ginseng {{which has been}} dried without being heated. It is peeled and dried to reduce the water content to 12% or less.

Delivering power to both tracks while turning them at different speeds is a difficult design problem.|$|E

25|$|Not only do EEGs capture {{dendritic}} currents {{almost exclusively}} {{as opposed to}} axonal currents, they also show a preference for activity on populations of parallel dendrites and transmitting current {{in the same direction}} at the same time.
