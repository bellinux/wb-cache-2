Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that <b>halofuginone</b> therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through inhibition of TGF-β signaling. <b>Halofuginone</b> treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation, phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-β, and TGF-β-induced SMAD-driven transcription. In addition, <b>halofuginone</b> reduced expression of TGF-β target genes that enhance bone metastases, including PTHrP, CTGF, CXCR 4, and IL 11. Also, cell apoptosis was increased in response to <b>halofuginone.</b> In nude mice inoculated with 1205 Lu melanoma cells, a preventive protocol with <b>halofuginone</b> inhibited bone metastasis.

Because we recently demonstrated that TGF-β/Smad cascade plays a crucial role in osteosarcoma metastatic progression, we investigated the effect of <b>halofuginone,</b> identified as an inhibitor of the TGF-β/Smad 3 cascade, on osteosarcoma progression. A preclinical model of osteosarcoma was used to evaluate the impact of <b>halofuginone</b> on tumor growth, tumor microenvironment and metastasis development. In vivo experiments showed that <b>halofuginone</b> reduces primary tumor growth and lung metastases development. In vitro experiments demonstrated that <b>halofuginone</b> decreases cell viability mainly by its ability to induce caspase- 3 dependent cell apoptosis. Moreover, <b>halofuginone</b> inhibits the TGF-β/Smad 3 cascade and the response of TGF-β key targets involved in the metastases dissemination process such as MMP- 2.

These results together with the well-documented role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and matrix degrading enzymes in formation of new blood vessels led us to investigate the effect of <b>halofuginone</b> on the angiogenic process. In a variety of experimental system, representing sequential events in the angiogenic cascade, <b>halofuginone</b> treatment resulted in profound inhibitory effect.

40|$|AbstractHalofuginone {{has been}} shown to prevent {{fibrosis}} via the transforming growth factor-β/Smad 3 pathway in muscular dystrophies. We hypothesized that <b>halofuginone</b> would reduce apoptosis—the presumed cause of satellite-cell depletion during muscle degradation—in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Six-week-old mdx mouse diaphragm exhibited fourfold higher numbers of apoptotic nuclei compared with wild-type mice as determined by a TUNEL assay. Apoptotic nuclei were found in macrophages and in Pax 7 -expressing cells; some were located in centrally-nucleated regenerating myofibers. <b>Halofuginone</b> treatment of mdx mice reduced the apoptotic nuclei number in the diaphragm, together with reduction in Bax and induction in Bcl 2 levels in myofibers isolated from these mice. A similar effect was observed when <b>halofuginone</b> was added to cultured myofibers. No apparent effect of <b>halofuginone</b> was observed in wild-type mice. Inhibition of apoptosis or staurosporine-induced apoptosis by <b>halofuginone</b> in mdx primary myoblasts and C 2 myogenic cell line, respectively, was reflected by less pyknotic/apoptotic cells and reduced Bax expression.

The study was aimed to: 1) evaluate the antitumor effects of <b>halofuginone</b> in combination with radiation therapy; and 2) preliminarily explore the possible mechanisms associated with these effects. Materials and methods: Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cell lines and xenograft model mice randomly received ionizing radiation, <b>halofuginone,</b> or combination treatment. The changes associated with antitumor effect of <b>halofuginone,</b> including hepatic and pulmonary metastases and survival, were observed. The migratory and invasive capabilities of LLC cells were investigated by using scratch assay and transwell chamber assay. The expression level of TGF-β and its activation were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. Chi-square test and survival analysis were performed for statistical analysis. P< 0. 05 was regarded as statistically significant. Unless otherwise specified, data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x̅ ± s). Results: After irradiation, the migratory and invasive capabilities of LLC cells were strengthened, and the TGF-β pathway was activated. The addition of <b>halofuginone</b> can significantly inhibit the migratory and invasive trend induced by irradiation, and the TGF-β pathway was also inhibited.

40|$|Background: Drug {{resistance}} {{remains a}} major public health challenge for malaria treatment and eradication. Individual loci associated with drug resistance to many antimalarials have been identified, but their epistasis with other resistance mechanisms {{has not yet been}} elucidated. Results: We previously described two mutations in the cytoplasmic prolyl-tRNA synthetase (cPRS) gene that confer resistance to <b>halofuginone.</b> We describe here the evolutionary trajectory of <b>halofuginone</b> resistance of two independent drug resistance selections in Plasmodium falciparum. Using this novel methodology, we discover an unexpected non-genetic drug resistance mechanism that P. falciparum utilizes before genetic modification of the cPRS. P. falciparum first upregulates its proline amino acid homeostasis in response to <b>halofuginone</b> pressure. We show that this non-genetic adaptation to <b>halofuginone</b> is not likely mediated by differential RNA expression and precedes mutation or amplification of the cPRS gene. By tracking the evolution of the two drug resistance selections with whole genome sequencing, we further demonstrate that the cPRS locus accounts for the majority of genetic adaptation to <b>halofuginone</b> in P. falciparum. We further validate that copy-number variations at the cPRS locus also contribute to <b>halofuginone</b> resistance. Conclusions: We provide a three-step model for multi-locus evolution of <b>halofuginone</b> drug resistance in P. falciparum.

40|$|Background: <b>Halofuginone</b> {{hydrobromide}} (1) {{is recognized}} as an effective drug against several species of Eimeria (E.) in poultry. In this paper, we describe a convenient and low cost preparation method for the compound, as well as primary validation of its activity. Methods: First, 7 -bromo- 6 -chloroquinazolin- 4 (3 H) -one (2) was prepared from m-chlorotoluene by a conventional process, and then chloroacetone was creatively introduced in two steps. Finally, <b>halofuginone</b> hydrobromide (1) was obtained from 7 -bromo- 6 -chloro- 3 -(3 -cholroacetonyl) quinazolin- 4 (3 H) -one (4) by a four-step reaction sequence including condensation, cyclization, deprotection and isomerization. The structures of the relative intermediates and target compound were characterized by melting point, IR, MS and 1 H-NMR. Besides, the protective effect of compound 1 -supplemented chicken diet at doses of 6, 3 and 1. 5 mg per 1 kg were evaluated on chickens infected with E. tenella, by reduction in mortality, weight loss, fecal oocyst excretion and gut pathology, respectively. Results: <b>Halofuginone</b> hydrobromide (1) was prepared successfully by and improved and innovative method based on traditional research. Moreover, the synthesized <b>halofuginone</b> hydrobromide significantly exhibited an anti-coccidial property.

40|$|ABSTRACT In vivo and {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} an effort to elucidate the mechanism of suppression by <b>halofuginone</b> of skin strength in broilers. In the in vivo study, <b>halofuginone</b> was included at concentrations of 0, 1. 5, 3, and 6 mg/kg of diet, corresponding to 0, 50, 100, and 200 %, respectively, of the amount recommended for use as a coccidiostat. Each dietary treatment was given to 260 female broiler day-old chickens. Skin tearing was evaluated at the processing plant Skin collagen and Kjeldahl-nitrogen were determined chemically. At the age of 7 wk, BW and feed efficiency were affected only in birds consuming the diet containing the highest concentration of the drug. Skin tearing increased but skin collagen concentration decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Fibroblasts were obtained by collagenase digestion from chicken skin and cultured. The cultured cells were incubated with various concentrations of <b>halofuginone,</b> monensin, and nicarbazin, and [TTIproline incorporation was evaluated in coUagenase-digestible (representing mostly collagen) and nondigesnble proteins exported by the cells into the medium. <b>Halofuginone,</b> at a concentration as low as 10 - 1 1 M, inhibited incorporation of [3 H]proline into collagenase-digestible proteins, but did not affect incorporation of [3 H]proline into collagenase-nondigestihle proteins. Even at concentrations as high as 10 " 9 hi, neither monensin nor nicarbazin affected collagenase-digestible proteins. The in vitro results suggest that halofugi-none specifically inhibits collagen synthesis by skin fibroblasts. Results of both in vivo and in vitro trials suggest that the increase of skin tearing during processing, induced by <b>halofuginone,</b> is caused by direct suppression of skin collagen synthesis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>halofuginone,</b> a specific inhibitor of collagen type I synthesis, on the postoperative formation of abdominal adhesions in rats. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Postoperative adhesions remain {{the leading cause of}} small bowel obstruction in the Western world. Surgical trauma causes the release of a serosanguineous exudate that forms a fibrinous bridge between two organs. This becomes ingrown with fibroblasts, and subsequent collagen deposition leads to the formation of a permanent adhesion. Most of the drugs used have been clinically ineffective, and none has been specific to a particular extracellular matrix molecule. Therefore, there are serious concerns about the toxic consequences of interfering with the biosynthesis of other collagens, other matrix proteins, or vital collagen-like molecules. METHODS: Adhesions were induced by scraping the cecum until capillary bleeding occurred. The adhesions were scored 21 days later. <b>Halofuginone</b> was either injected intraperitoneally (1 microg/ 25 g body weight) every day, starting on the day of operation, or added orally at concentrations of 5 or 10 mg/kg, starting 4 days before the operation. Collagen alpha 1 (I) gene expression was evaluated by in situ hybridization, total collagen was estimated by Sirius red staining, and collagen type III was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The adhesions formed between the intestinal walls were composed of collagen and were populated with cells expressing the collagen alpha 1 (I) gene. Regardless of the administration procedure, <b>halofuginone</b> significantly reduced the number and severity of the adhesions. <b>Halofuginone</b> prevented the increase in collagen alpha 1 (I) gene expression observed in the operated rats, thus reducing collagen content to the control level. In fibroblasts derived from abdominal adhesions, <b>halofuginone</b> induced dose-dependent inhibition of collagen alpha 1 (I) gene expression and collagen synthesis. Collagen type III levels were not altered by adhesion induction or by <b>halofuginone</b> treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of collagen synthesis appears to have a critical role in the pathophysiology of postoperative adhesions. <b>Halofuginone,</b> an inhibitor of collagen type I synthesis, could be used as an important tool in understanding the role of collagen in adhesion formation, and it may become a novel and promising antifibrotic agent for preventing postoperative adhesion formation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHalofuginone, an {{inhibitor}} of collagen α 1 (I) {{gene expression}} {{was used for}} the treatment of subcutaneously implanted C 6 glioma tumors. <b>Halofuginone</b> had no effect on the growth of C 6 glioma spheroids in vitro, these spheroids showed no collagen α 1 (I) expression and no collagen synthesis. However, a significant attenuation of tumor growth was observed in vivo, for spheroids implanted in CD- 1 nude mice which were treated by oral or intraperitoneal (4 μtg every 48 hours) administration of <b>halofuginone.</b> In these mice, treatment was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in collagen α 1 (I) expression and dose- and time-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis, as measured by MRI. Moreover, <b>halofuginone</b> treatment was associated with improved re-epithelialization of the chronic wounds that are associated with this experimental model. Oral administration of <b>halofuginone</b> was effective also in intervention in tumor growth, here, too, the treatment was associated with reduced angiogenic activity and vessel regression. These results demonstrate the important role of collagen type I in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth and implicate its role in chronic wounds.

40|$|<b>Halofuginone</b> is {{an analog}} of febrifugine—an {{alkaloid}} originally {{isolated from the}} plant Dichroa febrifuga. During recent years, <b>halofuginone</b> has attracted much attention because of its wide range of beneficial biological activities, which encompass malaria, cancer, and fibrosis-related and autoimmune diseases. At present two modes of <b>halofuginone</b> actions have been described: (1) Inhibition of Smad 3 phosphorylation downstream of the TGFβ signaling pathway results in inhibition of fibroblasts-to-myofibroblasts transition and fibrosis. (2) Inhibition of prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) activity in the blood stage of malaria and inhibition of Th 17 cell differentiation thereby inhibiting inflammation and the autoimmune reaction by activation of the amino acid starvation and integrated stress responses.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>Halofuginone</b> on radiation-induced cardiovascular injury in a rat model. Methods : Sixty Wistar-Albino rats were divided into six groups (the control group, radiotherapy (RT) only group Irradiation (IR), 2. 5 and 5 μg <b>Halofuginone</b> groups (Hal (2. 5) /C and Hal (5. 0) /C), and RT plus 2. 5 and 5 μg <b>Halofuginone</b> groups (Hal (2. 5) /IR and Hal (5. 0) /IR). Rats were exposed to a single dose of 12 Gy irradiation generated by a linear accelerator. <b>Halofuginone</b> was applied intraperitoneally with daily doses. At the 6 th and 16 th weeks of RT, 5 rats from each group sacrificed and; heart and thoracic aorta tissues removed for both light microscopic and electron microscopic examinations. Results : Light microscopic examinations revealed that the endocardial thickness of all study groups was significantly different at 6 th and 16 th week of RT (p < 0. 001 for both). Pair-wise comparisons showed that the differences were significant in IR- Hal (2. 5) /IR (p < 0. 001); IR-Hal (5. 0) /IR (p < 0. 001); and Hal (2. 5) /IR-Hal (5. 0) /IR (p = 0. 001) at 16 th week of RT. There were significant differences within the study groups regarding to the thoracic aorta fibrosis scores only at 16 th week of RT (p = 0. 002). Electron microscopic examinations demonstrated that there were significant differences between all the groups with respect to heart mitochondria scores at both 6 th week and 16 th weeks of RT (p < 0. 001 for both). The differences between Hal (2. 5) /IR and Hal (5. 0) /IR with respect to the heart mitochondria scores were significant only at 16 th week of RT (p = 0. 001). Conclusion : These data demonstrated that <b>Halofuginone</b> may improve radiation-induced cardiovascular injury. The most prominent improvement was observed in higher dose of <b>Halofuginone</b> group after long term follow-up. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether sup-plemental levels of L-proline in the diets of broiler chickens would mitigate the skin weakening effect caused by continuous feeding of the anticoccidial <b>halofuginone.</b> In Experiment 1, tensile strength and collagen levels in thigh apteria skin were determined at 21 and 42 d of age in male broilers fed 0,. 5, and 1 % L-proline with either <b>halofuginone</b> (3 mg/kg) or salinomycin (61 mg/kg). In Experiment 2, the same measurements were made on female broilers receiving diets containing <b>halofuginone</b> and supplemented with 0,. 5, or 1 % L-proline, 1 % L-proline through 21 d of age, or 1 % L-glutamic acid through 21 d of age, or a diet containing high L-proline feedstuffs (corn gluten meal and ring dried blood meal). In Experiment 1, dermis thickness of thigh apteria was measured in the males at Day 21. Skin strength was increased in male and female broilers fed <b>halofuginone</b> with addition of. 5 and 1 % L-proline, respectively, at 21 and 42 d of age.

40|$|AbstractHalofuginone is {{a leading}} agent in {{preventing}} fibrosis and inflammation in various muscular dystrophies. We hypothesized {{that in addition to}} these actions, <b>halofuginone</b> directly promotes the cell-cycle events of satellite cells in the mdx and dysf−/− mouse models of early-onset Duchenne muscular dystrophy and late-onset dysferlinopathy, respectively. In both models, addition of <b>halofuginone</b> to freshly prepared single gastrocnemius myofibers derived from 6 -week-old mice increased BrdU incorporation at as early as 18 h of incubation, as well as phospho-histone H 3 (PHH 3) and MyoD protein expression in the attached satellite cells, while having no apparent effect on myofibers derived from wild-type mice. BrdU incorporation was abolished by an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, suggesting involvement of this pathway in mediating halofuginone's effects on cell-cycle events. In cultures of myofibers and myoblasts isolated from dysf−/− mice, <b>halofuginone</b> reduced Bax and induced Bcl 2 expression levels and induced Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Addition of an inhibitor of the phosphinositide- 3 -kinase/Akt pathway reversed the halofuginone-induced cell survival, suggesting this pathway's involvement in mediating halofuginone's effects on survival. Thus, in addition to its known role in inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation, <b>halofuginone</b> plays a direct role in satellite cell activity and survival in muscular dystrophies, regardless of the mutation. These actions are of the utmost importance for improving muscle pathology and function in muscular dystrophies...|$|E
