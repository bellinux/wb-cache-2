Then we investigate some connections between hyperrings and fuzzy hyperrings using the notions of hypercongruences and fuzzy hypercongruences. We introduce and study induced equivalence relations on hyperrings and fuzzy hyperrings and investigate their properties. Finally, we define join hyperrings and fuzzy join hyperrings.

The topology maintained in this approach is called a <b>Hyperring.</b> It supports primitives: • Add(v) : This adds node v to the <b>Hyperring</b> next to the node that v contacted. • Remove(v) : This removes node v from the <b>Hyperring.</b> We assume here that a node can only remove itself.

Suppose that the network currently consists of n nodes. Then the <b>Hyperring</b> will consist of approximately log n levels of rings, starting with level 0.

Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the <b>hyper</b> sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
