These difficulties included having to endure McCartney's habit of dictating how the others should play their instruments and Lennon's increasing withdrawal from the band and emotional dependence on his ever-present partner, Yoko Ono. The couple had recently descended into heroin addiction, leaving Lennon, in author Peter Doggett's words, [...] "emotionally removed and artistically bankrupt". In their study of the Get Back project, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that, as another frustration for Harrison, Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked his compositions, even when they were [...] "far better than their own".|$|E

[...] He complained that the Canadian team threw [...] "cucumbers and other leftovers" [...] at his colleague Franz Baader on the flight from Moscow to Prague and harassed visitors in hotels. Bobby Hull also criticized Team Canada, stating that the fighting and gestures of the Canadian players [...] "were a bad example to young players and diplomatically harmful." ...|$|E

[...] "We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals.

He later said {{he was reluctant to}} be a [...] "hired gun", citing the band's refusal to record any of the nine songs he submitted for their then-upcoming album. Manson clarified: [...] "There was talk early on about collaborating with different guitar players on the record. That was before Twiggy and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> together, because once Twiggy was back, there was nobody else, and I don't care what you have to offer—this was our record." [...] Manson and Twiggy announced at the 2008 Scream Awards in October that the album was [...] "pretty much done", and indicated it would sound more like Antichrist Superstar than the band's recent material. Manson later described the record as featuring [...] " [...] guitar solos and brutal, reckless screaming", and as being [...] "very ruthless, heavy and violent". The album was co-produced by Manson, Twiggy and Vrenna, along with Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals co-producer Sean Beavan.|$|E
500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International.

In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted."

Leaving deHavilland upon its merger with Hawker Siddeley in 1960, he gave up full-time work and joined the board of East-West Airlines as a consultant in January 1961. In August 1964, he began negotiations with the Federal government on behalf of International Parcels Express Company (now Toll IPEC), which was attempting to enter the air freight business in Australia with the purchase of five DC-4 Skymasters; the government rejected the proposal later that year. Along with Arthur Coles, Brain was a guest {{at the opening of}} TAA's new headquarters at Franklin Street, Melbourne in November 1965. In 1978, he met with adventurer Dick Smith, who was about to launch an expedition to recover the Kookaburra from the Tanami Desert. Smith was keen to get directions from the man who had found the missing plane in 1929, in spite of receiving advice against taking the word of someone from the [...] "cap and goggles" [...] era. He rediscovered the Kookaburra in August that year [...] "exactly where Lester Brain had said...Lester was completely chuffed when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> and told him I'd found the Kookaburra thanks to his directions and how thankful I was that, despite everyone else's suggestions, I'd taken Lester's advice." ...|$|E

[...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?'

500|$|Wrigley was summarily {{retired from}} the RAAF in 1946, along with other senior commanders and {{veterans}} of World WarI, ostensibly {{to make way for}} the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. Keenly disappointed with the decision, Wrigley was officially discharged on 6June. He found it difficult to secure civilian employment because, [...] "by the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> all the worthwhile jobs round Australia had been snapped up by people, not only air force people but other people on the spot". After an unsuccessful attempt to run his own retail business, he [...] "eventually earned a living by taking on some administrative jobs which carried on for a few years". Wrigley was made an honorary air vice marshal in July 1956. In 1966 he became executive officer of the Victorian Overseas Foundation, and later a trustee. He published Aircraft and Economic Development: The RAAF Contribution through the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1969.

After the death of his first wife, Marjorie, Wrigley married Zenda Edwards on 5January 1972. In December 1979, he was the guest of honour at celebrations marking sixty years of flying at Darwin; the RAAF flew him from Point Cook to Darwin to commemorate his historic 1919 flight with Arthur Murphy. Wrigley wrote a history of the Victorian branch of the United Services Institution in 1980. Aged ninety-five, he died in Melbourne on 14September 1987.|$|E
