50|$|A long-standing {{controversy}} was how {{to interpret}} language in the Act that banned long haul-short haul <b>fare</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 addressed this question by strengthening ICC authority over railroad rates, This amendment also expanded the ICC's jurisdiction to include regulation of telephone, telegraph and wireless companies.|$|E
5000|$|The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 is a United States {{federal law}} that was {{designed}} to regulate the railroad industry, particularly its monopolistic practices. The Act required that railroad rates be [...] "reasonable and just," [...] but did not empower the government to fix specific rates. It also required that railroads publicize shipping rates and prohibited short haul or long haul <b>fare</b> <b>discrimination,</b> a form of price discrimination against smaller markets, particularly farmers in Western or Southern Territory compared to the Official Eastern states. [...] The Act created a federal regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which it charged with monitoring railroads to ensure that they complied with the new regulations.|$|E
50|$|For {{airports}} built {{within or}} close to the city limits, extending mass transit urban rail systems like rapid transit or light rail to airport terminals allows full integration with other public transport in the city, and seamless transport to all parts of town. Service frequency will be high, although travel time is a drawback as the services make many intermediate stops before reaching the city center and thus {{there may not be}} enough space for the baggage commonly carried by airport-bound passengers. Furthermore, luggage stowing facilities are not commonly found on mass transit vehicles as their primary objective is to provide high-capacity transport, as in the Airport, Inner West & South Line in Sydney, Australia. A common solution involves building a separate people mover from a mass transit station to the airport terminal (see below), often using automated systems, allowing faster travel time and <b>fare</b> <b>discrimination,</b> for instance Orlyval. Because they are solely dedicated to passengers using the airport, luggage stowing facilities are more likely to appear on these systems.|$|E
2500|$|By 1992 the Fifth Circuit could {{assert that}} [...] "the two-step burden-shifting rule ... {{has now become}} {{standard}} <b>fare</b> in <b>discrimination</b> cases" [...] {{in the third and}} final appeal by a Mississippi newspaper alleging that local government withdrew legal advertising in retaliation for critical coverage. The district court had found the first-ever application of the test to a case involving denial of public patronage [...] "strained"; Judge John Robert Brown disagreed, saying it was" [...] broad enough potentially to lend itself {{to a wide variety of}} fact patterns" [...] and remanded the case.|$|R
40|$|Latin American {{immigrants}} {{will continue}} to make up a large share of transit ridership, bicycling and walking in the United States for the foreseeable future, but there is relatively little research about them. This mixed-methods study compares the travel patterns of low-income immigrants living in the San Francisco Bay Area with that of other groups and investigates the barriers and constraints faced by low-income immigrants when taking transit and bicycling. Much of the previous work on immigrant travel has relied on national surveys and qualitative analysis, which underrepresent disadvantaged population groups and slower modes of travel, or are unable to speak to broader patterns in the population. We conducted interviews with 14 low-income immigrants and a paper-based intercept survey of 2, 078 adults. Interviewees revealed five major barriers that made public transit use difficult for them, including safety, transit <b>fare</b> affordability, <b>discrimination,</b> system legibility, and reliability. Although crime was the most prominent issue in interviews, the survey results suggest transit cost is the most pressing concern for low-income immigrants. Low-income immigrants were less likely than those with higher-incomes to have access to a motor vehicle, and were less likely than higher-income immigrants or the U. S. -born of any income to have access to a bicycle or bus pass. Finally, although most barriers to public transit use were the same regardless of nativity or household income, low-income immigrants were much less willing to take public transit when they had the option to drive and less willing to bicycle for any purpose. The prevalence of concerns about transit affordability, crime, and reliability suggest transit agencies should consider income-based fare reductions, coordinated crime prevention with local law enforcement, and improved scheduling...|$|R
