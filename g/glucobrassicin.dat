50|$|<b>Glucobrassicin</b> is {{also known}} to be a highly active {{egg-laying}} stimulant of cabbage white butterflies such as the small white (Pieris rapae) and the large white (Pieris brassicae).|$|E
50|$|The three first {{mentioned}} derivatives are as frequent in crucifers as <b>glucobrassicin</b> itself. The additional three derivatives {{appear to}} be rare in nature. 4-methoxyglucobrassicin was recently reported to be a signal molecule involved in plant defence against bacteria and fungi.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C), {{the most}} {{abundant}} metabolite of <b>glucobrassicins,</b> is found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower. I 3 C {{has been shown to}} have anticarcinogenic activity against many chemical carcinogens in multiple target organs in animal models. However, the anticarcinogenic activity of I 3 C is considered indirect since I 3 C is converted irreversibly to its dimer and other condensation products under the low pH conditions of the stomach. 3, 3 '-Diindolylmethane (DIM), a primary breakdown product of I 3 C, also shows anticarcinogenic activity {{in a manner similar to}} I 3 C. Our laboratory has shown that I 3 C dramatically induces CYP 1 A (cytochrome P 4501 A) and inhibits FMO 1 (flavin-containing monooxygenase form 1) expression in rat liver and intestine. We also showed that I 3 C induced hepatic CYP 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 in male guinea pig, mouse and rabbit. There was no significant difference in FMO 1 protein between control and I 3 C treated groups in these three species. The simultaneous induction of CYP and repression of FMO may alter the metabolism, disposition and toxicity of drugs and/or xenobiotics that are substrates of both monooxygenases such as N, N-dimethylaniline, nicotine and tamoxifen. In liver microsomes from rats fed I 3 C or DIM, the ratio of FMO to CYP metabolites of the three chosen compounds decreased, mostly due to a reduction of N-oxide FMO-dependent formation. Major concerns associated with human dietary I 3 C supplementation are its estrogenic effect as seen in trout and its ability to induce cytochrome P 450 s involved in bioactivation. Evidence presented here also demonstrated a dose response of vitellogenin induction after 2 weeks of dietary I 3 C or DIM in rainbow trout. In immature female rat, I 3 C and DIM significantly induced uterine peroxidase, hepatic CYP 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 and CYP 2 B 1 / 2 B 2. All our results suggested that I 3 C and/or DIM, in combination with other drugs that are substrates for both monooxygenases, could alter the therapeutic effects or toxicity of drugs. Also the estrogenic activity in rainbow trout and immature female rat should be considered when assessing risk for the use of I 3 C and DIM as chemopreventive agents or dietary supplements...|$|R
50|$|<b>Glucobrassicin</b> {{is a type}} of {{glucosinolate}} {{that can}} be found in almost all cruciferous plants, such as cabbages, broccoli, mustards, and woad. As for other glucosinolates, degradation by the enzyme myrosinase is expected to produce an isothiocyanate, indol-3-ylmethylisothiocyanate. However, this specific isothiocyanate is expected to be highly unstable, and has indeed never been detected. The observed hydrolysis products when isolated <b>glucobrassicin</b> is degraded by myrosinase are indole-3-carbinol and thiocyanate ion (plus glucose, sulfate, and hydrogen ion), which are envisioned to result from a rapid reaction of the unstable isothiocyanate with water. However, a large number of other reaction products are known, and indole-3-carbinol is not the dominant degradation product when glucosinolate degradation takes place in crushed plant tissue or in intact plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>glucobrassicin</b> {{begins with}} tryptophan produced through several {{steps from the}} Shikimic acid pathway compound, chorismic acid. Tryptophan is converted to indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) by cytochrome p450 enzymes (the redundant CYP92B3 and CYP79B3 in Arabidopsis thaliana) using NADPH and molecular Oxygen. A separate p450 enzyme (CYP83B1 in Arabidopsis) catalyzes a second subsequent monooxygenase reaction to create a proposed the intermediate 1-aci-nitro-2-indolyl-ethane. A cysteine is utilized by Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) in a conjugation process to produce a S-alkylthiohydroximate derivative, which is then cleaved off by a C-S Lyase (like the SUR1 enzyme found in Arabidopsis) to create a free thiol. A single glucosylation occurs attaching a glucose molecule to the indole hydroximate through a thioether linkage. Finally, the hydroximate itself is sulfated creating <b>glucobrassicin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Several {{derivatives}} of <b>glucobrassicin</b> are known. The compound {{itself was}} first isolated from Brassica plants, hence {{the ending of}} the name. When a second, similar natural product was discovered, it was named neoglucobrassicin. When further derivatives were discovered, a more systematic nomenclature was used. Currently, the following six derivatives are known from plants: ...|$|E
50|$|About 132 {{different}} glucosinolates {{are known}} to occur naturally in plants. They are synthesized from certain amino acids: So-called aliphatic glucosinolates derived from mainly methionine, but also alanine, leucine, isoleucine, or valine. (Most glucosinolates are actually derived from chain-elongated homologues of these amino acids, e.g. glucoraphanin is derived from dihomomethionine, which is methionine chain-elongated twice). Aromatic glucosinolates include indolic glucosinolates, such as <b>glucobrassicin,</b> derived from tryptophan and others from phenylalanine, its chain-elongated homologue homophenylalanine, and sinalbin derived from tyrosine.|$|E
50|$|Sinalbin is metabolised to {{form the}} mustard oil 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate by the enzyme myrosinase. The less sharp taste of white mustard is because 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate is {{unstable}} and degrades to 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and a thiocyanate ion, which are not pungent. Half-life of the isothiocyanate is depending on pH of the solution - longest time is 321 minutes at pH 3, and lowest is 6 min at pH 6.5. <b>Glucobrassicin</b> is a structurally related glucosinolate that likewise yields a non-pungent isothiocyanate due to reaction with water.|$|E
5000|$|Indole-3-carbinol (C9H9NO) is {{produced}} by {{the breakdown of the}} glucosinolate <b>glucobrassicin,</b> which can be found at relatively high levels in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collard greens and kale. It is also available in dietary supplements. Indole-3-carbinol is the subject of on-going biomedical research into its possible anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and anti-atherogenic effects. Research on indole-3-carbinol has been conducted primarily using laboratory animals and cultured cells. Limited and inconclusive human studies have been reported. A recent review of the biomedical research literature found that [...] "evidence of an inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and breast or prostate cancer in humans is limited and inconsistent" [...] and [...] "larger randomized controlled trials are needed" [...] to determine if supplemental indole-3-carbinol has health benefits.|$|E
50|$|Goitrin is a sulfur-containing oxazolidine, a cyclic thiocarbamate, {{that reduces}} the {{production}} of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine. It is found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, brussels sprouts and rapeseed oil, and is formed by the hydrolysis of a glucosinolate: progoitrin or 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate. The unstable isothiocyanate (2-hydroxy-3-butenyl isothiocyanate) derived from the latter glucosinolate spontaneously cyclizes to goitrin, because the hydroxy group is situated in proximity to the isothiocyanate group (allowing a five-membered ring to be formed). Hence, the oxygen in the molecule stems from the hydroxy group of the original unstable isothiocyanate. Plants containing this specific glucosinolate (or glucosinolates such as <b>glucobrassicin</b> and sinalbin which liberate thiocyanate ion) have goitrogenic potential due to the goitrin and thiocyanate they contain. However, they {{do not seem to}} alter thyroid function in humans at realistic amounts in the diet.|$|E
5000|$|Most B. vulgaris genotypes are {{naturally}} resistant to some insect {{species that are}} otherwise specialized on the crucifer family. In the case of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum, the resistance is caused by saponins. Glucosinolates such as glucobarbarin and <b>glucobrassicin</b> are used as a cue for egg-laying by female cabbage white butterflies such as Pieris rapae. Indeed, the larvae of this butterfly thrive well on this plant. Diamondback moth females are also stimulated by these chemicals, but the larvae die due {{to the content of}} saponins which are apparently not sensed by the moths. This phenomenon has been tested for biological insect control: B. vulgaris plants are placed in a field and attract much of the diamondback moth egg load. As the larvae die shortly after hatching, this kind of insect control has been named [...] "dead-end trap cropping".|$|E

Advisor: Robert Kratzke. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iii, 21 pages. <b>Glucobrassicin</b> {{gives rise to}} indole- 3 -carbinol (I 3 C), a compound with potent anti-cancer effects in preclinical models. We previously showed that urinary 3, 3 ´-diindolylmethane (DIM, the predominate metabolite of I 3 C), can discriminate between consumption {{of high and low}} doses of glucobrassicin-containing vegetables. However, the quantitative relationship between <b>glucobrassicin</b> exposure and urinary DIM level is unclear. We hypothesized that a range of <b>glucobrassicin</b> exposure from Brassica vegetables is reflected in urinary DIM and that this effect plateaus. Forty-five subjects consumed vegetables at 1 of 7 discrete dose levels (25 to 500 umol) of <b>glucobrassicin</b> for 2 days. Urine was collected for 24 hours afterward, and DIM was measured by LC/ESI-MS/MS-SRM. Urinary DIM excretion increased predictably with increasing <b>glucobrassicin</b> dose, plateauing between 200 and 300 umol of <b>glucobrassicin.</b> <b>Glucobrassicin</b> dose and urinary DIM correlated (R= 0. 82). The positive and strong correlation between <b>glucobrassicin</b> dose and urinary DIM supports its use as a biomarker of <b>glucobrassicin</b> exposure and I 3 C uptake...|$|E
40|$|Leaves of woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) {{were found}} to {{incorporate}} efficiently tritiated indoleacetaldoxime and 35 S from 35 S-l-cystine into <b>glucobrassicin</b> and sulfoglucobrassicin. Time course of incorporation of 35 S from 35 S-cystine into the glucosinolates indicated that <b>glucobrassicin</b> was formed first and then sulfoglucobrassicin. Simultaneous administration of tritiated indoleacetaldoxime and 35 S-cystine gave doubly labeled <b>glucobrassicin</b> and sulfoglucobrassicin. About twice as much 35 S was present in sulfoglucobrassicin as compared to <b>glucobrassicin</b> per unit of 3 H incorporated, indicating that a second, probably oxidized, atom of 35 S was later introduced into sulfoglucobrassicin. However, the 35 S incorporated from cystine into both glucosinolates during the first 8 hours of metabolism was almost exclusively in the divalent sulfur moiety. The incorporation patterns of 35 S and titritated indoleacetaldoxime into the glucosinolates suggested a fast turnover of <b>glucobrassicin</b> in the metabolizing leaves...|$|E
40|$|The {{exceptionally}} {{high levels}} in woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) of three indolic goitrogens, namely <b>glucobrassicin,</b> neoglucobrassicin, and glucobrassicin- 1 -sulfonate, permit the facile study of their {{distribution in the}} plant and their changes during its development. Woad seeds contain as much as 0. 23 % fresh weight of <b>glucobrassicin</b> but no other indole glucosinolate, while 1 -week-old seedlings also contain substantial amounts of neoglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin- 1 -sulfonate in their shoots whether grown in the light or dark. The sulfonate is not found in roots, and light depresses neoglucobrassicin levels in shoots. Sterile root cultures synthesize <b>glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin, and significant quantities of these were even found to be excreted by the roots of intact sterile seedlings in culture. This may explain the long known deleterious effect of woad and other cruciferous crops on subsequent plantings and the observation could be of ecological importance. Long term changes in levels of all three substances in the plant are similar and are compatible with earlier suggestions that the compounds could be auxin precursors {{at the time of}} flower stem elongation. Since sterile seedlings readily incorporate 35 SO 42 − into indole glucosinolates and relative specific radioactivities suggest that <b>glucobrassicin</b> is the precursor of the other two compounds, pathways of goitrogen biosynthesis should be relatively easily determined in this material...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{cold storage}} and three common cooking practices, blanching, sauteing, and {{microwave}} cooking at different time intervals, {{on the content}} of glucosinolate (GSL) anticancer components in six Brassica vegetables were investigated. Eleven GSLs including progoitrin, glucoraphanin, sinigrin, glucoalyssin, gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin, glucoerucin, <b>glucobrassicin,</b> 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin, gluconasturtiin, and neoglucobrassicin were quantified using LC-MS and HPLC. Storage at 4 ºC indicated no significant loss of GSLs in broccoli, kohlrabi, and cabbage, and approximately 90 - 100 % of the total concentration of aliphatic and indolyl GSLs were detected. Interestingly, glucoraphanin and <b>glucobrassicin,</b> known as a cancer prevention agents, increased approximately above 50 % in broccoli, kohlrabi, and cabbage, while the amount of <b>glucobrassicin</b> decreased by 5 % in cauliflower for 5 days at 4 ºC. Blanching of broccoli at 120 sec significantly (36 %) decreased total GSLs; however, sautéing and microwaving decreased by 13 - 26 %. Individual GSLs have different response at blanching. These findings suggest that different processing methods for each vegetable would be preferred to preserve the nutritional qualities...|$|E
40|$|The {{glucosinolate}} {{contents of}} two different cultivars of Brassica rapa (Herfstraap and Oleifera) infected with Leptosphaeria maculans and Fusarium oxysporum were determined. Infection triggered the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates (gluconapin, progoitrin, glucobrassicanapin and gluconapoleiferin) and indole glucosinolate (4 -hydroxy-glucobrassicin) in Herfstraap and of two indole glucosinolates (<b>glucobrassicin</b> and 4 -hydroxy-glucobrassicin) in Oleifera. While total and aliphatic glucosinolates decreased significantly in Oleifera, a large increase was observed in Herfstraap after fungal infection. The indole glucosinolate <b>glucobrassicin</b> accumulated in Oleifera {{at a higher rate}} than Herfstraap especially after infection with F. oxysporum. Apparently the interaction between fungus and B. rapa is cultivar and fungal species specific. ...|$|E
40|$|Brassica oleracea L. crops {{including}} kales, cabbages, and Tronchuda cabbages {{are widely}} grown in northwestern Spain and Portugal but little {{information is available}} on leaf glucosinolate content of these crops. The objectives were to determine the diversity for the total glucosinolate content and profile on leaves {{in a collection of}} 153 kales, 26 cabbages, and three Tronchuda cabbages varieties grown at two growing seasons and to determine the seasonal variation of glucosinolates in cabbages and Tronchuda cabbage varieties. Sinigrin, glucoiberin, and <b>glucobrassicin</b> were the major glucosinolates found in kales. Glucoiberin was the most common glucosinolate in Tronchuda cabbages in both planting seasons and in cabbages sown in fall season whereas <b>glucobrassicin</b> and glucoiberin were the most common glucosinolates in cabbages in spring season. In kales the total glucosinolate content ranged from 11. 0 to 53 lmol g 1 dw, with a mean value of 26. 3 lmol g 1 dw. Four kale varieties (MBG-BRS 0468, MBG-BRS 0476, MBG-BRS 0060 and MBG-BRS 0223) showed the highest total sinigrin or <b>glucobrassicin</b> contents. So, they could be good candidates for future breeding programs. In cabbages, the total glucosinolate content ranged from 10. 9 to 27 g 1 dw. Total glucosinolate concentration during spring sowing (22 lm g 1 dw) was higher than those in fall sowing (13 lm g 1 dw). Regarding both high glucosinolate content and the agronomic value, MBGBRS 0057 and MBG-BRS 0074 could be good sources of beneficial glucosinolates. The presence of high concentrations of sinigrin, glucoiberin, and <b>glucobrassicin</b> warrant further search into their potential use to enhance the level of these important phytochemicals in these edible crops.

40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} requires cultivars {{that can}} adapt to organic crop management systems {{without the use}} of synthetic pesticides as well as genotypes with improved nutritional value. The aim of this study encompassing 16 experiments was to compare 23 broccoli cultivars for the content of phytochemicals associated with health promotion grown under organic and conventional management in spring and fall plantings in two broccoli growing regions in the US (Oregon and Maine). The phytochemicals quantified included: glucosinolates (glucoraphanin, <b>glucobrassicin,</b> neoglucobrassin), tocopherols (d-, ¿-, a-tocopherol) and carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, ß-carotene). For glucoraphanin (17. 5 %) and lutein (13 %), genotype was the major source of total variation; for <b>glucobrassicin,</b> region (36 %) and the interaction of location and season (27. 5 %); and for neoglucobrassicin, both genotype (36. 8 %) and its interactions (34. 4 %) with season were important. For d- and ¿- tocopherols, season played the largest role in the total variation followed by location and genotype; for total carotenoids, genotype (8. 41 – 13. 03 %) was the largest source of variation and its interactions with location and season. Overall, phytochemicals were not significantly influenced by management system. We observed that the cultivars with the highest concentrations of glucoraphanin had the lowest for <b>glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin. The genotypes with high concentrations of <b>glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin were the same cultivars and were early maturing F 1 hybrids. Cultivars highest in tocopherols and carotenoids were open pollinated or early maturing F 1 hybrids. We identified distinct locations and seasons where phytochemical performance was higher for each compound. Correlations among horticulture traits and phytochemicals demonstrated that glucoraphanin was negatively correlated with the carotenoids and the carotenoids were correlated with one another. Little or no association between phytochemical concentration and date of cultivar release was observed, suggesting that modern breeding has not negatively influenced the level of tested compounds. We found no significant differences among cultivars from different seed companies...|$|E
40|$|Five {{conspicuous}} indole derivatives {{are present}} in leaves and other tissues of woad (Isatis tinctoria L.). They were identified as tryptophan, isatan B, <b>glucobrassicin,</b> neoglucobrassicin, and glucobrassicin- 1 -sulfonate. The latter three indole glucosinolates are present at levels of at least 260, 69, and 200 milligrams per kilogram fresh weight and were isolated as crystalline salts. Comparison of physical and chemical properties, particularly NMR spectral analysis, confirms that the 1 -methoxyglucobrassicin structure suggested for neoglucobrassicin is correct, whereas further evidence for the even more unusual sulfonation of the ring nitrogen in glucobrassicin- 1 -sulfonate was obtained. Glucobrassicin- 1 -sulfonate has an enzymic degradation pattern identical to that of <b>glucobrassicin.</b> As it too releases thiocyanate, it must {{be added to the}} list of known plant goitrogens. These studies and the techniques described establish woad as exceptionally suitable higher plant material for metabolic studies of indoles related to goitrogens and auxins...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensity}} of mechanical stress {{and the temperature}} significantly affect the levels of individual and total glucosinolates in shredded white cabbage (cv. Galaxy). Mild processing (shredding to 2 [*]mm thickness) at 8 °C resulted in the accumulation of glucosinolates (40 % increase) in comparison with unshredded cabbage, which was already seen 5 [*]min after the mechanical stress. Severe processing (shredding to 0. 5 [*]mm thickness) at 20 °C, however, resulted in an initial 50 % decrease in glucosinolates. The glucosinolates accumulated {{in all of the}} cabbage samples 30 [*]min from processing, resulting in higher levels than in unshredded cabbage, except for the severe processing at 20 °C where the increase was not sufficient to compensate for the initial loss. <b>Glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin were the major glucosinolates identified in the cabbage samples. Mechanical stress resulted in an increase in the relative proportion of <b>glucobrassicin</b> and in a decrease in neoglucobrassicin...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{processing}} of Brassica vegetables {{can lead to}} substantial loss of potential health-promoting glucosinolates (GLs). The extent of thermal degradation of a specific GL varies in different vegetables, possibly {{due to differences in}} the composition of other metabolites within the plant matrices. An untargeted metabolomics approach followed by random forest regression was applied to identify metabolites associated to thermal GL degradation in a segregating Brassica oleracea population. Out of 413 metabolites, 15 were associated with the degradation of <b>glucobrassicin,</b> six with that of glucoraphanin and two with both GLs. Among these 23 metabolites three were identified as flavonols (one kaempferol- and two quercetinderivatives) and two as other GLs (4 -methoxyglucobrassicin, gluconasturtiin). Twenty quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these metabolites, which were associated with glucoraphanin and <b>glucobrassicin</b> degradation, were identified on linkage groups C 01, C 07 and C 09. Two flavonols mapped on linkage groups C 07 and C 09 and co-localise with the QTL for GL degradation determined previously...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. January 2017. Major: Applied Plant Sciences. Advisor: Mary Rogers. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 68 pages. Pieris rapae is an insect pest the feeds exclusively on {{species of the}} Brassicaceae. It is a serious economic pest in commercial horticulture as larvae chew large holes in leaves, can destroy developing heads of broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, and otherwise contaminate or stain produce, rendering it unmarketable. P. rapae is notoriously difficult to manage in organic production systems, and organic brassica growers traditionally rely upon floating row covers or biopesticides to prevent feeding damage. Natural pest resistance is important when making cultivar recommendations for production systems with limited pest management options, and our research evaluates natural and induced resistance in broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) against P. rapae {{with a focus on}} the roles that glucosinolates (GSLs) play in resistance. GSLs are constitutive and inducible secondary metabolites in members of the Brassicaceae and are toxic to generalist insect pests. However, the relationship between GSL and P. rapae, a brassica specialist, is complex and not well understood. A controlled greenhouse study evaluated the effects of P. rapae herbivory on GSL induction and subsequent larval growth and performance on two broccoli cultivars (‘Beneforte’ and ‘Green Magic’) that varied in concentration of two GSLs, <b>glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin. Our results show that neoglucobrassicin and <b>glucobrassicin</b> concentrations did not significantly increase as a result of herbivory, but the overall growth and performance of P. rapae was influenced by cultivar. Larvae consumed less total leaf area and weighed less as pupae when feeding on ‘Beneforte’, which also had a significantly higher <b>glucobrassicin</b> concentration, indicating that cultivar may be important in resistance against P. rapae. A field study performed at two certified organic farms in Minnesota in 2015 and 2016 evaluated six broccoli cultivars (‘Belstar,’ ‘Fiesta,’ ‘Green Magic,’ ‘Marathon,’ ‘Packman,’ and ‘Thompson’) for natural resistance to P. rapae and for yield performance. The cultivars in this study did not significantly differ in susceptibility to P. rapae infestation, and neoglucobrassicin and <b>glucobrassicin</b> concentrations did not explain P. rapae egg and larval abundance. We conclude that cultivar selection should not be based on natural resistance to pests in this case but rather based on cultivar performance. ‘Belstar,’ ‘Fiesta’, ‘Green Magic,’ and ‘Packman’ were top performers and produced a consistent and high quality product, and therefore we would recommended these cultivars as acceptable selections for organic systems in Minnesota...|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates (GLSs), health {{promoting}} compounds {{commonly found}} in Brassica vegetables, were studied during sayur asin fermentation made from Indian mustard (B. juncea). The current preliminary study aims to investigate the changes of glucosinolates content during 3 and 7 days of fermentation in two different media, i. e. coconut water and tajin liquor, and salt concentrations of 2. 5 and 10 %. The glucosinolates were analysed by HPLC after sample extraction in hot methanol followed by purification and de-sulphation. Results show that sinigrin was the most dominant glucosinolate among others, i. e. gluconapin, <b>glucobrassicin,</b> 4 -hydroxy-glucobrassicin, 4 -methoxy-glucobrassicin, and neo <b>glucobrassicin,</b> accounting for about 1000 and 4000 µmol/ 10 g dw in raw Indian mustard. Unfortunately, fermentation has substantially reduced the glucosinolates content in sayur asin. After 3 days of fermentation the sinigrin content was reduced by 95 % as compared {{to that in the}} raw vegetable. The indole GLSs 4 -methoxy-glucobrassicin and neo-glucobrassicin concentration decreased to 80 - 90 % of the fresh materials. However, the decreasing mechanisms as well as factors contributing to the decrease of the glucosinolates could not be explained yet...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlucosinolates (GLSs) are {{of great}} {{interest}} for their potential as antioxidant and anticancer agents. Our aim was to assess in vitro antioxidant activity of cauliflower GLSs and their derivatives, {{as well as to}} evaluate their contribution to the overall antioxidant capacity of cauliflower extracts using four different in vitro assays, 2, 20 -azino-bis-(3 -ethyl-benzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) radical cation (ABTS-+), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH-), oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and superoxide radical scavenging activity assay (SRSA). The antioxidant activities of GLSs determined using ABTS-+ and DPPH- assays were weak. In contrast, ORAC and SRSA assays showed significant antioxidant activity for GLSs. This activity was particularly important for <b>glucobrassicin,</b> which was the most effective GLS, and for glucoiberin and gluconapin. Mixtures of GLSs did not show either synergy or antagonism in general. Interestingly, the breakdown products, i. e. enzymatic hydrolysis-derived products (EHDP) of GLSs, were far more active than the native GLSs. The highest increases in antioxidant activity were obtained for EHDPs from progoitrin, sinigrin and glucoraphanin; progoitrin EHDP being the second most active derivative behind <b>glucobrassicin</b> EHDP. Antioxidant activities and GLS composition of different cauliflower by-product extracts were also determined. The contribution of different GLSs on measured antioxidant activity of cauliflower extracts was also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological and {{mechanistic}} studies show health-promoting effects of glucosinolates and their breakdown products. In literature, differences in non-enzymatic glucosinolate degradation rates during food processing between different vegetables are described, which {{provide the basis}} for studying the genetic effects of this trait and breeding vegetables with high glucosinolate retention during food processing. Non-enzymatic glucosinolate degradation, induced by heat, was studied in a publicly available Brassica oleracea doubled haploid population. Data were modeled to obtain degradation rate constants that were used as phenotypic traits to perform quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Glucosinolate degradation rate constants were determined for five aliphatic and two indolic glucosinolates. Degradation rates were independent of the initial glucosinolate concentration. Two QTL were identified for the degradation rate of the indolic <b>glucobrassicin</b> and one QTL for the degradation of the aliphatic glucoraphanin, which co-localized with one of the QTL for <b>glucobrassicin.</b> Factors within the plant matrix might influence the degradation of different glucosinolates in different genotypes. In addition to genotypic effects, we demonstrated that growing conditions influenced glucosinolate degradation as well. The study identified QTL for glucosinolate degradation, giving the opportunity to breed vegetables with a high retention of glucosinolates during food processing, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown...|$|E
40|$|An liquid chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} method using electrospray ionization {{in negative}} ion mode {{coupled with a}} hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer was applied to characterize of intact glucosinolates (GLSs) in crude sample extracts of wild bud flowers of Capparis spinosa (Capparis species, family Capparaceae). Structural information of GLSs was obtained upon precursor ions' isolation within the FTICR trapping cell and subsequent fragmentation induced by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD). Such a fragmentation was found very useful in terms of chemical identification of all precursor ions [M-H]- including sulfur-rich GLSs reported {{here for the first}} time. Along with most common GLSs already found in capers such as glucocapparin, isopropyl/n-propyl- GLS, mercapto-glucocapparin, and two indolic GLS, i. e., 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin and <b>glucobrassicin,</b> the occurrence of the uncommon glycinyl-glucocapparin as well as two sulfur-rich GLSs is reported. IRMPD showed an increased selectivity towards disulfide bond cleavages with thiol migration, suggesting the side chain structure of non-targeted compounds, i. e., disulfanyl-glucocapparin and trisulfanyl-glucocapparin. Glucocapparin [2. 05 ± 0. 25 mg/g, dry weight (dw) ] was the most abundant GLS, followed by <b>glucobrassicin</b> (232 ± 18 μg/g, dw) and 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin (89 ± 12 μg/g, dw). All other compounds were present at very low content ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 μg/g dw...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{advantages}} {{to the use}} of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants for the study of auxin metabolism previously have been partially offset by the complexity of indolic metabolism in this plant and by the lack of proper methods. To address some of these problems, we developed isotopic labeling methods to determine amounts and examine the metabolism of indolic compounds in Arabidopsis. Isolation and indentification of endogenous indole- 3 -acetonitrile (IAN; a possible precursor of the auxin indole- 3 -acetic acid [IAA]) was carried out under mild conditions, thus proving its natural occurrence. We describe here the synthesis of 13 C 1 -labeled IAN and its utility in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of endogenous IAN levels. We also quantified the nonenzymatic conversion of IAN to IAA under conditions used to hydrolyze IAA conjugates. 13 C 1 -Labeled IAN was used to assess the contribution of IAN to measured IAA following hydrolysis of IAA conjugates. We studied the stability and breakdown of the indolic glucosinolate <b>glucobrassicin,</b> which is known to be present in Arabidopsis. This is potentially an important concern when using Arabidopsis for studies of indolic biochemistry, since the levels of indolic auxins and auxin precursors are well below the levels of the indolic glucosinolates. We found that under conditions of extraction and base hydrolysis, formation of IAA from <b>glucobrassicin</b> was negligible...|$|E

40|$|A {{novel and}} simple method for {{detecting}} five glucosinolates (glucoalyssin, gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin, <b>glucobrassicin,</b> and 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin) in kimchi was developed using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The chromatographic {{peaks of the}} five glucosinolates were successfully identified by comparing their retention times, mass spectra. The mobile phase was composed of A (acetonitrile) and B (water). As for glucosinolate, the relative quantities were found through sinigrin, and five different compounds {{that have not been}} previously discovered in kimchi were observed. Monitoring was carried out on the glucosinolate in 20 kimchis distributed in markets, and this study examined the various quality and quantity compositions of the five components. The glucoalyssin content ranged from 0. 00 to 7. 07 [*]μmol/g of day weight (DW), with an average content of 0. 86 [*]μmol/g of DW, whereas the gluconapin content ranged from 0. 00 to 5. 85 [*]μmol/g of DW, with an average of 1. 17 [*]μmol/g of DW. The content of glucobrassicanapin varied between 0. 00 and 11. 87 [*]μmol/g of DW (average = 3. 03 [*]μmol/g of DW), whereas that of <b>glucobrassicin</b> varied between 0. 00 and 0. 42 [*]μmol/g of DW (average = 0. 06 [*]μmol/g of DW). The 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin content ranged from 0. 12 to 9. 36 [*]μmol/g of DW (average = 3. 52 [*]μmol/g of DW). A comparison of the contents revealed that, in most cases, the content of 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin was the highest...|$|E
40|$|<b>Glucobrassicin</b> (GBS), a {{glucosinolate}} {{contained in}} many brassica vegetables, is the precursor of chemopreventive compounds such as indole- 3 -carbinol. Large amounts of GBS {{would be needed}} to perform studies aimed at elucidating its role in the diet. This study was mainly undertaken to evaluate the flower buds of Isatis canescens as a source for GBS purification. In order to investigate the health-promoting potential of this species, glucosinolate, phenol and flavonoid content as well as the whole antioxidant capacity were also determined. Flower bud samples were collected in four localities around Mount Etna in Sicily, Italy, where I. canescens is widespread, as they are locally traditionally eaten...|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates in {{different}} ecotypes of Brassica rapa L. subsp. sylvestris L. Janch. var. esculenta Hort. widely distributed in Southern Italy and locally known as ‘‘friariello” and ‘‘cima di rapa”, were characterized and their glucosinolate composition was {{compared with that}} of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica). Although these two vegetables have a similar morphologic aspect, they showed a very different glucosinolate profile. While glucoraphanin, <b>glucobrassicin</b> and 1 -methoxyindol- 3 -ylmethyl were confirmed as the main compounds in broccoli, gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin were identified {{for the first time as}} the molecular markers of friarielli and other Brassica rapa plants.

40|$|Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) spray {{treatments}} {{were applied}} to the kale varieties ‘Dwarf Blue Curled Vates ’ and ‘Red Winter ’ in replicated field plantings in 2010 and 2011 to investigate alteration of glucosinolate (GS) composition in harvested leaf tissue. Aqueous solutions of 250 mM MeJA were sprayed to saturation on aerial plant tissues four days prior to harvest at commercial maturity. The MeJA treatment significantly increased gluconasturtiin (56 %), <b>glucobrassicin</b> (98 %), and neoglucobrassicin (150 %) concentrations in the apical leaf tissue of these genotypes over two seasons. Induction of quinone reductase (QR) activity, a biomarker for anti-carcinogenesis, was significantly increased by the extracts from the leaf tissue of these two cultivars. Extracts of apical leaf tissues had greater MeJA mediated increases in phenolics, glucosinolate concentrations, GS hydrolysis products, and QR activity than extracts from basal leaf tissue samples. The concentration of the hydrolysis product of glucoraphanin, sulforphane was significantly increased in apical leaf tissue of the cultivar ‘Red Winter ’ in both 2010 and 2011. There was interaction between exogenous MeJA treatment and environmental conditions to induce endogenous JA. Correlation analysis revealed that indole- 3 -carbanol (I 3 C) generated from the hydrolysis of <b>glucobrassicin</b> significantly correlated with QR activity (r = 0. 800, P, 0. 001). Concentrations required to double the specific QR activity (CD values) of I 3 C was calculated at 230 mM, which is considerably weaker at induction than other isothiocyanates like sulforphane. To confirm relationships between GS hydrolysis products and QR activity, a range o...|$|E
40|$|Kales (Brassica oleracea acephala group) are {{important}} vegetable crops in traditional farming {{systems in the}} Iberian Peninsula. They are grown throughout the year to harvest their leaves and flower buds. The glucosinolate content of kales is dependent upon the environmental factors, plant part examined, phenological stage of plant growth, and level of insect damage. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the changes in the total and individual glucosinolate concentrations during plant development and to determine if significant variation of glucosinolate levels can be explained by insect pests attack and other environmental factors in four locations in northwestern Spain. The total glucosinolate concentration in leaves of B. oleracea increased with plant age from seedling to early flowering stages. At that stage, the aliphatic glucosinolate content in leaves of B. oleracea declined drastically over time as the content in the flower buds increased. The highest contents of indolyl glucosinolate (<b>glucobrassicin)</b> and of the aromatic glucosinolate occurred in leaves harvested at the optimum consumption stage while flower buds contained the highest concentration of aliphatic glucosinolates, especially sinigrin. Sinigrin is reported to have anticarcinogenic properties. There appears to be a loss of total and individual glucosinolate concentrations related to pest attack. Leaves damaged by lepidopterous pests contained a lower total glucosinolate content (25. 8 μmol g- 1 dw) than undamaged leaves (41 μmol g- 1 dw). The amounts of sinigrin, glucoiberin, and <b>glucobrassicin</b> were also lowest in insect-damaged leaves. Environmental factors such as soil properties and temperature appear to influence the glucosinolate content in leaves although more research on this subject is needed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Broccoli {{and other}} cruciferous {{vegetables}} contain {{a number of}} bioactive compounds, in particular glucosinolates and polyphenols, which are proposed to confer health benefits to the consumer. Demand for organic crops is at least partly based on a perception that organic crops may contain higher levels of bioactive compounds; however, insufficient research {{has been carried out}} to either support or refute such claims. RESULTS In this study we examined the effect of conventional, organic, and mixed cultivation practices on the content of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and total and individual glucosinolates in two varieties of broccoli grown over 2 years in a split-plot factorial systems comparison trial. Levels of total phenolics and total flavonoids showed a significant year-on-year variation but were not significantly different between organic and conventional production systems. In contrast, levels of the indolyl glucosinolates <b>glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) under fully organic compared to fully conventional management. CONCLUSION Organic cultivation practices resulted in significantly higher levels of <b>glucobrassicin</b> and neoglucobrassicin in broccoli florets; however, other investigated compounds were unaffected by production practices. peer-reviewedThis is the accepted version of the following article: Valverde, J., Reilly, K., Villacreces, S., Gaffney, M., Grant, J. and Brunton, N.

40|$|Glucosinolates are multi-functional plant {{secondary}} metabolites which play a {{vital role}} in plant defence and are, as dietary compounds, important to human health and livestock well-being. Knowledge of the tissue-specific regulation of their biosynthesis and accumulation is essential for plant breeding programs. Here, we report that in Arabidopsis thaliana, glucosinolates are accumulated differentially in specific cells of reproductive organs. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), distribution patterns of three selected compounds, 4 -methylsulfinylbutyl (glucoraphanin), indol- 3 -ylmethyl (<b>glucobrassicin),</b> and 4 -benzoyloxybutyl glucosinolates, were mapped in the tissues of whole flower buds, sepals and siliques. The results show that tissue localization patterns of aliphatic glucosinolate glucoraphanin and 4 -benzoyloxybutyl glucosinolate were similar, but indole glucosinolate <b>glucobrassicin</b> had different localisation, indicating a possible difference in function. The high resolution images obtained by a complementary approach, cryo-SEM Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (cryo-SEM-EDX), confirmed increased concentration of sulphur in areas with elevated amounts of glucosinolates, and allowed identifying the cell types implicated in accumulation of glucosinolates. High concentration of sulphur was found in S-cells adjacent to the phloem in pedicels and siliques, indicating the presence of glucosinolates. Moreover, both MALDI MSI and cryo-SEM-EDX analyses indicated accumulation of glucosinolates in cells on the outer surface of the sepals, suggesting that a layer of glucosinolate-accumulating epidermal cells protects the whole of the developing flower, in addition to the S-cells, which protect the phloem. This research demonstrates the high potential of MALDI MSI for understanding the cell-specific compartmentation of plant metabolites and its regulation...|$|E
