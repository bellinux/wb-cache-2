40|$|ABSTRACT: Ab initio {{calculations}} {{are used}} to determine the basic physical properties of hydrogen adsorption at the N-terminated GaN(0001 ̅) surface. It was shown that the <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> <b>is</b> pinned at the valence band maximum (VBM) for hydrogen coverage θH = 0. 75 ML above which the <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> <b>is</b> shifted to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Application of the electron counting rule (ECR) indicates that for θH = 0. 75 ML, the <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> <b>is</b> not pinned, located in the bandgap. Ab initio calculations confirmed that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> at the surface as predicted and explained earlier (Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 2013, 114, 143705 and Krukowski et al. J. Appl. Phys. 2013, 115, 043529). The adsorption energy contains electron transfer contribution, below θH = 0. 75 ML to VBM and above that coverage to CBM; thus it is ΔEads(H) ≅ 5. 8 eV and ΔEads(H) ≅ 3. 1 eV for a single H atom for these coverage ranges, respectively. Accordingly, the H 2 equilibrium pressure at the GaN(0001 ̅) surface varies from very low for θH 0. 75 ML.

However, it is known that Zn 3 N 2 is sensitive to moisture in air[25], so one expects the formation of a Zn 3 N 2 /ZnO core-shell NW, but not the complete conversion of Zn 3 N 2 into ZnO NWs since we observed peaks that are clearly related to Zn 3 N 2 after exposure to air, as shown in Figure  3.
