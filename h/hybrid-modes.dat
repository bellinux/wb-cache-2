Polarization conversion in reflection appears when <b>hybrid-modes</b> are excited in a guiding structure composed {{of at least one}} anisotropic media. In contrast to a dark dip, in this case modes are associated to a peak in the converted reflectance spectrum, increasing the detection sensitivity and avoiding confusion with reflection dips associated with other processes as can be transmission.

We survey the effect of fishnet metamaterial structural parameters such as the magnetic oscillation strength, magnetic resonance frequency and magnetic damping on the double-negative refractive index frequency region in metamaterials and on the <b>hybrid-modes</b> in slab metamaterial-dielectric waveguides. To identify the robustness of the metamaterials to fluctuations in the metamaterial structural parameters, we investigate the behavior of metamaterials under Gaussian errors on their structural parameters.

This work focuses on the exciton-plasmon coupling between para-Hexaphenylene (p- 6 P) organic nanofibers (ONFs) and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in organic/dielectric/metal systems. We have transferred the organic p- 6 P nanofibers onto a thin silver film covered with a dielectric (silicon dioxide) spacer layer with varying thicknesses. Coupling is investigated by two-photon fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and leakage radiation spectroscopy (LRS). Two-photon excitation allows us to excite the ONFs with near-infrared light and simultaneously avoids direct SPP excitation on the metal layer.

Presented in this thesis are experiments and analyses of small-strain soil-structure vibration problems and large-strain soil-structure rocking behavior. A literature review is presented regarding the relevant bodies of work for both topics followed by two experimental investigations. The first is an investigation of multi-modal, small-strain vibrations of field-scale surface foundations on a natural cohesive soil deposit. For this investigation, the physical aspects of the soil-structure vibrating system, the excitation system, the measurement system, the measurement approach, numerical modeling, and comparison with experimental results are presented. The validity and efficiency of a <b>hybrid-mode</b> vertical-eccentric test is demonstrated via its equivalence to separate modal vertical and lateral-rocking tests. Critical insights from numerous past centrifuge scaled-model studies are verified and extended to this field-scale study. The second is an experimental investigation of large-strain rocking of a field-scale surface foundation resting on a cohesive soil deposit. The physical aspects of the soil-structure rocking system, the measurement system, the various actions imposed on the physical system, and a discussion of the experimental results are presented. The results of the field investigation show that energy may be dissipated at the soil-structure interface by means of soil hysteresis through moment-rotation and horizontal force-horizontal displacement. Rounding of the soil surface was observed due to yielding and plastic deformation of the soil from increased rotational strains. Yielding soil also introduced nonlinearity into the response of the soil-foundation system, which directly influenced the period.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the radiation pattern characteristics of microstrip linear travelling-wave array antennas. Initial experimental investigations indicate that these structures can, in some circumstances, suffer from severe polarisation impurity {{particularly in the}} off-axis planes. These performance limitations have not {{been reported in the}} literature prior to this work, and are not amenable to calculation by existing theories. With the objective of accurate radiation pattern calculation of generalised periodic microstrip travelling-wave array structures, a new, unified, theoretical treatment is developed. This theory is based on a Green's Function formulation in an infinite array environment. In this way, higher order effects such as mutual coupling, surface wave generation and <b>hybrid-mode</b> propagation are included. Additionally, the analysis is structured to enable a wide variety of antenna geometries to be considered. Each non-identical period of a practical array is considered as being in an infinite array of identical periodic geometry. This geometry is then specified in terms of a single period (or "unit cell"). The unit cell geometry of the array to be studied is specified as a set of non-equal rectangular segments whose dimensions and positions are variable. In a numerical implementation of the analysis, this allows the geometry of the antenna to be specified at run-time. Application of the infinite array results to practical, non-infinite structures is discussed, and the resultant radiation patterns calculated via a suitable Green's Function. This theoretical approach is validated by comparison between experimental and predicted results. Very good correlation is obtained although in short (10 wavelength) structures, direct radiation from the transition effects the experimental results. In both the general applicability and the accuracy of the results, the theory appears to be a significant advance in the analysis of this class of radiating structures...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{increasing}} electricity residential consumptions {{and the global}} attention towards GHG emissions, we propose a method to optimally schedule household loads according to CO 2 signals, {{with the aim of}} minimizing the daily equivalent carbon emissions of a single house. Hybrid appliances and the daily thermal load can use electricity imported from the grid, natural gas, or hot water produced in a gas-burning boiler, and, eventually, they can be shifted in time. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, where the variables to be determined are binary and indicate the operation status of the appliances requiring a certain level of power or heat from the different energy carriers in each time step. The results show that the proposed algorithm allows to schedule the household loads by significantly reducing the carbon emissions. When the contribution of renewable sources in the generation mix is low, using multiple energy carriers, namely gas, hot water, and electricity, to supply the household appliances and the thermal load can reduce carbon emissions up to 30 %, on a winter day. On the other hand, windy and sunny days can benefit more from a scheduling mainly based on electricity, although the maximum power importable from the grid can limit the carbon savings. This is a realistic condition for many European countries, such as Italy, where exceeding this limit leads to an automatic load shedding, and France, where users pay a subscription according to their expected maximum power demand. In general, shifting loads in time has a smaller effect; when the <b>hybrid-mode</b> is to be preferred, emission savings are marginally affected by the variability in the dynamic CO 2 -equivalent intensity factor of the electrical grid, as the main energy carriers are hot water and gas, whose emission factor is constant. When the loads are mainly using electricity, shifting their operations in time while fulfilling the user’s preference can reduce the emissions up to around 8 %. Overall, switching from a single-carrier mode to a multi-carriers one and vice versa can successfully enable up to 74 % equivalent CO 2 emissions reduction. The good performance of the software in terms of run-time means that it can be used for modeling a larger group of households, and it is suitable for real-time scheduling. Future works include a more detailed user’s model; in particular, we will include some kind of thermal storage and we will consider the load profiles available on LoadProfileGenerator (Noah Pflugradt), which can simulate the energy demand of several types of German household.|$|R
