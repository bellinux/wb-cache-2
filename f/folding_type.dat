An important feature of this fold, which is characterized by the presence of two domains, appears to be the existence of three clusters of evolutionarily conserved hydrophobic contacts. Although two of these clusters are located in the central cores of the domains and presumably stabilize their scaffold, allowing the correct alignment of the residues involved in cofactor and substrate binding, the role of the third cluster is much less evident. A site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to carry out a model study on the importance of the third cluster in the structure of a well characterized member of the <b>fold</b> <b>type</b> I group, serine hydroxymethyltransferase from Escherichia coli. The experimental results obtained indicated that the cluster plays {{a crucial role in the}} stabilization of the quaternary, native assembly of the enzyme, although it is not located at the subunit interface. The analysis of the crystal structure of serine hydromethyltransferase suggested that this stabilizing effect may be due to the strict structural relation between the cluster and two polypeptide loops, which, in <b>fold</b> <b>type</b> I enzymes, mediate the interactions between the subunits and are involved in cofactor binding, substrate binding and catalysis...|$|R

The number of known three-dimensional structures of pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate-dependent enzymes is rapidly increasing, but only for relatively few have the folding mechanisms been characterized in detail. The dimeric O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from Salmonella typhimurium belongs to the β-family and <b>fold</b> <b>type</b> II group.

For each of the folding classes, an ellipsoid in the multidimensional space was constructed from the 20 -D vectors of amino acid composition of its member proteins according to standard analytical geometry methods. From this representation, an ellipsoid-based scheme is then presented for determining the <b>folding</b> <b>type</b> of a protein {{on the basis of its}} elliptically scaled radial distances from ellipsoid centroids (rather than the conventional Euclidean distances) in a definitive and analytical manner. Among the 132 basis set proteins from which the ellipsoid representa-tions were derived, locations of their individual vectors give correct assignment of the <b>folding</b> <b>type</b> for 127 proteins; this success rate of 96 %, though better than those in previous studies, is established to be the theoretical upper limit only for the basis set proteins.

Based on these data, the frequencies of occurrence of 20 amino acids {{for each of the}} 1490 proteins have been calculated according to the genetic codes. Proteins are generally classified into five folding types, i. e. the [alpha], [beta], [alpha] + [beta], [alpha]/[beta] and [zeta] (irregular) types.

By means of three methods established by different investigators, the <b>folding</b> <b>type</b> for each of the 1490 human proteins has been predicted. It has been demonstrated that the accuracy of prediction for the 1490 human proteins is at least 80 % by examining the predicted results of some structurally known proteins with these methods.

If this is true, why is that the predicted results of the protein <b>folding</b> <b>type</b> from amino acid composition always failed to reach the desired accuracy? An examination of the prediction approach indicates that none of the previous algorithms has ever taken into account the coupling effect among different amino acid components. In view of this, a new algorithm has been developed which distinguishes itself from the previous ones by incorporating such a coupling effect. The very high rates, 99. 2 % and 95. 3 %, of correct predictions thus obtained for a recently constructed training set of 120 proteins and testing set of 64 proteins, respectively, provide confirmation of the above suggestion...|$|E

Results: In this work, we propose a method based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for recognizing proteins belonging to 30 different folds using the occurrence of amino acid residues {{in a set of}} 1612 proteins. The present method could discriminate the globular proteins from 30 major folding types with the sensitivity of 37 %, which is comparable to or better than other methods in the literature.

The present method has several advantages such as, (i) it directly predicts the <b>folding</b> <b>type</b> of a protein without performing pair-wise comparisons, (ii) it can discriminate folds among large number of proteins and (iii) it is very fast to obtain the results.

40|$|According {{to their}} fold, pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate-dependent enzymes are grouped into five superfamilies. <b>Fold</b> <b>Type</b> I easily {{comprises}} {{the largest and}} most investigated group.

Remarkably, the location of the cofactor in the active site, between the two domains that form a single subunit, is almost identical in all members of the group. Nonetheless, <b>Fold</b> <b>Type</b> I enzymes show very little sequence identity, raising the question as to which structural features determine the common fold. An important fold determinant appears to be the presence of three evolutionarily conserved clusters of hydrophobic contacts. A previous investigation, which used Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase, a well characterized <b>Fold</b> <b>Type</b> I member, demonstrated the involvement of one of these clusters in the stability of the quaternary structure. The present study focuses {{on the role of the}} same cluster in the stability of the cofactor binding site. The investigation was carried out by equilibrium denaturation experiments on serine hydroxymethyltransferase forms in which the hydrophobic contact area of the cluster under study was reduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The results obtained show that the mutations clearly affected the process of pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate dissociation induced by urea, reducing the stability of the cofactor binding site.
