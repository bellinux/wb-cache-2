25|$|The Arrow Sport F was {{specifically}} built {{to accommodate the}} low-cost, yet heavy Arrow F V-8 engine, an aircraft modification of the Ford V-8. The engine was designed by Ford Engineer David E. Anderson with an aluminum oil pan, aluminum cylnders, and a 2:1 <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> to drive the prop at reasonable rpm ranges. The engine weighed 402lbs for 85hp vrs 182lbs for an equivalent Continental aircraft engine.|$|E
25|$|The XP-82 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines. Initially, the left engine was a V-1650-23 with a <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> box to allow the left {{propeller}} to turn opposite to the right propeller, which was driven by the more conventional V-1650-25. In this arrangement both propellers would turn upward {{as they approached the}} center wing, which in theory would have allowed better single-engine control. This proved not to be the case when the aircraft refused to become airborne during its first flight attempt. After a month of work North American engineers finally discovered that rotating the propellers to meet in the center on their upward turn created sufficient drag to cancel out all lift from the center wing section, one quarter of the aircraft's total wing surface area. The engines and propellers were then exchanged, with their rotation meeting on the downward turn, and the problem was fully solved. The first XP-82 prototype (44-83886) was completed on 25 May 1945, and made the type's first successful flight on 26 June 1945. This aircraft was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 30 August 1945, whose officials were so impressed by the aircraft, while still in development, that they ordered the first production P-82Bs in March 1945, fully three months before its first flight.|$|E

500|$|When {{these ships}} were designed, the older {{technology}} of reciprocating steam engines was slowly {{being replaced by}} the newer technology of steam turbine propulsion. While turbines generally meant more speed, they were less fuel-efficient and limited {{the range of the}} ships unless more fuel could be stored. Early Dreadnought designs, which were in simultaneous development with the Mississippi class, used primitive direct-drive turbines. The U.S. Navy was slow to fully adopt turbines, and only used them exclusively in battleship production when indirect transmissions became refined (<b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> or turbo-electric). Several subsequent battleship classes were built where otherwise identical vessels had different types of engines (for example, the [...] and es).|$|E
2500|$|First run in 1937, the R-2800 was the United States's first 18-cylinder {{radial engine}} design. The Double Wasp was more {{powerful}} than the world's only other modern eighteen, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442in³ (56.4L). (The American Wright Duplex-Cyclone radial of 3,347in³ (54.86L) was also under development at the time, and promised to be {{more powerful than}} either the P or Gnome-Rhone radials.) The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head {{in such a way that}} the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins. [...] The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> housing and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> housings, on the [...] "outboard" [...] sides of the distributor casings.|$|E
2500|$|The Admiralty ordered 18 LCAs from Messrs. Thornycroft in April 1939. These early boats weighed {{more than}} 9 tons and had flush-decked hulls, an {{armoured}} bulkhead forward that {{wrapped around the}} steering compartment on the starboard side. The steering compartment's armour plates stood about two feet proud of the deck line. In September, 8 more were ordered. Ford V8 marine conversions by Thornycroft powered the early groups of LCAs, these water-cooled petrol engines developing 65 hp each when driving the 19"x14" [...] 2-bladed propellers through a 41:20 <b>gear</b> <b>reduction.</b> The twin propulsion units gave a speed of 10½ knots at 2,800 revolutions per minute with a load of [...] in the boat. Later craft used propellers with three blades.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experience}} of driving an EV1 was unlike a conventional gasoline or diesel vehicle. The EV1's [...] {{was the lowest}} of any production automobile in history, while typical contemporary production cars had a drag coefficient in the range [...] The EV1's clean shape meant it produced less wind noise at highway speeds, providing a more comfortable driving experience for its occupants. At lower speeds, and when stationary, the car produced little to no noise at all, save for a slight whine from the single-speed <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> unit. The car's smooth shape, waterfall tail and rear fender skirts gave it a distinctive appearance. The EV1 had no analog dials, and all instrumentation readouts were displayed in a single thin curved strip mounted high on the dashboard, just underneath the windshield.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, 2 July 2000 in Peyton, Colorado the {{prototype}} and sole example, registered N42915, crashed, killing the designer/builder of the aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board summarized the events: [...] "The pilot was performing a low fly-by over runway 33, {{and as the}} airplane reached the departure end, the engine lost power. Witnesses said that the pilot made a left turn back towards runway 15. Subsequently the airplane hit wires, impacted terrain, cart wheeled, came to rest against a transmission pole, and burned. Post accident examination of the engine revealed that the <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> assembly had failed. The pilot had designed and built the airplane in 1986." [...] The NTSB assigned cause factors: [...] "the pilot's inadequate decision to turn back (low altitude) towards the runway for a forced landing. A contributing factor was the total loss of engine power due to a reduction gear failure." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1954, Fiat {{introduced}} its own experimental turbine-engined prototype, the Turbina.

25|$|Westinghouse then {{developed}} {{steam turbines}} for maritime propulsion. Large turbines were most efficient at about 3,000rpm, while an efficient propeller operated at about 100rpm. That required <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> but building <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> that could operate at high rpm and {{at high power}} was difficult, since a slight misalignment would shake the power train to pieces.
