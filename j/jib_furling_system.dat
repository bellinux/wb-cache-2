5000|$|The jib is {{controlled}} by a jib sheet that runs through a block and cleat with a 2:1 mechanical advantage. Jib traveller and ratchet blocks are optional. A <b>jib</b> <b>furling</b> <b>system</b> is standard.|$|E
50|$|A gennaker sail can be added, but is {{not legal}} for racing. This is usually {{combined}} with a <b>jib</b> <b>furling</b> <b>system.</b> The boat can also be sailed by one person, without a foresail, with a D-PN of 78.7.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} a <b>furling</b> <b>jib</b> is usually {{attributed}} to Major E du Boulay in England who invented a device similar to a roller blind for reefing a jib. Major Wykeham-Martin used one of Boulay's rollers and improved the system by incorporating roller bearings in 1907 when the system was patented. The original castings were made by London-based toilet makers Bouldings. By the 1940s nearly every British cruising yacht was fitted with this <b>furling</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{other common}} type of <b>furling</b> <b>system</b> is for the {{mainsail}}. The mainsail may be furled into the mast or the boom, with boom <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> being simpler and more common. The simplest boom <b>furling</b> <b>system</b> consists of a boom that can rotate along its axis, with a latch to lock it in place. Provision {{must be made to}} allow the mainsail to wrap around the boom without interfering with the mainsheet, such as end-boom sheeting or a bridle. To furl the mainsail, the boom is unlocked, and then rotated to take up the desired amount of mainsail, and then locked in place. More advanced boom <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> will wrap the furling mechanism in a slotted cover, so the sail furls inside the cover; this also makes sheeting easier, since the sheet may be attached to the outer portion of the boom. These systems use either a line, a hand operated crank, or a hydraulic or electric powered furler.|$|R

50|$|Mast <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> {{avoid the}} issues of boom furling, but add their own issues. Mast <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> {{essentially}} eliminate the possibility of battens, as vertical battens are not practical. Without battens, the mainsail must be cut with a hollow leech, like the typical jib, which reduces the sail area. Mast furlers also add mass all {{along the length of}} the mast, raising the center of mass of the boat, which decreases stability.|$|R

50|$|Roller reefing rolls or wraps {{the sail}} around a wire, foil, or spar {{to reduce its}} {{exposure}} to the wind. In mainsail <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> the sail is either wrapped around the boom by a mechanism in the gooseneck or hardware inside the boom winds it around a rotating foil.|$|R
50|$|To be {{successfully}} furled, a sail must be {{flexible enough to}} wrap around a tight radius. Sail stiffening devices such as battens can be accommodated by roller <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> when they lie parallel to the mast; otherwise furling must be stopped at the lowest batten or the battens must be removed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Furling</b> <b>systems</b> {{controlled}} {{with lines}} {{led to the}} cockpit allow reefing without crew having to go on deck in heavy weather. Roller reefing also allows more variable sail area than conventional or jiffy reefing. Countering these advantages are the furled sail possibly not having an optimal shape and sail repair or replacement being more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Parrel beads (also spelled parral or parrell) are {{an element}} of sailing rigging, usually {{deployed}} at the jaws of a gaff on a gaff rigged or gunter rigged craft, or on the tack of a spinnaker rigged over a <b>furled</b> <b>jib.</b>|$|R
50|$|UV {{protection}} {{panels are}} usually {{affixed to the}} leech and foot of roller <b>furling</b> <b>jibs</b> to prevent ultraviolet rays from reaching the sailcloth while the sail is not in use. These are typically a dark color to absorb the harmful rays.|$|R
50|$|The Melges17 is a Bermuda rigged racing scow first {{launched}} in January 2004 by Melges Performance Sailboats. The boat's rig {{consists of a}} main with a large roach, a roller <b>furling</b> <b>jib</b> and an asymmetrical spinnaker {{used in conjunction with}} the retractable bowsprit.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> are for <b>jibs</b> and other headsails. These generally consist of either a plastic pipe or a specially stiffened jib, and a spool {{to hold the}} <b>furling</b> line. The <b>jib</b> {{is attached to the}} furler, and the line is wound around the spool. When the line is pulled, the furler turns, rolling up the jib; when the furling line is released, the jibsheet may be used to unfurl the jib.|$|R
60|$|In a {{short time}} the ship was {{prepared}} to face the worst. The topsails were close-reefed; the topgallant-masts sent down on deck; the spanker and <b>jib</b> were <b>furled,</b> and, soon after, the mainsail and foresail were also furled. The boats were taken in and secured on deck, and the ship went a little more easily through the raging sea; but as {{the violence of the}} gale increased, sail had to be further reduced, and at last everything was taken in except the main spencer and foretopmast-staysail.|$|R

50|$|Murray Scheiner, {{a sailor}} and {{professional}} rigging designer from Great Neck, New York, modernized the <b>furling</b> <b>jib</b> {{in the late}} 1960s. His inspiration came from observing a disabled sailor friend who required several crew members to hoist the jib, preventing him from sailing independently. This invention greatly changed sailing for professionals and leisure sailors alike.|$|R
5000|$|The Sprint 15 is a one-design 15 ft glassfibre sailing catamaran, principally sailed in the UK.

50|$|Mainsail <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular on cruising yachts, {{as they can be}} operated shorthanded and from the cockpit, in most cases. However, the sail can become jammed in the mast or boom slot if not operated correctly. Mainsail furling is almost never used while racing because it results in a less efficient sail profile. The classical slab-reefing method is the most widely used. Mainsail furling has an additional disadvantage in that its complicated gear may somewhat increase weight aloft. However, as the size of the boat increases, the benefits of mainsail roller furling increase dramatically.|$|R

40|$|Furling is the {{dominant}} mechanism for over speed and power control of small wind turbines. In this paper we present a consistent model {{of the dynamics of}} gravity-controlled <b>furling</b> <b>systems</b> based on a Lagrangian formalism. The aerodynamic forces acting on tail vane and rotor have been modeled using Xfoil and blade element momentum (BEM) theory, respectively. Due to the proximity of tail vane and rotor a model of the near-wake generated by the rotor was incorporated into the model, assuming a parabolic wake shape. The different design parameters, such as lever lengths and axis tilt angles, have been studied in a systematic manner and their impact on the wind speed values for entering and leaving the furling regime have been assessed. In {{the first part of the}} study the free-stream in-flow wind speed was fixed at a given value and the system was allowed to reach stable conditions. The steady-state values of the yaw and furling angle were recorded as a function of wind speed both for increasing and decreasing wind speed and the consequences for design choices have been discussed. In the second part, a slow variation of input wind speed was superimposed on the constant wind speed signal and the dynamic response of the system was analyzed. The results of the study are thought to provide an initial roadmap for the design of <b>furling</b> <b>systems.</b> Small wind turbine Furling Xfoil BEM Lagrangian formalism Wake...|$|R
40|$|<b>Furling</b> {{automatic}} <b>system</b> is {{a system}} that uses a combination of gravity and wind speed. This system can avoid the wind turbine damage from high wind speeds. <b>Furling</b> automatic <b>system</b> work based on wind speed, if wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the automatic <b>furling</b> <b>system</b> will work with moving the surface of the blade against the wind direction, so the result the blade surface area (A) which deal with the direction the wind is making wind turbine moves vertical or horizontal. This system uses two methods, vertical system method is by using the hinge spring mounted in the turbine body that moves up and down, when the wind speed exceeds the maximum limit then the system will slow movement of the blade, and method of the horizontal system where using the simple hinge mounted at the tail pivot (shaft tail), when wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the turbine will move horizontally, so that will slow the blade rotation. <b>Furling</b> automatic <b>system</b> has not been widely used in wind turbine, so that its development has not been so widespread, especially in Indonesia which is currently developing wind turbine technology for alternative energy. Benefits of use this system can prevent wind turbine damage caused by excessive wind speeds. Technology used in this system is very efficient because it does not require a complicated design. This system also functions as a controller of the blade rotation rate caused wind speed and used in small-scale wind turbines horizontal axis type. One of the standard horizontal wind turbine blade from the USA is the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA) consists of 25 airfoil design. Selection of the blade type based on blade length and power generators that will be used. This design has been developed since 1984.

50|$|The <b>furling</b> <b>system</b> {{itself is}} very simple in concept. The {{leading edge of the}} sail (luff) to be furled is {{stiffened}} in some way, such as by attaching it to a length of plastic pipe or by sewing in a stiff material such as foam. This stiffened edge serves to spread the force of the furler {{along the edge of the}} sail, so that the sail will furl along its full length. This stiffened edge is then attached to the source of energy for furling, which may be a handle that is turned, a spool containing a line that is pulled, or a motor.|$|R
50|$|The Wanderer has Main and Jib sails; it {{can also}} be fitted with a Spinnaker. Reefing of the main sail is by slab reefing. The jib can be fitted with a roller <b>furling</b> <b>system.</b> The boat has high {{intrinsic}} stability, and the normal wooden centreplate can be replaced with an 38.5 kg steel centre board which makes it even harder to capsize. The relatively light weight of the boat contributes to its ease of launching and recovery. The design allows for fitting of a long shafted outboard motor of up to 3.3 hp. There is very ample storage which includes a waterproof locker for storage of the outboard motor when not in use.|$|R
