5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework <b>for</b> <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

25|$|The {{power of}} twin designs {{arises from the}} fact that twins may be either {{monozygotic}} (identical (MZ): developing from a single fertilized egg and therefore sharing all of their alleles) – or dizygotic (DZ: developing from two fertilized eggs and therefore sharing on average 50% of their polymorphic alleles, the same level of genetic similarity as found in non-twin siblings).

25|$|China {{has begun}} the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program <b>for</b> <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> Moon and is {{investigating}} the prospect of lunar mining, specifically looking for the isotope helium-3 for use as an energy source on Earth. China launched the Chang'e 1 robotic lunar orbiter on October 24, 2007. Originally planned for a one-year mission, the Chang'e 1 mission was very successful and ended up being extended for another four months. On March 1, 2009, Chang'e 1 was intentionally impacted on the lunar surface completing the 16-month mission. On October 1, 2010, China launched the Chang'e 2 lunar orbiter. China landed the rover Chang'e 3 on the Moon on December 14, 2013, became the third country to have done so. Chang'e 3 is the first spacecraft to soft-land on lunar surface since Luna 24 in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Acclaimed for his {{scholarly}} {{works on}} Stalinism {{in general and}} the Romanian communist regime in particular, as well as <b>for</b> <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> impact of nationalism, national communism and neo-Stalinism in the Soviet Union and countries of the Eastern Bloc, Tismăneanu writes from the critical perspective of a civil society supporter. His other influential texts deal with diverse topics such as Cold War history, Kremlinology and the Holocaust. Having moved from a loose Marxist vision, shaped under the influence of neo-Marxist and Western Marxist scholarship, he became a noted proponent of classical liberalism and liberal democracy. This perspective is outlined in both his scientific contributions and volumes dealing with Romania's post-1989 history, the latter of which include collections of essays and several published interviews with literary critic Mircea Mihăieș. Vladimir Tismăneanu completed his award-winning synthesis on Romanian communism, titled Stalinism for All Seasons, in 2003.|$|E
25|$|After {{making a}} {{television}} production: La Matiouette ou l'arrière-pays, (1983), Téchiné returned to critical attention with Rendez-vous (1985), a sexy noir melodrama replete with the seductive {{surface of the}} era. In the film a would-be actress, Nina, fleeing her provincial home for Paris, enters a turbulent love relationship with a sadistic, self-destructive young actor, who caused {{the death of his}} former girlfriend. When the actor himself is killed in an accident, or possible suicide, his former mentor/director, and father of the dead girlfriend, determines to cast the inexperienced Nina as the female lead in 'Romeo and Juliet', a role his deceased daughter played. The film is ultimately a vehicle <b>for</b> <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> violent intensity of certain emotional attachments and their ability to cause one's life to spin off in unexpected directions. By now a key director of the post-New Wave, this film earned Téchiné the Cannes Festival Best Direction Award while helping launch the career of Juliette Binoche.|$|E

25|$|In 1946 Simpson {{developed}} {{a special interest}} in cosmic rays, which very little was known about at the time as the field which was {{still in the process of}} being established, including their origin. Beginning with investigations pertaining to the cosmic ray neutrons in the lower atmosphere, Simpson was there from the beginning developmental phases of the field, and contributed significantly throughout the years to its development with his scientific investigations. Simpson's contributions were unique in that he somehow accomplished his work in a way which boosted the accomplishments and careers of others around him such as graduate students, research associates and other faculty. In 1955 he gave Eugene N. Parker a job as a research associate in the Enrico Fermi Institute of the University of Chicago, and his progress was largely a consequence of Simpson's continued support. His research on cosmic ray neutrons in the lower atmosphere was developed upon its founding by Serge Korff before World War II. Simpson in his research contributed the discovery that the latitude effect seen with neutrons is around 20 times greater than with ionization chambers in 1949. In 1951 he found that the time variations are much greater as well. He had recognized the potential of the neutrons and the lower energy cosmic ray particles <b>for</b> <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> causes of the time variations. That year he also invented the neutron monitor to fulfill the need for a stable ground-based neutron detector. In doing so, he established neutron monitor stations at various locations including Peru, Huancayo, Mexico, Mexico City, New Mexico, Sacramento Peak, Colorado, Climax, and Chicago Illinois.|$|E
