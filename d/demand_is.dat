5|$|On a graph {{with both}} a demand curve and a {{marginal}} revenue curve, demand will be elastic at all quantities where marginal revenue is positive. <b>Demand</b> <b>is</b> unit elastic at the quantity where marginal revenue is zero. <b>Demand</b> <b>is</b> inelastic at every quantity where marginal revenue is negative.|$|E

5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> met by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine how job and home <b>demands</b> <b>are</b> related to {{psychological}} distress in a sample of Japanese working parents with preschool children (n= 196). We expected that job and home <b>demands</b> <b>are</b> partially related to psychological distress through work-to-family conflict (WFC) and family-to-work conflict (FWC), respectively. Structural equation modeling showed that, as expected, home <b>demands</b> <b>were</b> partially related to psychological distress, both directly and indirectly through FWC. In contrast, job <b>demands</b> <b>were</b> only directly related to psychological distress. The differences between the roles of FWC and WFC are discussed using identity theory...|$|R

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user.

In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
