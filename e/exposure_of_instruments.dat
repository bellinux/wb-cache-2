It is {{shown that the}} quadrupole term being proportional to ∼ sin 2 b sin l is non-zero with a probability of 99. 9 %. The occurrence of this anisotropy term is then confirmed by the binomial test even with the probability of 99. 97 %. Hence, the sky distribution of all known gamma-ray bursts is anisotropic. It is also argued that this anisotropy cannot be caused exclusively by instrumental effects due to the nonuniform sky <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> BATSE <b>instrument.</b> Separating the GRBs into short and long subclasses, it is shown that the short ones are distributed anisotropically, but the long ones seem to be distributed still isotropically.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Exposure</b> <b>of</b> the {{anterior}} or lateral lumbar via the retroperitoneal approach easily causes injuries to the lumbar plexus. Lumbar plexus injuries which occur during anterior or transpsoas lumbar spine <b>exposure</b> and placement <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> have been reported. This study aims {{is to provide}} more anatomical data and surgical landmarks in operations concerning the lumbar plexus {{in order to prevent}} lumbar plexus injuries and to increase the possibility of safety in anterior approach lumbar surgery. Methods To study the applied anatomy related to the lumbar plexus of fifteen formaldehyde-preserved cadavers, Five sets of Virtual Human (VH) data set were prepared and used in the study. Three-dimensional (3 D) computerized reconstructions of the lumbar plexus and their adjacent structures were conducted from the VH female data set. Results The order of lumbar nerves is regular. From {{the anterior}} view, lumbar plexus nerves are arranged from medial at L 5 to lateral at L 2. From the lateral view, lumbar nerves are arranged from ventral at L 2 to dorsal at L 5. The angle of each nerve root exiting outward to the corresponding intervertebral foramen increases from L 1 to L 5. The lumbar plexus nerves are observed to be in close contact with transverse processes (TP). All parts of the lumbar plexus were located by sectional anatomy in the dorsal third of the psoas muscle. Thus, access to the psoas major muscle at the ventral 2 / 3 region can safely prevent nerve injuries. 3 D reconstruction of the lumbar plexus based on VCH data can clearly show the relationships between the lumbar plexus and the blood vessels, vertebral body, kidney, and psoas muscle. Conclusion The psoas muscle can be considered as a surgical landmark since incision at the ventral 2 / 3 of the region can prevent lumbar plexus injuries for procedures requiring <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> the lateral anterior of the lumbar. The transverse process can be considered as a landmark and reference in surgical operations by its relative position to the lumbar plexus. 3 D reconstructions of the lumbar plexus based on VCH data provide a virtual morphological basis for anterior lumbar surgery. </p...|$|R

40|$|Ammunition storage spaces on {{naval vessels}} are {{commonly}} fitted with drencher {{systems that are}} designed to prevent ordnance reaching a temperature where it might explode due to fast or slow “cook‐off”. Many of these systems are traditional low pressure water spray systems that are required by the Naval Ship Code and class requirements to deliver water at a rate of between 24 ℓ/m 2 /min and 32 ℓ/m 2 /min. The origin of this requirement is not entirely clear. The high flow rates are a burden on system design and rapid flooding of the magazines decreases the stability of the ship due to free surface effects. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the necessity of high flow rates. In addition, the feasibility of reducing them using a lower flow rate drencher system –if necessary in conjunction with a low pressure water mist system– was investigated. The experiments involved <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> an <b>instrumented</b> steel tube, representing ordnance, to a diesel pool fire located beneath or beside it. The temperature of the tube was monitored prior to, during and after activation of the fire suppression to ensure that it did not exceed a threshold temperature of 200 °C. Flow rates from the drencher system were varied and at lower flows the WMS was activated. For the fire scenarios studied, the results indicated that a flow rate of 32 ℓ/m 2 /min exceeded that required to keep the temperature of the ordnance below 200 oC. At an application rate of 10 ℓ/m² per minute, the installed drencher system suppressed the fire and the kept the temperature of the ordnance below the threshold. A dual system of drencher combined with water mist system was effective at comparable flow rates. The fire however, although controlled, was not fully extinguished in all cases. This study is part of a trilateral research project between Canada, The Netherlands and Sweden designated FiST. Results contribute to defining the way ahead in the process of evaluation of national requirements for fixed fire fighting systems for magazines...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{strengths}} of the proposed study, namely, a relatively large sample size to assess different <b>exposures,</b> use <b>of</b> validated <b>instruments</b> for diet and lifestyle assessment, ascertainment <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> variables via structured interviews, and uniform measurements of clinical and biochemical parameters across case and control groups. Special efforts {{will be made to}} increase response rates and minimise withdrawal of participants. However, some limitations warrant attention. Case–control designs are inherently retrospective in nature, as such they are susceptible to biases. For instance, selection bias may arise if only severely ill patients are recruited and the controls are drawn from a different reference population. For this reason, we will select newly diagnosed (incident) T 2 D patients, while non-diabetic controls are recruited from the outpatient clinics of the same hospital, who are matched to the cases in terms of residential location but are unlikely to share the same risk profiles. Moreover, the hospital serves the entire catchment covering both rural and urban areas of Hanoi, so that our sample of participants should be representative of the underlying adult population. Another potential drawback is recall bias (Armenian 2009), which may lead to spurious associations between exposures and the outcome of interest (Gordis 2000). In this study, a consistent recruitment and interview process is adopted throughout the data collection period and applied to both case and control groups, particularly the use of interviewer-administered questionnaires, which should reduce recall error and bias between the two groups.|$|R
40|$|The {{switching}} of {{the total}} solar irradiance (TSI) backup radiometer (PREMOS-B) to a primary role for 2 weeks {{at the end of}} the PICARD mission provides a unique opportunity to test the fundamental hypothesis of radiometer experiments in space, which is that the sensitivity change <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> due to the space environment is identical for the same instrument type as a function of solar-exposure time <b>of</b> the <b>instruments.</b> We verify this hypothesis for the PREMOS TSI radiometers within the PREMOS experiment on the PICARD mission. We confirm that the sensitivity change <b>of</b> the backup <b>instrument,</b> PREMOS-B, is similar to that of the identically-constructed primary radiometer, PREMOS-A. The extended <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> the backup <b>instrument</b> {{at the end of the}} mission allows for the assessment, with an uncertainty estimate, of the sensitivity change of the primary radiometer from the beginning of the PICARD mission compared to the end, and of the degradation of the backup over the mission. We correct six sets of PREMOS-B observations connecting October 2011 with February 2014, using six ratios from simultaneous PREMOS-A and PREMOS-B exposures during the first days of PREMOS-A operation in 2010. These ratios are then used, without indirect estimates or assumptions, to evaluate the stability of SORCE/TIM and SOHO/VIRGO TSI measurements, which have both operated for more than a decade and now show different trends over the time span of the PICARD mission, namely from 2010 to 2014. We find that by February 2014 relative to October 2011 PREMOS-B supports the SORCE/TIM TSI time evolution, which in May 2014 relative to October 2011 is ~ 0. 11  W m− 2, or ~ 84 ppm, higher than SOHO/VIRGO. Such a divergence between SORCE/TIM and SOHO/VIRGO over this period is a significant fraction of the estimated decline of 0. 2  W m− 2 between the solar minima of 1996 and 2008, and questions the reliability of that estimated trend. Extrapolating the uncertainty indicated by the disagreement of SORCE/TIM and PREMOS with respect to SOHO/VIRGO, we can conclude that it is currently not possible to assess centennial timescale changes in solar irradiance based on any of the presently existing TSI composites. It is imperative to accurately estimate solar irradiance changes from observations in order to extrapolate centennial scale trends important for understanding both long-term solar irradiance changes and the Sun’s influence on the Earth’s climate...|$|R
