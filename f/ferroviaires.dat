500|$|President Ferdinand Marcos {{created the}} Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) on July 12, 1980, {{by virtue of}} Executive Order No.603 giving birth to what was then dubbed the [...] "Metrorail". [...] First Lady Imelda Marcos, then {{governor}} of Metro Manila and minister of human settlements, became its first chairman. [...] Although responsible for {{the operations of the}} LRT-1 and LRT-2, the LRTA primarily confined itself to setting and regulating fares, planning extensions and determining rules and policies, leaving the day-to-day operations to a sister company of Meralco called the Meralco Transit Organization (METRO Inc.). [...] Initial assistance for the project {{came in the form of}} a ₱300million soft loan from the Belgian government, with an additional ₱700million coming from a consortium of companies comprising SA Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi (ACEC) and BN Constructions <b>Ferroviaires</b> et Métalliques (today both part of Bombardier Transportation), Tractionnel Engineering International (TEI) and Transurb Consult (TC). [...] Although expected to pay for itself from revenues within twenty years of the start of operation, it was initially estimated that the system would lose money until at least 1993. For the first year of operation, despite a projected ₱365million in gross revenue, losses of ₱216million were thought likely.|$|E
