She was a teacher and a pianist of some competency. They were married in 1876. In 1881, Stanley was struck with Tuberculosis. His younger brother Solomon Liberty was carried off by the disease the same year at the age of 27. Freelan was luckier. He resolved to lead a less sedentary life and decided upon a career in manufacturing, opening the Stanley Practical <b>Drawing</b> <b>Set</b> factory.

This is contrary to the predictions of the arbitrary mapping hypothesis (Ellis & Lambon-Ralph, 2000) which argue that AoA effects should be stronger for tasks that involve arbitrary mappings between representations than for tasks that involve consistent mappings. Independent ratings were obtained for AoA, frequency, name agreement and object familiarity from Turkish undergraduates for all items in the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) line <b>drawing</b> <b>set.</b> The role of AoA was explored in atypically consistent Turkish in an object and a word naming experiment using the same subset of stimuli.

The target/baffle carrier is a frame mounted on shafts through the target/baffle module. The module provides motion control of the target transverse to the beam by moving the shafts vertically and horizontally. The carrier supplies precision motion control of the target along the beam. When maintenance is required that cannot be done in situ, the entire module with carrier and components still mounted on it is moved to the work cell.

40|$|The term ‘digital drawing’ may imply {{a special}} kind of <b>drawing,</b> <b>set</b> against a natural approach. Previous generations also had to adjust to the new {{technologies}} of the time. Some resisted, some went ahead. New methods present difficulties as well as opportunities. The how-to-draw books of the 1900 ’s show not just one ‘traditional’ approach, but a wide range, and a healthy debate. For the past two centuries such books have here and there discussed both drawing machines, and the connected question of how to draw machines. One way or another the world of drawing will absorb the impact of computers, and it won’t be just as an isolated genre of slightly weird drawing. So it is wrong to exclude ‘digital’ drawing from surveys, to think of this category as distinct from mainstream drawing. Museums have already collected the significant works, and traced the history. The way forward should be to integrate digital tools within the broad spectrum of drawing types. There are no good reasons for not using digital devices, and no good reasons for not using pencils. All the same, I cite three cases where a pencil and paper technique would not be up to the job: football, a drawing jam session, and astronomy...|$|E

They discuss the increased architectural–engineering quality, sustainable advantages, and cost effectiveness of those systems and their application in an exploration and a challenging {{of the limits}} of cross-laminated, panel-and-stud, and post-and-beam timber construction, as compared to traditional buildings. A comparison with the tallest timber residential building in the world, the Stadthaus precedent in east London, provides an appropriate quantitative background for evaluating the decisions made throughout the project, while references to Edward Glaeser's recent study, Triumph of the City, form the theoretical backdrop for a discourse on what potential benefits an adoption of the scheme on an urban scale could have. Particular emphasis is placed on finding methods for obtaining new, avant-garde architectural expressions to simultaneously widen and deepen the current narrow-andshallow canon of multi-storey timber buildings. The final outcome is presented both as diagrams of stacking methods and a full <b>drawing</b> <b>set</b> of the final building examples, with notations describing the structural and constructional applications of the building systems chosen. Furthermore, the paper covers a comprehensive account of how these new modular buildings sit within their architectural context, and how the formal logic underpinning them can be assimilated further and used as the point of departure for future studies.

40|$|On Longing: Undertaking this {{research}} has transformed my practice radically. In {{the past five years}} research only gradually merged with practice. At first, research was something that happened late at night after everyone had left the studio. The process of the PhD however accommodated a major shift changing the nature of my practice allowing a new focus on self-initiated work and for research to become much more integrated. With this work I evaluate the idea of an architectural phenomenology recasting history as the experiential content of speculative architecture. Such work and research is structured by architectures unique mode of intellectuality where the intellectual act cannot be separated from aesthetic experience. Through the course of the PhD my practice (integrating research and practice) nurtured the development of a drawing process, which I describe as a &lsquo;Practice by Replay&rsquo;; very much a protocol for producing architecture through the recollection of history to explore the possibilities of continuing historical experiential spatial qualities in new architectonic constructions. This drawing practice has brought forward a tool through which I can evaluate old work and produce new work as part of a reflective practice. It is at this point (whilst producing such drawings, mostly {{in the second half of}} my PhD) a particular dynamic quality in my practice emerged. Through drawing I find myself engaging with various levels of perception (personal viewing), avoiding post facto representations in favor of using drawing as a primary investigative resource. At the same time I actively use historical archetypical elements in my work to explore aspects of duration freed from historical classification and taxonomy. As such my current practice holds a paradoxical emphasis on the congruence between intuition and tradition. It is this emphasis that drives my current practice in order to produce architecture through a heightened awareness (developed through the research) accommodated by a collapse of time in space. &lsquo;Longing&rsquo; stands for the incorporation of many ideological believes in the pantheon of architectural deities insisting on avoiding moral conflict yet expanding on formal encounter and divergence. Such promise, to gain strength trough a practiced economy of forces, is experienced through <b>drawing,</b> <b>set</b> as a stage exploring theatrical configurations with various levels of preservation. Although this alliance of material form is important the sudden and overwhelming shadows of new and hidden spaces (discovered through a process of subtraction) mark new areas of access, both physically and conceptually.
