5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage <b>distortion,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhombicub{{octahedron}} that, {{while some}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faces are not regular polygons, are still vertex-uniform. Some of {{these can be}} made by taking a cube or octahedron and cutting off the edges, then trimming the corners, so the resulting polyhedron has six square and twelve rectangular faces. These have octahedral symmetry and form a continuous series between the cube and the octahedron, analogous to <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhombicosidodecahedron or <b>the</b> tetrahedral <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuboctahedron. However, the rhombicuboctahedron also has a second set <b>of</b> <b>distortions</b> with six rectangular and sixteen trapezoidal faces, which do not have octahedral symmetry but rather Th symmetry, so they are invariant under the same rotations as the tetrahedron but different reflections.|$|R

5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E

5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{hampered}} by {{problems with the}} 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbine casings after {{a short period of}} service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation. The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
