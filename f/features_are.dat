5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a {{problematic}} grouping when trying to place among hadrosaurines. Many skull <b>features</b> <b>are</b> similar to Edmontosaurus, while other are closer to Gryposaurus, so the group has been classified as close to both. However, the clade might be closer to Edmontosaurus, as the <b>features</b> <b>are</b> more numerous uniting them.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{distinctive}} Hammond organ <b>features</b> <b>are</b> not usually found on other keyboards like the piano or synthesizer. Some {{are similar to}} a pipe organ, but others are unique to the instrument.|$|E
5|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of Aravan's iconography {{is the presence}} of demonic canine teeth. Although the central Koovagam icon does not feature such demonic teeth, they are a regular feature of most Draupadi cult images, where Aravan's demonic <b>features</b> <b>are</b> emphasized.|$|E

Additionally, the engine has been tweaked in both the cars to produce more horsepower.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{the only}} planet known to support life, and its natural <b>features</b> <b>are</b> the subject of many fields of {{scientific}} research. Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; {{it is the largest}} terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic <b>features</b> <b>are</b> its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|For video {{resolutions and}} refresh rates {{up to and}} {{including}} 4K/60 Hz, the Dynamic HDR, Game Mode VRR and eARC <b>features</b> <b>are</b> supported with the existing HDMI cables.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{statistical}} classification of multivariate normal (Gaussian) observations in the subspace of informative <b>features</b> <b>is</b> studied.

40|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} {{for identifying}} five different varieties of rice, using the morphological <b>features</b> <b>is</b> presented. The proposed algorithm consists of several steps: image acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Eighteen morphological <b>features</b> <b>were</b> extracted from rice kernels. The Set of features contained redundant, noisy or even irrelevant information so <b>features</b> <b>were</b> examined by four different algorithms. Finally six <b>features</b> <b>were</b> {{selected as the}} superior ones. A back propagation neural network-based classifier was developed to classify rice varieties. The overall classification accuracy was achieved as 98. 4 %...|$|R

3000|$|The {{number of}} <b>features</b> <b>is</b> {{computed}} for each {{band in the}} GLCM, so {{the total number of}} <b>features</b> <b>is</b> 7 × (4 directions) × 16 bands = 448. However in the case of SSGLDM, the number of features depends on the choice of subset of bands (S). For example, if S contains two bands, the number of <b>features</b> <b>is</b> 7 × (4 directions) × (N [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{congruent}} <b>feature,</b> which <b>is</b> a capability in NASTRAN {{that can}} contribute to significant increases in computational efficiencies, is discussed.
