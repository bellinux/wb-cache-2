2500|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry VI, the Lords {{in parliament}} {{decided that the}} dead King's brothers – John, Duke of Bedford and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester – would have positions of importance {{in the government of}} England as the new King, Henry VI, was a baby on his accession. Bedford would rule as regent in France, whilst Gloucester would be chief councillor (not quite a full protector) [...] in England. Stafford became a member of this regency royal council on its formation. The first representative meeting of the council was held, with Stafford attending, in November 1422. He attended council assiduously for the next three years. By 1424, the rivalry between Gloucester, as Protector, and the Bishop of Winchester, Henry Beaufort, as the de facto head of council had become outright, frequent conflict. Although Stafford probably favoured the interests of Gloucester in the duke's struggle for supremacy over Beaufort in council, the young earl may also have been a moderating influence between them. For example, in October 1425, Stafford, together with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Portuguese Duke of Coimbra, helped to negotiate an end to a burst of violence that had erupted in London between the followers of Gloucester and the Cardinal. However, in 1428, when Gloucester demanded an extension of his authority, Stafford was one of the councillors who personally signed an [...] "outspoken statement" [...] to the effect that Gloucester's position had been formulated six years earlier, and that in any case the King would attain his majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>not-too-distant</b> <b>future.</b> Stafford {{was also one of the}} lords who was chosen by the council to inform Beaufort (who had now been appointed a Cardinal) to absent himself from Windsor until it was decided if he could carry out his traditional duty of Prelate to the Order of the Garter now he had been promoted.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of self-fertilization can mediate pronounced changes in genomes as {{a by-product of}} a drastic reduction in effective population size and the concomitant accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations by genetic drift. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> nematode genus Caenorhabditis, a highly selfing lifestyle has evolved twice independently, thus permitting an opportunity to test {{for the effects of}} mode of reproduction on patterns of molecular evolution on a genomic scale.

The DRG was {{thought of as a}} structure that merely “supported ” physiologic communication between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS). Newer scientific information regarding the anatomic and physiologic changes that occur within the DRG as a result of environmental pressures has dispelled this concept and suggests that the DRG is an active participant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of NP. This new information, alongwith new clinical data showing that stimulation of the DRG reduces intensity of pain, suggests that the DRG can be a robust target for neuromodulation therapies. Methods: A review of the anatomical and physiological literature regarding the role of <b>the</b> DRG <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of NP was performed utilizing SciBase, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The information gathered was used to lay an anatomic and physiologic foundation for establishing the DRG as a relevant target for neuromodulation therapies and to formulate a hypothesis as to how electrical stimulation of the DRG might reverse the process and perception of NP. Conclusions: The DRG is an active participant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of NP. DRG stimulation has multiple effects on the abnormal changes that occur within the DRG as a result of peripheral afferent fiber injury. The sum total of these stimulation effects is to stabilize and decrease hyperexcitability of DRG neurons and thereby decrease NP...|$|R
