5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
25|$|Cuba has {{historically}} – {{both before and}} during Communist rule – performed better than {{other countries in the}} region on infant mortality and life expectancy. <b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> official statistics by the Castro regime should be treated skeptically.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by analysts and media that the S constitutes {{an important part of}} the G-2 relationship between the United States and China. <b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it can promote political trust, constructive engagement, and collaboration between the two countries.|$|E

25|$|Chinese <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the missile}} has the {{potential}} to reach targets 8000km away and that the Indian government had deliberately downplayed the missile's capability in order to avoid causing concern to other countries. The exact range of the Agni-V missile is classified.|$|E
25|$|Polls have {{suggested}} that the economy is the major issue going into this election, especially with the resulting high price of gas, along with rising prices of other goods and services, such as food, and the possible impact the current financial crisis may have on Canada. Some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Canada has just narrowly dodged a recession, although the economy is in its worst shape since 1991.|$|E
25|$|As Finance Minister, Kudrin {{has also}} {{supported}} increasing {{the retirement age}} and cutting down on bureaucracy. For his policies, he has often {{been the target of}} criticism, especially from the United Russia party, which he has refused to join. According to Renaissance Capital, Kudrin's poll ratings are not favourable as he is seen as responsible for some highly criticized welfare reforms, although economic <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the reforms proved to be highly effective.|$|E
50|$|If an <b>expert</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> a {{proposition}} is true, this provides {{a reason for}} tentatively accepting it, {{in the absence of}} stronger reasons to doubt it. But suppose that evidence of financial gain suggests that the expert is biased, for example by evidence showing that he will gain financially from his claim.|$|R

2500|$|Experts differ {{over any}} causal link between child {{pornography}} and child sexual abuse, with some <b>experts</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{it increases the}} risk of child sexual abuse, and others <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> use of child pornography reduces the risk of offending. [...] A 2008 American review of the use of Internet communication to lure children outlines the possible links to actual behaviour regarding the effects of Internet child pornography.|$|R
25|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the {{migration}} of both Bengalis and Burmese (Rohingya) to Pakistan started in the 1980s and continued till 1998. Large scale Rohingya migration to Karachi made Karachi {{one of the largest}} population centres of Rohingyas in the world after Myanmar. The Burmese community of Karachi is spread out over 60 slums in Karachi such as the Burmi Colony in Korangi, Arakanabad, Machchar colony, Bilal colony, Ziaul Haq Colony and Godhra Camp.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{comparisons}} between HFCS and table sugar, {{there is some}} evidence that the overconsumption of added sugar in any form, including HFCS, is a major health problem, especially for onset of obesity. Consuming added sugars, particularly as sweetened soft drinks, is strongly linked to weight gain. The World Health Organization has recommended that people limit their consumption of added sugars to 10% of calories, but <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> typical consumption of empty calories in the United States is nearly twice that level.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh is {{a unitary}} state and {{parliamentary}} democracy. Bangladesh also {{stands out as}} one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. “It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant — though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment — alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world”, said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. <b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.|$|E
5000|$|Business Insider {{reported}} {{that a variety of}} factors made it more likely that Iran's stance would harden once the agreement was in place, with one Iran <b>expert</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Iran's [...] "nice, smiling face" [...] would now disappear as the country pursued more adversarial stances, and policy analysts <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> by negotiating the deal with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Obama had [...] "made an investment in the stability of the IRGC regime".|$|R

25|$|From time to time, new {{vulnerabilities}} {{are discovered}} in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting {{the company to}} issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities {{are a result of}} the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits {{in other parts of the}} PDF viewing software. Security <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> sexting poses {{a serious}} problem, partly because teens do not {{understand}} that the images are permanent and can be spread quickly. [...] "It does not click that what they’re doing is destructive, let alone illegal." [...] "Once they are out there, it spreads like a virus," [...] police say.|$|E
2500|$|The US FDA reports 50,000 health {{problems}} a year due to dietary supplements [...] and these often involve bodybuilding supplements. For example, the [...] "natural" [...] best-seller Craze, 2012's [...] "New Supplement of the Year" [...] by bodybuilding.com, widely sold in {{stores such as}} Walmart and Amazon, was found to contain N,alpha-Diethylphenylethylamine, a methamphetamine analog.

5000|$|The hacker Guccifer 2.0 {{claimed that}} he hacked into the Democratic National Committee {{computer}} network and then leaked its emails to both the newspaper The Hill and the whistleblowing website Wikileaks. [...] "Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, cited <b>experts</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the DNC emails were leaked by the Russians." [...] The press and cybersecurity firms discredited the Guccifer 2.0 claim, as investigators now believe Guccifer 2.0 was {{an agent of the}} G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence service." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{revelation of}} this program caused a {{widespread}} controversy, with legal experts and politicians concluding that it violates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other legal <b>experts</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the FISA law only applied to domestic calls and not to overseas calls and communications that involved a foreign intelligence threat. Bush administration officials such as the Attorney General defended the program by citing {{that this was a}} part of the justification that the Clinton administration used in its warrantless search of Aldrich Ames. They claimed that since Ames was spying for a foreign power, presidential power applied and FISA did not.|$|R
5000|$|One day someone found Gandhi's {{picture and}} Uttam popped a ballon while their father saw who {{believed}} he killed Gandhi, with Uttam replying [...] "Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara" [...] {{while his father}} hit him. Later they go to another doctor named Siddharth (Parvin Dabas) who helps Uttam when he thinks that his house is jail and people poisoned his food because he killed Gandhi. Siddharth eats the food so Uttam knows the food is not poisoned. Later,in court, a gun <b>expert</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> a toy gun (which Uttam believes he killed Gandhi with) cannot kill anyone.|$|R
2500|$|The journal Nature has {{reported}} that the IAEA response to the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan was [...] "sluggish and sometimes confusing", drawing calls for the agency to [...] "take a more proactive role in nuclear safety". But nuclear <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the agency's complicated mandate and the constraints imposed by its member states mean that reforms will not happen quickly or easily, although its INES [...] "emergency scale is very likely to be revisited" [...] given the confusing {{way in which it}} was used in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a regular}} menstrual cycle is not desired, then therapy for an {{irregular}} cycle {{is not necessarily}} required. [...] Most <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> if a menstrual bleed occurs at least every three months, then the endometrium (womb lining) is being shed sufficiently often to prevent {{an increased risk of}} endometrial abnormalities or cancer. If menstruation occurs less often or not at all, some form of progestogen replacement is recommended. An alternative is oral progestogen taken at intervals (e.g., every three months) to induce a predictable menstrual bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|A {{week after}} the storm Army Corps of Engineers project manager Al Naomi gave his {{preliminary}} impression, saying, [...] "One would think it's the barge that did it," [...] and confirming that the barge striking the floodwalls would have [...] "precipitated a tremendous collapse". However, in the preliminary report presented to Congress, <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the barge was drawn through an existing hole in the floodwall, {{and that it was}} the topping of the Industrial Canal floodwall, not the barge, that caused the break. The LSU report subsequently found that overtopping did not occur, rather, design failures precipited the levee failures.|$|E

Chris Hunter, a former bomb disposal expert, described them as [...] "mass produced" [...] and [...] "being wheeled out on an industrial level. You see them everywhere." [...] According to one US group, the number of mines used in Afghanistan had surged by 400% since 2007, matched by a 400% {{increase in the number of}} troops killed by them, and an even higher 700% increase in the number that have been wounded by them.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{reported}} on February 1, 2016, that Brock was still drawing a salary from American Bridge 21st Century, which was legally prohibited from coordinating with the Clinton campaign, while also drawing a salary from Correct the Record, which was [...] "directly {{working with the}} Clinton campaign on Internet-based pushback against the controversies that have dogged her presidential bid." [...] This situation was described as [...] "pushing campaign finance boundaries," [...] with <b>experts</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Brock had found loopholes to circumvent campaign finance restrictions. Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics suggested that Brock was [...] "running a shadow campaign" [...] via a network of groups that Maguire called [...] "the Brocktopus." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jinhui {{claimed that}} Green Dam recognizes pornographic images by {{analyzing}} skin-coloured regions, complemented by human face recognition. However, {{according to a}} Southern Weekly article, the software is incapable of recognizing pictures of nudity featuring black- or red-skinned characters but sensitive enough to images with large patches of yellow that it censors promotional images of the film Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. The article also cited an <b>expert</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the software's misrecognition of [...] "inappropriate contents" [...] in applications including Microsoft Word can lead it to forcefully close those applications without notifying the user, and so cause data losses. [...] On 21 June 2009, Ming Pao reported that the software detected and censored pictures of Chinese political leaders as pornography.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that radiation near another tank was measured at 1.8 Sv/h, 18 times higher than previously thought. [...] TEPCO had initially recorded radiation at about 100 mSv/h, but later admitted that that was because the equipment they were using could only read measurements up to that level. The latest reading came from a more advanced device capable of measuring higher levels. [...] The buildup of water at the site is close to becoming unmanageable and <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> TEPCO will soon be left with {{no choice but to}} release the water into the ocean or evaporate it.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{climate change}} is likely to affect water {{availability}} to Egypt, although the direction of change is uncertain. According to Nahla Abou El-Fotouh of the National Water Research Centre (NWRC) “Some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there will be water increase with more rainfall from the Ethiopian plateau, and some say {{there will be a}} decrease because of water evaporation.".

2500|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Syrian War, the Israeli {{military}} is reportedly preparing itself for potential threats should there be a power vacuum in Syria. [...] "After Assad and after establishing or strengthening their foothold in Syria they are going to move and deflect their effort and attack Israel," [...] an Israeli official told The Associated Press in January 2014. Some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> while the encroaching militant forces on Israel's border will heighten security measures, the advancements are not likely to create significant changes to Israel’s policy disengagement in the Syria crisis. IAF has been suspected of a number of airstrikes on Syrian soil, allegedly targeting Iranian and Hezbollah targets.|$|E
50|$|Members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team (NEST) {{board the}} tugboat {{to defuse the}} bomb. The {{reporter}} and cameraman remain despite pleas from the news anchors in New York City that they leave the area. The NEST team argue about how to bypass McKeeson's many safeguards. As they attempt to defuse the bomb, they realize {{that they have made}} a mistake and have accidentally triggered one of the safeguard devices. At the studio, an <b>expert</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> there are conventional explosives in the device, geared to set up the chain reaction. The members of the NEST work frantically to stabilize the bomb, then begin to panic. One member rushes to leave the ship's hold as two others keep working desperately on the device. Suddenly, static fills the screen as all contact with Charleston is lost.|$|R
50|$|The most common, fear factor, a cyberterrorist {{will create}} fear amongst individuals, groups, or societies. The {{bombing of a}} Bali nightclub in 2002 created fear amongst the foreign {{tourists}} who frequently visited the venue. Once {{the bomb went off}} and casualties ensued, the influx of tourists to Bali significantly reduced due to fear of death. Korstanje Maximiliano argues that cyber-terrorism is not very different than terrorism. Basically, cyber-attacks are aimed at instilling fear in order to impose demands or claims of any type. In view of <b>that,</b> this <b>expert</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> in those societies oriented to ratioanlization and plannification, the probabilities terrorism surfaces are higher than traditional past-oriented communities. What disturbs the social order is that citizens do not know when the next blow will take place, nor where.|$|R
