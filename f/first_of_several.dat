NY32, however, turns north again, beginning the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> concurrencies with US9W.|$|E
5|$|In February 1957, Melbourne {{was sent}} to the Royal Hobart Regatta. Following this, she {{travelled}} to New Zealand, where she participated in exercises with HMNZS Royalist and visited several New Zealand ports. The <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> annual three-month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April, with Melbourne returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier {{spent the rest of the}} year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public. During the visit to Port Adelaide, on 28 October 1957, Melbourne was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV Straat Lanka—the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off Lord Howe Island, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.|$|E
5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans {{called for the}} demolition of many buildings downtown, {{to be replaced by}} a new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E

5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E
5|$|By January 1943, the {{situation}} looked {{very good for}} the Soviet side. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad had weakened the German front. The Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire front, especially in southwestern Russia. Amidst these conditions, Operation Iskra was to become the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> offensive operations aimed at inflicting a decisive defeat on the German Army Group North.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was {{continuing}} its rapid growth {{and began to}} enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> strange fires in the University's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college's first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the university's main building. In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom {{as well as several}} dormitory buildings in 1909.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1958, Kelly {{recorded}} his second album as leader, the quartet Piano, {{more than six}} years after his first. In the same year, he played for recordings led by, among others, vocalist Betty Carter, and made the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> appearances on albums led by Cannonball Adderley, Blue Mitchell, and Hank Mobley. Kelly also played organ on one track of Pepper Adams and Jimmy Knepper's The Pepper-Knepper Quintet, an unusual departure from his usual instrument.|$|E
5|$|Early in life, Breathitt was {{appointed}} a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory.

Although his running mate William T. Barry lost the office of governor to Thomas Metcalfe, Breathitt defeated his opponent for lieutenant governor.|$|E

Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Following the American {{declaration}} of war on Germany, on 6 April 1917, I Corps was organized and activated on 15–20 January 1918, in the National Army in Neufchâteau, France, the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> corps-sized formations intended to command divisions of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War I. Assisted by the French XXXII Corps, the headquarters was organized and trained; on 20 January, Major General Hunter Liggett took command.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Danielle was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> Cape Verde-type {{hurricane}}s to form {{during the}} 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Danielle {{was the fourth}} named storm and third hurricane of the season. Danielle formed on August13, 2004 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean and remained over the central Atlantic, peaking as a strong Category 2 hurricane on August16. Reaching cooler waters, Danielle began to weaken, becoming a remnant low on August21 and dissipating on August24. Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made a northerly turn. As a result, there was no impact caused by the storm.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E
5|$|In 1221 Llywelyn {{took control}} of {{neighbouring}} Meirionnydd from his son, Gruffydd; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there, but {{the father and son}} had fallen out. The prince then began to build the castle of Castell y Bere with the intent of controlling the local population and securing his new south-west border, which included the mountain trade routes between Gwynedd, Powys Wenwynwyn and Deheubarth. Castell y Bere was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> stone castles built by Llywelyn and the initial castle consisted of several towers positioned around a courtyard, situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris.|$|E

5|$|In 1244, Alexander {{made the}} <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> {{attempts}} by Scottish monarchs {{to purchase the}} Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's expulsion from the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a full-scale summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, {{and it was not}} until the 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season at Massillon, Brown's team posted a 5–4–1 record, better than the {{previous}} year but far from Brown's exacting standards. The Tigers improved again in 1933, ending with an 8–2 record but losing to their chief rivals, the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs. In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21–6 defeat to Canton in {{the final game of}} the season. As the pressure on Brown grew to turn the tables on Canton, Massillon finally accomplished the feat the following year in an undefeated season, the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> with Brown at the helm.|$|E
