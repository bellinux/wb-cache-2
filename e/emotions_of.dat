5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E
40|$|Psychological {{interrelation}} {{between the}} base odors (according to Amoore) and the base emotional states {{of human beings}} (according to Ekman) is established. The subjects were offered samples of the basic odors. Their task was to associate these odors {{with one of the}} proposed basic <b>emotions.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> variance showed the significant association of putrid odor with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> disgust, the odor of mint with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> surprise, and the odor of musk with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> anger. Other odors can cause two or three emotions. Based on the theoretical analysis, the article proposes to associate flowery odor with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> joy, the odor of fruit with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> pleasure, the pungent odor with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> fear, and the odor of camphor with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> sadness. Hypothesis of the existence of olfactory-emotional language allowing to create the emotional tone of the odor of any object, is offered...|$|R

5|$|Evangelion is an apocalyptic anime, set in {{a futuristic}} Tokyo fifteen years after a {{worldwide}} cataclysm. The story centers on Shinji, a teenage boy who is recruited by his father into the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha called Evangelion in combat against monstrous beings known as Angels. The series explores the experiences and <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv {{as they attempt to}} prevent another catastrophe.

5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
5|$|Who We Are is {{the fourth}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band Lifehouse. It was first released via compact disc in the United States on June18,2007 by Geffen Records. It was released via digital download the next day on June19,2007. The band entered the studio without any demos recorded and only had lyrics from Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. The songs on the album were mostly inspired by different <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> love, bliss, struggles, and pain. Musically, the album {{is a combination of}} rock, alternative, and adult alternative.|$|E
40|$|Although both {{auditory}} {{and visual}} information {{can influence the}} perceived <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> an individual, how these modalities contribute to the perceived <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> a crowd of characters was hitherto unknown. Here, we manipulated the ambiguity <b>of</b> the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> either a visual or auditory crowd of characters by varying the proportions of characters expressing one of two emotional states. Using an intersensory bias paradigm, unambiguous emotional information from an unattended modality was presented while participants determined the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> a crowd in an attended, but different, modality. We found that emotional information in an unattended modality can disambiguate the perceived <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> a crowd. Moreover, {{the size of the}} crowd had little effect on these crossmodal influences. The role of audiovisual information appears to be similar in perceiving emotion from individuals or crowds. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of multisensory influences on the perception of social information from crowds of individuals...|$|R

5000|$|In Shand's view, the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> sorrow, {{which he}} classifies {{as a primary}} emotion, has two impulses: to cling to the object of sorrow, and to repair the {{injuries}} done to that object that caused the emotion in the first place. Thus the primary <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> sorrow {{is the basis for}} the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> pity, which Shand describes as a fusion of sorrow and joy: sorrow at the injury done to the object of pity, and joy as an [...] "element of sweetness" [...] tinging that sorrow.|$|R
5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> using {{facial expressions}} reveals slight gender differences {{based on the}} definition and boundaries (essentially, the “edge line” where one emotion ends and a subsequent <b>emotion</b> begins) <b>of</b> the categories. The <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> anger is perceived easier and quicker when it is displayed by males. However, the same effects are seen in the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> happiness when portrayed by women.

Veigue begins to have difficulty {{in dealing with}} Claire's condition, and his cold attitude causes her to leave with Milhaust. Eventually, Veigue opens up {{to the rest of}} the group and overcomes his difficulties. As the continuing negative feelings of Karegia's population are starting to damage the world, the group decide to revive Georgyas again and bring him round to their way of thinking. At Geyorkias' resting place, Zilva appears and reveals herself as the mastermind behind the incidents, declaring that she will use Geyorkias to destroy the Humas and create a Gajuma-ruled kingdom. After her defeat, the party revive Geyorkias: he in turn reveals that the force influencing Zilva and spreading hatred was in fact Yuris, and that Yuris has become a threat to the world. The group travel to confront Yuris, but are initially sapped of strength by its negative emotions. The growing positive <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> the people of Karegia as the racial disputes fade give them the strength to destroy Yuris' core. Agarte then recovers her Force, returns herself and Claire to their original bodies, and summons the Sacred Beasts to destroy Yuris. The effort costs Agarte her life, and she leaves Karegia in Milhaust's charge and reveals her love for him before dying. The group then go their separate ways to resolve the remaining conflicts in the land.|$|E
5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> players instead.|$|E

Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds its location for himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat before merging with Kida. Rourke and the mercenaries lock Kida in a crate and prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates his friends for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> the Atlanteans and provides power, protection, and longevity in return. It will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted {{to use it as a}} weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Encouraged by Sweet, Milo rallies the crew, and the Atlanteans to stop Rourke.|$|E
