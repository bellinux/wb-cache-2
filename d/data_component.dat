Not only are uncertainties in individual <b>data</b> <b>components</b> characterized, but also comparative influence of those <b>data</b> <b>components</b> {{in the overall}} computation of yield. The two most influential <b>data</b> <b>components</b> identified through this analysis are: 1) existing reservoir capacity for community systems that use reservoir storage and 2) streamflow characteristics during drought, both for determining availability of flow for direct withdrawals from those streams as well as determining the cumulative amount of water that flows into or can be pumped to reservoirs. Additional uncertainties from climate data (precipitation and evaporation) are considerably less influential in yield estimation. Data needs for estimating surface water system yields are identified {{not only by the}} uncertainties in and influences of various <b>data</b> <b>components,</b> but also are prioritized by cost and timeline for obtaining data and the expected likelihood that additional data noticeably could affect conclusions regarding drought vulnerability of individual systems.

Communities of {{interest}} (COIs) are collaborative groups of users who exchange information {{in pursuit of}} shared goals, interests, missions, or business processes and who therefore must have a shared vocabulary for the information they exchange. COIs reuse <b>data</b> <b>components</b> and artifacts found in NIEM to document their information exchanges. One or more COIs can coordinate to develop new domain content as they identify gaps in the <b>data</b> <b>components</b> needed for documenting information exchanges.|$|R

50|$|Specialization is {{used when}} a base object class (type) {{contains}} {{or can be}} subcategorized into a more specific subclass. When this can be done, the subclass derived from the base class inherits {{the properties of the}} more general base or parent class. This mechanism is used to share or reuse properties between the general <b>data</b> <b>component</b> and its specialization. For example, a vehicle type (or class) is identified as a <b>data</b> <b>component</b> with properties of vehicle identification number (VIN), make, and model. Truck type (or class) is a specialization of vehicle and thus inherits the vehicle's properties but also has its own characteristic properties, such as truck bed length. Specialization is time independent and is generally used only when the base class and subclass always exist.|$|E

50|$|A Key Sequenced Data Set (KSDS) {{is a type}} of {{data set}} used by the IBM VSAM {{computer}} data storage system. Each record in a KSDS data file is embedded with a unique key. A KSDS consists of two parts, the <b>data</b> <b>component</b> and a separate index file known as the index component which allows the system to physically locate the record in the data file by its key value. Together, the data and index components are called a cluster.|$|E
5000|$|While data {{dictionaries}} {{define the}} vocabulary utilized by the GJXDM to transmit IEPs, {{the relationships between}} the different <b>data</b> <b>components</b> need to be defined in order for the data to be interpreted correctly.

Twice a year volunteers collect nutrient samples for analysis of total phosphorus, nitrate and nitrite, ammonia, chloride, sulfate, and total suspended solids.

50|$|Domains. For {{purposes}} of NIEM, a domain {{refers to a}} business enterprise broadly reflecting the agencies, units of government, operational functions, services, and information systems which are organized or affiliated to meet common objectives. NIEM domains are organized to facilitate governance, and each has some measure of persistency. Each domain traditionally includes a cohesive group of data stewards who are subject matter experts (SMEs), have some level of authority within the domains they represent, {{and participate in the}} processes related to harmonizing conflicts and resolving <b>data</b> <b>component</b> ambiguities.|$|E
50|$|Data Components. The {{fundamental}} {{building block}} of NIEM is the <b>data</b> <b>component.</b> Data components {{are the basic}} business data elements that represent real-world objects and concepts. Information exchanged between agencies {{can be broken down}} into individual components - for example, information about people, places, material things, and events. Components that are frequently and uniformly used in practice are specified in NIEM and can then be reused by practitioners for information exchanges, regardless of the nature of their business or the operational context of their exchanges, provided they are semantically consistent.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main reason}} for {{applying}} masking to a data field is to protect data that is classified as personal identifiable data, personal sensitive data or commercially sensitive data, however the data must remain usable {{for the purposes of}} undertaking valid test cycles. It must also look real and appear consistent. It is more common to have masking applied to data that is represented outside of a corporate production system. In other words, where data is needed for the purpose of application development, building program extensions and conducting various test cycles. It is common practice in enterprise computing to take data from the production systems to fill the <b>data</b> <b>component,</b> required for these non-production environments. However the practice is not always restricted to non-production environments.

40|$|Energy {{efficient}} architecture {{research has}} flourished recently, {{in an attempt}} to address packaging and cooling concerns of current microprocessor designs, as well as battery life for mobile computers. Moreover, architects have become increasingly concerned with the complexity of their designs in the face of scalability, verification, and manufacturing concerns. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a high performance, energy and complexity efficient front-end prefetch architecture. This design, called Serial Prefetching, combines a high fetch bandwidth branch prediction and efficient instruction prefetching architecture with a low-energy instruction cache. Serial Prefetching explores the benefit of decoupling the tag component of the cache from the <b>data</b> <b>component.</b> Cache blocks are first verified by the tag component of the cache, and then the accesses are put into a queue to be consumed by the <b>data</b> <b>component</b> of the instruction cache. Energy is saved by only accessing the correct way of the <b>data</b> <b>component</b> specified by the tag lookup in a previous cycle. The tag component does not stall on a I-cache miss, only the <b>data</b> <b>component.</b> The accesses that miss in the tag component are speculatively brought in from lower levels of the memory hierarchy. This in effect performs a prefetch, while the access migrates through the queue to be consumed by the <b>data</b> <b>component...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} development and proof of concept of a TeleGeoMonitoring (TGM) system for spatially monitoring and analyzing, in real-time, data derived from vehicle-mounted sensors. In response to the concern for vibration related injuries experienced by equipment operators in surface mining and construction operations, the prototype TGM system focuses on spatially monitoring vehicle vibration in real-time. The TGM vibration system consists of 3 components: (1) <b>Data</b> Acquisition <b>Component,</b> (2) <b>Data</b> Transfer <b>Component,</b> and (3) <b>Data</b> Analysis <b>Component.</b> A GPS receiver, laptop PC, data acquisition hardware, triaxial accelerometer, and client software make up the <b>Data</b> Acquisition <b>Component.</b> The <b>Data</b> Transfer <b>Component</b> consists of a wireless data network and a data server.

This tree-dependent component analysis framework leads naturally to an efficient general multivariate density estimation technique where only bivariate density estimation needs to be performed. ...|$|R
