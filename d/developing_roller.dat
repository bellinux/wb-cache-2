40|$|International audiencePhysically {{correct and}} {{realistic}} visual appearance rendering or analysis of material surface visual properties require complex descriptive models capable of modelling material dependence on variable illumination and viewing conditions. The recent most advanced representation of visual properties of surface materials is a Bidirectional texture function (BTF). BTF is 7 D function of planar coordinates, spectral coordinate, and viewing and illumination angles, respectively. Unlike smooth textures, it specifies their altering appearance due to varying illumination and viewing conditions. This BTF visual appearance dependency on viewing and illumination conditions significantly complicates not only its acquisition, representation, and modelling but also makes its rendering noticeably more demanding. BTF textures are acquired by costly measurements of real materials and their subsequent nontrivial processing. While several techniques for measurement or processing of BTF textures {{have been described}} already, there is no environment allowing BTF texture rendering.

Surface finishing and deterministic microstructuring {{have been shown to}} be effective methods in improving the tribological properties of sliding contacts such as bearings and cylinder liners. This is due to their acting as micro pressure-chambers and as wear debris traps.

The material combination bronze against steel as typically used in powertrain applications was investigated. The surface structures where machined using electrochemical machining by closed electrolytic free jet (Jet-ECM). It was determined that microstructuring reduced the friction coefficient by up to 45 % in the hydrodynamic regime under loads and speeds found in automotive components.

40|$|AbstractSingle point {{incremental}} forming (SPIF) is {{a highly}} versatile and flexible process for rapid manufacturing of complex sheet metal parts. In the SPIF process, a ball nose tool moves along a predefined tool path to form the sheet to desired shapes. Due to its unique ability in local deformation of sheet metal, the friction condition between the tool and sheet {{plays a significant role}} in material deformation. The effects of friction on surface finish, forming load, material deformation and formability are studied using a newly <b>developed</b> oblique <b>roller</b> ball (ORB) tool. Four grades of aluminum sheet including AA 1100, AA 2024, AA 5052 and AA 6111 are employed in the experiments. The material deformation under both the ORB tool and conventional rigid tool are studied by drilling a small hole in the sheet. The experimental results suggest that by reducing the friction resistance using the ORB tool, better surface quality, reduced forming load, smaller through-the-thickness-shear and higher formability can be achieved. To obtain {{a better understanding of the}} frictional effect, an analytical model is developed based on the analysis of the stress state in the SPIF deformation zone. Using the developed model, an explicit relationship between the stress state and forming parameters is established. The experimental observations are in good agreement with the developed model. The model can also be used to explain two contrary effects of friction and corresponding through-the-thickness-shear: increase of friction would potentially enhance the forming stability and suppress the necking; however, increase of friction would also increase the stress triaxiality and decrease the formability. The final role of the friction effect depends on the significance of each effect in SPIF process...|$|R

When this system was used to examine invasive properties of Yersinia enterocolitica, it resulted in rapid internalization of high numbers of bacteria during the infection phase which prevented subsequent discrimination of intracellular multiplication. A modified procedure was developed which standardized the ratio of bacteria to HeLa cells (i. e., multiplicity), the time for the infection phase, and the addition of specific antiserum with gentamicin for restricting bacterial uptake during the intracellular growth phase. Studies with this modified chamber slide system found that strains of human isolates of Y. enterocolitica (serotypes O: 3, O: 8, O: 5, 27, and O: 6, 30) exhibited different degrees of cell infection but did not multiply intracellularly.

Roller energy production {{is included in}} the energy flux balance equation to predict rms wave height for randomly varying, irregular waves over arbitrary bathymetry. The dissipation function is defined using wave roller theory, where the area of the roller is defined from a simple bore analogy. The Rayleigh distribution is used to statistically describe wave heights as waves shoal, break, and dissipate. Model predictions are compared with data acquired on both barred and near planar beaches. The surface roller wave height transformation model predicts rms wave heights with an average rms error of 6. 5 % for a barred beach over three days, 3. 0 % for two planar beaches over four days, and 4. 5 % average error for all locations over seven days. The model has two free parameters, alpha representing the type of breaker and gamma a measure of breaking wave saturation, also a function of beach slope. Optimal values of both parameters are chosen by model fitting. The model is sensitive to gamma, but not sigma.

In this study, the improving performance of the badminton machine with the two <b>rollers</b> <b>developed</b> by the author is examined. Finite element models of a feather shuttlecock and the badminton machine with two rollers are made, and the projection simulations proceed with the moving behavior and contact stress of the shuttlecock. The coefficient of friction is examined from the surfaces {{in contact with the}} shuttlecock and the roller in the analysis. From the results of analysis, it is found that the roller with a large diameter attains the higher speed of the shuttlecock than the small rollers for every project. The taper angles of the roller edge and the insert height of the shuttlecock relative to the roller surface are optimized for attaining the maximum shuttle speed by the projection simulation and the response surface approach. In the results of the optimization, the performance of the machine has been improved as the shuttle speeds increased by about 7 % and the stress causing the shuttle deterioration decreased.

On the issue of micropattern fabrication, traditional photolithography processes are prone to destroy or contaminate the related bioactive molecules; the popular microcontact printing processis limited to transfer small molecules and proteins by self-assembling them on a substrate. In the study, a new process for polymer transfer by soft lithography was developed to transfer bioactive natural polymers onto a flat substrate or a micropatterned platform. There are two steps were employed to diminish the heterogeneity of features and shrinkage of linewidths and increase the completeness of transfer: the O 2 plasma was employed to activate the PDMS stamp surfaces, and also the phospholipid as a transfer layer was used to increase the adsorption of hydrophilic polymers. On the purpose of fabricating a single-celled sensing electrode, the polymer transfer was required to modify the cell platform surfaces for cell attachment. We <b>developed</b> a <b>roller</b> imprint process to transfer hydrophilic bioactive polymers on a micropatterned platform. SEM and AFM were utilized to observe the transferred thin films lying on the platform (about 350 nm thick). SEM-EDX and ESCA were also used to inspect the composition differences between the convex and concave parts of the platform, ensuring the transfer of bioactive polymers. It is successful to transfer some bioactive natural polymers [...] chitosan, gelatin, hyaluronan and alginate. As for the cell-rejecting layer on the concave of platform, a self-assembled monolayer was formed by grafting PEG oligomer to prevent cell attachment. Therefore, a platform with cell-rejecting and cell-adhesive areas was performed to guide single cell’s attachment and growth. Cell attachment tests were performed to explore the relationship between cells and aterial compositions and the shapes of patterns. For these tried polymers, gelatin was found to present a better environment for cell attachment.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) uses a roller-based {{mechanism}} for {{positioning of the}} solar arrays. The forces and moments that <b>develop</b> at the <b>roller</b> interfaces {{are influenced by the}} design including the kinematic constraints and the lubrication condition. To help understand the SARJ operation, a set of dedicated experiments were completed using roller pairs. Of primary interest was to measure the axial force directed along the axis of rotation of the roller as a function of shaft misalignment. The conditions studied included dry and clean surfaces; one surface plated by a gold film, and greased surfaces. For the case of a bare 440 C roller against a nitrided 15 - 5 roller without lubrication, the axial force can be as great as 0. 4 times the normal load for a shaft angle of 0. 5 deg. Such a magnitude of force on a roller in the SARJ mechanism would cause roller tipping and contact pressures much greater than anticipated by the designers. For the case of a bare 440 C roller against a nitrided 15 - 5 roller with grease lubrication, the axial force does not exceed about 0. 15 times the normal load even for the largest misalignment angles tested. Gold films provided good lubrication for the short duration testing reported herein. Grease lubrication limited the magnitude of the axial force to even smaller magnitudes than was achieved with the gold films. The experiments demonstrate the critical role of good lubrication for the SARJ mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Sheet metal {{spinning}} {{is one of}} the metal forming processes, where a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank onto a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. Over the last few decades, sheet {{metal spinning}} has developed significantly and spun products have been widely used in various industries. Although the spinning process has already been known for centuries, the process design still highly relies on experienced spinners using trial-and-error. Challenges remain to achieve high product dimensional accuracy and prevent material failures. This PhD project aims to gain insight into the material deformation and wrinkling failure mechanics in the conventional spinning process by employing experimental and numerical methods. In this study, a tool compensation technique has been proposed and used to <b>develop</b> CNC multiple <b>roller</b> path (passes). 3 -D elastic-plastic Finite Element (FE) models have been developed to analyse the material deformation and wrinkling failure of the spinning process. By combining these two techniques in the process design, the time and materials wasted by using the trial-and-error could be decreased significantly. In addition, it may provide a practical approach of standardised operation for the spinning industry and thus improve the product quality, process repeatability and production efficiency. Furthermore, effects of process parameters, e. g. roller path profiles, feed rate and spindle speed, on the variations of tool forces, stresses, strains, wall thickness and wrinkling failures have also been investigated. Using a concave roller path produces high tool forces, stresses and reduction of wall thickness. Conversely, low tool forces, stresses and wall thinning have been obtained in the FE model which uses the convex roller path. High feed ratios help to maintain original blank thickness but also lead to material failures and rough surface finish. Thus it is necessary to find a “trade off” feed ratio for a spinning process design...|$|R
40|$|In {{respect of}} {{autogenous}} and drying shrinkage {{and the effects}} of relaxation creep during the hydration cycle, roller compacted concrete in dams has to date been universally assumed to behave {{in the same manner as}} conventional mass concrete, despite notional evidence to the contrary on prototype dam structures, particularly in respect of high-paste RCC. While the results of laboratory materials testing and associated early behaviour analyses for RCC have been published, no conclusive example exists in the public domain whereby predicted behaviour is confirmed through measured behaviour on a comprehensively-instrumented prototype dam structure. In his PhD thesis, Quentin Shaw presents evidence to indicate that the early behaviour of RCC, and particularly high quality, high-paste RCC in dams, is quite different to that of CVC. Referring to instrumentation records from Wolwedans and Knellpoort dams in South Africa, Çine Dam in Turkey, Wadi Dayqah Dam in Oman and Changuinola 1 Dam in Panama, indications of less than expected shrinkage and stress relaxation creep during the hydration cycle in the constituent RCC are documented. Taking the comprehensively-instrumented and monitored Wolwedans Dam, the actual materials behaviour of the constituent RCC is evaluated through the replication of the prototype behaviour on a finite element model. Through this analysis, it is clearly demonstrated that the level of shrinkage and stress relaxation creep that would be traditionally assumed in RCC simply did not occur. In fact, the analyses suggested that no shrinkage, or creep was apparent. The reasons for the different behaviour of high-paste RCC compared to CVC are subsequently explored. With Wadi Dayqah Dam as the only example evaluated where some drying shrinkage and/or stress relaxation creep was obviously apparent, the evident susceptibility of this lean RCC mix, with a high w/c ratio, a high content of non-cementitious fines, natural gravel aggregates, a high aggregate water absorption and placement in a very dry environment, is noted. However, it is considered to be the combination of a strong aggregate skeletal structure <b>developed</b> through <b>roller</b> compaction and a low w/c ratio that results in a particularly resilience in high-paste RCC to early shrinkage and creep. It is also recognised that temperature and gravity effects in an arch dam structure will tend to limit, or even eliminate containment stresses in the critical load-carrying upper section and that this will reduce the risk and impact of stress relaxation creep. Consequently, a new understanding of the early behaviour of RCC in large dams is presented, suggesting that a high quality RCC mix in an arch dam can be designed for a cumulative shrinkage and stress relaxation creep under the hydration cycle of approximately 20 microstrain, compared with a more traditionally accepted value of between 125 and 200 microstrain. The implications of these findings on the design of large RCC dams are demonstrated to be significant, particularly in respect of RCC arch dams. In addition, suggestions are made for the requirements in respect of RCC mix design for negligible shrinkage and creep, while an approach to combine the use of field measurement with structural modelling to predict and demonstrate actual RCC behaviour is briefly discussed.
