5|$|During a gig with a {{stand-in}} drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>times,</b> but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|The present Sultanate of Terengganu was {{established}} in the 1708. The first Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Zainal Abidin I established his court near Kuala Berang, then he moved his court a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> until he settled near Bukit Keledang, Kuala Terengganu. During the early 18th century, Kuala Terengganu was still a small town. It was described as having about one thousand houses that were scattered around the town. The Chinese were already present in Kuala Terengganu at that time. Half of the population were Chinese and they were engaged in agriculture and trading. After the death of Sultan Daud in 1831, a brief civil war erupted between two claimants to the throne, namely Tengku Mansur and Tengku Omar. Tengku Omar was based at Bukit Puteri while Tengku Mansur was based at Balik Bukit. Tengku Omar was defeated by Tengku Mansur and he fled from Terengganu. Tengku Mansur became the next Sultan as Sultan Mansur II. His son, Sultan Muhammad succeeded him as the next Sultan after his death in 1837. However, in 1839, Tengku Omar returned to Terengganu with his entourage to reclaim the throne. He defeated Sultan Muhammad and forced Sultan Muhammad to flee. Tengku Omar reoccupied his fort at Bukit Puteri and was throned as the next Sultan, Sultan Omar.|$|E

This brought him one final List A appearance, in the 1995 NatWest Trophy against Durham; although Herefordshire were crushed by 207 runs, he dismissed two Test cricketers in John Morris and Manoj Prabhakar. Jarvis also appeared in that year's MCC Trophy final, but took only one wicket as Herefordshire lost by two wickets to Cambridgeshire.|$|E

Pook then used pliers to extract two of her teeth, which police later found at his house [...] "like some kind of macabre trophy." [...] Dudson said: [...] "I was stood at the doorway with Jeanie [...] and Bernie [...] Cliff [...] took her gag off. He told her to open her mouth. He said: 'Right, I'm going to rip your teeth out'.

500|$|Early on {{the second}} day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the {{opposition}} wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire Charlie Elliott and his batting partner John Edrich. As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, [...] "Well played—my God you're going to cause some problems." [...] D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>times</b> after passing three figures. He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, and congratulations from John Gleeson, one of the opposing Australians. Oborne assesses the innings {{as one of the}} best ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him. Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for Derek Underwood to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was then}} {{confirmed}} {{to play against}} England at Swansea on 12 January in a team much changed from that which was beaten by South Africa the previous month. The London Express commented that neither he nor Maddock on the other wing, had much merit, but were selected {{for a lack of}} choice, the whole team being unexceptional. Welsh spectators, expecting defeat {{at the hands of the}} English, stayed away from the game, and only 5,000 turned out, a record low for international rugby in Wales. But the headline in the 'Pink Edition' of the Evening Express read [...] "St George Routed", as Wales beat England 22–0. Right from the start, the Welshmen seemed up to the task. An early try-scoring opportunity was lost when Gabe was tackled and unable to make the pass to Williams, who was in the clear. Wales came close to scoring a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>times,</b> until Gabe receiving the ball from Trew, timed his pass perfectly to Williams, and he scored in the corner. Most of the play till this point had been in England's 25, but when the English broke out, Williams' defensive play was called into action. At half time, with further tries from Gibbs and Maddock, the Welsh were leading 13–0. England started the second half well but, after a long period in the Welsh half, Wales got an attacking opportunity, and Gabe, receiving the ball from Trew, beat his opposite number, and passed to Williams, who scored a second try in the corner. Maddock and Brown then scored two more tries, for a total of six to Wales.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − The paper {{presents}} a new method of anticor-rosion coatings diagnostics using bilinear transformation. It {{is possible to}} identify {{the parameters of the}} equivalent cir-cuit of the coating on the basis of object impedance meas-urement at a few, optimally selected measurement frequen-cies. The rules of optimal frequency selection are given. The number of frequencies is equal to the number of the equiva-lent circuit components. The developed identification algo-rithm enables continuous monitoring of the coating per-formance. The main advantage of the method is a <b>few</b> (<b>more</b> than 10) <b>times</b> shorter identification process compared to traditional identification technique based on impedance spectroscopy followed by impedance spectrum fitting using computer programs (e. g. LEVM or EQUIVCRT), which are utilising complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) method...|$|R
30|$|It {{is known}} that the maximum {{transmission}} rate is an increasing function of the SINR threshold (see e.g., [22]). This {{gives rise to the}} following trade-off: By increasing the transmission rate, the number of transmitters that can successfully satisfy the SINR criterion concurrently decreases. On the other hand, by decreasing the transmission rate, a higher number of transmitters can jointly satisfy the SINR criterion. Thus, {{it is not clear whether}} allowing more concurrent transmissions (less time sharing) at lower rates is preferable to allowing <b>fewer</b> concurrent transmissions (<b>more</b> <b>time</b> sharing) at higher rates. The answer is tightly dependent on the performance objective and on the network parameters, such as the transmission powers, channel conditions, etc.|$|R
