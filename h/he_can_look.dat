500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E

2500|$|Kartikeya means [...] "of the Krittikas". This epithet is also {{linked to}} his birth.

These six mothers all want to take care of him and nurse baby Kartikkeya. They argue. Baby Kartikkeya ends the argument by growing five more heads to have a total of six heads so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> at all six moms, and let them each nurse one.|$|E
2500|$|Mill {{argues that}} if people who are [...] "competently acquainted" [...] with two pleasures show a decided {{preference}} for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and [...] "would not resign it for any quantity of the other", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these [...] "competent judges" [...] will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, {{the judgment of the}} majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that [...] "many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher." [...] Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for {{there is no other way}} of measuring [...] "the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations." [...] "It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{town house}} has been {{described}} as having a [...] "flat roofline, rectangular profile and somewhat delicate lintel detail - in addition to neo-classical window spacing and a main facade with spindly belfry steeple". The building has been compared to the Scottish National Library on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh for having a modern style with classical or traditional elements and recognised for Scandinavian influences. The base of the town house features Darney stone from East Woodburn, with the walls being made from Blaxter stone, both of which were brought north to the town from Northumberland quarries. The surroundings of the main entrance are made of Elverwater stone. The stone on the walls was done by retired masons from around the ages of 65 to 80. The clock tower of Nordic influence, which sits on top of the building, complete with a weather vane, shows St Bryce, the patron saint of Kirkcaldy. The unique design was done by David Carr of Edinburgh. A small copper ball, [...] in diameter, {{at the bottom of the}} vane, is supposed to represent the world. The figure is located at the top of the [...] weather vane with the intention <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> across the town as the vane turns around in the wind, with the world at his feet. The vane, probably made of wrought iron, was designed by Thomas Hadden of Edinburgh.|$|E
2500|$|Infielder Stephen Drew {{returned}} from the disabled list, with Grace once again optioned to Syracuse, and the Nationals began a nine-game swing through California on May 29. On {{the first game of}} the road trip, the Nationals obtained their second shutout win of the year, beating the San Francisco Giants 3–0 behind a strong start by Tanner Roark. The game was marred, however, by an eighth-inning brawl that broke out after Giants reliever Hunter Strickland, facing Harper for the first time since the Nationals right fielder went 2-for-2 with two home runs off him during the 2014 National League Division Series, drilled Harper in the hip with a 98mph fastball with his first pitch. Harper tossed aside his bat and charged Strickland on the mound, throwing his helmet wide to the left of Strickland before the two players traded punches. They were separated by their teammates, with Giants first baseman and former National Michael Morse quickly getting between them before being bowled over (and concussed) by Giants pitcher and former University of Notre Dame football star Jeff Samardzija, and ejected from the game. Harper said after the game that he decided immediately that the pitch was intentional: [...] "You never want to get suspended or anything like that, but sometimes you've got to go and get him. You can't hesitate. You either go to first base or you go after him, and I decided to go after him." [...] He suggested Strickland was retaliating for the 2014 home runs (which Strickland denied), saying, [...] "It was three years ago. ... I don't know why he's thinking about it. He's got a World Series ring, it's on his finger, and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> at it every single night he wants to." [...] Both Harper and Strickland were issued suspensions by Major League Baseball, with Harper receiving a four-game penalty, which was lowered on appeal to three games. He began serving the suspension on May 31.|$|E

5000|$|A {{few weeks}} in the show started {{developing}} problems booking guests with some media outlets, such as the Dallas Morning News, wondering if it was Miller's interview style where [...] "Miller messes around with them as best <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> <b>looking</b> for openings to throw a jab or two or 10." [...] In response Miller {{said he did not}} want to always be [...] "a faceless, selfless conduit of information", {{he did not want to}} be another Larry King saying one or two words between guests speeches.
