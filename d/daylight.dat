5|$|<b>Daylight</b> saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as <b>daylight</b> savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening <b>daylight</b> lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use <b>daylight</b> saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{adverse effect}} of <b>daylight</b> saving time {{may lie in}} the fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during <b>daylight</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of <b>daylight</b> hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of <b>daylight.</b> On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of <b>daylight.</b> There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, after {{a three-year}} trial of <b>daylight</b> saving in Queensland, Australia, a {{referendum}} on <b>daylight</b> saving was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote– with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the <b>Daylight</b> Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating {{the implementation of a}} dual-time zone arrangement for <b>daylight</b> saving in South East Queensland {{while the rest of the}} state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the <b>Daylight</b> Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of <b>daylight</b> saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement. The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E

Due {{to a lack of}} information that indicate the likely energy savings, <b>daylighting</b> schemes are not yet popular among most buildings.|$|R
40|$|A {{fiber optic}} <b>daylighting</b> {{system is a}}n {{evolving}} technology for transporting illumination from sunlight into building interiors. This system is a solution developed by <b>daylighting</b> designers to reduce operational costs and enhance comfort. As an innovative technology, fiber optic <b>daylighting</b> systems can illuminate building interiors efficiently compared with other <b>daylighting</b> strategies. However, as a transmission medium in <b>daylighting</b> systems, optical fibers require uniform light distribution in sunlight concentration, which could generate heat. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of heat buildup produced by end-emitting fiber optic <b>daylighting</b> systems in tropical buildings. The applied method adopts a new fiber optic <b>daylighting</b> system technology from Sweden called Parans SP 3, with a 10 m cable to be tested in an actual room size under the Malaysian climatic environment, particularly within {{the vicinity of the}} main campus of the Universiti Sains Malaysia. Results show that the system generated a temperature of 1. 3 °C under average conditions through fiber optic diffusers and increases indoor temperature by 0. 8 °C in a 60 m 3 room.

40|$|Awareness of the {{benefits}} of good <b>daylighting</b> has risen in recent years, and the designs of many new buildings take <b>daylighting</b> into consideration. However, the majority of our built environment is older than this recent trend, and was not designed with <b>daylighting</b> as a top priority. A need exists, therefore, to find an efficient means of improving the <b>daylighting</b> of existing buildings. Furthermore, along with the development of such a <b>daylighting</b> technique, a set of guidelines should be developed to determine this technique's applicability to a given existing space, thus facilitating its acceptance into the toolbox of current building practice. This paper focuses particularly on the integration and adaptation of anidolic <b>daylighting</b> systems into existing buildings. By using mostly RADIANCE simulations, this thesis seeks to discover a range of conditions for optimal integration of an anidolic <b>daylighting</b> system. These conditions are then simplified and displayed {{in the form of a}} set of recommendations and guidelines for the benefit of architectural practitioners. y Siân A. Kleindienst. Thesis (S. M.)

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of <b>daylight</b> saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E

Illumination values at fixed locations within a classroom are presented on a monthly basis as a direct measure of the <b>daylighting</b> performance. The research indicates that this <b>daylighting</b> design is highly dependent on direct beam sunlight falling on the translucent light-shelf with the annual <b>daylighting</b> performance varying depending upon the position of the sun in the sky. The <b>daylighting</b> performance can be identified as being distinctly different for the winter, equinox and summer periods.

40|$|<b>Daylighting</b> is a {{beneficial}} design strategy since it may provide energy savings {{and contribute to}} a more sustainable design. In recent studies, <b>daylighting</b> {{has also been shown}} to increase staff and student productivity and to decrease absenteeism. The consulting engineer is often faced with the dilemma of how to design a <b>daylighted</b> building. What tools are available to predict the amount of <b>daylighting?</b> What are the design limitations and parameters? How much time is required? How does the data compare to the ?real world?? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to answer these questions and provide useful information for the design of <b>daylighted</b> areas with the assistance of software-based simulation. A survey was made of the available software programs for the calibrated modeling of light scattered in enclosed spaces. These software packages used algorithms based on either total radiosity (flux transfer) computations or physically accurate ray tracing. A summary of this survey along with the selection criteria used in selecting a software program are presented. ?Radiance?, a reverse ray tracing method software package, was chosen for use in the simulations. An existing school was modeled with the Radiance software and predictions of <b>daylighting</b> contributions were compared with actual data taken at the site location. The use of <b>daylighting</b> also requires a highly specialized lighting system. This system incorporates the use of controllable ballasts and lighting sensors to maximize the <b>daylighting</b> contribution to the overall required illumination.
