25|$|During {{the late}} Egyptian 18th dynasty, the Amarna Letters {{tell the story}} of the decline of Egyptian {{influence}} in the region. The Egyptians showed flagging <b>interest</b> <b>here</b> until almost the end of the dynasty. Horemheb (d 1292 BC), the last ruler of this dynasty, campaigned in this region, finally beginning to turn Egyptian interest back to this region.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union intended to impose the New Order, it was essentially a war of conquest. German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg {{was one of the few}} in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage anti-Communist opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His <b>interest</b> <b>here</b> was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as the Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the Russian Liberation Army were somewhat able to win him over.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} edge of the Columbia Embayment is along a line from the Klamath Mountains on the Oregon coast to a point in the Blue Mountains just east of the Wallula Gap. Unlike the OWL, this line has little topographical expression, and aside from the Hite Fault System is not associated with any major fault systems. But mapping of gravitational anomalies shows a definite lineament, some 700nbsp&km (about 400 miles) long, called the Klamath-Blue Mountain Lineament (KBML). This lineament is of <b>interest</b> <b>here</b> because of the possibility it was formerly conjugate with OWL, discussed in the next section.|$|E

25|$|Turner found {{remains of}} Jōmon people of Japan {{to belong to}} Sundadont pattern similar with the Southern Mongoloid living populations of Taiwanese aborigines, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Thais, Borneans, Laotians, and Malaysians. A {{recreation}} of a map made by William W. Howells, {{professor of anthropology at}} Harvard University, the shaded are the remnants and populations of non-Mongoloid people, appearing as N (Negrito) or A (Australoids of Wallacea, Melanesia and Australia). The latter peoples comprise the present aboriginals of Australia and Melanesia, as shown; the <b>interest</b> <b>here</b> is their presence and remnants. 'Sundadonts' comprise Southeast Asiatics and offshore peoples from northern Japan (Ainu) down to Taiwan and Indonesia. 'Sinodont' comprises the East Asian populations from Korea, Japan, China, Mongolia and Siberia.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic consortia {{have been}} shown to degrade styrene as sole carbon source (Grbić-Galić et al. 1990). In this case styrene {{degraded}} to a range of organic intermediates and carbon dioxide. Taking the carbon dioxide figures as a representation of the amount of styrene that had completely degraded to gas as is of <b>interest</b> <b>here,</b> rates of styrene degradation ranged from 0.14 to 0.4 a−1. This is an order of magnitude faster than the most rapid rate of polystyrene degradation identified (Kaplan et al. 1979, Sielicki et al. 1978). It is consistent with the T2GGM polystyrene degradation model (Quintessa and Geofirma 2011b), which considers the rate-limiting step for polystyrene degradation to be the breakup of polystyrene, rather than the degradation of styrene.|$|E
25|$|Pressure force. This is {{the action}} on the parcel arising from the spatial {{differences}} of atmospheric pressure p around it. (Temporal changes are of no <b>interest</b> <b>here.)</b> The spatial change of pressure is visualised through isobars, that are contours joining the locations where the pressure has a same value. In the figure this is simplistically shown by equally spaced straight lines. The pressure force acting on the parcel is minus the gradient vector of p (in symbols: grad p) - drawn in the figure as a blue arrow. At all points, the pressure gradient points to the direction of maximum increase of p and is always normal to the isobar at that point. Since the flow packet feels a push from the higher to the lower pressures, the effective pressure vector force {{is contrary to the}} pressure gradient, whence the minus sign before the gradient vector.|$|E

25|$|A star or planet {{often is}} modeled {{as a black}} body, and {{electromagnetic}} radiation emitted from these bodies as black-body radiation. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The photosphere of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature T that is maintained {{over a long period}} of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of <b>interest</b> <b>here.</b> Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.|$|E
25|$|The Zapotec {{kingdom of}} Zaachila {{expanded}} into the Tehuantepec area under Cosijoeza starting in 1487, pushing the native Huaves {{to the narrow}} coastal strips around the Tehuantepec lagoons. With this, the Zapotecs gained control of the salt deposits of the area, which was a valuable commodity. Tehuantepec became a second Zapotec capital. This dominion had relations with the Aztecs but did not pay tribute and controlled the trade route to Central America. The influence of this dominion extended west to Nexapa and along the coast to Tlapanatepec. Tequixixtlan and Xallapan were subordinate dominions, ruled by governors sent from Tehuantepec. Tehuantepec increased in importance as the original capital of Zaachila came {{under pressure from the}} Mixtecs and later from the Aztecs {{by the end of the}} 15th century. The Aztecs’ <b>interest</b> <b>here</b> was the control the trade route between the Mexican Plateau to Soconusco in Chiapas and into Guatemala. The Aztecs attacked Tehuantepec in 1496, and it was defended by an alliance of Mixtecs and Zapotecs. These two groups normally fought each other, but allied in the face of the foreign threat. This and the city’s formidable defenses led to a seven-month siege under Aztec ruler Axayacatl. The next Aztec chief Ahuiztotl, decided to marry his daughter Coyolicatzin to the Zapotec king Cosijoeza. This ended the war.|$|E
