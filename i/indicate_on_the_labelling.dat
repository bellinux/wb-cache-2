30|$|A {{commonly}} concerned {{issue is}} whether mandatory COOL of the main ingredient would be a technical barrier to trade for developing countries.

Otherwise, mandatory traceability would become a technical barrier to trade for the developing country. To avoid the possible protectionism, traceability systems should not be mandatory when the originating place of <b>the</b> main ingredient <b>indicated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>label</b> of a finished product is a developing country.

40|$|There is a {{tendency}} to align higher levels of fluoride in natural mineral water with the existing higher levels in tap water. Treatment of natural mineral waters could harm the preservation of their natural character. In this study fluoride intake through bottled and tap water consumption in the Belgian adult population was assessed, taking into account regional differences. A deterministic approach was used whereby consumption quantities of tap water and different brands of bottled water were linked with their respective fluoride concentrations. Data from the national food consumption survey (2004) were used and the Nusser methodology was applied to obtain usual intake estimates. Mean intake of fluoride through total water consumption in Flanders was 1. 4 +/- 0. 7 mg/day (97. 5 (th) percentile: 3. 1 mg/day), while in the Walloon region it was on average 0. 9 +/- 0. 6 mg/day (97. 5 th percentile: 2. 4 mg/day).
