25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> while others act compulsively {{so as to}} mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

50|$|People {{who suffer}} from an {{addictive}} personality spend excessive time on a behavior or with an item, not as a hobby but because they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to.</b> Addiction can be defined when the engagement in the activity or experience affects the person’s {{quality of life in}} some way. In this way, many people who maintain an addictive personality isolate themselves from social situations in order to mask their addiction.|$|E

Web-enhanced course delivery offers an opportunity to expand delivery techniques. This paper evaluates an asynchronous discussion board group exercise in an intermediate accounting course. Analysis of students' perceptions of the exercise indicated that <b>they</b> considered it <b>had</b> contributed <b>to</b> their learning. The discussion board gave them time to analyse other students' responses and to prepare their own contributions. The results show the discussion board made it easier for non-English background students and students over 30 years of age to express an opinion, and made them <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the discussion. Students raised issues {{about the quality of the}} contributions, the lack of feedback from the lecturer on discussion topics, the time taken to complete the exercise and the amount of work involved for the assessment weighting. asynchronous discussion board, group work, web-based learning, student perceptions, non-English background students,...|$|R

50|$|Did change {{occur in}} perceptions? A social norms {{approach}} {{is based on}} correcting misperceptions before changing behavior. The changes in behavior are thought to occur as an outcome of corrected perceptions. The goal is thus for the population to understand the prevalent behavior so they do not <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live up to misperceived norms of behavior. If there is a reduction in misperceptions, then the campaign has been implemented {{in a manner consistent}} with the social norms approach.|$|E

Students tend to question whether or not they are actually Asian if they are unable to excel highly in academics like they grow up believing. This type of feeling has a big affect on an individual's self-esteem and creating a difficulty in forming a healthy well-being.|$|E

Half the people that worked here were put here by politicians. <b>They</b> didn’t <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work, and those who were workers felt like, why bother?" [...] After a couple members of the board resigned, then-governor Donald Carcieri told other members not to continue going to board meetings, allowing O'Connell to report directly to the governor to restructure the company, removing about a third of the employees and implementing a merit-based business corporate philosophy.|$|R

Elizabeth is perhaps the only Twilighter who is the child of a Zeta; Calvin reaches the conclusion that she is also the only female diplodeviant. Tony and Margaret fall in love, and then Calvin and Elizabeth do likewise. Elizabeth becomes pregnant.

What her sisters see as arrogance is to a large extent Posy's {{confidence}} in her extraordinary ability as a dancer (apparent from a very young age). She also has a great talent for mimicry that often helps in times of stress. Posy is also the inheritor of the titular ballet shoes, a parting gift from her birth mother.

Ellingson maintains that virtually none of those accused of believing in the [...] "noble savage" [...] ever actually did so. He likens the practice of accusing anthropologists (and other writers and artists) of belief in the noble savage to a secularized version of the inquisition, and he maintains that modern anthropologists have internalized these accusations {{to the point where}} they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> begin by ritualistically disavowing any belief in [...] "noble savage" [...] if they wish to attain credibility in their fields.
