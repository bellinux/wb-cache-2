25|$|The {{start of}} the 2nd {{generation}} of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: Gustavo Cerati, Indio Solari, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-Soda Stereo member Cerati {{spent most of the}} early part of the decade in the electronic side of music.

Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts.|$|E

He added that since the genius lies in the arrangements, [...] "having so much of the arrangement absent" [...] means that the music [...] "just sounds awkward and incomplete, as if it was waiting for the final round of mixing and overdubs." [...] Erlewine's overall opinion on the album was [...] "if the purpose of this disc is to draw attention to Michael's vocals, The Stripped Mixes does its job, but just because his voice is pushed <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>center</b> does not mean that this is the best place to appreciate his genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these trials, James neither renounced {{her faith}} nor gave up hope {{that one day}} she would have the blessings she desired. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, she {{struggled}} {{to care for the}} remaining children at home as a single parent. In 1872, she sold the family farm and moved closer to the city in order to save money. During these years James both managed a household of children and small grandchildren, but also worked as a domestic servant in order to make ends meet. In addition, she made the family's soap, clothing, and raised vegetables in a small garden. James remained active in the church at this time as well. She participated in the Relief Society doing extensive charitable work. She also contributed financially to the building of the Logan, Manti, and St. George temples; temples that, as an African-American, she was not allowed to enter. The members of her congregation, however, did recognize her faith and sacrifice. In her later life, both she and her brother Isaac J.

James remained a strong supporter of Joseph Smith, calling him [...] "the finest man I ever saw on earth." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{tickets for}} the tour were allotted {{to the members of}} Icon, Madonna's {{official}} fan club members. However, the tour soon started selling all around the world. Originally scheduled to perform in twelve major markets in North America with additional stops in Paris and London, the demand for tickets became so high that in New York City after two Madison Square Garden dates sold out in record time, Madonna's manager Caresse Henry, and the worldwide tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment, decided to add new dates to the tour. Within the first five days the tour was a sell-out for the dates at Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Toronto, Philadelphia and Miami. High-priced ticket packages for all dates on the tour were sold from Madonna's tour website Madonnaviptickets.com. The tickets were priced at $700 ($ in [...] dollars) per person.

500|$|Since {{its origins}} in the Bronx during the 1970s, hip hop music has been {{associated}} with noise. According to author Mark Katz techniques such as scratching are an expression of transgression where scratching, like the visual art of graffiti, is a form of vandalism. [...] "It is a celebration of noise," [...] writes Katz, [...] "and no doubt part of the pleasure it brought to DJs came from the knowledge that it annoyed the older generation." [...] Scholar William Jelani Cobb states that [...] "though the genre will always be dismissed by many as brash, monotonous noise, the truth is that hip hop has undergone an astounding array of lyrical and musical transformations." [...] Scholar Ronald Radano writes that [...] "no term in the modern lexicon conveys more vividly African-American music's powers of authenticity and resistance than the figure of 'noise'. In hip-hop parlance, 'noise,' specifically 'black noise', is that special insight from the inside, the anti-philosophy that emerges <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>center</b> through the sound attack of rap." [...] Radano finds the appearance of [...] "black noise" [...] nearly everywhere in the [...] "transnational repetitions of rap opposition," [...] but stresses that despite its global nature, black noise still conforms to American racial structures. Radano states that [...] "rather than radicalizing the stable binaries of race, noise inverts them; it transforms prior signs of European musical mastery — harmony, melody, song — into all that is bitchin', kickin', and black." ...|$|E
