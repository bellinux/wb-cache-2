40|$|International audienceThe {{drilling}} of deep holes {{remains an}} unsatisfactory machining operation due its limited productivity. This manufacturing process requires the chips {{to be evacuated}} {{through the use of}} retreat cycles and high-pressure lubrication, which is problematic both for productivity and the respect of the environment. An alternative response to the chip evacuation problem is the use of a vibratory <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> which enables the chip to be split thanks to the drill's axial vibration. The high-speed drilling operation requires specific cutting conditions to be determined in order to maintain self-excited axial vibration throughout the drilling process. The prediction of adequate cutting conditions is determined {{on the basis of the}} frequency characteristics of the spindle/self-vibratory <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> and the dynamics of the cutting process. It can be expressed in terms of a specific stability diagram indicating the zone of stable self-excited axial vibration. The aim of this study is to develop a high-speed spindle/drilling head/tool system finite element model to evaluate the system's dynamic characteristics and the adequate cutting conditions allowing stable self-excited axial vibration. The model is elaborated on the basis of rotor dynamics prediction, and takes into account the interfaces between system components, using the receptance coupling method. Using the model, adequate cutting conditions are determined by integrating the model-based tool tip transfer function into the chatter vibration stability approach proposed by Budak and Altintas. The simulated results are validated by performing vibration and drilling tests. The proposed model can be used to accurately evaluate the dynamic performance of the spindle/self-vibratory <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> and can also be used to design an optimised spindle/drilling head for a given drilling process...|$|E

40|$|Tempress Small Mechanically-Assisted High-Pressure Waterjet Drilling Tool project {{centered}} {{on the development of}} a downhole intensifier (DHI) to boost the hydraulic pressure available from conventional coiled tubing to the level required for high-pressure jet erosion of rock. We reviewed two techniques for implementing this technology (1) pure high-pressure jet drilling and (2) mechanically-assisted jet drilling. Due to the difficulties associated with modifying a downhole motor for mechanically-assisted jet drilling, it was determined that the pure high-pressure jet drilling tool was the best candidate for development and commercialization. It was also determined that this tool needs to run on commingled nitrogen and water to provide adequate downhole differential pressure and to facilitate controlled pressure drilling and descaling applications in low pressure wells. The resulting Microhole jet drilling bottomhole assembly (BHA) drills a 3. 625 -inch diameter hole with 2 -inch coil tubing. The BHA consists of a self-rotating multi-nozzle <b>drilling</b> <b>head,</b> a high-pressure rotary seal/bearing section, an intensifier and a gas separator. Commingled nitrogen and water are separated into two streams in the gas separator. The water stream is pressurized to 3 times the inlet pressure by the downhole intensifier and discharged through nozzles in the <b>drilling</b> <b>head.</b> The energy in the gas-rich stream is used to power the intensifier. Gas-rich exhaust from the intensifier is conducted to the nozzle head where it is used to shroud the jets, increasing their effective range. The prototype BHA was tested at operational pressures and flows in a test chamber and on the end of conventional coiled tubing in a test well. During instrumented runs at downhole conditions, the BHA developed downhole differential pressures of 74 MPa (11, 000 psi, median) and 90 MPa (13, 000 psi, peaks). The median output differential pressure was nearly 3 times the input differential pressure available from the coiled tubing. In a chamber test, the BHA delivered up to 50 kW (67 hhp) hydraulic power. The tool drilled uncertified class-G cement samples cast into casing at a rate of 0. 04 to 0. 17 m/min (8 to 33 ft/hr), within the range projected for this tool but slower than a conventional PDM. While the tool met most of the performance goals, reliability requires further improvement. It will be difficult for this tool, as currently configured, to compete with conventional positive displacement downhole motors for most coil tubing drill applications. Mechanical cutters on the rotating nozzle head would improve cutting. This tool can be easily adapted for well descaling operations. A variant of the Microhole jet drilling gas separator was further developed for use with positive displacement downhole motors (PDM) operating on commingled nitrogen and water. A fit-for-purpose motor gas separator was designed and yard tested within the Microhole program. Four commercial units of that design are currently involved in a 10 -well field demonstration with Baker Oil Tools in Wyoming.
