After her performance, the singer was asked how she felt it went, saying she had [...] "forgotten what a crowd like that feels and looks like. I try not to <b>get</b> <b>nervous</b> – I don't like to think about things too much beforehand, otherwise I worry too much. I like to deal with the situation when it happens." [...] A beatboxer from Norfolk, Tom Povey, was picked to perform with her on stage after he was seen performing in a London pub. Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{opposite}} Sacha Parkinson, {{who plays}} Sian Powers, Thompson filmed his first screen kiss.

I mean I don't <b>get</b> <b>nervous</b> when I go on stage or anything like that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E
500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's {{not a good idea to}} have a lot of people around because you <b>get</b> <b>nervous</b> that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't <b>get</b> <b>nervous</b> when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E

Dan was really good at cluing in to that, saying something that didn't back down, but still had a vulnerability to it. This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Hollis was a 25-year-old {{insurance}} agent {{at the time}} of the attack. He was born September 25, 1920. He lived at 3502 N. State Line Avenue; a house which no longer exists. On the night of his attack, he was at the movies on a double date with his brother, Bob, who was also an {{insurance agent}}. After the movie, he dropped his brother and his date off. While he was taking his girlfriend home, they stopped on a lateral road off of Richmond where the attack occurred. Hollis suffered three fractures in his skull and was hospitalized for several days at Texarkana Hospital (also known as Pine Street Hospital) which stood at W. 5th and Pine street and no longer exists. He was in critical condition. After four days, he showed slight improvement but was still not fully conscious. He was released from the hospital on Saturday, March 9. His doctor told him it would be [...] "some time" [...] before he was completely well again and that he was not to work for six months. By the middle of May, he was still recovering from his injuries. Three months after the attack, he stated [...] "I still <b>get</b> <b>nervous</b> when I think about it. At night, on the street, even downtown." [...] Hollis was questioned several times by officers after the other killings. Starting at the end of April, he spent a week with Larey in Frederick, Oklahoma before residing in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hollis eventually married and had seven children. He had a Bachelor of Arts in history and a Master of Science in Public Administration. He worked for the US government. He loved to dress in western clothing, including a cowboy hat, a holster and a pistol. He appeared in the 1971 television film They've Killed President Lincoln as Vice President Andrew Johnson. He eventually moved to Houston where he began working for NASA. Hollis died in his sleep at the age of 54. His family remembered him for his jokes and sense of humor, as well as his love for the outdoors, including camping and hunting.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1978 US Open, Evert {{would play}} sixteen-year-old Pam Shriver in the final. [...] Shriver showed Evert {{she was to}} be taken seriously in the match by winning her first service game at 15 points for Evert, which was {{the first game of the}} match. [...] Evert would have a hard time shaking Shriver off during the first set because of mostly double {{faulting}} three-times in one game in the eight game of the set to allow Shriver to break back to level the set 4-games all. [...] Evert would lose the next game to go down 4 games to 5, which she said [...] "I was disgusted with those three double-faults...when I <b>get</b> <b>nervous,</b> serving is one of the first things that goes. [...] But even at 5-4, I felt very confident. [...] I didn't think there was any way I could lose." [...] During the subsequent game, Evert would only lose one point on serve to get the match back level at 5 games-all. [...] In the critical 11-game, Evert would show why experience matters and broke the youngster's serve, which allowed Evert to win the opening set 7 games to 5. [...] Evert and Shriver would battle to an even 4-all in the second set before the youngster showed her inexperience by having a 40 to love game, and simply put Shriver could not close it out against the relentless effort of Evert. [...] The points after this was the following: Evert winning on a forehand return, then made a winning volley, then got deuce with a galloping forehand up the line, Shriver won the next point with a booming service to get the advantage with a volley, Shriver on game point lead her forehand astray, lastly Evert won the game by hitting two unreturnable returns. [...] In the tenth game of the set, Shriver tried her best by getting most shots back, but Evert still won the set 6 games to 4, which gave Evert her fourth US Open title in a row and first one on the hard DecoTurf. [...] Evert later said [...] "I felt hungary to win...When the chips were down, I went for passing shots and made them. [...] I hit the lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV News, Knowles spoke about her more aggressive stage persona, Sasha Fierce. She said: [...] "I absolutely get scared every time I get on the stage. I <b>get</b> <b>nervous.</b> I'm actually really scared when I'm not nervous because then I don't transform into that person that {{people are used to}} seeing." [...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite. When I'm onstage, I'm aggressive, I'm strong, I'm fearless." [...] Knowles' third album I Am... Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007).

Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created. She said that it was a mixture of everything she loved: [...] "I tried to bring jazz and hip-hop, and ballet and fashion, and everything together... It is the best thing I've done as far as my tours go." ...|$|E
