40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> {{broadcasting}} {{is available}} {{in more and more}} countries with various forms. One of the most successful forms is Digital Video Broadcasting for Terrestrial (DVB-T), which has been deployed in most countries of the world for years. In order to bring the <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> broadcasting <b>services</b> to battery-powered handheld receivers in a mobile environment, Digital Video Broadcasting for Handheld (DVB-H) has been formally adopted by ETSI. More advanced and complex <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> broadcasting systems are under development, for example, the next generation of DVB-T, a. k. a. DVB-T 2. Current commercial DVB-T/H receivers are usually built upon dedicated application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). However, ASICs are not flexible for incoming evolved standards and less overall-area efficient since they cannot be efficiently reused and shared among different radio standards, when we integrate a DVB-T/H receiver into a mobile phone. This paper presents an example implementation of a DVB-T/H receiver on the prototype of Infineon Technologies' Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platform called MuSIC (Multiple SIMD Cores), which is a DSP-centered and accelerator-assisted architecture and aims at battery-powered mass-market handheld terminals...|$|R
40|$|In today's world, {{demands of}} <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are growing tremendously, {{together}} {{with the development of}} new communication technologies and investigation of new transmission media. Two common problems encountered in <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are unreliable transmission channels and limited resources. This dissertation investigates advanced source coding and error control techniques, and is dedicated to designing joint source-channel coding schemes for robust image/video transmission. Error resilience properties of JPEG 2000 codestreams are investigated first, and an LDPC-based joint iterative decoding scheme is proposed. Next, a progressive decoding method is presented for still and motion image transmission. The underlying channel codes are created using a Plotkin construction and offer the novel ability of using one long channel codeword to protect an entire image, yet still allowing progressive decoding. Progressive quality improvements occur in two ways: the first is the usual progressive refinement, where image quality is improved as more data are received; the second is that residual error rates of earlier received data are reduced as more data are received. Finally, multichannel systems are studied and an optimal rate allocation algorithm is proposed for parallel transmission of scalable images in multichannel systems. The proposed algorithm selects a subchannel as well as a channel code rate for each packet, based on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the subchannels. The resulting scheme provides unequal error protection of source bits and significant gains are obtained over equal error protection (EEP) schemes. An application of the proposed algorithm to JPEG 2000 transmission shows the advantages of exploiting differences in SNRs between subchannels. Multiplexing of multiple sources is also considered, and additional gains are achieved by exploiting information diversity among the sources...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for terrestrial and satellite delivered <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> has precipitated {{the problem of}} spectrum scarcity in recent years. This has resulted in deployment of spectral efficient technologies such as MIMO for terrestrial systems. However, MIMO cannot be easily deployed for the satellite channel using conventional spatial multiplexing as the channel conditions here {{are very different from}} the terrestrial case, and it is often dominated by line of sight fading. Orthogonal circular polarization, which has long been used for increasing both frequency reuse and the power spectral density available to earth-bound satellite terminals, has recently been recommended for directly increasing the throughput available to such devices. Following that theme, this thesis proposes a novel dual circular polarisation multiplexing (DCPM) technique, which is aimed at the burgeoning area of throughput-hungry digital video broadcasting via satellite to handheld devices (DVB-SH) and digital video broadcast to the next generation of hand held (DVB-NGH) systems. In determining the working limits of DCPM, a series of measurement campaigns have been performed, from which extensive dual circular polarised land mobile satellite (LMS) channel data has been derived. Using the newly available channel data and with the aid of statistical channel modelling tools found in literature, a new dual circular polarised LMS MIMO channel model has been developed. This model, in contrast with previously available LMS MIMO channel models, is simpler to implement since it uses a distinct state-based empirical-stochastic approach. The model {{has been found to be}} robust and it easily lends itself to rapid implementation for system level MIMO and DCPM analysis. Finally, by way of bit error rate (BER) analysis in different channel fading conditions, it has been determined when best to implement polarisation multiplexing or conventional. MIMO techniques for DVB-type land mobile receivers. It is recommended that DCPM be used when the channel in predominantly Ricean, with eo-polar channel Rice factors and sub-channel cross correlation values greater than 1 dB and 0. 40 respectively. The recommendations provided by this research are valuable contributions, which may help shape the evolving DVB-NGH standardisation process.

It provides the main focus of the European Unions research effort to accelerate deployment of advanced communications infrastructures and services, and is complemented by extensive European research in the areas of information technology and telematics. The stated objectives of ACTS are to "develop advanced communication systems and services for economic development and social cohesion within Europe, taking account of the rapid evolution of technologies, the changing regulatory situation and opportunities for development of advanced transeuropean networks and services". Within ACTS, the emphasis of the work has shifted from the exploration of fundamental concepts and detailed system engineering, as it had been in earlier programs such as RACE (Research and development in Advanced Communication technologies for Europe), to issues relating to implementation of advanced systems and generic services, and applications which demonstrate the potential use of advanced communications in Europe. A key feature of the ACTS program is that the research be undertaken in the context of real-world trials. Work within the program is divided into six technical areas: Interactive <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>services,</b> photonic technologies, high speed networking, mobility and personal communication networks, intelligence in networks and services and quality, safety and security of communication systems and services. The total EU budget for the ACTS program is approximately 670 MECU, covering around 160 projects, with over 1000 individual organisations participating within the program, thereby illustrating the scale of the activities. MIDAS is one of five projects in the technical area of photonic technologies concerned with high speed transmission, the others being ESTHER, UPGRADE, HIGHWAY and SPEED, each concerned with various aspects or approaches to the development of 40 GBit/s transmission systems within the European arena. A full list of project descriptions and objectives, {{as well as those of}} the ACTS program as a whole, are to be found in Ref [1]. The MIDAS consortium consists of the following organisations: Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), CSELT (Italy), Thomson LCR (France), United Monolithic Semiconductor (France), Telia (Sweden), Kings College London (UK), University of Athens (Greece), ORC University of Southampton (UK).
