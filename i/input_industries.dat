During 2014 through 2015, India was the third largest producer of raw steel and the largest producer of sponge iron in the world.

Most {{iron and steel}} in India is produced from iron ore.The Indian Ministry of Steel is concerned with: the coordination and planning of the growth and development of the {{iron and steel industry}} in the country, both in the public and private sectors; formulation of policies with respect to production, pricing, distribution, import and export of iron and steel, ferro alloys and refractories; and the development of <b>input</b> <b>industries</b> relating to iron ore, manganese ore, chrome ore and refractories etc., required mainly by the steel industry.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} several decades, {{globalization}} {{has led to the}} integration of product markets. Rapid increases in cross-border economic, social, technological and cultural exchange have become the key elements of knowledge diffusion and thus technology spillovers among countries. As a result, the debate as to whether absolute convergence occurs at the cross-country level has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the changes in the input structure of the construction industry in nine developed countries between the late 1960 s and 1990 and to evaluate whether convergence occurs at input industry level. The analysis of the technical coefficients for 35 industries reveals that, across countries and over time, not only the key inputs but also the new high and low <b>input</b> <b>industries</b> are similar. The estimation of variance factors on the other hand suggests that (1) during the sample period, the input structure of the industry is dominated by divergence rather than convergence; (2) among the <b>input</b> <b>industries,</b> services in particular tend for convergence; and (3) manufacturing inputs provide a mixed picture where only a few inputs show convergence and the remaining inputs show in general weak divergence.

Hence, we propose an index that assesses the relevance of any input for the target output, including its role as an input of inputs. Thereafter, we exploit an own-built firm-level dataset of about 20, 489 U. S. parent companies integrating more than 154, 000 affiliates worldwide.

It was not only due to the weakness of agricultural marketing policy, but also lack of research, particularly research related to the costumer’s attitude of marketing mix. Understanding of costumer’s attitude of marketing mix was really important. Many literatures indicated {{that one of the}} advantages of this was to design the marketing mix strategy. The main purposes of this study were, first, to evaluate the customer’s attitude toward marketing mix among distinct market segments of livestock <b>input</b> <b>industry,</b> and second, to examine the influence of demographic variables on customer attitude toward marketing mix.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} foreign intellectual property right (IPR) systems and the policies that comprise them on U.

Extending the empirical and theoretical work of Smith (2002), this paper uses a gravity model to analyze how IPRs affect the market power and market expansion effects of exports to countries with differing abilities to imitate technology. The findings suggest that strengthening global IPRs grant a market power effect to U. S. exporters; strong IPRs reduce U. S. exports by awarding a temporary monopoly over the protected good. However, {{the analysis of the}} individual policy components of an IPR system reveal which components inhibit trade through market power effects and which components counterbalance it through market expansion effects, increasing the flow of trade and access to biotechnology related agricultural inputs...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a better {{understanding}} of the elements of service quality in agribusiness <b>input</b> <b>industries,</b> specifically crop protection and fertilizer inputs. Often bundling their services with products, suppliers of agronomic inputs might inefficiently allocate resources to solve customer problems. An ideal solution tailored to the needs and desires of each agricultural production operation should improve the profits for farmer and supplier alike. To confirm the hierarchical structure of agribusiness input services and assess the value of improvements in the attributes, this study surveys 106 farmers on their perceptions of service quality. Results of the analysis suggest that service quality in agronomic inputs is composed of a hierarchical structure where three attributes (physical environment quality, interaction quality, and outcome quality) each have three subdimensions. Furthermore, farmers value improvements in outcome quality the most and physical environment quality the least. In addition, the values of these improvements are investigated for five buyer segments. This analysis suggests that input suppliers would do well to allocate resources in a way that exploits differences among these segments. ...|$|E

The result is a simulation model, shaped to the European sugar sector, and enabling to assess the size and distribution {{of the benefits of}} transgenic sugar beet adoption in the European Union (EU) and the Rest of the World (ROW). Our model results suggest that the ROW captures the largest share of the benefits (53 % of total welfare increase). The EU sugar industry absorbs the next largest share of the benefits (30 %), with the smallest share (17 %) accruing to seed suppliers and gene developers. Since EU intervention prices are exogenously fixed each year, EU consumers do not take part in the distribution of the gains from the innovation. However, consumers outside the EU necessarily gain due to the depressing effect of the technology on world sugar prices. The latter is costly for the cane growers in the ROW, while beet producers gain. Our results reveal an apparent contradiction. When modern (bio) technologies are introduced in commodity markets subject to obsolete trade policies, the natural flow of domestic benefits from the <b>input</b> <b>industry,</b> via farmers, to consumers is hampered and biased towards the producing sector (<b>input</b> <b>industry,</b> farmers, and processors), leaving domestic consumers unaffected.

Current status and the road forward are emphasized for four dominant issues—resistance management, coexistence, trade and markets, and social and economic concerns. All of these issues have been central to agriculture for decades—well before the introduction of genetically engineered products for agriculture in the 1990 s. An example is the National Research Council committee on ecologically based pest management, which {{for the most part}} preceded the introduction of genetically engineered ag products. It {{is important to recognize that}} the issues discussed here were not initiated by genetic engineering. Genetically engineered crops are not unique for these issues, but have their own subset. These must be dealt with to ensure sustainability of these products to continue as an integral part of crop ag practices. The beneficial impact of GE crops in farm sustainability was addressed by a 2010 NRC report, e. g. herbicide resistant crops enabled broad use of no-till practices and the use of herbicides with less residual persistence in our soils, and plants genetically engineered for pest resistance have reduced the use of chemical pesticides. NABC 27 explored in an open forum the road forward to promote sustainability of these products, the ones now in use, those in development and still others being conceived in our laboratories.

This study examines global R&D spending by private industry in seven agricultural input sectors, food manufacturing, and biofuel and describes the changing structure of these industries. In 2007 (the latest year for which comprehensive estimates are available), the private sector spent $ 19. 7 billion on food and agricultural research (56 percent in food manufacturing and 44 percent in agricultural input sectors) and accounted for about half of total public and private spending on food and agricultural R&D in high-income countries. In R&D related to biofuel, annual private-sector investments are estimated to have reached $ 1. 47 billion worldwide by 2009. Incentives to invest in R&D are influenced by market structure and other factors. Agricultural <b>input</b> <b>industries</b> have undergone significant structural change over the past two decades, with industry concentration on the rise. A relatively small number of large, multinational firms with global R&D and marketing networks account for most R&D in each input industry.

40|$|Agricultural input {{distribution}} channels incorporate {{a number of}} complexities that make communication of prices and availability murky, and create inefficiencies in input markets. The Internet provides the potential for realizing significant efficiency gains in the agricul-tural inputs industry through the continued consolidation and vertical integration made possible by improving communications networks. Innovative firms {{have the opportunity to}} profit from the changes wrought and encouraged by the Internet. Agricultural <b>input</b> <b>industries</b> are uniquely affected by international compe-tition and falling prices in agricultural commodity markets. As receipts to agricultural production decline, growers have increased incentives to reduce costs to remain competitive, including the costs of employing inputs. Yet prices paid for inputs by American growers continue to stay steady or rise even as prices received by farmers have plunged (figure 1). If efficiencies can be gained in agricultural input marketing, and all or some are passed on to input buyers, the gap between prices paid and received might lessen, making U. S. agriculture more competitive. E-commerce offers substantial promise in achieving efficiency in agricultural input industrial chains. Background: The Agricultural-Chemical Distribution Channel Figure 2 provides an analysis of the agricultural-chemical distribution channel. The cost of distributing product from input manufacturers to growers is approx-imately $ 3 billion. Put differently, 30 % of what a grower pays for agricultural chemicals is the cost of getting them from the plant to the farm.
