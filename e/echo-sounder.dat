40|$|Bars are semi-submerged fluvial forms {{associated}} with the availability of sediments and a temporal dynamic, whose dimensions are controlled by the flow and depth of the channel.   Attachment bars are very common in large anabranching river systems and {{play an important role}} in island formation and ecology. The Upper Paraná River exhibits an anabranching pattern characterized by channels of different sizes, separated by islands and bars. The objective of this work is to present the processes involved in the formation and development of attachment bars in Santa Rosa Island, situated in Porto Rico, State of Parana, Southern Brazil. Acquisition campaigns were performed to obtain data on channel hydraulics (ADCP equipment), morphometry (<b>Echo-sound</b> profiles) and textural parameters (grain-size analyses) at high and medium water levels. Santa Rosa Island divides the flow into two channels of distinct hydraulic and sedimentary dynamics. Flow diversion produces a decrease in flow velocity and consequent sediment deposition near the upstream end of Santa Rosa Island. The formation and maintenance of attachment bars in Santa Rosa Island is related to flow competence reduction and the occurrence of divergent currents.

40|$|The {{global demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} {{is high and}} is also believed to be high in the future. Much of today s {{oil and gas exploration}} is carried out offshore and consequently, there is a risk if oil and gas blowouts at the seabed. Major concerns from a subsea oil and gas release are fire and toxic hazard to people working on offshore installations and loss of buoyancy of ships and floating installations. In addition, oil spills will result in both immediate and long-term environmental damage. Risk assessments are a very useful tool to pinpoint the risks of offshore oil and gas exploration and production. In terms of blowouts, these assessments require knowledge of the qualitative behavior and reliable quantitative estimates for where and when the oil and gas will surface. Since execution of underwater test releases of hydrocarbons is extremely costly, computer models are interesting research subjects. In this thesis, a simulation concept for forecasting oil and gas blowouts is presented. ANSYS FLUENT 15. 0. 0, a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package, is used to obtain both the qualitative behavior and the quantitative estimates. The model accounts for variation in bubble size and bubble density. In addition the model allows for the presence of ocean currents and gas dissolution. The released oil droplets and the natural gas bubbles are tracked while they rise towards the ocean surface in order to estimate the effect of ambient ocean currents. The general model set-up is first validated against experimental data, for which air-bubbles are released in a 7 m deep basin. The primary simulations are based upon a field experiment conducted in Norwegian waters during June 2000, known as DeepSpill. Four discharges of oil and gas from a water depth of 844 m was carried out under controlled circumstances. Extensive observations and documentation were acquired during the experiments, in addition chemical and biological samples were collected along the water column. In the present work, simulation results are presented, discussed and compared with chosen field data obtained from the DeepSpill experiment. The overall simulation results are found to correspond quite good with the results from the DeepSpill experiment. The mean path of oil corresponds favorably with the overall shape of the <b>echo-sound</b> images taken during the experiments. The point of complete gas dissolution is found to match the field data, as long as a mass transfer reduction factor is employed. However, the rise time of oil droplets are somewhat over-predicted, which may indicate a need for denser grid in the release zone and/or a reconsideration of the oil droplet size distribution...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{hydrothermal}} plumes in the Arctic and Nordic Seas is {{an important}} objective for ecosystem assessments of these habitats. Very {{little is known about}} what role the hydrothermal plumes play in the Nordic Seas. Recent visual observation and <b>echo-sound</b> imaging suggest that this habitat is densely inhabited by larger zooplankton compared to the surroundings. In this thesis I focused particularly on the diet of a pelagic predator that is commonly found in plumes of the Nordic Seas, the amphipod Themisto abyssorum (Paper III). The diet of T. abyssorum in the deep-sea and at hydrothermal vents was previously unknown and new tools were needed to access this information. Therefore, we developed a molecular assay to help us find and identify predator-prey interactions that are difficult to detect using classical microscopy methods (Paper I and II). We also conducted a genetic survey of the pelagic eukaryote microorganism community at the Jan Mayen Vent Field, Loki’s Castle and the Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano (Paper IV) to understand the vent impact on these communities. Molecular tools have become important in predator-prey interaction studies where dissection can be inadequate. The most common approach is to use specific primers that target known prey taxa. However, to study the complete range of prey items consumed we needed to work with universal primers. We therefore developed an application for the Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (DHPLC) for separating amplicons in a mixture, in order to study the total prey DNA from stomach contents. This technique was developed as part of a study of predator-prey interactions of the copepod Limnocalanus macrurus from the Bothnian Bay in the Northern part of the Baltic Sea (Paper I and II). The DHPLC assay was efficient, unbiased and could be used for any predator-prey interaction (Paper II). More than 30 taxa (at different taxonomic levels) were identified from the samples suggesting highly carnivorous feeding preferences. The assay development in Paper I and II confirmed {{that it was possible to}} explore stomach DNA using universal primers without significant bias from predator DNA. Until now, dissection and microscopy have been the most common tools used to study trophic interactions of T. abyssorum. However, sole use of such tools may have caused an underestimation of prey diversity, particularly among those prey items not visible in the microscope. Themisto spp. are very useful as target species in deep-sea studies with long haul times because they have long gut passage time, so prey items are not digested as quickly as in some other species. The novel technique for excluding predator amplicons developed in Paper II was used to analyse the gut content of T. abyssorum. Specimens from three localities; The Jan Mayen Vent Fields, The Loki’s Castle Vent Field and The Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano, were analysed using a 3 - 500 bp long 18 S rRNA sequence. The number of Operational Taxonomical Units (OTUs) reported in Paper III was highest in T. abyssorum guts from Loki’s Castle while the Jan Mayen samples had the lowest numbers of prey. The most abundant prey was calanoid copepods, supporting previous findings. However, the molecular approach has also revealed soft-bodied prey and possibly detritus. In summary, our study showed much higher diversity of prey than previous studies and the wide range of taxa found also indicates that T. abyssorum is likely highly omnivorous. In Paper III, our data indicates that the localities were quite different from each other in terms of prey diversity and we therefore hypothesised that biodiversity of hydrothermal vents might be more closely linked to the general water masses of the Nordic Seas than to the hydrothermal activity alone. A molecular diversity assay was used to describe the eukaryote community of the hydrothermal vents in the Norwegian Sea (Paper IV). Water samples from five localities and from three different depths were collected. The five localities were Jan Mayen Vent Fields with a reference station, Loki’s Castle with a reference station and the Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano. The results obtained from Paper IV support the hypothesis from Paper III, where water masses gave the strongest effect followed by depth, and thirdly a differentiation between Loki’s Castle and the reference station indicated an effect of the hydrothermal vent. Papers I, II and III illustrate the power of molecular markers in dietary studies, generating a more in-depth understanding of predator-prey interactions. In addition, both the stomach content analysis in Paper III and the genetic survey of the water column in Paper IV suggests that the plankton taxa composition was not vent specific. The results illustrate the need to go deeper and further into a complete inventory of the plankton community surrounding vents and seeps. Furthermore, several technical challenges regarding sampling for stomach content analysis are yet to be solved and an even better understanding of predator-prey interactions depends on that development. </p...|$|R
