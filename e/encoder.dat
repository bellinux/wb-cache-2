5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} sinking of a British warship in Chinese waters, the theft {{of one of the}} ship's cruise missiles—and the {{shooting}} down of a Chinese fighter plane. He uncovers a link to media mogul Elliot Carver which suggests that Carver had purchased a GPS <b>encoder</b> on the black market.|$|E
5|$|M sends Bond to {{investigate}} Carver after he releases news {{articles about the}} crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS <b>encoder,</b> Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the <b>encoder.</b> Bond learns that the <b>encoder</b> had been tampered with, {{and goes to the}} South China Sea {{to investigate}} the wreck (which was actually in Vietnamese waters). He and Wai Lin, a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The media baron Elliot Carver soon {{begins his}} plans to use a stolen <b>encoder</b> {{obtained}} at the bazaar by his henchman, cyberterrorist Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights. Meaconing the GPS signal using the <b>encoder,</b> Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship, commanded by Mr. Stamper, sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet and killing off the Devonshires survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} {{investigating the}} matter and the two agree to work together. They discover that Carver had used the GPS <b>encoder</b> to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet {{on their way to}} China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow a hole in the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E
25|$|Nero's AAC <b>encoder</b> {{has been}} very {{competitive}} when tested against other encoders in scientific listening tests, for a time, second only to Apple's AAC <b>encoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|CDex uses FAAC <b>encoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{compressing}} ZIP or gzip files, 7-Zip {{uses its}} own DEFLATE <b>encoder,</b> which may achieve higher compression, but at lower speed, {{than the more}} common zlib DEFLATE implementation. The 7-Zip deflate <b>encoder</b> implementation is available separately {{as part of the}} AdvanceCOMP suite of tools.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS X {{users can}} utilize Apple's AAC <b>encoder</b> with the {{command-line}} afconvert tool.|$|E
25|$|FFmpeg {{supports}} AAC encoding through external library libfaac, {{and using}} its experimental native <b>encoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|VLC {{media player}} uses the FAAC (<b>encoder)</b> and FAAD (decoder) {{to provide support}} for AAC audio.|$|E
25|$|Software {{that can}} export audio in WMA format include Windows Media Player, Windows Movie Maker, Microsoft Expression <b>Encoder,</b> Sony Sound Forge, GOM Player, RealPlayer, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition, and Adobe Soundbooth. Microsoft Office OneNote {{supports}} encoding in all WMA codecs, and Windows Media <b>Encoder</b> supports all available bit rate and resolution options as well. Open source players like VLC media player can also do some encoding.|$|E
25|$|A vocoder, a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} voice and <b>encoder,</b> is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the <b>encoder,</b> the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.|$|E
25|$|FAAC or Freeware Advanced Audio Coder is a {{software}} project {{which includes the}} AAC <b>encoder</b> FAAC and decoder FAAD2. It supports MPEG-2 AAC as well as MPEG-4 AAC. It supports several MPEG-4 Audio object types (LC, Main, LTP for encoding and SBR, PS, ER, LD for decoding), file formats (ADTS AAC, raw AAC, MP4), multichannel and gapless encoding/decoding and MP4 metadata tags. The <b>encoder</b> and decoder is compatible with standard-compliant audio applications using {{one or more of}} these object types and facilities. It also supports Digital Radio Mondiale.|$|E
25|$|The auto <b>encoder</b> idea is {{motivated}} by {{the concept of a}} good representation. For example, for a classifier, a good representation can be defined as one that yields a better-performing classifier.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{bit rate}} of an encoded piece of audio, {{the quality of}} MP3 encoded sound also depends {{on the quality of}} the <b>encoder</b> {{algorithm}} as well as the complexity of the signal being encoded. As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with encoding algorithms, different encoders do feature quite different quality, even with identical bit rates. As an example, in a public listening test featuring two early MP3 encoders set at about 128kbit/s, one scored 3.66 on a 1–5 scale, while the other scored only 2.22. Quality is dependent on the choice of <b>encoder</b> and encoding parameters.|$|E
25|$|The MPEG-1 {{standard}} {{does not}} include a precise specification for an MP3 <b>encoder,</b> but does provide example psychoacoustic models, rate loop, and the like in the non-normative {{part of the original}} standard.|$|E
25|$|Once the stacked auto <b>encoder</b> is trained, its output {{can be used}} as {{the input}} to a {{supervised}} learning algorithm such as support vector machine classifier or a multi-class logistic regression.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{barcodes}} {{are used in}} some kinds of absolute 1D linear <b>encoder.</b> The barcodes are packed close enough together that the reader always has one or two barcodes in its field of view.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Chip Magazine (Germany) {{found that}} AAC files encoded with the Nero AAC <b>encoder</b> would consume {{as little as}} half of the space on a {{portable}} music player when compared to MP3 files of similar audio quality.|$|E
25|$|Hardware {{interrupts}} are signalled to the CPU {{using three}} inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate <b>Encoder</b> is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems {{that do not}} require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of additional software complexity. The interrupt controller {{can be as simple as}} a 74LS148 priority <b>encoder,</b> or may be part of a VLSI peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the Atari ST range of computers and Sharp X68000), which also provided a UART, timer, and parallel I/O.|$|E
25|$|Michael Everson (born January 9, 1963) is an American and Irish linguist, script <b>encoder,</b> typesetter, font designer, and publisher. He runs a {{publishing}} company called Evertype, {{through which he}} has published over a hundred books since 2006.|$|E
25|$|The <b>encoder</b> and decoder support MPEG-4 AAC LC, HE-AAC (AAC LC + SBR), and HE-AACv2 (LC + SBR + PS) Audio Object Types. Sample rates up to 96kHz, and {{multichannel}} audio {{up to six}} channels (5.1 surround) are supported.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime 6 added limited {{support for}} MPEG-4; {{specifically}} encoding and decoding using Simple Profile (SP). Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) features, like B-frames, were unsupported (in contrast with, for example, encoders such as XviD or 3ivx). QuickTime 7 supports the H.264 <b>encoder</b> and decoder.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} for Sirius Satellite Radio receivers {{as well as}} some of the uplink equipment, and the studio <b>encoder,</b> originated at Bell Labs in the late 1990s and subsequent years. The studio <b>encoder</b> was a result of Bell Labs efforts in statistical multiplexing of perceptual audio coded signals, a cousin of the MP3 standards. The waveform design for the terrestrial and satellite signals, as well as the early prototype receivers, were implemented in a FPGA logic and tested in the field to verify the performance of the receivers. This work was contracted by Sirius to Lucent Technologies, at the time a spinoff of AT Early prototypes were followed by a number of generations of ASIC custom designed chipsets, supplied at first by Agere Systems and later supplied by Agere Systems and their competitor ST microelectronics.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{found that}} Sony BMG and {{the makers of}} XCP also {{apparently}} infringed copyright by failing {{to adhere to the}} licensing requirements of various pieces of open-source software whose code was used in the program, including the LAME MP3 <b>encoder,</b> mpglib, FAAC, id3lib, mpg123 and the VLC media player.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} MP3 <b>encoder</b> can produce variable bitrate audio. MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it. VBR is used when {{the goal is}} to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with constant bitrate. Average bitrate is a type of VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread. The most evolved LAME MP3 <b>encoder</b> supports the generation of VBR, ABR, and even the ancient CBR MP3 formats.|$|E
25|$|If {{the symbol}} width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall {{naturally}} into two blocks: the lower block of 2n codes for coding single symbols, {{and the upper}} block of 2n codes {{that will be used}} by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2n for CLEAR and 2n + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2n+1 − 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2n − 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the <b>encoder,</b> but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the <b>encoder</b> can generate 2n − 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the <b>encoder</b> must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2n − 2 codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.|$|E
25|$|WMA can encode {{audio signals}} sampled {{at up to}} 48kHz with up to two {{discrete}} channels (stereo). WMA 9 introduced variable bit rate (VBR) and average bit rate (ABR) coding techniques into the MS <b>encoder</b> although both were technically supported by the original format. WMA 9.1 also added support for low-delay audio, which reduces latency for encoding and decoding.|$|E
25|$|MPEG-2 doubles {{the number}} of {{sampling}} rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of {{the information from the}} audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an <b>encoder</b> to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 <b>encoder.</b> Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.|$|E
25|$|FAAC {{stands for}} Freeware Advanced Audio Coder. The FAAC <b>encoder</b> is an audio {{compression}} computer program that creates AAC (MPEG-2 AAC/MPEG-4 AAC) sound files from other formats (usually, CD-DA audio files). It contains a library (libfaac) {{that can be}} used by other programs. AAC files are commonly used in computer programs and portable music players, being Apple Inc.'s recommended format for the company's iPod music player.|$|E
25|$|VLC {{can handle}} some {{incomplete}} files {{and in some}} cases can be used to preview files being downloaded. Several programs make use of this, including eMule and KCeasy. The free/open-source Internet television application Miro also uses VLC code. HandBrake, an open-source video <b>encoder,</b> used to load libdvdcss from VLC Media Player. A program named Livestreamer may utilize VLC as its main video stream player and will not work without one.|$|E
25|$|The FDK AAC <b>encoder</b> {{employs a}} more {{aggressive}} default low-pass filter than is used in other codecs. Higher frequencies are removed so that more bits are available to better describe sounds of lower frequencies, improving the overall quality for most combinations of recordings and listeners. In some, not completely rare, combinations the missing high frequencies are noticeable. The library allows overriding the low-pass filter setting, and in the highest VBR mode effectively applies no filter at all.|$|E
25|$|If lossy data {{compression}} {{is used on}} audio or visual data, differences from the original signal will be introduced; if the compression is substantial, or lossy data is decompressed and recompressed, this may become noticeable {{in the form of}} compression artifacts. Whether these affect the perceived quality, and if so how much, depends on the compression scheme, <b>encoder</b> power, the characteristics of the input data, the listener’s perceptions, the listener's familiarity with artifacts, and the listening or viewing environment.|$|E
25|$|Encoder–decoder {{frameworks}} {{are based}} on neural networks that map highly structured input to highly structured output. The approach arose {{in the context of}} machine translation, where the input and output are written sentences in two natural languages. In that work, an LSTM RNN or CNN was used as an <b>encoder</b> to summarize a source sentence, and the summary was decoded using a conditional RNN language model to produce the translation. These systems share building blocks: gated RNNs and CNNs and trained attention mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Moving light {{programs}} are often {{much more complex}} than that of stationary instruments. While {{it is possible to}} operate them with any console that uses the DMX512 Protocol, many lighting board operators find a console dedicated to moving light operation to be much more efficient. Oftentimes there will be <b>encoder</b> wheels which will control the Pan, Tilt, Focus, Zoom, Color, and Effects. Many people find visualization software (such as WYSWIG, VectorWorks, and others) to be helpful when programming while other people prefer a hard tactile control.|$|E
25|$|These assertions {{are tested}} {{on a large}} set of {{randomized}} input images, to handle the worst cases. The former IEEE 1180–1990 standard contained some similar precision requirements. The precision has a consequence on the implementation of decoders, and it is critical because some encoding processes (notably used for encoding sequences of images like MPEG) {{need to be able}} to construct, on the <b>encoder</b> side, a reference decoded image. In order to support 8-bit precision per pixel component output, dequantization and inverse DCT transforms are typically implemented with at least 14-bit precision in optimized decoders.|$|E
