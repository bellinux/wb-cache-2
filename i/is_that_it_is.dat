5|$|The {{most likely}} star-formation {{scenario}} for Betelgeuse <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a runaway star from the Orion OB1 Association. Originally {{a member of}} a high-mass multiple system within Ori OB1a, Betelgeuse was probably formed about 10–12 million years ago, but has evolved rapidly due to its high mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive {{the position and}} momentum of an electron. This {{became known as the}} Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E

5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> massive {{enough for the}} force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading {{to a state of}} hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{the formal}} {{structure of the}} Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but {{the presence of a}} practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process.

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|For {{a number}} of items {{relating}} to works of art near the coast of Asia Minor and in the adjacent islands, Pliny was indebted to the general, statesman, orator and historian Gaius Licinius Mucianus, who died before 77. Pliny mentions the works of art collected by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace and in his other galleries (XXXIV:84), but much of his information about the position of such works in Rome is from books, not personal observation. The main merit of his account of ancient art, the only classical work of its kind, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a compilation ultimately founded on the lost textbooks of Xenocrates and on the biographies of Duris and Antigonus.|$|E
25|$|The Champoeg name {{itself has}} an unknown origin.

5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all particles behave {{to an extent}} like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this {{became known as the}} uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{theories}} {{explaining the}} origin of this lake have been formulated. One version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows of the Jhelum River. The dendritic drainage pattern of the catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity. Lithologically, a variety of rock types have been discerned namely, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The Dachigam Telbal Nallah system is conjectured to follow two major lineaments. Discontinuous surfaces seen in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern. The water table cuts the hill slopes, which is evidenced by the occurrence of numerous springs in the valley. Seismic activity in the valley is recorded under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India, the most severe zone where frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected. In the year 2005, Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes measured at 7.6 on the Richter's scale, which resulted in deaths and the destruction of many properties, leaving many homeless.|$|E

5|$|The English law legal system, {{developed}} over the centuries, {{is the basis of}} common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.|$|E
5|$|The breed's {{history is}} {{uncertain}} before {{the middle of}} the 19th century. One theory is that it originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles {{at the time of the}} French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. The theory goes, that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel. Originally these dogs were large gundogs, colored lemon and white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap/toy breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with the gesture of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365. Another interpretation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a gospel book.|$|E

A further benefit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and {{feel guilty about}} their behaviour, leading {{them to go to}} great lengths to conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|One of Berhtwald's letters {{has been}} preserved, sent to Forthhere, Bishop of Sherborne, and asking Forthhere to intercede with Beorwold, the Abbot of Glastonbury, to ransom a slave. Another letter, this one {{addressed}} to Berhtwald, from Waldhere, Bishop of London, also survives. The main {{interest in the}} second letter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the oldest surviving letter close surviving in Western Europe. This second letter also relates that Waldhere and Berhtwald had attended a synod which can be dated to sometime between 703 and 705, where the kingdom of Wessex was threatened with excommunication. A charter witnessed by Berhtwald which mentions a supposed 706 council, numbered 54 by Sawyer, is now {{known to be a}} fake, although the witness list may be based on a legitimate 8th century charter that no longer survives. Likewise, a charter with Berhtwald as a witness and relating to the 716 Council of Clofesho is also known to be a 9th-century forgery, although again it may have been based on actual documents from the council.|$|E
