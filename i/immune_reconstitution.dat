40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} noncoding RNA {{molecules}} that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) -associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a B-cell-tropic virus associated with KS and B-cell lymphomas, encodes 12 miRNA genes {{that are highly}} expressed in these tumor cells.

We found that ectopic expression of miR-K 12 - 11 or miR- 155 leads to a significant expansion of the CD 19 + B-cell population in the spleen. Subsequent quantitative PCR analyses of these splenic B cells revealed that C/EBPβ, a transcriptional regulator of interleukin- 6 that is linked to B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, is downregulated when either miR-K 12 - 11 or miR- 155 is ectopically expressed. In addition, inhibition of miR-K 12 - 11 function using antagomirs in KSHV-infected human primary effusion lymphoma B cells resulted in derepression of C/EBPβ transcript levels. This in vivo study validates miR-K 12 - 11 as a functional ortholog of miR- 155 in the context of hematopoiesis and suggests a novel mechanism by which KSHV miR-K 12 - 11 induces splenic B-cell expansion and potentially KSHV-associated lymphomagenesis by targeting C/EBPβ...|$|R

An important issue with regard to recipient <b>immune</b> function and <b>reconstitution</b> after PTC {{is the extent to}} which, in addition to diminution of antihost allo-reactive donor T cells, the remainder of the nonhost allo-reactive donor T cell pool may be affected. To investigate PTC's effects on nonhost reactive donor CD 8  T cells, ova-specific (OT-I) and gp 100 -specific Pmel- 1  T cells were labeled with proliferation dyes and transplanted into syngeneic and allogeneic recipients. Notably, an intermediate dose (66  mg/kg) of PTC, which abrogated GVHD after allogeneic HSCT, did not significantly diminish these peptide-specific donor T cell populations. Analysis of the rate of proliferation after transplantation illustrated that lymphopenic-driven, donor nonhost reactive TCR Tg T cells in syngeneic recipients underwent slow division, resulting in significant sparing of these donor populations. In contrast, after exposure to specific antigens at the time of transplantation, these same T cells were significantly depleted by PTC, demonstrating the global susceptibility of rapidly dividing T cells after an encounter with cognate antigen. In total, our results, employing both syngeneic and allogeneic minor antigen-mismatched T cell replete models of transplantation, demonstrate a concentration of PTC that abrogates GVHD can preserve most cells that are dividing because of the accompanying lymphopenia after exposure. These findings have important implications with regard to <b>immune</b> function and <b>reconstitution</b> in recipients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation...|$|R

Good virologic responders (n = 26) {{were defined as}} those who had suppressed and maintained plasma viral load (VL) below the detection limit of the assay for at least 12 months.

RESULTS: Of the 26 good virologic responders, 20 (77 %) were on {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) compared with one (4 %) of the poor responders. Among the 26 good responders, baseline median levels of CD 38 +CD 8 + T cells were elevated, but had decreased significantly at 6 months (P < 0. 001) and at 12 months of therapy (P < 0. 001). Median levels of HLA-DR+CD 8 + T cells also decreased from baseline at 6 months (P < 0. 001) and at 12 months of therapy (P < 0. 001). Levels of CD 62 L+CD 4 + T cells increased steadily during the 6 and 12 months of therapy and reached levels observed among HIV-negative blood donors (P = 0. 07).

5000|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) is {{a standard}} curative procedure and results in a full <b>immune</b> <b>reconstitution,</b> if the treatment is successful. [...] Firstly, {{a bone marrow transplant}} requires a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between the donor and the recipient. [...] The HLA is distinct from person to person, which means the immune system utilizes the HLA to distinguish self from foreign cells. [...] Furthermore, a BMT can be allogenic or autologous, which means the donor and recipient of bone marrow can be two different people or the same person, respectively. [...] The autologous BMT involves a full HLA match, whereas, the allogenic BMT involves a full or half (haploidentical) HLA match. [...] Particularly, in the allogenic BMT the chances of graft-versus-host-disease occurring is high if the match of the donor and recipient is not close enough. [...] In this case, the T-cells in the donor bone marrow attack the patient's body because the body is foreign to this graft. [...] The depletion of T-cells in the donor tissue and a close HLA match will reduce the chances of graft-versus-host disease occurring. [...] Moreover, patients who received an exact HLA match had normal functioning T-cells in fourteen days. [...] However, those who received a haploidentical HLA match, their T-cells started to function after four months. [...] In addition, the reason BMT is a permanent solution is because the bone marrow contains multipotent hematopoietic stem cells [...] which become common lymphoid or common myeloid progenitors. [...] In particular, the common lymphoid progenitor gives rise to the lymphocytes involved in the immune response (B-cell, T-cell, natural killer cell).

We determined the effects of an exercise training program performed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on clinical and biological variables in a minor histocompatibility antigen-driven murine model of cGVHD treated with cyclosporine A.

D 2 male mice and {{were randomly assigned to}} an exercise (n = 11) or control group (n = 12).

To find new laboratory markers of therapy effectiveness, both B- and T- immune recovery were evaluated {{by means of a}} follow-up study of long-term treated HIV- 1 - infected patients, with a special focus on the measure of new B- and T-lymphocyte production. Methods A longitudinal analysis was performed in samples obtained from HIV- 1 -infected patients before therapy beginning and after 6, 12, and 72 [*]months with a duplex real-time PCR allowing the detection of K-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) and T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), as measures of bone-marrow and thymic output, respectively. A cross sectional analysis was performed to detect B- and T-cell subsets by flow cytometry in samples obtained {{at the end of the}} follow-up, which were compared to those of untreated HIV- 1 -infected patients and uninfected controls. Results The kinetics and the timings of B- and T-cell release from the bone marrow and thymus during antiretroviral therapy were substantially different, with a decreased B-cell release and an increased thymic output after the prolonged therapy. The multivariable regression analysis showed that a longer pre-therapy infection duration predicts a minor TREC increase and a major KREC reduction.
