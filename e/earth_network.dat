The aim of this work {{is to create a}} computer program intended for dimensioning of <b>earthing</b> <b>networks.</b> The <b>earthing</b> <b>networks</b> are the most convenient alternative in term of effective grounding and distribution of ponential. They are based on latiny a flat conductor network cables and connection of appliance parts to network. Introduction of the thesis is dedicated to explanation of grounding theory and to description of requirements essential for properly designed earthing system (dimensioning of earthing system). Following chapter brings description of computer program algorithm testing propriety of an assigned <b>earthing</b> <b>network</b> for a particular switchgear. The chapter also contains description of an user interface and explanation of all features, included in the program.
