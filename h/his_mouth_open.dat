5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open</b> and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} 14,623, {{far short of}} a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round, surpassing Rocky Marciano and setting {{the record for the}} longest active unbeaten streak in a {{professional}} career at 50–0. In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed {{it was part of the}} game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily with <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open.</b> Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued and his face started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 for Mayweather. In round 10, McGregor staggered across the ring and was in a bad way against the ropes as Mayweather landed some hard shots. With McGregor barely on his feet after a few unanswered punches, the referee waived the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.|$|E
500|$|The series {{makes use}} of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Beginning with the second season, visual effects became an {{in-house}} department. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series because a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects, such as in [...] "Nightshifter". Wide shots of the bank's exterior—featuring closed-off streets, police, and SWAT helicopters—were accomplished with visual effects. The series' catchphrase—"Scary just got sexy"—was added to a billboard in the background. For the episode [...] "Houses of the Holy", production did not want viewers {{to be able to}} determine that the [...] "angel" [...] was in actuality a priest. Thus, the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard. At times, the visual effects used were subtle. Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of [...] "No Exit"; director Kim Manners did not ask for it, but thought the addition [...] "made it really creepy". The episode [...] "Playthings" [...] featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs. The department added blood flowing from underneath him, and also made his fingers twitch and <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open</b> and close to create a more lifelike appearance.|$|E

500|$|Freedom of Speech {{depicts a}} scene of a local town meeting in which Jim Edgerton, the lone {{dissenter}} to the town selectmen's announced {{plans to build a}} new school, was accorded the floor as a matter of protocol. The old school had burned down. Once he envisioned this scene to depict freedom of speech, Rockwell decided to use his Vermont neighbors as models for a Four Freedoms series. The blue-collar speaker wears a plaid shirt and suede jacket. He has dirty hands and a darker complexion than others in attendance. The other attendees are wearing white shirts, ties and jackets. Although one of the men is wearing a wedding band, the speaker is not. Edgerton's youth and workmanlike hands are fashioned with a worn and stained jacket, while the other attendees, appear to be older and more neatly and formally dressed. He is shown [...] "standing tall, <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> his shining eyes transfixed, he speaks his mind, untrammeled and unafraid." [...] Edgerton is depicted in a way that resembles Abraham Lincoln. According to Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal, the closest figure in the painting is revealing a subject of the meeting as [...] "a discussion of the town's annual report". According to John Updike, the work is painted without any painterly brushwork. According to Robert Scholes, the work shows audience members in rapt attention with a sort of admiration of this lone speaker.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two key rulings {{clarifying}} {{the constitutionality of}} physical intrusions into the human body by police and other government agents. In Rochin v. California, police officers broke into the home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth. Officers were unable to force <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will. A unanimous Supreme Court held the involuntary stomach pump was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it [...] "shocked the conscience", and was so [...] "brutal" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] {{that it did not}} comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency. In 1957, the Court held in Breithaupt v. Abram that involuntary blood samples [...] "taken by a skilled technician" [...] neither [...] "shocked the conscience" [...] nor violated substantive due process. In Breithaupt, police took a blood sample from a patient suspected of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} while he lay unconscious in a hospital. The Court held that the blood samples were justified, in part, because [...] "modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection." [...] Additionally, the Court mentioned in dicta that involuntary blood samples may violate the constitution if officers do not provide [...] "every proper medical precaution" [...] to the accused.|$|E

Aslan urges her to repair all the injured soldiers on the field to good health, which she does, while he restores all those petrified. The next day, Aslan crowns the four children Kings and Queens of Narnia and Peter the High King.|$|E

60|$|Even Brooke was startled, and Saxton {{sat down}} with all his {{customary}} assurance gone out of him. <b>His</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> loosely, he seemed to grow suddenly limp, and his cigar shook visibly in his nerveless fingers.|$|R
60|$|My apprehensions were justified. Mitchell topped his ball. It rolled {{twenty yards}} into the rough, and nestled under a dock-leaf. <b>His</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened,</b> then {{closed with a}} snap. He came over to where Millicent and I were standing.|$|R
