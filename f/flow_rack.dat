50|$|The main {{advantage}} of carton <b>flow</b> <b>rack</b> over static rack or shelving systems is that merchandise remains better organized {{and easier to}} find or pick. With carton <b>flow</b> <b>rack,</b> the product is automatically rotated on a first-in, first-out basis. Merchandise is stocked {{in the rear of}} the carton <b>flow</b> <b>rack</b> and moves toward the picking station in front on an inclined shelf equipped with specially designed roller track. When a carton is removed from the picking station, the next one in line rolls to the front. Carton flow always keeps items within reach. Inventory is easier to monitor and control since products are fully visible at all times.|$|E

A Gravity <b>Flow</b> <b>Rack</b> (GFR) system {{is one of the}} very well adopted MH system and very practical in order to optimize the effectiveness of the JIT production system. This paper presents a review on the actual implementation of a GFR system at an automotive component's assembly line in an accord to improve its existing MH system. The main purpose of this implementation is to reduce the material transfer activities while reducing the occupied space; hence reducing the overall production cycle time (CT). The implementation outcomes show significance improvement on the productivity and not to mention the material handling's time.

40|$|AbstractSince {{the past}} two decades, small, medium and large {{automotive}} industries have grown rapidly and globally in Malaysia {{in line with the}} increasing of demand from customers. To increase market share and sustain in industry, most of the companies continuously applied world-class manufacturing techniques such as Lean Manufacturing, Toyota Production System, Just-in-Time (JIT), Kanban, Kaizen, Six Sigma and others. In order to achieve world class manufacturing status such as on-time delivery, high quality and high production efficiency, an effective material handling system is necessary to support production processes. Based on observation at a JIT automotive assembly line of a local automotive manufacturer in Shah Alam, {{it was found that the}} existing material storage system used was bulk storage called as wire mesh and trolley. Also, the material handling activities were run without referring to any standard or procedure. Therefore, the aims of this case study are to design a new storage system for an automotive component which is Air Cleaner by using computer aided design software, CATIA V 5 R 20 and to evaluate its’ effectiveness by using a computer aided manufacturing software, DELMIA Quest. Improvement will be made on the existing material handling system by introducing new standard poly-boxes and a gravity <b>flow</b> <b>rack</b> system for material handling activities. The results obtained from the computer simulation were compared to the existing performance of the line.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the effectiveness of Just In Time implementation by adopting the Lean Manufacturing principle. The lean manufacturing principle here is referring to the systematic and non-wasteful manufacturing operation; using the set takt time and production scheduling based on the customer’s demand. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the existing manufacturing operation at Cylinder Head Cover manufacturing process using Material and Information Flow Chart (MIFC), and identify the waste. From here, effective kaizen activities such as i) Work Standardization ii) U-shaped layout formation, and iii) Improved Material Handling System were recommended and implemented. Consequently, continuous flow process at the Cylinder Head Cover manufacturing line is achieved. Kanban system is the heart of Just In Time operation. To initiate kanban, the aforementioned activities must be in-placed. To complement the kanban operation, the establishment of i) kanban tool, ii) effective <b>flow</b> <b>rack</b> system and iii) appropriate layout is vital. With these implementation, the manufacturing performance were then measured according to the identified lean metric; such as i) productivity, ii) inventory level, iii) lead time, iv) manpower requirement and v) space utilization. These lean metrics were analyzed and compared against the manufacturing operation before the implementation was carried out. The research outcomes revealed that the company had gained significant improvement in term of performance and profit. It can be concluded that this research is successfully carried out and the same approach can be adopted in other manufacturing line. Ultimately this organization (the case study subject) is targeting to implement company-wide lean manufacturing operation.

Incast congestion is more serious for within rack network as compared to out of rack traffic. Figure  7 also shows that incast congestion sets in early in three-tier topology than in fat-tree topology. Similar results are obtained for outcast congestion. Hence incast and outcast concerns are serious in three-tier network topology especially for applications with flows within a TOR switch. In fat-tree topology incast and outcast congestion affects throughput more profoundly when out of <b>rack</b> <b>flows</b> increase.|$|R

40|$|To achieve {{reductions}} in the power consumption of the data center cooling infrastructure, the current strategy in data center design {{is to increase the}} inlet temperature to the rack, while the current strategy for energy-efficient system thermal design is to allow increased temperature rise across the rack. Either strategy, or a combination of both, intuitively provides enhancements in the coefficient of performance (COP) of the data center in terms of computing energy usage relative to cooling energy consumption. However, this strategy is currently more of an empirically based approach from practical experience, rather than a result of a good understanding of how the impact of varying temperatures and <b>flow</b> rates at <b>rack</b> level influences each component in the chain from the chip level to the cooling tower. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a model to represent the physics of this strategy by developing a modeling tool that represents the heat <b>flow</b> from the <b>rack</b> level to the cooling tower for an air cooled data center with chillers. This model presents the performance of a complete data center cooling system infrastructure. After detailing the model, two parametric studies are presented that illustrate the influence of increasing rack inlet air temperature, and temperature rise across the rack, on different components in the data center cooling architecture. By considering the total data center, and each component's influence on the greater infrastructure, it is possible to identify the components that contribute most to the resulting inefficiencies in the heat flow from chip to cooling tower and thereby identify the components in need of possible redesign. For the data center model considered here it is shown that the strategy of increasing temperature rise across the rack may be a better strategy than increasing inlet temperature to the rack. Part II of this work expands on this paper with further parametric studies to evaluate the robustness of this data center cooling strategy, with conditions for optimal strategy deployment. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

The main reason for solving this problem is to reduce the costs of data racks cooling. Another problem to be solved is a reverse flow in the servers, thus not cooled, occuring due to the underpressure in the recirculation zones. In order to solve the problem, the experimental and numerical model of 27 U data rack fitted with 10 pieces of server models with a total input of 10 kW was created. Different configurations of layout of elements affecting the flow in the inlet area of the data rack were compared.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{interested}} in the mathematical modeling and approximation of the turbulent flow with strong anisotropy for the case of <b>flow</b> in a <b>rack</b> station. Turbulent models based on Boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption are traditionally employed for the solution of these types of flows. Linear eddy viscosity model and the assumption of isotropic Reynolds stress tensor are typically used in many cases. This leads to certain limitations in the cases of either separated flow or flow with significant curvature of the mean flow. The application of full Reynolds stress model is suitable for this case but it introduces at least seven additional equations and the model has much higher demand for computing time, grid parameters and discretization schemes. Therefore the Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Model (EARSM) is used here. This model is based on two equations k – omega turbulence model with the nonlinear eddy viscosity model and explicit terms for anisotropic parts of the Reynolds stress tensor. The computational requirements are similar to the standard k – omega model. The numerical and experimental results from PIV measurement are compared...|$|R

40|$|Trash racks are {{set before}} inlet sumps of a pumping station with wet-pits {{in order to}} block trash. The flow fields before and behind the trash rack were numerically {{simulated}} and flow fields in the inlet sump were calculated using the simulated velocity distribution of the section behind the trash rack as the inlet boundary condition. Local head loss of trash-barriering increases {{with the increase of}} blockage ratio of the trash rack. When waterweeds block upper part of the trash <b>rack,</b> <b>flow</b> pattern behind the trash rack will be extremely turbulent, flow velocity of lower part of inlet section of inlet sump will increase, flow velocity of the upper part will decrease, and even backflow appears, which will deteriorate the flow pattern and increase head loss in the inlet sump. Trash-barriering has little effect on velocity distribution of impeller inlet section. Trash-barriering will not only increase head and power of the pump but also decrease the flow. For the example of the pumping station: when blockage ratios of the trash racks are 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7, operating cost will increase by 13 %~ 43 % than that of without trash racks. Therefore, the trash rack should be cleaned up timely...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{understanding}} of how the materials feeding design at a workstation impacts the assembly process performance, in terms of manufacturing flexibility, process support, materials planning and work task efficiency. Design/methodology/approach The empirical data are based on two embedded case studies performed in close corporation with two Swedish automotive companies; additional observations from more than 20 company visits in Japan, and small-scale case studies performed in Japanese companies. To fully assess the work measurement figures, video recordings, work instructions and layout drawings were used to plot the operatorswalking patterns, and it was then possible to map the whole work cycle for an operator. Industrial engineers, anagers, group leaders, team leaders and operators were interviewed. Based on the literature review and personal experience from the small-scale case studies carried out in Japan, the existing assembly systemscomponent racks were conceptually re-designed. This led to two hypothetical assembly systems, which could be used for understanding the impact of materials feeding design on assembly process performance. The design of the new component racks and the choice of packaging types were made together with practitioners. Findings The paper shows that the design of component racks and choice of packaging types have a major impact on the assembly process performance. Component racks with a large depth and small width and tailored packages create important advantages over traditional Swedish component racks designed for EUR-pallets. Line stocking is not always the best choice for materials feeding, but this paper shows that line stocking, especially in Swedish assembly systems, can be improved. Sequencing can thus be reduced, resulting in fewer problems when there are sequence breaks in the production <b>flow.</b> Component <b>racks</b> with small packages and large depth increase the work task efficiency, volume, mix, new products and modification flexibility. For example, free space is an important issue for these types of flexibilities. Component racks that are portable and easy to rearrange, together with free space, greatly facilitate handling of new product introductions or modifications of products. The new and old component can be displayed and fed to the same workstation, and if there is a larger change a whole segment of a component rack can easily be replaced by a new one between work shifts. Research limitations/implications - The scope of the study is limited to the conditions at workstations. Consequences for the materials flow upstream (i. e. internal materials handling, warehousing, transport, supplier processes, etc.) are not included, but must in further studies also be considered to avoid sub-optimisation. Originality/value - The paper highlights the fact that a shift in focus is necessary when designing workstations with component racks in Swedish companies, meaning that operators become the customers rather than the transport company or materials handler...|$|R
40|$|The Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) {{has been}} {{developed}} jointly by Boeing Corporation, Huntsville, Alabama and Honeywell Engines & Systems, Torrance, California to meet the internal thermal control needs for the International Space Station (ISS). The ITCS provides heat removal for the critical life support systems and thermal conditioning for numerous experiment racks. The ITCS will be fitted {{on a number of}} modules on the ISS. The first US Element containing the ITCS, Node 1, was launched in December 1998. Since Node 1 does not contain a pump to circulate the fluid it was not filled with ITCS fluid until after the US Laboratory Module was installed. The second US Element module, US Laboratory Module, which contains the pumps and all the major ITCS control hardware, was launched in February 2001. The third US Element containing the ITCS, the US Airlock, was launched in July 2001. The dual loop system of the ITCS is comprised of a lowtemperature loop (LTL) and a moderate-temperature loop (MTL). Each loop has a pump package assembly (PPA), a system flow control assembly (SFCA), a threeway mixing valve (TWMV), several <b>rack</b> <b>flow</b> control assemblies (RFCA), cold plates, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, pump bypass assembly (PBA) and a heat exchanger. In addition, the MTL has an additional TWMV, a payload regeneration heat exchanger (P/RHE) and a manual flow control valve (MFCV). The LTL has a service performance and checkout unit (SPCU) heat exchanger. The two loops are linked via one loop crossover assembly (LCA) providing cross loop capabilities and a single PPA, two-loop functionality. One important parameter monitored by the ground stations and on-orbit is the amount of fluid leakage from the ITCS. ISS fluid leakage is of importance since ITCS fluid is costly to re-supply, may be difficult to clean up in zero-g, and if uncontained could lead to equipment failures and potential hazards. This paper examines the nominal leakage observed over period of a year of on-orbit operation and compares this with analysis predictions. This paper also addresses the off-nominal leakage and a fluid transfer event causing significant changes in accumulator quantity...|$|R
