2500|$|Esri's {{transition}} to the ArcGIS platform, starting with the 1999 release of ArcGIS 8.0, rendered incompatible an extensive range of user-developed and third-party add-on software and scripts. A minority user base resists migrating to ArcGIS because of changes in scripting capability, functionality, operating system (Esri developed ArcGIS Desktop software exclusively for the Microsoft Windows operating system), {{as well as the}} significantly larger system resources required by the ArcGIS software. [...] Esri has continued support for these users [...] [...] ArcView 3.x is still available for purchase, and ArcInfo Workstation is still included in a full ArcGIS ArcInfo licence to provide some editing and <b>file</b> <b>conversion</b> functionality that has not been included to date in ArcGIS. [...] Other issues with ArcGIS include perceived high prices for the products, proprietary formats, and difficulties of porting data between Esri and other GIS software.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the workshop question: Can data {{generated from the}} infancy of the digital age be ingestible by software today? We have prototyped a set of e-services that serve {{as a framework for}} understanding content preservation, automation and computational requirements on preservation of electronic records. The framework consists of e-services for (a) finding <b>file</b> format <b>conversion</b> software, (b) executing <b>file</b> format <b>conversions</b> using available software, and (c) evaluating information loss across conversions. While the target audience for the technology is the US National Archives, these basic e-services are of interest to any manager of electronic records and to all citizens trying to keep their files current with the rapidly changing information technology. The novelty of the framework is in organizing the information about <b>file</b> format <b>conversions,</b> providing services about <b>file</b> format <b>conversion</b> paths, in prototyping a general architecture for reusing existing third-party software with import/export capabilities, and in evaluating information loss due to <b>file</b> format <b>conversions.</b> The impact of these e-services is in the widely accessible conversion software registry (CSR), conversion engine (Polyglot) and comparison engine (Versus) which can increase the productivity of the digital preservation community and other users of digital files...|$|R

50|$|Another {{strategy}} for ensuring the long-term stability of digital files is to periodically migrate data from {{one form of}} media to anotherâ€”usually from an outdated medium to a more current format. This process applies to both file formats and storage media. Simply transferring data from one medium to another, such as from a CD to DVD, without changing {{the format of the}} file, is also a form of preservation called Refreshing. Documentation of any <b>file</b> <b>conversions</b> or media transfers is stored in the records as well for historical reference.|$|R
5000|$|... conv:This option {{specifies}} <b>file</b> content <b>conversion</b> semantics. It {{is possible}} for the filesystem drivers to convert the newline conventions in files, between LF termination and CRLF termination, on the fly as files are read and written. By default this conversion is entirely disabled. The filesystem drivers can perform <b>conversion</b> for some <b>files,</b> attempting to auto-detect what files to convert based upon the extension portion of the filename, or globally for all <b>files.</b> These three <b>conversion</b> levels are specified as conv=b (for [...] "binary"), conv=a (for [...] "auto-detect"), and conv=t (for [...] "text"), respectively. The latter two options carry an inherent risk of corrupting non-text <b>file</b> data. No <b>conversion</b> at all is the default.|$|R
