50|$|Newer {{additions}} to toaster technology include wider toasting slots for bagels and thick breads, {{the ability to}} toast frozen breads, and the option to heat a single side or slot.

Several attachments were available for the Mixmaster, including a juice extractor, drink mixer, meat grinderfood chopper, and slicershredder.

Under National’s leadership, according to the publication, people now had more money, pensions, cattle, sheep, university scholarships, overseas trips, radios, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, <b>electric</b> <b>toasters,</b> houses, motor vehicles, and telephones.

5000|$|Before this, {{while working}} for the Washington Electric Company in 1906, Copeman {{developed}} a design for an electric version of the gas stoves which had been available in Britain and the USA for several decades. Development of the idea took several years, but in 1912 the Copeman Electric Stove Company was formed {{in the city of}} Flint, Michigan to produce the Copeman Electric Stove (also marketed as the [...] "fireless cooker"). Westinghouse Electric Corporation bought the company in 1917, moved production to Mansfield, Ohio, and continued to develop and improve the stove. From 1913, another of Copeman's inventions, a toaster with automatic bread turner, was also produced by the Copeman Electric Stove Company. <b>Electric</b> <b>toasters</b> were a recent invention at that time - the first commercially successful version was patented in July 1909 - and the bread had to be turned manually once the first side had been toasted. During a shopping trip, Copeman's wife Hazel gave them the idea for a toaster which turned the bread without manua intervention, and in 1914 a patent for what Copeman called the Automatic Toaster was filed in Hazel's name. Five other toaster-related patents were granted to both Lloyd and Hazel during the same year. [...] The invention of the pop-up toaster in 1926 superseded Copeman's innovations, however. [...] A company called Copeman Laboratories Company had been established in Flint, Michigan during the year 1918 to allow Copeman to dedicate his time to inventing, although he also {{spent a lot of time}} at his farm in Farmer's Creek, where he would lock himself in the basement - sometimes for up to a week, with his wife bringing him meals on a tray [...] - and develop new ideas and products. Examples of his work at this time, which met with varying success, included injecting chickens with solutions to make their meat taste like beef; pioneering experiments in the development of latex; the Copeman Lubri-Cap, grease-filled paper cups for lubricating wheel bearings (the patent for this product was [...] bought for $178,000 by the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation, the same corporation that also owned the patent rights to the Zerk fitting); Flexo-Line travel clothes lines, which are still manufactured today; a device to use dry ice to cool bottles of beer; self-extinguishing cigarettes; and a rust-reducing latex coating for motor vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>toaster,</b> sliced bread was toasted by placing it in a metal frame or on a long-handled toasting-fork and holding it near a fire or over a kitchen grill.

Crompton kept his company {{at the cutting edge of}} electrical engineering. Despite having invested heavily in promoting and installing direct current systems, following the War of Currents, Crompton quickly developed alternating current equipment as well.

Broilers designed for cooking fish are usually part of the stove and are located below, and unlike many Western-style grills, are not full width. Built-in ovens large enough to bake or roast are uncommon; in their place, work-top multifunction convection microwaves are used. Most kitchens have electric exhaust fans.
