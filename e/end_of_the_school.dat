5|$|In January 1905, Yamashita {{got a job}} {{teaching}} judo at the U.S. Naval Academy. There {{were about}} 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, Robert L. Ghormley. The position ended at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year.

Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the Naval Academy throughout {{the first six months of}} 1906.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 {{there were}} 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were {{operated}} {{by the government and}} 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6percent of ACT enrollments.|$|E
