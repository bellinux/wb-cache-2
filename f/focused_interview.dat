Case reportWe report a case of head-and-neck and mediastinal emphysema due to oral hyperpressure inducing parotid acini rupture. The aim is to highlight the importance of precise interview of patient and family so as to identify this mechanism. DiscussionPneumoparotid is a rare cause of swelling induced by insufflation into Stensen's duct.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two articles to be submitted for publication. The first, a literature review, makes visible common influences on science teaching self-efficacy beliefs and also points to potentially invisible validation concerns regarding the instrument used. The second investigates the participants' invisible science teaching self-efficacy beliefs and, {{through the use of}} a more <b>focused</b> <b>interview,</b> makes those beliefs visible. Science teaching self-efficacy beliefs are science teachers' perceptions of their abilities to teach science effectively. The construct "teaching self-efficacy" originated in social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1977). The first article reviews the mixed results from teaching self-efficacy research in science contexts. The review focuses upon factors that facilitate or inhibit the development of self-efficacy beliefs among science teachers across stages of their careers. Although many studies of science teaching self-efficacy beliefs have utilized the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument - STEBI (Enochs & Riggs, 1990; Riggs & Enochs, 1990), this review also includes non-STEBI studies in order to represent diverse lines of research methodology. The review's findings indicate that antecedent factors such as science activities in and out of school, teacher preparation, science teaching experiences and supportive job contexts are significant influences on the development of science teaching self-efficacy beliefs. The review also indicates that the majority of these studies are short term and rely on a single STEBI administration with the collection of antecedent/demographic and/or interview data. The second article documents a study that responded to the above literature review findings. This study utilized multiple STEBI administrations during the preservice and beginning year of teaching for two science teachers. Rather than general questions, these participants were asked item specific, yet open-ended, questions to determine what events or experiences the participants felt influenced their survey answers. This methodological approach was chosen to add clarity to the STEBI scores and to add another layer in the ongoing process of instrument validation. Unlike some studies in science teaching self-efficacy, both participants' STEBI scores continued to increase as they transitioned from preservice to beginning teachers. The participant responses to the <b>focused</b> <b>interview</b> probes also validated their STEBI scores 77...|$|E

This expansion causes humans to put pressure on converting valuable farmlands to urban uses. New residential, industrial, commercial, and socioeconomic factors influence the expansion of a living and working place. Two facets of study are conducted in this research, one of Geography, and Sociology, brought under one research framework. The first purpose is to examine changes in land use in Muncie and Dela are County between 1988 to 1996. Furthermore, it also seeks to study the rate of urban expansion, and direction. The second purpose is to identify the underlying causative factors of urban sprawl.

Research analysis indicated that using remotely sensed data to monitor land use changes is feasible and cost-effective.
