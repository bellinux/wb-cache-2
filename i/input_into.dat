According to Computer Reseller News, Muglia pushed developers to visit customers, created customer advisory boards and led other efforts to incorporate customer <b>input</b> <b>into</b> product development at Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the character's creation, and some aspects of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} loads {{entering the}} surface waters in Germany via the groundwater path were quantified. For this purpose, {{the results of}} a nitrogen balance model (Bach et al., 2000), which considers the most important N-inputs to the soil (manure, inorganic fertiliser, atmospheric deposition) and N-removals from the soil through crop harvest, were combined with the groundwater residence time/denitrification model WEKU (Kunkel and Wendland, 1997; Wendland et al., 2001). The modelled groundwater-borne nitrogen <b>inputs</b> <b>into</b> surface waters were validated using results from the MONERIS model (Behrendt etal., 2000) concerning riverine nitrogen retention, nitrogen inputs from point sources as well as nitrogen inputs through direct run-off (drainage etc.). In the vicinity of surface waters and in solid rock areas, the groundwater borne nitrogen <b>inputs</b> <b>into</b> surface waters are considerably high compared to the <b>inputs</b> <b>into</b> the aquifer due to predominantly unfavourable de-nitrification conditions and short residence times of groundwater. In the North German lowlands, however, the groundwater-borne nitrate <b>inputs</b> <b>into</b> surface waters are considerably low compared to the <b>inputs</b> <b>into</b> the aquifer. There, the residence time of groundwater in the aquifer is high and the groundwater is predominantly oxygen free and contains pyrite and/or organic carbon compounds, allowing a halving of the nitrate loads in the groundwater within a period of 1 to 4 years (see Wendland and Kunkel, 1999) ...|$|R

Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the film if it were made by them.

5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} <b>input</b> <b>into</b> {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E

In the following close season, Chapman became the first professional manager in charge of England, albeit in an ad hoc unofficial capacity, for a summer tour of Europe. He {{did not have any}} <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the selection process, the team being determined by the FA's International Selection Committee, but did advise on tactics and gave pre-match team talks. Chapman was in charge for a friendly against Italy in Rome on 13 May 1933, which finished 1–1, and England's 4–0 win over Switzerland a week later.|$|E

In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E
5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E

Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|Magia is a {{collection}} of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads. It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogotá, when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Columbia representative said that the recording process was simple and went perfectly fine. But for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and no <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the rhythmic structure or artistic production of the songs.|$|E

5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona had {{virtually}} secured their La Liga title by {{the start of}} 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated {{in the second half of}} the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health. After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi. Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13million. He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff. Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his <b>input</b> <b>into</b> the team's attack had increased exponentially; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.|$|E
