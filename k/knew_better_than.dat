25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers {{who would have been}} good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> any other general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E

500|$|In {{the race}} Oxbow broke third {{out of the}} gate and settled behind pacesetters Frac Daddy and Freedom Child, {{completing}} a quarter mile in 23 seconds. As usual, Oxbow wanted to run close to the front, Stevens <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to fight with him, and so, as in the Derby, horse and rider once again chased the speed horses at fractions described as [...] "suicidal". At the half-mile pole Oxbow was a neck off the leader, who clocked at 0:46.66, and on the backstretch, Oxbow went to the front, reaching the three-quarter mile mark at 1:10.95, running the second fastest half- and three-quarter mile fractions at that point in the race since Secretariat's 1973 record-setting performance. Oxbow was still in front by a half length at the mile post. At the top of the homestretch, Palace Malice and Oxbow were nose and nose but Oxbow tired, and finished second by three lengths to Palace Malice with Kentucky Derby winner Orb third, [...] lengths behind Oxbow. [...] His speed figure for the Belmont was 98, the same as in the Risen Star Stakes.|$|E

2500|$|Alvar {{has been}} criticized by his contemporaries for an overly nationalistic and {{colonialist}} viewpoint on the Spanish language. In his final year {{as director of the}} Real Academia Española, Alvar responded harshly to the European Commission (an institution of the European Union) after it requested that Spain revoke its law that all typewriters, computers and printers sold domestically include the tilde, a Spanish diacritical mark. Alvar declared that [...] "he tilde is our tradition and our identity." [...] He also received criticism for a statement he made in 1991 about indigenous languages, stating, [...] "Mexico <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anybody else the value of having a language that unifies, that liberates the indigenous communities from their backwardness and misery...the path to freedom runs through hispanization." ...|$|E

[...] She became the only female political officer in the British forces and received the title of [...] "Liaison Officer, Correspondent to Cairo" [...] (i.e. to the Arab Bureau {{where she had been}} assigned).

He faced a fractured group of representatives, divided between dedicated reformers intent on enacting the Emperor's reforms immediately, {{and a host of}} conservative aristocrat representatives who vehemently opposed the emancipation of the serfs. Konstantin was particularly scornful of the numerous aristocratic protests against his plan, commenting once that they were not even worthy for him to spit upon. On several occasions, Konstantin only just managed to keep the Committee from disintegrating under the strain. The post was a difficult one and the pressures wore on the Grand Duke. His enemies retaliated with ludicrous and poisonous gossip: [...] "Konstantin", they said, [...] "was insane, the result of too much masturbation".|$|E

Unharmed, he wandered to Quicken Loans Arena where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting Cavalier fans. [...] "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?.

I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{complained to}} Victor Huguet (a French liaison officer serving with the British) about Wilson (6 October), but also told Wilson that French was getting “more unreasonable” and asked Wilson whether he (Murray) should resign; Wilson {{informed}} Billy Lambton, French’s secretary, {{of both of}} these incidents. Murray also (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him. Murray later wrote (in 1930) [...] "Why did I stay with (this) War Office clique when I knew I was not wanted? I wanted to see Sir John through. I had been so many years with him, and <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone how his health, temper and temperament rendered him unfit, in my opinion, for the crisis we had to face. ..... the senior members (of GHQ staff) entirely ignored me, as far as possible, continually thwarted me, even altered my instructions." [...] He also claimed that Wilson's disloyalty had left him the impossible job of managing Sir John alone. Rawlinson noted in his diary that Murray became “a cipher at GHQ” (28 Nov 1914), was disliked by his subordinates (4 December) and that Sir John French often ignored his staff “chiefly because Murray is incapable of managing them and getting any good work out of them” (6 Dec 1914). Edmonds later claimed that Murray sometimes falsified the timing of orders, but he was given away by the time stamp which the duty clerk placed on them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{response}} of the Polish majority to the Jewish Holocaust covered an extremely wide spectrum, often ranging from acts of altruism {{at the risk of}} endangering their own and their families’ lives, through compassion, to passivity, indifference, and blackmail. Polish rescuers faced threats from unsympathetic neighbours, the Polish-German Volksdeutsche, the ethnic Ukrainian pro-Nazis, as well as blackmailers called szmalcowniks, along with the Jewish collaborators from Żagiew and Group 13. The Catholic saviors of Jews were also betrayed under duress by the Jews in hiding following capture by the military police, which resulted in the Nazi murder of the entire networks of Polish helpers. Holocaust testimonies confirm that, trapped in the ghettos, the Jewish criminal underworld took advantage of inside information about the socio-economic standing of their own compatriots. The Jewish looters <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone else [...] "where to dig for valuables" [...] wrote Isaiah Trunk and Rubin Katz. In 1941, the operational guidelines for the mass anti-Jewish actions to be carried out with the participation local gentiles were issued by Reinhard Heydrich at the onset of German-Soviet war. Massacres of Polish Jews by the Ukrainian and Lithuanian auxiliaries were committed in over 30 locations across formerly Soviet-occupied parts of Poland, including in Brześć, Tarnopol, Białystok, Łuck, Lwów, Stanisławów, and in Wilno where the Jews were murdered along with the Poles in the Ponary massacre at a ratio of 3-to-1. National minorities routinely participated in pogroms led by OUN-UPA, YB, TDA and BKA. Local participation in the Nazi German [...] "cleansing" [...] operations included the Jedwabne pogrom of 1941. The Einsatzkommandos were ordered to organize them in all eastern territories newly occupied by Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, statistics of the Israeli War Crimes Commission indicate that less than one tenth of 1 per cent of native Poles collaborated with the occupiers.|$|E
