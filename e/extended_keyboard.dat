25|$|By early 1985 much Macintosh {{software}} required 512K of memory. Apple sold {{an official}} memory upgrade for the Macintosh 128K, {{which included a}} motherboard replacement effectively making it a Macintosh 512K, {{for the price of}} US $995. Additionally, Apple offered an 800KB floppy disk drive kit, including updated 128K ROMs. Finally, a Mac 128K could be upgraded to a Macintosh Plus by swapping the logic board as well as the case back (to accommodate the slightly different port configuration) and optionally adding the Macintosh Plus <b>extended</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Any of the kits could be purchased alone or together at any time, for a partial or full upgrade for the Macintosh 128K. All upgrades were required to be performed by professional Apple technicians, who reportedly refused to work on any Macintosh upgraded to 512K without Apple's official upgrade, which at US$700 was much more expensive than about $300 for third-party versions.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards {{are designed to}} send scancodes to the operating system, rather than directly sending characters. From there, the series of scancodes is converted into a character stream by keyboard layout software. [...] This allows a physical keyboard to be dynamically mapped to any number of layouts without switching hardware components – merely by changing the software that interprets the keystrokes. It is usually possible for an advanced user to change keyboard operation, and third-party software is available to modify or <b>extend</b> <b>keyboard</b> functionality.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Apple <b>Extended</b> <b>Keyboard's</b> {{case was}} sloped upward towards the rear {{so that when}} viewed from the side it formed a continuous convex curve.

This made for a relatively large and heavy case. The plastic of the case shell below the keyboard section on top was serrated, a common detail found on many Apple products of the era.|$|R

5000|$|Paul McNulty is {{a builder}} of {{historical}} pianos, {{described by the}} New Grove as [...] " [...] famous for the high standard of his instruments." [...] Within the community of builders, McNulty is noted for his efforts to extend the production of historically informed instruments later into history: while he has built many fortepianos in 18th-century style, he has also progressively sought to span {{the gap between the}} fortepiano (the cradle of modern historical-piano construction) and the fully modern piano that emerged around the last third of the 19th century. The expanding diversity of McNulty's productions has thus helped [...] "provide an opportunity to <b>extend</b> <b>keyboard</b> performing practice to include the piano repertory of the 19th century" [...] (New Grove).|$|R

2500|$|Today, most {{keyboards}} use one {{of three}} different mechanical layouts, usually referred to as simply ISO (ISO/IEC 9995-2), ANSI (ANSI-INCITS 154-1988), and JIS (JIS X 6002-1980), referring roughly to the organizations issuing the relevant worldwide, United States, and Japanese standards, respectively. (In fact, the mechanical layouts referred such as “ISO” and “ANSI” comply to the primary recommendations in the named standards, while each of these standards in fact also allows the other way.) Keyboard layout in this sense may refer either to this broad categorization or to finer distinctions within these categories. For example, [...] Apple Inc produces ISO, ANSI, and JIS desktop keyboards, each in both extended and compact forms. The <b>extended</b> <b>keyboards</b> have 110, 109, and 112 keys (ISO, ANSI, and JIS, respectively), and the compact models have 79, 78, and 80.|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} hardware, the new {{motherboard}} is a cleaner design that drew less power and resolved audio noise issues that {{interfered with the}} Ensoniq synthesizer in the original motherboard. Over four times more RAM is built-in, with double the ROM size, and an enhanced ADB microcontroller provides native support for sticky keys, mouse emulation, and keyboard LED support (available on <b>extended</b> <b>keyboards).</b> Hardware shadowing of Text Page 2 was introduced, improving compatibility and performance with the classic Apple II video mode. The clock battery is now user-serviceable, being placed in a removable socket, and a jumper location was added to lock out the text-based control panel (mainly useful in school environments). Support for the Apple-IIe-to-IIGS upgrade was removed, and some cost-cutting measures had some chips soldered in place rather than being socketed. As the firmware only worked in this motherboard and no new firmware updates were ever issued, users commonly referred to {{this version of the}} IIGS as the [...] "ROM 3".|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the Renaissance and Enlightenment, theorists {{as varied}} as Nicola Vicentino, Francisco de Salinas, Fabio Colonna, Marin Mersenne, Constantijn Huygens, and Isaac Newton {{advocated}} the use of meantone tunings that were <b>extended</b> beyond the <b>keyboard's</b> twelve notes, and hence {{have come to be}} called [...] "extended" [...] meantone tunings. These efforts required a concomitant extension of keyboard instruments to offer means of controlling more than 12 notes per octave, including Vincento's Archicembalo (shown in Figure 3), Mersenne's 19-ET harpsichord, Colonna's 31-ET sambuca, and Huygens' 31-ET harpsichord. Other instruments <b>extended</b> the <b>keyboard</b> by only a few notes. Some period harpsichords and organs have split D/E keys, such that both E major/C minor (4 sharps) and E major/C minor (3 flats) can be played without wolf fifths. Many of those instruments also have split G/A keys, and a few have all the five accidental keys split.|$|R
