5|$|A {{video of}} Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2009, {{engaging}} in a discussion {{with a group of}} Tea Party protesters on health care reform, began circulating on the Internet and soon went viral. The <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> noted for its civility, in contrast to the explosive character of several other discussions between members of the 111th Congress and their constituents that had occurred over the summer.|$|E
5|$|Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) offer Pembleton (Andre Braugher) a {{promotion}} to lieutenant and the vacant shift commander position working alongside Gee (Yaphet Kotto). Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him {{not to mention the}} offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides not to take the job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner. The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, a 25th-anniversary {{celebration for}} The Blues Brothers {{was held at}} Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. Attendees {{included}} Landis, former Universal Studios executive Thom Mount, film editor George Folsey, Jr., and cast members James Brown, Henry Gibson, Charles Napier, Steve Cropper, and Stephen Bishop. It featured a press conference, a panel discussion where Dan Aykroyd joined by satellite, and a screening of the original theatrical version of the film. The panel <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> broadcast direct to many other cinemas around the country.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} international communication on cultivated plant taxonomy, organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands. One development promoting <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by {{the first issue of}} Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy. This filled a gap left when the American journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s. Another development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy. Hortax also publishes Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} at the Paley Center for Media in New York City on October 20, 2010. It {{was shown in}} conjunction with the Robert M. Batscha University Seminar Series. The Paley Center screening included an online streaming broadcast—the first simultaneous film screening and panel question-and-answer for online and local audiences. The panel <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> moderated by The New York Times journalist Noam Cohen, and featured both co-directors, in addition to Wikimedia Foundation representative Samuel Klein and Wikipedian in Residence at the British Museum Liam Wyatt. After the event, SnagFilms subsequently made the film available for free for six days to viewers in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{started on}} May 23 in Lethbridge {{and went on}} to the other Canadian cities of Saskatoon, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, London, Winnipeg, Calgary, Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Edmonton, and Red Deer. London was added mid-tour because of popular demand. The London {{performances}} were hosted by Men Against Sexual Trafficking and the London Anti-Human Trafficking Committee. The final performances of the tour were conducted at the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer from October 2 to 6. After the Saturday matinée in each city, a panel <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> held with both the audience and anyone else who wanted to attend, the purpose being to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere. The final talkback panel in Red Deer was attended by about 70 people.|$|E
5|$|Very minimal impact {{occurred}} {{as a result}} from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received 25mm (1in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States {{a few days after the}} storm's recurvature. No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent had {{informed}} Diefenbaker that Parliament would be dissolved in April, for an election on June 10. A final parliamentary conflict was {{sparked by the}} suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt E.H. Norman {{in the midst of}} allegations made by a United States Senate subcommittee that Norman had communist links. Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public, and defended him again after his death, suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false. It quickly became apparent that the information released by the Americans might have come from Canadian intelligence sources, and after severe questioning of Pearson by Diefenbaker and the other parties' foreign policy critics, Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth, but had passed a security review. The minister evaded further questions regarding what information had been provided, and the <b>discussion</b> <b>was</b> cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12.|$|E
