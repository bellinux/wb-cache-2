Thereby, polyhydroxyprolinol derivatives 9 a-e and 9 h-j were obtained from aromatic ketones and aliphatic aldehydes in good to excellent yields of 65 - 91 %.

40|$|A novel {{synthetic}} {{strategy for}} the potential analogue 17 of the immunosuppressive agents subglutinols A (3) and B (4) was investigated. Neither of these molecules, nor any analogues, have been synthesized previously. The route selected employed a cis -isopropylidene control group in the tether to facilitate the key synthetic step, an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction. This approach afforded the tricyclic core of 18 in an efficient and direct manner. The Diels-Alder precursor 20 was constructed from <b>D-isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (24), vinylmagnesium chloride (22), and 4 -iodo- 3 -methoxymethoxymethyl-penta- 1, 3 -diene (21). The synthesis of the lactone 19 and the attempts to remove the MOM group from 18 were also investigated. Unfortunately, however, the final target analogue 17 was not realized due to unsuccessful attempts at removing the MOM group from 18. Thus, an efficient route to the decalin core was established, though the coupling of the lactone 19 awaits further study...|$|E

The grown crystals possess blocky morphology with (100) (010) and (001) prominent faces. Thermal analysis shows that the crystals are stable up to 162 degrees C and decompose immediately after melting. The optical transmission lower cutoff is determined to be 300 nm. The Kleinman conjecture, applicable to second-order nonlinear coefficients, was violated as the optical transmission was dependent {{on the state of}} the incident light polarization. The principal dielectric frame of the crystal was determined using conoscopy and is found to be rotated about the crystallographic b-axis. Non-collinear SHG rings up to second order were observed which helped to locate phase matching directions.

L-Ascorbic acid (100 ?mg/kg/d, intraperitoneally (i. p.)) - and L-ascorbic acid 2 -glucoside (50 ?mg/kg/d, i. p.) -treated rats showed an approximately 1. 3 -fold increase in the ratio of liver weight (LW) to body weight (BW), when compared to saline (as control) -, L-dehydroascorbic acid (150 ?mg/kg/d, i. p.) - and <b>D-isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (150 ?mg/kg/d, i. p.) -administrated rats on day 3 after PH.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on inhibitors of two important enzymes: alpha-amylase and steroid 5 α-reductase. Ascorbic acid, a reported inhibitor of alpha-amylase, has been investigated to determine which of its structural features are necessary for its inhibitory action. These studies have involved the synthesis of thirteen derivatives of L-ascorbic acid and three derivatives of <b>D-isoascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> incorporating systematic modifications of the functional groups present in both molecules. We have found that the ene-diol moiety in ascorbic acid is crucial for its inhibitory action. Modification of this functionality significantly reduces inhibitory activity. Ascorbic acid, and some of its derivatives, are shown to be potent inhibitors of barley-malt, porcine-pancreas, human-saliva, bacterial- and fungal alpha-amylases. Kinetic studies to determine the mode of inhibition of ascorbic acid demonstrate that it has characteristics of a competitive inhibitor of alpha amylase. SAR studies on inhibitors of steroid 5 α-reductase were focused on three main areas; modification of known inhibitors to improve potency and isozyme selectivity, synthesis and investigation of a potential new class of inhibitor and investigation into the utility of a novel pharmacophore. A 4 -methyl-octahydrobenzoquinolinone derivative, incorporating a photoisomerisable phenylazo group at the C 9 position was synthesised, as was a dihydrophenanthrene- 2 -carboxylic acid derivative containing a styryl substituent at C 7. A series of piperidone derivatives was synthesised to investigate their potential as steroid 5 α-reductase inhibitors.

40|$|The lipase from Pseudomonas sp. K- 10 catalyzes {{enantioselective}} hydrolyses of methyl sulfinylacetates. These {{are used}} in the asymmetric SPAC (Sulfoxide Piperidine And Carbonyl) transformation, a multistep reaction of a sulfinylacetate, an α-methylene aldehyde and piperidine, to produce a γ-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated ester. Superior asymmetric induction is obtained using methyl sulfinylacetates which incorporate aromatic electron-withdrawing groups. Diastereomerically and optically pure sulfinylacetates incorporating chiral auxiliaries in the ester functionality are also synthesized. Double diastereoselection occurs when these {{are used in}} the SPAC reaction, with the chirality of the sulfoxide always assuming the dominant stereochemical role. The lipase from Pseudomonas sp. K- 10 is also used to resolve γ-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated esters via irreversible acylations in hexane. The substrates which incorporate a relatively small or large side chain are resolved efficiently, but with opposite selectivity, while those of intermediate size are acylated with poor induction. When used in tandem with the asymmetric SPAC reaction, γ-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated esters are obtained in good yield and high optical purity. One such chiron is used in the synthesis of (3 S, 4 S) - 4 -amino-S-cyclohexyl- 3 -hydroxypentanoic acid, an analogue of the unusual amino acid statine. Monoacylations of pentitol-derived diols catalyzed by lipase from Candida cylindracea are described, wherein the symmetry of the product is reduced with respect to the staring material; chirons containing three asymmetric centers are generated by these biocatalytic desymmetrization processes. Some of these monoacylations are accomplished with high stereoselectivity, depending on the structure of the diol. Changing the protecting groups on the diols has little effect on the stereoselectivity. An extensive review of the syntheses of the stereoisomers and analogues of castanospermine is given. Methodology based on an asymmetric allylation reaction is then described which allows access to eight previously unreported stereoisomers. Three of these are synthesized; 1, 6, 8 -triepicastanospermine via desymmetrization of an adonitol-derived meso diol, and 1, 7, 8 -triepicastanospermine and 1, 6, 7, 8 -tetraepicastanospermine from L-arabinose and D-xylose respectively.

40|$|Conductive inks have {{received}} increasing attention over {{past few decades}} owing to their applications for printed devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), circuit, flexible displays, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and photovoltaics. Because of the lowest resistivity and anti-oxidation properties in air, silver inks are the currently favored conductive inks for printed electronics. However, the high cost and low electro-migration resistance of silver inks which can cause circuit failure under high humidity, limit their applications on a large scale. Copper, owing to its low cost, low resistivity (1. 7 × 10 - 8 Ω m, {{similar to that of}} silver) and high electro-migration resistance, has become the promising material for conductive inks. However, copper particles suffer from the oxidation. This problem can be solved by stabilizing copper particles by surfactants. The stabilizers which act as barriers hinder the percolation paths of electrons, resulting in low conductivity (high resistivity) of the printed patterns. A conventional method to overcome the above obstacle is high temperature sintering in an oven (> 250 ℃). Nevertheless, for applications of low-cost and flexible electronic devices on heat-sensitive substrates, a low sintering temperature is essential. To decrease sintering temperature, several methods, such as laser process, decreasing particle size, photonic sintering, and using copper-based metal-organic decomposition (MOD), have been reported. In this thesis, new strategies to obtain highly conductive copper layers by lower temperature (≤ 200 °C) sintering were put forward. This thesis contains 5 chapters. First chapter is Introduction. Recent progress of low temperature sintering for electro conductive layers is discussed. In addition, the strategies and methods of the research in this thesis are outlined. In the second chapter, alkylamine-stabilized copper fine particles and their inks were prepared. One common way to lower the sintering temperature is decreasing particle size (100 nm). In the first step, copper fine particles (280 nm) were synthesized by a one-pot reaction utilizing <b>D-isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> as a mild reductant. For sintering processes, an oxidative preheating of the film was used for the formation of tight connections between particles. Then a following reductive sintering using a 3 % hydrogen in nitrogen gas at 200 °C and 250 °C enabled the achieving of high conductivities of copper films. The results showed that the thermal-preheating step in air generated convex surfaces, nanorods or nanoparticles among particles successfully. This was owed to the inside-out diffusion of copper ions from copper particles and the diffusion of oxygen ion in the opposite direction. The generated convex surfaces, nanorods or nanoparticles increased the contacts between particles and thus facilitated the sintering of particles in the following reductive sintering process. As a result, resistivities of 12. 2 × 10 - 8 and 7. 8 × 10 - 8 Ω m of copper films were achieved at 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. In the third chapter, low temperature deposition of metallic copper from metal-organic compound systems is discussed. To achieve low resistivity at a lower sintering temperature, copper-based MOD inks with scalability and simplicity were also studied. In this work, the influence of various copper sources (i. e., copper(II) formate tetrahydrate and copper(II) acetate monohydrate) in MOD inks on the resistivity of films was compared. Commercially available copper particles (0. 4 - 2. 5 μm) were introduced into the inks to replace the organic components for higher conductivity and reliability of the obtained copper films. The results demonstrated that the resistivity of sintered copper films decreased with the decrease of size of the added commercial particles. The lowest resistivity of 2. 6 × 10 - 7 Ω m was achieved using the inks containing 0. 4 μm of added copper particles after sintering at 120 °C under nitrogen. In addition, polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized copper particles (PVP-Cu) with a size range of 127 ± 20 nm instead of the commercial ones were used for preparing MOD inks to demonstrate the general applicability of this method. The resistivity of the obtained copper film using PVP-Cu particles at the sintering temperature of 100 °C was 7 × 10 - 6 Ω m. These results demonstrated that the use of copper particles to replace organic components in MOD inks effectively led to the low resistivity of film after sintering at the temperature as low as 100 °C under nitrogen. In the forth chapter, in order to further decrease the resistivity, polydispersed-submicron copper particles stabilized with decomposable polymer (polypropylene carbonate, PPC) as a main part and a self-reducible copper formate/ 1 -amino- 2 -propanol (CuF-IPA) complex as an additive were chosen to prepare the MOD inks. The surface modification of copper particles with PPC, using of smaller poly-dispersed particles, and self-reducible copper complex were favorable to obtaining highly conductive copper films at low temperature sintering. The lowest reported resistivity (8. 8 × 10 - 7 Ω m) at the sintering temperature of 100 °C under nitrogen was achieved. Such a low sintering temperature with low resistivity was proved to be a result of the dual promotion effects of aminolysis of PPC with IPA and the pyrolysis of CuF-IPA complex. PPC broke down into smaller molecules by aminolysis with IPA, which reduced the steric stabilization for copper particles, and thus enabled particle coalescence and sintering more easily. The generated copper particles from the pyrolysis of CuF-IPA complex directly contributed for creating connections among particles and higher packing density. The fifth chapter contains conclusions of this thesis. The methods and conductive inks developed in our study are promising for flexible and low-cost printing electronic devices...|$|E
