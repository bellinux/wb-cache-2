40|$|With systems {{operating}} at higher frequencies, parasitic effects are taking larger {{shares of the}} voltage and timing budget of a circuit. Also smaller devices have shrunken landscape for components, increasing coupling between critical physical features.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 A {{high speed}} motion neutron {{radiography}} system has been developed at Oregon State University which is capable of taking high speed neutron radiographs of events which occur {{on the order of}} one to two milliseconds or more. This system was used previously to demonstrate the application of {{high speed motion}} neutron radiography techniques to two phase flow and to the burning of solid propellants. Results of this effort showed the burning patterns and relative distributions of the propellant and gases during the burning of these propellants. This system has been modified and the techniques adapted and further developed for the investigation of similar phenomena which occur with the burning of liquid propellants. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the new system and techniques for the investigation of liquid streams which were used to simulate the injection of liquid propellants into a pressurized steel chamber. Examples of the application of these new techniques to liquid streams injected into an unpressurized steel chamber are presented. The <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>system</b> is capable of taking neutron radiography movies at frame rates up to about 11, 000 frames per second, although about 5000 frames per second proved to be adequate for liquid streams. In order to use the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>system</b> for liquid streams several modifications and improvements were investigated, especially with regards to the synchronization method.

Photodetectors, waveguides, wavelength demultiplexers and modulators have all been fabricated in silicon-based technology. The capability of fabricating light-emitting devices (LEDs) in silicon-based technology would greatly expand the use of silicon as an optoelectronic material. Applications where silicon-based light emitters could be utilized include data transceivers for local area network, communication, optical interconnects for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>system</b> integration, and low-cost high resolution displays to name a few.

40|$|A new <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>system</b> for recording, processing, and {{analysis}} of vocal fold vibrations has been developed. Results obtained with this system will be discussed from the technical {{as well as the}} medical viewpoint. By using a digital high speed camera, the laryngeal movement can be recorded with a maximum speed of about 5600 frames per second and a sequence length of up to 8192 single frames. For examination purposes the recorded sequences can be viewed bidirectionally in different slow motion rates. An application-specific written adaptive semi automatic motion analysis software is used to calculate and plot the glottograms for selected points on each vocal cord. From the obtained data, statistical measures like speed, acceleration rates, the fundamental frequency, amplitudes and perturbation parameters can be calculated. Based on the digital films, motion plots and characteristic statistics, this approach of laryngeal examination is a practicable method which supports the possibilitie s of quantitative and graphical analysis of the moving vocal folds and overcomes the disadvantages of the presently common examination methods...|$|E
30|$|Test unit: {{on-board}} {{output unit}} (LED): The Spartan 3 E target FPGA board contains 8 -bit output unit with 8 on-board {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) [20]. In the testing setup of the experiment, the MISO signal of the controller has been mapped with a single LED of the on-board 8 -bit LED unit and the resultant command responses and read/write data patterns were observed. Since the SPI mode is a serial bus interface mode, the SD card gives response serially through its output port to the master. The MISO line signal is left shifted in every clock cycle to observe a series of patterns in 8 -bit LED unit available in the FPGA board. Additionally, in the output section, a clock down converter unit has been designed and integrated {{to slow down the}} speed of response of the controller for better perception. This is a little compromise with the speed of operation in testing and verification section. However, introduction of this section is purely optional and while integration of the controller with real-time <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>system</b> this unit is to be omitted.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”IEEE 802. 11 {{wireless}} LANs are {{evolving into}} a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>system</b> by adopting MIMO technologies. Currently the standard deals with transmission for one user over a link. In this paper, {{we consider the}} MIMO technique of spatial multiplexing that enables multiple users to receive packets over the down-link simultaneously. It takes advantage of multiuser diversity in the space and time domains, supposing that each antenna independently performs link adaptation for each subchannel. Through analysis, we show that multiuser transmission has performance improvement over the single-user case. However, by using adaptive data splitting over spatial multiplexing, {{the performance of the}} single-user transmission is enhanced, and even better than that of multiuser case for small multiuser diversity. To exploit the multiuser diversity extensively, we apply a scheduling algorithm that considers channel condition of each subchannel. Simulation results show the multiuser transmission has higher link utilization than the single-user case for large mul-tiuser diversity. To implement this, the system requires further considerations to modify ACK policy, and to mix conventional and MIMO-capable stations. I...|$|E

Our approach {{to develop a}} hand-shape classifier, trained using computer animation, along with its application in dynamic gesture recognition is described. The system developed operates in real time and provides accurate gesture recognition. It operates using a single low resolution camera and operates in Matlab on a conventional PC running Windows XP.

In recognising dynamic gestures we utilise both hand shape and hand position information; these are two o f the main features used by humans in distinguishing gestures.
