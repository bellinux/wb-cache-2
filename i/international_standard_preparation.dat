The standardization of antiserum against the <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>preparation</b> of human chorionic gonadotrophin, the determination of antiserum specificity using appropriate controls, and the value of antiserum in the diagnosis of pregnancy and conditions associated with high urinary levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|The International Standard for Hyaluronidase {{is derived}} from a blend of four batches of bovine {{testicular}} hyaluronidase which had been purified so as to contain approximately 400 units per milligram. The material was mixed with β-lactose, and lyophilized. Tablets were made from the dried mixture, and were examined extensively in the USA {{in order to establish}} their homogeneity and to relate their potency to the current USA “turbidity reducing unit” (TRU). On the basis of this examination, the International Unit for hyaluronidase is defined as the activity of 0. 1 mg of the <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Preparation,</b> and is very nearly equal to one TRU. It is recommended that the Standard be employed only for assaying testicular hyaluronidase, and that certain precautions be taken in its use...|$|E
40|$|To {{check the}} potency of DPT vaccine, <b>standard</b> <b>preparations</b> of the components, namely Adsorbed Diphtheria Toxoid, Pertussis Vaccine and Adsorbed Tetanus Toxoid, are needed. Since WHO <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Preparations</b> are {{distributed}} only in limited amounts, WHO has suggested that each member country should develop a National Standard, which is matched against In­ternational <b>Standard</b> <b>Preparation.</b> An Indonesian National Standard of DPT vaccine (lot 1) has been prepared and lyophilized at the National Institute of Health in Tokyo. The potency of the National Standard of Adsorbed Diphtheria Toxoid is determined by antibody ti­tration in Guinea pigs. Antitoxin titres are determined by cell culture method.

40|$|The {{disappearance}} of phe 3 -oxytocin, val 3 -oxytocin and oxytocin from {{the circulation of}} male rats was shown {{to be due to}} qualitatively similar mechanisms, that is, it depends on uptake in the kidneys and organs of the splanchnic vascular area. However, compared to phe 3 -oxytocin and oxytocin (whose half-lives were essentially similar) val 3 -oxytocin took twice as long to reach half its initial blood concentration. In lactating rats the mammary glands probably participated in the uptake of phe 3 -oxytocin, but the rate of {{disappearance of}} val 3 -oxytocin was not different from that in non-lactating animals. In male nephrectomized rats without splanchnic circulation, phe 3 -oxytocin, unlike val 3 -oxytocin, was quickly distributed in a volume equal to two-thirds of the total body water. Using oxytocin as the standard, val 3 -oxytocin and phe 3 -oxytocin were more potent when assayed on a superfused uterus or on a rat uterus in vivo than when assayed by the pharmacopoeial method (1958) on the isolated uterus in an organ bath. The difficulties of assaying oxytocin analogues against oxytocin (or the <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>preparation)</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{measurement}} of anti-HBs {{is used to}} evaluate the response to hepatitis B vaccination in health care workers and to optimize postexposure management. The different guidelines for hepatitis B vaccination and booster policy imply that the {{measurement of}} anti-HBs levels by different assays is accurate and consistent, yielding comparable quantitative results. We measured anti-HBs levels in 200 serum samples from patients and health care professionals by nine different anti-HBs assays and compared the quantitative results and the performance characteristics of the different test systems. The assay specificity ranged between 96. 8 and 100 % when sera from individuals without a vaccination history and with negative anti-HBc status were defined as true negatives. Sensitivity ranged between 93. 5 and 100 %. A high number of sera showed discrepancies between measurements by the different systems. The mean coefficient of variation between the different measurements was 47. 1 % (range, 15. 0 to 201. 0 %), and the factors of multiplication ranged from 2. 8 to 105. Hemolysis or lipemia did not seem to influence the measurement, and {{there was no difference between}} anti-HBc-positive and -negative individuals. The classical enzyme immunoassays tend to find lower anti-HBs levels than the automated systems, with higher values by the Abbott AXSYM assay. The serial dilution of the <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>preparation</b> was measured accurately by most of the assays. In conclusion, the quantitative measurement of anti-HBs levels is not reliable, even though an international standard is used for the calibration of the systems. Some systems showed specific problems that should be addressed by the manufacturers...|$|E

40|$|Pitfalls in {{the method}} for demonstrating {{antinuclear}} antibodies (ANA) by the indirect immunofluorescence technique are described {{and the use}} of <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> <b>preparations</b> outlined. Determination of the optimal border dilution dividing positive from negative results is discussed. Each laboratory is a unique setting; it must define its own method, which should rarely be changed. One should not rely on copying methods from other laboratories or commercial firms, but the reproducibility of the nuclear substrate, the conjugate, and other variables should be controlled daily by the use of a control serum which has been related to the WHO <b>standard</b> <b>preparation</b> for ANA of the homogeneous type. Since many sera contain mixtures of different ANA, the results of routine tests are best expressed in titres or expressions of the intensity of fluorescence. The ANA test using the immunofluorescence technique should be used as a screening method for other tests allowing a more defined interpretation of the ANA. Each laboratory should individually determine the border between positive and negative results. Therefore about 200 sera from local healthy controls equally distributed over sex and age, and 100 sera from local patients with definite SLE should be tested. Since the local clinicians should become acquainted with this border it should rarely be changed. Finally each laboratory should participate regularly in national and international quality control rounds, where sera known to be difficult to interpret are tested. The judgment of the organisers of these rounds should stimulate improvements in the participating laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Parvovirus B 19 is a {{single-stranded}} DNA virus {{which causes}} severe disease in immunocompromised patients and foetal loss in pregnant women. It {{is classified as}} an Erythrovirus and this genus also comprises two related viral genotypes (so-called LaLi/A 6 (genotype 2) and V 9 (genotype 3)) which appear to be immunologically indistinguishable from Parvovirus B 19. Serological and nucleic acid test (NAT) systems to detect Parvovirus B 19 -mediated infection are commercially available; however, some NAT systems are genotype-specific. <b>International</b> <b>standard</b> <b>preparations</b> of Parvovirus B 19 IgG and DNA have been produced for assay standardisation purposes, and to ensure consistency of assay manufacture and performance. Immunological assays, such as B-cell ELISpot, T-cell stimulation, and cytokine detection {{can also be used}} to confirm exposure to Parvovirus B 19. Immunohistochemical techniques, employing commercially available monoclonal antibodies, are used to localise the virus in infected tissue and Parvovirus B 19 viral antigen can also be detected in serum and plasma using antigen-specific ELISA. NAT systems have also been described to detect newly identified parvoviruses such as human bocavirus (HBoV), PARV 4, and PARV 5, although absolute confirmation of clinical diseases associated with these agents is required. This chapter describes the current status of detection systems for all the aforementioned parvoviruses, with particular emphasis on Erythrovirus detection by serological, NAT, and immunological approaches...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of results of assays obtained at the Laboratory of Hygiene, Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, Canada, shows {{that the problem of}} assaying tetanus toxoids differs with the two test-animals used, the mouse and the guinea-pig. In the mouse, the slopes of dosage-response curves of plain and adsorbed toxoids are clearly not similar, so that separate standards are required for their assay. In the guinea-pig, the slopes of immunization curves for these two types are similar, and one standard should suffice.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine whether the surface of young adult human articular cartilage was smooth as defined by industrial standards for metal surfaces. Human articular cartilage with attached subchondral bone from the midregion of the trochlear surface of the talus was obtained postmortem from 7 donors (aged 29 +/- 9 y). The specimens were processed using multiple fixation techniques prior to scanning electron microscopy and 3 -dimensional stereoscopic analysis. Three-dimensional stereoscopic data showed that 92. 78 +/- 16. 90 % of the articular surface was devoid of surface irregularities and was considered to be smooth.

Based on initial data which showed that the current WHO 2 nd <b>international</b> <b>standard,</b> IS for G-CSF (09 / 136) or alternatively, a PEG-G-CSF standard with a unitage traceable to the G-CSF IS may potentially serve as the IS for PEG-G-CSF products, two candidate preparations of PEG-G-CSF were formulated and lyophilized at NIBSC. These preparations were tested by 23 laboratories using in vitro bioassays in a multi-centre collaborative study. Results indicated that {{on the basis of}} parallelism, the current WHO 2 nd IS for G-CSF or any of the PEG-G-CSF samples could be used as the <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> for PEG-G-CSF <b>preparations.</b> However, because of the variability in potency estimates seen when PEG-G-CSF preparations were compared with the current WHO 2 nd IS for G-CSF, a candidate PEG-G-CSF was suitable as the WHO IS.

The risk of injuries while snowboarding is higher compared with alpine skiing, with the wrist as the dominant injury region. In contrast to increasing numbers regarding helmet usage, acceptance for wearing wrist protectors is decreasing. To date the market offers a variety of wrist protection products for snowboarding which feature different protective elements. However, there are no minimum performance standards for snowboarding wrist protectors worldwide. Currently a harmonized <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> is under <b>preparation</b> to provide guidelines for minimum safety performance for all wrist protectors used in snowboarding. In the course of this aim, a multi body system (MBS) was developed to acquire further knowledge about the functional requirements of wrist protectors. To evaluate a worst case scenario different falling scenarios of snowboarders were simulated to calculate the resulting loads in the upper extremity. The simulations were carried out using the multi body dynamics software package SIMPACK 9. 0 (SIMPACK AG, Wessling, Germany). The comprehensive model contains a human model, a model of a ski slope and a model of a snowboard. The parameterized models adapt to the body height, the body weight and the shoe size of the snowboarder. In this study a model of a 50 percentile adult (1. 80 m, 78. 4 kg) was used. To evaluate a worst case scenario well-known falling situations of snowboarders were simulated.
