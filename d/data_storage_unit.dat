40|$|The {{increase}} of the quantity of data {{that needs to be}} stored gave rise to different storage media. From stone in pre-history, to punched tape and cards {{from the beginning of the}} information age, to today's optical, magnetic and semiconductor <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> the need for better ways of storing data is still increasing. One of the most widely used <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> is the hard disk drive. It consists of several rigid platters coated with magnetic material and magnetic heads, which magnetize the surface of the platter (write) or detect the magnetisation of the surface (read). The data is stored on the platter in tracks divided into sectors and magnetized areas of different orientation. The movable parts of the HDD are vulnerable to external factors and with time they can wear out and fail, a fact which reduces the hard disks reliability. Despite this, HDD's are the primary choice for <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> in personal computers because of their high capacities and relatively low prices. The most popular alternative and competition to hard disks today are semiconductor <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> solid-state drives. SSD’s do not have moveable parts. The data in a SSD can be stored in faster, non-persistent DRAM memory or the slower, persistent flash NAND memory, which retains data without power. This makes them very fast, not affected by external factors and energy efficient compared to HDD's but they are also more expensive and can store less data.

40|$|Abstract — Retrieving local {{information}} {{is vital for}} efficient search and rescue operations in a disaster area after a natural disaster strikes buildings and their residents. This local information includes {{the information about the}} neighborhood (e. g., transportation plan of the area, usage types of buildings), buildings within the neighborhood (e. g., layout plans, contents of buildings and the number of residents) and their residents (e. g., personal and health information). Although it seems reasonable to store the required local information in a centralized database, experiences indicate that search and rescue teams cannot retrieve local information from these centralized databases since the information infrastructure is usually damaged or overloaded immediately following a disaster. The Search and Rescue Data Access Point (SR-DAP) system is designed for storage and retrieval of the required local information in/from <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> that are deployed on buildings. This study aims to empirically evaluate and analyze two key technologies, namely RFID tags and wireless sensors as local <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> within SR-DAP.

40|$|A high {{capacity}} <b>Data</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit</b> {{is key to}} the store and forward mode of operation for numerous science and commercial missions and services that generate very high data volumes at high data rates. This paper introduces just such a commercial service {{in the form of the}} CASCADE service. In order for this service to succeed, one of the key spacecraft components is the <b>Data</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit,</b> or DSU. Besides {{high capacity}}, the <b>Data</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit</b> needs to have a relatively random access, low power consumption, and a reasonable size and mass. There are currently two storage technologies that appear to be candidates for the <b>Data</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit.</b> These are DRAM based Solid State Recorders, and space qualified RAIDs based on commercial hard disk drives. The space qualified RAIDs are not as proven as the Solid State Recorders. However, the space qualified RAIDs currently have a significant advantage in terms of size, mass, and power for a unit with the capacity required by Smallsat and Microsat missions. This paper discussed a third technology now coming on the horizon which promises to have all the benefits of the RAID drives with none of the technical problems of spinning drives. This technology makes use of rugged FLASH memory modules as the storage medium. The paper discusses the new DSU now under development at Routes AstroEngineering. This unit promises to deliver much more storage density with high reliability and speed normally associated with the Solid State Recorder at a recurring cost that is planned to be competitive with the RAID spinning drive technology. The unit is scalable, capable of storage densities of up to 10 Tbits in total, with up to 8 individual memory channels sharing this memory array.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{distributed}} caching in dense wireless small cell networks (SCNs) is studied using mean field games (MFGs). In the considered SCN, small base stations (SBSs) are equipped with <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> and cooperate to serve users' requests either from files cached in the storage or directly from the capacity-limited backhaul. The aim of the SBSs is to define a caching policy that reduces the load on the capacity-limited backhaul links. This cache control problem is formulated as a stochastic differential game (SDG). In this game, each SBS takes into consideration the storage state of the other SBSs {{to decide on the}} fraction of content it should cache. To solve this problem, the formulated SDG is reduced to an MFG by considering an ultra-dense network of SBSs in which the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium is shown to be guaranteed. Simulation results show that this framework allows an efficient use of the available storage space at the SBSs while properly tracking the files' popularity. The results also show that, compared to a baseline model in which SBSs are not aware of the instantaneous system state, the proposed framework increases the number of served files from the SBSs by more than 69 %.

Users can see and analyze the structure of a simple, flat file system (with no directories) provided with Zion, or simulate commercial structures such as FAT or NTFS. They can even create their own implementations and run them through the simulator to analyze their behaviors. Zion runs on Windows machines, and the application is provided with a DLL that includes the interfaces of a file system and a volume manager. These interfaces allow students to create a project in Visual Studio using any. NET language (3. 0 or above), and build their own file system or volume manager. The tool gives the users the power to adjust simulated architectural parameters such as volume and block size, or performance factors such as seek and transfer time.
