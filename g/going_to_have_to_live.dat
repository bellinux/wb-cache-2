2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies {{in a way that would}} [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than they have been in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E

Those are certainly my two most important constituents — or three, with my wife." ...|$|E
40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards. However, it also raises some interesting questions about sovereignty and responsibility in foreign affairs...|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{head coach}} Marv Levy told his team, [...] "You've got thirty more minutes. Maybe it's {{the last thirty}} minutes of your season.

Weeks later, New Zealand coach Stephen Kearney announced that Marshall had been dropped as the team's captain. Marshall said, [...] "It was the proudest moment of my career, captaining my country. I was lucky enough that I got to break the record for most caps as Kiwi captain.

5000|$|As skeptical as I am, I {{think the}} contemplation of the multiverse is an {{excellent}} opportunity {{to reflect on the}} nature of science and on the ultimate nature of existence: why we are here.... In looking at this concept, we need an open mind, though not too open. It is a delicate path to tread. Parallel universes may or may not exist; the case is unproved. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with that uncertainty. Nothing is wrong with scientifically based philosophical speculation, which is what multiverse proposals are.

5000|$|In October 2010, film {{director}} James Cameron donated $1 million to oppose California's Prop 23, {{which would have}} overturned AB 32—California's climate change legislation. In response to this donation, McElhinney and McAleer made a short film; it alleged that passage of AB 32 would increase Californians' energy costs, and suggested that Cameron, who'd been quoted as saying, [...] "we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with less," [...] lives a more energy-extravagant life than most Americans. [...] The Independent said that this attack advertisement was [...] "tapping a rich rhetorical vein", but ignores Cameron's distributor, 20th Century Fox, which buys carbon offsets.|$|E
50|$|The bulk of {{the book}} focuses on a British writer, Nathan, who is {{attempting}} to sell {{an idea for a}} claustrosphere commercial to Plastic Tolstoy, owner and chief marketer of the company which builds them. The commercial represents a change in emphasis for the advertising campaign; up to now claustropheres have been sold as a kind of fall-back insurance, just in case the environment collapses. However, now that virtually everybody owns at least a basic model, sales are falling and the company is having to try and sell upgrade and improvement packages instead. The new advertising, therefore, attempts to convince people {{for the first time that}} the environment truly is doomed and they are inevitably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in their claustrospheres.|$|E
