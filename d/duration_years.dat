40|$|Background: India, {{a land of}} agriculture, {{has formed}} the {{scaffolding}} for many agro-based industries. Morbidity is more common among these industrial workers; hence, this study was conducted. Objectives: To study the morbidity pattern among the rice mill workers {{and the relationship between}} <b>duration</b> (<b>years)</b> of working and their morbid status. Study Design: A cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: A pre-structured questionnaire was used to record the necessary information such as clinical history, sociodemographic profile, findings of clinical examination and performance of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The study was conducted in three rice mills in an urban area under Urban Health Training Centre (UHTC), Department of Community Medicine, SSMC, Tumkur. A total of 75 workers were recruited for the study. The study was conducted in the month of October. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test. Results: Among these 75 workers, 42. 66 &#x 0025; had respiratory morbidity; among them, 10. 66 &#x 0025; had PEFR less than 200 L/min. 26. 66 &#x 0025; had low backache and knee joint pain and 20 &#x 0025; had generalized / musculo skeleton pain. 6. 6 &#x 0025; suffered from allergic conjunctivitis and 4 &#x 0025; had skin allergy. Conclusion: High Prevalence of respiratory morbidity (42. 66 &#x 0025;) and 8 (10. 66 &#x 0025;) workers with decreased PEFR were found. It also showed that there was statistically significant relationship between <b>duration</b> (<b>years)</b> of working and respiratory morbid condition.

30|$|Two methodological issues {{arise when}} {{examining}} immigrant adaptation with a cohort approach. First {{is the issue}} of variable identification. Similar to the age-period-cohort identification problem (Hobcraft, Menken and Preston, 1982), analysis of different immigration cohorts raises what is known as a duration-period-cohort identification dilemma (Myers and Lee 1996 : 54). Since <b>duration</b> (<b>years</b> spent in the host country), period (year of data observation) and cohort (year of immigration) are linear functions of one another, including all three variables in a regression model would lead to perfect collinearity. Yet, it may be theoretically desirable to differentiate and include all three variables as predictors in a model. The second issue is the confounding of duration and immigration cohort (Myers and Lee, 1996). Researchers have typically used immigration cohort to represent effects owing to varying lengths of residence in the host country (Chiswick, 1978). This is problematic, however, since variation in a response variable for immigrants arriving in different years can be due to differences in length of residence, differences in observed and unobserved characteristics between cohorts, or both. This issue affects our analysis since historical cohorts are defined by year of immigration.|$|E

Objectives: To determine the association between HC use and plasma proteins involved in established and emerging disease risk pathways. Method: Concentrations of 54 high-abundance plasma proteins were measured simultaneously by LC-MRM/MS in 783 women from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured separately. ANCOVA {{was used to test}} differences in protein concentrations between users and non-users, and among HC users depending on total hormone dose. Linear regression was used to test the association between <b>duration</b> (<b>years)</b> of HC use and plasma protein concentrations. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify plasma proteomic profiles in users and non-users. Results: After Bonferroni correction, 19 proteins involved in inflammation, innate immunity, coagulation and blood pressure regulation were significantly different between users and non-users (P, 0. 0009). These differences were replicated across three distinct ethnocultural groups. Traditional markers of glucose and lipid metabolism were also significantly higher among HC users.

40|$|IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is {{the most}} common lesion causing primary {{glomerulonephritis}} in the world. The main clinical predictors of progression are: elevated blood pressure, high histological score and proteinuria. Although elevated serum creatinine concentration at diagnosis, increased excretion of cytochines, age at onset, obesity and genetic factors may all influence clinical outcome, it is quite clear that proteinuria is the hallmark of renal damage in IgAN. Patients with IgAN and little or no proteinuria (3 g/day. The product of <b>duration</b> (<b>years)</b> and urinary protein excretion (g/day) at the time of renal biopsy is more significantly correlated with progression. So, this so called proteinuria index may be a useful predictor for glomerular and interstitial histopathological changes and the fate of renal function in IgAN. The progression of IgAN may be slowed by antihypertensive and antiproteinuric therapy, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, that can minimize secondary glomerular injury. Proteinuria {{has been shown to be}} an adverse prognostic factor in IgAN, with a strong relationship between proteinuria and prognosis and established importance of remission. Consequently, targeting proteinuria may be a valid surrogate for individualized kidney protective therapy...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{association}} between smoking, smoking cessation and aortic arc calcification (AAC) in an older Chinese population. Methods: A total of 3022 men and 7279 women aged 50 - 85 years were recruited and received a medical check-up including measurement of fasting plasma vascular risk factors. Two radiologists reviewed the posterior-anterior plain chest X-ray radiographs and assessed AAC together. Information on smoking status, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was collected. Results: The crude prevalence of AAC in men (38. 58 %) was lower than that in women (41. 37 %). The adjusted odds ratios of AAC increased significantly across never, ex- and current smokers in both genders. Dose-response relationships were observed among current smokers for smoking amount (cigarettes/day), smoking <b>duration</b> (<b>years)</b> and cigarette pack-years in both genders (all p < 0. 01). The odds ratios decreased significantly (p = 0. 018) with longer duration of quitting in light ex-smoking men (< 23. 5 pack-years) but showed no beneficial effect (p = 0. 72) for heavy ex-smokers (≥ 23. 5 pack-years). Conclusion: Smoking increased the risk of AAC in Chinese, while smoking cessation decreased the risk only in male light ex-smokers. Chest X-ray is a cheap and simple method to detect AAC, which should be an important warning signal for immediate smoking cessation. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Reintroducing NWSGs onto managed grasslands to reverse grassland bird population declines lacks information about appropriate multi-purpose management. Post-season nesting habitat quality of mixed NWSGs (indiangrass (IG, Sorghastrum nutans), big bluestem (BB, Andropogon gerardii) and little bluestem (LB, Schizachyrium scoparium)) responding to previous-year(s) harvest intervals (treatments, 30 -, 40 -, 60 -, 90 or 120 -d) and <b>duration</b> (<b>years</b> in production), were assessed on late-spring-early-summer re-growths. Yearly phased harvestings were initiated in May on sets of randomized plots, ≥ 90 -cm apart, in five replications (blocks) to produce one-, two-, and three-year old stands by the third year. Sward heights and canopy closure were recorded a day before harvest, followed a week after by visual estimates of ground cover of plant species and litter. Harvesting increased post-season grass cover and reduced forbs following a high rainfall year. Harvested plot swards showed no treatment differences, but were shorter and intercepted more sunlight. Similarly, harvest duration increased grass cover with no year effect but reduced forbs following a high rainfall year. One- or two-year full-season harvesting of similar stands may not compromise subsequent bobwhite nesting-cover provided post-season harvesting starts after the breeding cycle is completed...|$|E

40|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known about the {{mechanisms}} that underlie variation in female fertility in humans. Data on this topic are nonetheless vital to a number of pragmatic and theoretical enterprises, including population planning, infertility treatment and prevention, and evolutionary ecology. Here we study female fertility by focusing on one component of the interbirth interval: the waiting time to conception during menstrual cycling. Our study population is a Dogon village of 460 people in Mali, West Africa. This population is pronatalist and noncontracepting. In accordance with animist beliefs, the women spend five nights sleeping at a menstrual hut during menses. By censusing the women present at the menstrual huts in the study village on each of 736 consecutive nights, we were able to monitor women's conception waits prospectively. Hormonal profiles confirm the accuracy of the data on conception waits obtained from the menstrual hut census (Strassmann [1996], Behavioral Ecology 7 : 304 – 315). Using survival analysis, we identified significant predictors of the waiting time to conception: wife's age (years), husband's age (49 years), marital <b>duration</b> (<b>years),</b> gravidity (number of prior pregnancies), and breast-feeding status. Additional variables were not significant, including duration of postpartum amenorrhea, sex of the last child, nutritional status, economic status, polygyny, and marital status (fiancÉe vs. married).
