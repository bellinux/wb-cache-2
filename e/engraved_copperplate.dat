50|$|Valverde's {{most famous}} work was Historia de la composicion del cuerpo humano, first {{published}} in Rome, 1556. All but four of its 42 <b>engraved</b> <b>copperplate</b> illustrations were taken almost directly from Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica. Vesalius bitterly commented on Valverde's plagiarism, accusing him of having performed very few dissections himself. Occasionally, however, Valverde corrected Vesalius' images, as in his depictions of {{the muscles of the}} eyes, nose, and larynx. One of Valverde's most striking original plates is that of a muscle figure holding his own skin {{in one hand and a}} knife in the other, which has been likened to Saint Bartholomew in The Last Judgment (Michelangelo) of the Sistine Chapel.|$|E

25|$|The {{printing}} of textiles from <b>engraved</b> <b>copperplates</b> was first practiced by Bell in 1770. It was entirely obsolete, as an industry, in England, {{by the end}} of the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Geminus, a {{pseudonym}} for Thomas Lambrit, was another engraver and printer, who freely copied the anatomical drawings of Vesalius, a practice which infuriated him into denouncing 'extremely inept imitators'. Geminus did however redraw and rearrange Vesalius' woodcut illustrations, choosing to use <b>engraved</b> <b>copperplates,</b> {{with which he}} was more familiar. Gyles Godet, a French printer/publisher, worked in London {{from the end of}} the 1540s until his death in the 1570s. He also made use of Vesalius' diagrams, though crediting the Flemish anatomist.|$|R

50|$|In this era, enterprising American {{printers}} were matching their British {{counterparts in}} quality and quantity, and severely undercutting them in price. A successful master printer, Dobson objected to a British bias he perceived in the Britannica, and resolved to re-edit the Britannica accordingly. He completed his Encyclopædia in April 1798, {{a year after}} the original. It had 16,650 pages, with 595 <b>engraved</b> <b>copperplates,</b> slightly more than the Britannica. In support of Dobson's patriotic initiative, President George Washington subscribed to two sets, one of which now is kept with {{most of the rest of}} George Washington's personal library in the Boston Athenæum.|$|R

50|$|Molineux {{published}} An Abridgement of Mr. Byrom's Universal English Short-hand, London, 1796; {{called the}} second edition, really the first. It is a simplified {{representation of the}} Byrom system, with a few alterations. Molineux later brought out other works on the same subject, with <b>engraved</b> <b>copperplates.</b> One of them is partly written in epistolary form. Popular, they passed through about a dozen editions. Some are entitled An Introduction to Byrom's Universal English Short-hand, and others The Short-hand Instructor or Stenographical Copy Book. The editions of The Instructor published in 1824 and 1838 have a portrait of Molineux, engraved by Robert Cabbell Roffe from a painting by Scott.|$|R
