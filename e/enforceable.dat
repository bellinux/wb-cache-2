5|$|Compact Clause, Article I, section 10, clause 3 {{under which}} it creates an <b>enforceable</b> compact.|$|E
5|$|The deed of settlement, however, {{confirms}} the loans are valid and <b>enforceable,</b> while waiving accrued penalty interest on overdue borrowings.|$|E
5|$|As such, such trusts are not <b>enforceable</b> {{because they}} are invalid. Equity {{has been willing to}} accept their {{validity}} in the common law to prevent the trustee committing fraud and keeping the property; justifications for this acceptance are debated.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights {{is defined}} as the basic human rights of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply {{irrespective}} of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender. They are <b>enforceable</b> by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not <b>enforceable</b> by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing law's.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards {{legislation}} as {{an indispensable}} means for realising the rights which {{is unlikely to}} be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of <b>enforceable</b> rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Duties {{are defined}} as the moral {{obligations}} of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India. These duties, set out in Part IV–A of the Constitution, concern individuals and the nation. Like the Directive Principles, they are not <b>enforceable</b> by the law.|$|E
5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with compensation to loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting {{and called for}} secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was <b>enforceable</b> only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be <b>enforceable</b> as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not <b>enforceable</b> by law.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are <b>enforceable</b> and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern world to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, 2008, a {{government}} working group presented New Brunswick Education Minister Kelly Lamrock with eight recommendations for extracurricular transportation. The recommendations included that guidelines for transporting students to school-related extracurricular activities be strengthened, that {{a school bus}} be used when transporting ten or more students, that vehicles be equipped with snow tires if travelling between October 15 and April 30, and that the district superintendent be charged with responsibility for ensuring safe transportation of students to and from extracurricular activities. Lamrock initially suggested that schools voluntarily follow the recommendations, though they were later made into <b>enforceable</b> policy.|$|E
5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it <b>enforceable</b> by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{defendant}} and the State Attorney may appeal the decision; the appeal would {{be heard by}} a panel of the Prague High Court, consisting of three professional judges. A decision of second instance court is final and <b>enforceable.</b> Nevertheless, an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by {{the defendant}} or the Supreme State Attorney, which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno; an extraordinary appeal may, however, rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case. After exhausting all of these remedies, the defendant may also lodge a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are <b>enforceable</b> against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 the {{producer}} Basil Dean offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy's best-selling novel, The Constant Nymph. Before rehearsals began Dean {{found that a}} bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an <b>enforceable</b> contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre. Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, with a guarantee {{that he would take}} over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left. In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead {{for the rest of the}} run. The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour.|$|E
5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for {{loss of citizenship}} based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service during wartime, or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be <b>enforceable</b> without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E
5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an <b>enforceable</b> political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Żeligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has argued {{that it was not a}} regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated that it was not a mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the Vilnius question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern Vilnius or other territorial claims. Senn has described the agreement as tacitly leaving Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and <b>enforceable</b> fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1936, {{the pianist}} John Tobin gave a {{performance}} of Pars prima from Opus clavicembalisticum. This performance was highly inadequate, as it lasted {{twice as long as}} it should have. Sorabji left before it finished, and later denied having attended it. He gave his last public performance of his music on 16 December 1936 in Glasgow, when he premiered his Piano Toccata No. 2, and afterwards withdrew from the concert platform {{for the rest of his}} life. He later banned unauthorised performances of his music, but it remains unclear when he did so; Paul Rapoport has argued that it was probably in 1938 or 1939, but Sorabji's first announcement of it dates from 1944. Although the ban was not legally <b>enforceable,</b> Sorabji presented it so sharply and decisively that, for the most part, he achieved his aim. The shift in Sorabji's attitude to public performances of his music has generally been ascribed to Tobin's performance, but this explanation has also been described as simplistic. Apart from misleading reviews of his works by music critics, the deaths of people who were important to him (Busoni, Warlock, and Bernard van Dieren), the silence of Sibelius, the changes in Szymanowski's style, and the increasing prominence of Stravinsky and the late Schoenberg have all been put forward as catalysts for his decision to isolate himself from the world of music. The financial implications of his father's death have also been cited as an important factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an <b>enforceable</b> legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

25|$|Virtually every {{significant}} commercial {{country in}} the world is a party to the Convention while relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments their courts. Additionally, the awards not limited to damages.

25|$|Agreements to {{arbitrate}} {{were not}} <b>enforceable</b> at common law, {{traced back to}} dictum by Lord Coke in Vynor’s Case, 8 Co. Rep. 81b, 77 Eng. Rep. 597 (1609), that agreements to arbitrate were revocable by either party.|$|E
25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{the doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not <b>enforceable,</b> and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and <b>enforceable</b> in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|For {{many decades}} the correct {{interpretation}} of the articles also caused some controversy among Irish nationalists. Some saw the constitution as placing an <b>enforceable</b> legal obligation on {{the government of the}} Republic to use its influence to actively seek the unification of the island. Invoking Article 2, some Northern Ireland nationalists elected to the UK parliament requested, but were denied, the right to be recognised in the southern parliament (the Oireachtas) as TDs (members of Dáil Éireann). Before 1999, however, the Irish Supreme Court affirmed in consistent rulings that Article 2 created no rights or obligations that were actually <b>enforceable</b> in a court of law.|$|E
