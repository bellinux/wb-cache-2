500|$|During filming, Roth held {{a grudge}} against Heston {{due to his}} work with the National Rifle Association: [...] "It was very {{difficult}} for me. On one level, there's the man and he's my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing is what it is now. I'm so against it, very vocally so. But it was inappropriate for the workplace. If I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him, I'll talk to him outside the workplace. So it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene." [...] Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston.|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, The Sunday Mirror {{revealed}} {{that in a}} UKIP members' online forum Gasper had condemned LGBT rights as a [...] "lunatic's charter", while claiming that some homosexuals prefer sex with animals over that with other humans, and reiterating her belief in a link between homosexuality and paedophilia. The newspaper characterised the comments as [...] "extremist and offensive" [...] and noted that the forum contained many homophobic and racist statements from UKIP members. When The Sunday Mirror asked for comment, Gasper stated that [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about them. It's none of your business." [...] Political commentator Nick Cohen, commenting in The Observer, described Gasper as an advocate of [...] "dumb prejudice".|$|E

500|$|Tintin in the Congo {{has been}} criticised as {{presenting}} the Africans as naïve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing {{a class of}} African children. [...] "My dear friends," [...] he says, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you today about your fatherland: Belgium." [...] Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying, [...] "I portrayed these Africans according to... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time." [...] Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as [...] "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals", although Thompson noted her quote may have been [...] "taken out of context".|$|E
500|$|At Casterman's prompting, Tintin in the Congo was {{subsequently}} fully re-drawn, {{and the new}} version was published in 1946. As {{a part of this}} modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version, [...] "My dear friends, today I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you about your country: Belgium!" [...] whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white [...] "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe." ...|$|E
500|$|Barkley {{spoke for}} many years of his Republican Party affiliation. In 1995, he {{considered}} running as a Republican candidate for Alabama's governorship in the 1998 election. However, in 2006, he altered his political stance, stating [...] "I was a Republican until they lost their minds." [...] At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence {{to the idea of}} running for Governor of Alabama, stating: I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration...

500|$|During a {{subsequent}} NPR talk show, Savage {{said that he}} has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, [...] "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, [...] "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball." [...] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a [...] "foaming lunatic... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum... You're nobody and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you!" [...] At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.|$|E
500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions.

500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E

[...] In April 2016, Feige added, [...] "We're only working on what’s been announced through the end of 2019. And it is still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond". A year later, Feige noted, [...] "We have an idea , and it's gonna be very, very different," [...] but cautioned that Marvel would not be [...] "actively discussing anything past untitled Avengers" [...] besides dating the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and that James Gunn would be working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He also was not sure if Marvel would continue to group the films in phases once Phase Three concluded, that [...] "it might be a new thing." [...] A second sequel to Homecoming is also planned.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} the Boko Haram {{insurgency}} and {{the inability of the}} government to fight the group were closely tied with the country's upcoming presidential elections.

2500|$|Vancouver won {{the game}} 4–0, with their second goal coming on a power play, the fifth of the season.

This taunting led to a scuffle and both players received major penalties for fighting. Leafs' forward Dave Bolland was injured after a hit by Kassian. While finishing his check, Kassian's skate came off the ice, sliced Bolland's ankle, cutting a tendon. After the game, Kassian said that he felt it was a clean hit but added: [...] "Obviously, people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> especially with my suspension before.
