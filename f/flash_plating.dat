Fluorescence measurements were performed with a using a multi-well reader (Varioskan <b>Flash</b> Multimode <b>Plate</b> Reader, Thermo Scientific). Corrected excitation and emission spectra of prodigiosin were obtained both in buffer alone {{and in the}} presence of excess lambda DNA, in order to obtain spectra for the free and bound forms. For prodigiosin, excitation spectra {{were measured}} with λex =  543  nm, while emission spectra were measured with λem =  570  nm. λDNA (Merck Genei) sufficiently free of protein was used. A 260 /A 280 of 1.8 was considered for the assay. DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (Eppendorf bio spectrophotometer Basic). All the experiments were carried out in 5  mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.0. DNA and prodigiosin were dissolved in the buffer at a concentration of 250  μg/mL respectively. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 480  nm and the emission range set between 480 and 600  nm using a slit width of 5 / 5  nm (Varioskan <b>Flash</b> Multimode <b>Plate</b> Reader, Thermo Scientific).|$|R

30|$|The MIC and MBC of {{purified}} prodigiosin {{against these}} pathogenic strains were tested. The pathogens were grown in nutrient broth (peptone 5  g/L; beef extract 3  g/L; NaCl 5  g/L; pH 7.0) supplemented with increasing concentrations of prodigiosin (1 – 50  µg/mL) in 96 well micro titre plates and incubated at 30  °C for 24  h. A positive (cell treated with ciprofloxacin; 1  mg/mL) and negative control (cells without any drug) well was included for every test bacteria to validate adequate microbial {{growth over the}} course of the incubation period. The plate was analysed for turbidity using Varioskan <b>Flash</b> Multimode <b>Plate</b> Reader (Thermo Scientific) after 24  h of a growth period. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of prodigiosin that resulted in the complete inhibition of bacterial growth under study. The MBC was determined by plating samples from the treated wells (as given above) with concentrations above the MIC on to fresh plates of nutrient agar and counting viable CFU/ml. The MBC is the lowest concentration that demonstrated a preset reduction (such as 99.9  %) in CFU/ml when compared to the MIC dilution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an integrated campaign for monitoring the electrical-meteorological conditions in São Bernardo do Campo city (known as ABCD region of São Paulo State) that begun in November, 2004. To realize this work {{it was developed}} a network using local technology that consists in Electric Field Mill sensors (EFM), Slow Antenna (Flat Plate Antenna) and video cameras. All sensors are synchronized by a Global Position System (GPS) receiver. The Electric Field Mill sensors measure the local changes of the electric field by storm and transients pulses caused by the <b>flashes.</b> The Flat <b>Plate</b> antenna measures the individual electric field changes in the same flash. A video camera capture images of the lightning flashes which were used to validate the recorded data from the sensors. ...|$|R

G. 1 {{formulation}} is a true gold electroless process and if It can be used to <b>plate</b> gold <b>flash</b> over the selectively plated electronic contacts. The purpose of gold <b>flash</b> to <b>plate</b> the entire surface of the gold plated contact with thin layer of soft gold for the purpose of SoIderatMty. Thickness of this gold flash should be from 5 - 8 microinches. It is found that addition of solid nickel when barrel plating with H. G. formulatlon, converted this system from immersion type to true auto cataiytic process. ELECTROLESS PROCESSES: DEFINITIONS Because electroless deposition does not involve the passage of externally applied current to the system, some confusion over the use of the term electroless has resulted. Electroless deposition has been used synonymously with chemical deposition which can result from the following processes: (1) DisPlacement reactions. Depending on its position in the electrochemical series, a metal higher up in the series may be covered (plated) with the metal lower down in the series. A well known example is the coverage of iron with copper in an acidified copper sulphate solution. Two reactions, one anodic and the other cathodic, take place simultaneously at the surface of the iron...|$|R

40|$|Summary form only given. In recent years, the {{application}} of chip on board technology (COB) has become widespread. COB technology offers many advantages compared to conventional packaging techniques, such as the reduced weight and volume of electronic components and high flexibility. For consumer applications and especially for the harsh environmental conditions in automotive applications, a qualified investigation of reliability is necessary. COB technology with wire bonds includes die bonding, wire bonding and encapsulation of bare chips on printed circuit boards (PCBs). In order to obtain a correlation between process conditions and reliability, the bondability and solderability of different electroless metal finishes were investigated. In this paper, the bondability and solderability of palladium metal finishes with an optional gold <b>flash</b> and electroless <b>plated</b> Ni-Au metallizations are shown. The investigation of the bondability was performed in two steps. First, a detailed study was performed to determine the basic factors affecting bondability. This study includes surface investigations such as SEM, Auger spectroscopy and measurement of microhardness and microroughness. As the next step, bond process windows were determined {{for each type of}} metallization to obtain information on bondability before and after accelerated ageing tests. The feasibility of different surface investigation methods is shown and the results are compared to results from bond experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Manny Charlton of Nazareth used John Birch to {{customise}} a Gibson Flying-V guitar {{which he}} had purchased in Tucson, Arizona during 1976. John Birch added Di Marzio Super Distortion Humbuckers, an out-of-phase switch, Gibson TP-6 fine tuning tailpiece, a <b>flash</b> metal scratch <b>plate</b> and refinished it to a dark sunburst colour. This guitar appears on Nazareth's albums Playin' the Game (1976) and Expect No Mercy (1977) and can be heard on the recordings of [...] "Kentucky Fried Blues", [...] "Down Home Girl" [...] and [...] "Flying". It was used on many Nazareth tours in the late 1970s and was in Manny Charlton's possession until April 2015, when it was sold to a private collector. John Birch also customised another Gibson guitar that Manny Charlton used to favour in the 1970s. This was a Gibson Les Paul that started out life as a '50s Gold Top before Manny bought in the states around 75-76. John Birch sprayed this guitar black and fitted it with his own bridge design. He also fitted it with Alembic-designed hot-rod magnets in the pickups. Manny used this guitar for several years until in [...] "a moment of insanity" [...] according to himself: In {{the middle of the}} '80s whammy bar craze he had a Kahler Tremolo fitted to it, and [...] "destroyed a wonderful guitar".|$|R
