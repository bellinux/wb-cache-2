50|$|In 1988, Rovt {{took a job}} at IBE Trade {{which was}} founded by Sheldon Silverston. IBE made a profit by selling goods to governments that were not in favor with the {{international}} community and as a result, did not have ready access to hard currency. IBE was paid in hard commodities rather than cash (e.g. steel, coffee). Thanks to Rovt’s connections in the Eastern bloc and understanding of the fertilizer business thanks to his involvement at the vegetable distributor, IBE expanded it operations to the Soviet Union supplying goods in exchange for fertilizer, something the Soviets had in abundance thanks to ample natural gas supplies, a primary input to the manufacture of fertilizer. Once Perestroika took hold, the barter business diminished and Rovt (along with his childhood friend and co-worker at IBE, Imre Pakh) bought IBE from Silverston and transitioned the company into a traditional <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributor</b> eventually controlling 85-90% of the fertilizer trade in Russia and the Ukraine by 2000.|$|E

In probe parcels the more and more precise labour quality demands require mechanization of experiments. A solution is offered to mechanization of distributing fertilizer on probe parcels. A new plot <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributor</b> was designed and built. I outline here the principle of working of the plot fertilizer. The unevenness of spreading {{of each type is}} significantly influenced by the tilt of the cone-belt dispenser from vertical position. A test-bench was collected to measure the aberrations. The measurement proves that only a few degree deviation results in significant change in the unevenness of dispensing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the field tests that evaluate a new centrifugal <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributor</b> Vicon RS-EDW {{to be used}} in Precision Agriculture. The results of dynamic calibration tests show a significant and systematically difference between the application rates of the two discs (about 20 %). This difference had to be corrected by the manufacturer that made the necessary changes in the electric actuators. The fertilizer spreader had good distribution homogeneity, considering different working velocities and different positions in the parcel. The pattern distribution curve for 18 % Super phosphate fertilizer led to an effective working width of 28 meters, with a coefficient of variation of 15 %. The longitudinal test, under experimental working conditions led to a machine delay time of 6 - 7 seconds. The obtained results show an actual fertilization application density between 74 - 90 % of that determined for each location. These results make it possible to confirm that the spreader can be used to spread any fertilizer differentially in the field...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Accidents with <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> at work {{happen in}} the Austrian {{agriculture}} every year. In accordance with Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC and the standards ISO 4254 - 1 and DIN EN 14017, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> undergo a risk assessment before construction and market entry to ensure their complying with these legal recommendations and to eliminate largely the risk of injury for the operators. To determine the accident scenarios, causes, and technical solutions, a narrative analysis of 14 reports of accidents that led to moderate and serious injuries from 2008 to 2010 was done, eight victims interviewed, and seven accident machines and eight new ones, which were sold in 2013, evaluated according to applicable regulations. Mostly farm managers were involved in accidents with mineral <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> during coupling and uncoupling and filling mainly on the farmyard. During coupling and uncoupling, farm managers collided with the machine itself, and during filling with the fertilizer chunks of the big bags. Falls from the machine were caused by slips and missteps during fertilizing, filling, and cleaning tasks. Farm managers were hit by the machine by coming {{into contact with the}} running spreading unit during fertilization and maintenance tasks. The accident machines showed large and the new machines low permanent deficits in instruction and warning notices as well in constructional execution. Potential constructive improvements are the standardized provision of instructions and warnings, standard-compliant boarding (ladders, grab rails, platforms, etc.) and loading means (lift arms, platforms) for filling and monitoring the container contents, sufficient space or hydraulic coupling elements for coupling, uncoupling, and unfolding of spreader units, and protective devices for agitators in new machines.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} results of {{implementing}} precision agriculture technologies in dry land permanent pastures in the southern region of Portugal over a six year period. A project provided the means for the acquisition of precision farming technologies and demonstration of their potential and limitations in experiments carried out on a 6 ha field with a biodiverse pasture. The technologies sought, on the one hand, to simplify the time-consuming and expensive process of evaluating the soil characteristics and productivity of the pasture and on the other, to optimize the application of fertilizers, the main practice used by farmers to improve pastures. The use of a "DUALEM 1 S" electromagnetic induction sensor in association with a GPS receiver allowed the identification of areas in the plot with different potentials and production capacities. The use of a "GRASSMASTER II" probe associated with a GPS receiver, after calibration, {{proved to be a}} very interesting tool in non-destructive and rapid assessment of pasture productivity. Through the combination of "FIELDSTAR" and "FERTICONTROL" systems it was possible to control a "VICON RS-EDW" centrifugal <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributor</b> equipped with variable rate technology (VRT). Closing the cycle in precision agriculture with differentiated application of phosphate fertilizers is an important step in rationalizing the use of economic resources and environmental protection...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{well known}} empirical puzzle {{in the literature}} on technology adoption: despite the potential of technologies to increase returns dramatically, a significant fraction of households do not use these technologies. I study the use of hybrid maize and fertilizer in Kenya, where there are persistent cross-sectional differences in aggregate adoption rates with a large fraction of households switching in and out of adoption. By allowing for selection of farmers into technology use via comparative advantage differences, I examine whether the yield returns to adopting hybrid maize vary across farmers. If so, high average returns can coexist with low returns for the marginal farmer. My findings indicate the existence of two interesting subgroups in the population. A small group of farmers has potentially high returns from adopting the technologies. Yet, they do not adopt. This lack of adoption appears to stem from supply and infrastructure constraints, such as the distance to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors.</b> In addition, a larger group of farmers faces very low returns to adopting hybrid maize, but chooses to adopt. This latter group might benefit substantially from the development of newer hybrid strains to increase yields. On the whole, the stagnation in hybrid adoption {{does not appear to be}} due to constraints or irrationalities. Technology, Heterogeneity, Comparative Advantage...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the procedures used to set up the subsidy prices and evaluate the prices and quantity allocations given to distributors in order to measure their impact on the financial performances of the <b>distributors.</b> Two <b>fertilizer</b> trading companies, MIs Tanzania Fertilizer Company Ltd and MIs Premium Agro Chern Ltd were taken as case studies. The data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using tables, ratios and trend analysis. Excel computer program was used to analyse the data and illustrating them by using figures and graphs. The findings indicated that the distributors' businesses will not realise profits and attain growth unless the subsidy prices set by the government are equal or higher than their commercial prices, and that the quantities allocated to them are equal to their budgeted sales volumes or are above their break-even volumes. The researcher recommends a review of the current price setting procedures and quantity allocation criteria to improve the distributors' financial performances and to achieve the government {{objective of}} the scheme. The researcher also recommends a country importation schedule, standards for subsidy <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> and having own fertilizer plant. While the policy of subsidizing fertilizers to our farmers is good for the country's food security programmes and increase in foreign exchange earnings, the recommended measures would streamline the administration of the scheme, ensure reliability in fertilizer supplies, provide feedback and facilitate policy analysis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to find methods and models {{suitable}} for describing and/or quantifying - the characteristics of unevenness in fertilizer intensity - any net effect of the characteristics of the fertilizer unevenness. Non-uniform distribution of nitrogen fertilizer was simulated on wheat. The distribution pattern was simulated by defined systematic unevenness in a transverse direction to the direction of sowing. Totally 3312 sown rows after each seed coulter with a length of 3 meters were individually harvested during 1979 - 1982. The uptake of nutrient was found to be extremely local but the indirect effect of the influence has a wider range. The interaction between plants gives the crop a ’strategy’ to best benefit from placed nutrient. This strategy, however, does not always seem to result in maximizing the quantity of the yield. The studies show that yield depression {{may be related to the}} variability of fertilizer intensity. The variability within a relevant locality influencing the growth of a single plant can be expressed by a variance and an autocorrelation function. A description is given of how yield depression can be predicted and how parameters for predicting yield depression can be estimated by non-uniform distribution patterns. Different methods of analyzing the dependence between neighbouring plots were tested. A moving average and a nearest neighbour technique of analyzing the data were used. A proposed method of field-testing <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> is to randomly position trays on the field to be fertilized. The trays should be divided into at least two halves or parts to give a measure of the auto-correlation between neighbouring miniplots. Assuming different types of systematic pattern, the auto-correlation function valid within a relevant distance can be estimated...|$|R
