5|$|Eastbourne has {{numerous}} {{parks and}} gardens, {{although there are}} several smaller open spaces including Upperton <b>Gardens,</b> the <b>Carpet</b> <b>Gardens</b> and the Western Lawns. The first public park in Eastbourne was Hampden Park, originally owned by Lord Willingdon and opened on 12 August 1902. Facilities include: football pitches, rugby club, indoor bowls, a large lake (formerly a Decoy pond), lakeside cafe, children's recreation area, tennis courts, BMX and skate facility, disc golf course (target) and woodland. The largest and newest park is Shinewater Park, located {{on the west side}} of Langney and opened in 2002. There is a large fishing lake, basketball, football pitches, a BMX and skate park and children's playground.|$|R
50|$|The garden {{nasturtium}} {{is used as}} a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Dot Moth and the <b>Garden</b> <b>Carpet</b> Moth. A very common pest found on nasturtiums is the caterpillar of the Large White or Cabbage White Butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Sixty nine insect herbivores {{and seven}} fungi are {{associated}} with garlic mustard in Europe. The most important groups of natural enemies associated with garlic mustard were weevils (particularly the genus Ceutorhynchus), leaf beetles, butterflies, and moths, including the larvae of some moth species such as the <b>Garden</b> <b>Carpet</b> moth.|$|E
50|$|Erysimum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species {{including}} the <b>Garden</b> <b>Carpet</b> (Xanthorhoe fluctuata). In addition, some species of weevils, like Ceutorhynchus chlorophanus, live inside the fruits feeding on the developing seeds. Many species of beetles, bugs and grasshoppers eat on the leaves and stalks. Some mammalian herbivores, for example Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in North America, Argali (Ovis ammon) in Mongolia, Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) in Central Europe, or Spanish Ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in the Iberian Peninsula, feed on wallflower flowering and fruiting stalks.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} Safavid carpets {{can be attributed}} to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure: Seven different types of <b>carpets</b> were identified: <b>Garden</b> <b>carpets</b> (depicting formal <b>gardens</b> and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medaillon designs with offset medaillons and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. The first and third weft are made of wool, and lie hidden in the center of the carpet. The middle weft is of silk or cotton, and passes from the back to the front. When the carpets are worn, this third weft evokes a characteristic, [...] "tram line" [...] effect.|$|R

40|$|Soon after Islam was {{revealed}} to the Prophet Muhammad in Arabia in the early 7 th century, his followers began spreading the faith. Within one century, Islam had been carried across North Africa to Spain and across the Middle East to Central Asia. Great centers of civilization developed in the political capitals, such as Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo, and later in Istanbul and Isfahan, accompanied by elaborate court ceremonies to promulgate their wealth and power. Imperial ceremonials were equivalent to theatrical settings, usually based on strict hierarchies and rigid protocol, in which luxurious textiles were vital symbols. Four overt textile symbols of imperial wealth and power - throne covers, throne room carpets, red-carpet receptions, and robes of honor - will be considered here. All together, they {{provide insight into the}} original significance of extant Islamic textiles whose status, given the comparatively few archival tidbits, often challenges evaluation. The documented ceremonial practices of the Ottoman Turks during their political and artistic height in the 16 th and early 17 th centuries provide an illuminating framework for condsidering other wealthy Islamic courts. The Ottomans preserved and documented one of the largest treasuries in the world in the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. It contains, for example, numerous fabrics and more than three hundred and thirty imperial kaftans dating from the 16 th and 17 th centuries. About twenty percent of the kaftans are patterned, including foreign fabrics dominated by Italian velvets, and some eighty percent are plain (Figure 5). In addition, traveler 2 ̆ 7 s accounts and historical miniature paintings have been consulted. First, however, the significance of precious gems will be summarized. When the Arabs conquered the Middle East, gemstones already symbolized imperial power and wealth, especially in Iran during the Sasanian empire (226 - 651). Pearls and rubies enriched clothing and carpets. Most renowned was the immense floor covering known as King Khosrau 2 ̆ 7 s spring <b>garden</b> <b>carpet,</b> which was made around 600 for the imperial audience hall at the palace in Ctesiphon. It contained paths covered with gemstones flanked by blossoming trees and fruits formed with gold, silver, and precious stones. Was it a knotted pile carpet or an embroidery...|$|E

5000|$|Charles {{has created}} a wild garden, a formal garden and a walled kitchen garden at Highgrove. He has also planted {{a large number of}} trees in the grounds, and holds the NCCPG {{national}} beech collection. Individual features in the <b>gardens</b> include the <b>Carpet</b> <b>Garden,</b> Southern Hemisphere Garden, Walled Garden, the Autumn Walk, Sundial Garden, and a Woodland Garden featuring two classical temples made from green oak and a stumpery. Charles has described his efforts as representing [...] "...one very small attempt to heal the appalling short-sighted damage done to the soil, the landscape and our own souls" [...] and has written that [...] "Some may not like it, others may scoff that it is not in the 'real world' or it is merely an expensive indulgence. Whatever the case, my enduring hope is that those who visit the garden may find something to inspire, excite, fascinate or soothe them".|$|R

6000|$|The [...] "Garden" [...] is {{the most}} {{elaborate}} part of the Mosque. Little can be said in its praise by day, when it bears the same relation to a second-rate church in Rome as an English chapel-of-ease to Westminster Abbey. It is a space of about eighty feet in length, tawdrily decorated so as to resemble a <b>garden.</b> The <b>carpets</b> are flowered, and the pediments of the columns are cased with bright green tiles, and adorned to {{the height of a}} man with gaudy and unnatural vegetation in arabesque. It is disfigured by handsome branched candelabras of cut crystal, the work, I believe, of a London house, and presented to the shrine by the late Abbas Pasha of Egypt.[FN#24] ...|$|R
60|$|Pearl {{accordingly}} {{ran to the}} bow-window, at {{the further}} end of the hall, and looked along the vista of a <b>garden</b> walk, <b>carpeted</b> with closely-shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate {{on this side of}} the Atlantic, in a hard soil, and amid the close struggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamental gardening. Cabbages grew in plain sight; and a pumpkin-vine, rooted at some distance, had run across the intervening space, and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall window, as if to warn the Governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth would offer him. There were a few rose-bushes, however, and a number of apple-trees, probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula; that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals, seated on the back of a bull.|$|R
60|$|It was a sunny room, gay {{with light}} color and dainty furnishings, having long window-doors that {{opened to the}} <b>garden.</b> An Aubusson <b>carpet</b> of palest green, with a festoon pattern of pink roses, covered two-thirds of the blocked, {{polished}} floor. The empanelled walls were white, with here a gilt mirror, flanked on either side by a girandole in ormolu. A spinet stood open in mid-chamber, and upon it were sheets of music, a few books {{and a bowl of}} emerald-green ware, charged now with roses, whose fragrance lay heavy on the air. There were two or three small tables of very dainty, fragile make, and the chairs were in delicately-tinted tapestry illustrating the fables of La Fontaine.|$|R
50|$|Moss {{is often}} {{considered}} a weed in grass lawns, but is deliberately encouraged to grow under aesthetic principles exemplified by Japanese gardening. In old temple <b>gardens,</b> moss can <b>carpet</b> a forest scene. Moss {{is thought to}} add a sense of calm, age, and stillness to a garden scene. Moss is also used in bonsai to cover the soil and enhance the impression of age.Rules of cultivation are not widely established. Moss collections are quite often begun using samples transplanted from the wild in a water-retaining bag. However, specific species of moss can be extremely difficult to maintain away from their natural sites with their unique requirements of combinations of light, humidity, substrate chemistry, shelter from wind, etc.|$|R
50|$|Hartington {{took great}} pains to parade his {{interest}} in horseracing, so as to cultivate an image of not being entirely obsessed by politics.

40|$|The word paradise is of Iranian {{origin and}} {{refers to an}} {{enclosed}} garden space. In the Koran it is the permanent abode of the righteous. Its form, with flowing water, shade and fruits, is physically reproduced in <b>gardens,</b> mosques and <b>carpets.</b> The best examples of such reproduction {{were found in the}} sixteenth century, in the city of Esfahan. Today these structures still exist. How have they changed and what has remained intact? After a synopsis of Iranian history with our topic of paradise in mind, we investigate these two periods and present descriptive analyses. The objectification of the idea of 'paradise' is seen in the street names, and their perseverance to the present day shows the continuity of this symbol ever since the first written documents in Iran.

5000|$|Shepheard's Hotel was {{famed for}} its grandeur, for its guests, {{and as a}} base for the military. It was renowned for its opulence, with stained glass, Persian <b>carpets,</b> <b>gardens,</b> terraces, and great granite pillars {{resembling}} those of the Ancient Egyptian temples. Its American Bar was frequented not only by Americans but also by French and British officers. There were nightly dances at which men appeared in military uniform and women in evening gowns. Tourist shops faced the hotel from across the street, and there was a storeroom where officers could check their excess luggage. Reviews of the hotel's cuisine varied over time. At an early stage, its food was said to leave [...] "much to be desired" [...] but, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, others were describing the food as [...] "as good as anything at Paris' Ritz, or Berlin's Adlon, or Rome's Grand".|$|R
60|$|This {{desert of}} unattractiveness has its oasis. Near the outer {{end of the}} Hackney Road is a park of 217 acres, fenced in, not by railings, but by a wooden paling, and {{containing}} plenty of greensward, trees, a lake for bathers, flower beds with the flowers arranged carefully in patterns by the admired cockney art of <b>carpet</b> <b>gardening</b> and a sandpit, imported from the seaside for the delight of the children, but speedily deserted on its becoming a natural vermin preserve for all the petty fauna of Kingsland, Hackney and Hoxton. A bandstand, an unfinished forum for religious, anti-religious and political orators, cricket pitches, a gymnasium, and an old fashioned stone kiosk are among its attractions. Wherever the prospect is bounded by trees or rising green grounds, it is a pleasant place. Where the ground stretches far to the grey palings, with bricks and mortar, sky signs, crowded chimneys and smoke beyond, the prospect makes it desolate and sordid.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} his reign, Tahmasp {{organized}} the gardens of Sadatabad. This, like all Persian gardens, is divided in four by two perpendicular alleys and bordered by a canal, an arrangement found particularly in the tapis-jardins (literally <b>carpet</b> <b>gardens)</b> of the same period. It contains baths, four covered walkways and three pleasure pavilions: the Gombad-e Muhabbat, the Iwan-e Bagh and the Chehel Sutun. The name of the latter, built in 1556, means [...] "palace of forty columns", a name which is explained by the presence of twenty columns reflected in a pond. In the Persian tradition, the number forty is often used to mean a large quantity. This little construction at one point served as a place of audience, for banquets and for more private uses. It was decorated with panels painted with literary Persian scenes, such as the story of Farhad and Shirin, as well as hunting scenes, festivals and polo, etc. Floral bands surrounded these panels, based on models of Shah Tahmasp himself, to paint at his hours, or again of Muzaffar Ali or Muhammadi, thus used in the royal library.|$|R
500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could {{do anything to make}} her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined that huge concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square <b>Garden</b> would be <b>carpeted</b> for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls to damp sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand did not like to listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft dome drivers for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line array system called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand out better individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|R
50|$|Paisley or Paisley {{pattern is}} a term in English for a design using the buta or boteh, a droplet-shaped {{vegetable}} motif of Persian origin that resembles a twisted teardrop. Paisley designs became very popular in the West in the 18th and 19th centuries, following imports of post-Mughal Empire versions of the design from India, especially {{in the form of}} Kashmir shawls, and were then imitated locally. Although the fig-shaped paisley is of Persian origin, its western name derives from the town of Paisley, in West Scotland, a centre for textiles where paisley designs were produced. The pattern is still commonly seen in Britain and other English-speaking countries with men's ties but remains popular in other items of clothing in Iran and South and Central Asian countries. It is woven using gold or silver threads on silk or other high quality textiles for gifts, for weddings and special occasions. In Iran and Uzbekistan its use goes beyond clothing - paintings, jewelry, frescoes, curtains, tablecloths, quilts, <b>carpets,</b> <b>garden</b> landscaping, and pottery also sport the buta design. In Uzbekistan the most frequently found item featuring the design is the traditional doppi headdress.In Tamil Nadu the manga maalai (mango necklace) with matching earrings is a traditional feature of bharathanatyam dance.It is a prominent design in Kanchipuram saris. It has sometimes been associated with Hinduism.|$|R
5000|$|Wau {{is a town}} in New Guinea, in the {{province}} of Morobe situated {{at one end of the}} Wau-Bulolo Valley. It was the site of a gold rush during the 1920s and 1930s. Gold prospectors arrived at the coast at Salamaua and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track. The miners partially cleared the area and built houses and workshops, and established a water supply and an electricity grid. They constructed the aerodromes at Wau and Bulolo which were the primary means of reaching the Wau-Bulolo Valley. Wau aerodrome was a rough Kunai grass airstrip 3100 ft in length with a 10 per cent slope heading directly for Mount Kaindi. Aircraft could approach from the north east only, landing uphill and taking off downhill. The mountain at the end of the runway prevented second attempts at landing and precluded extension of the strip. Pilots had to manoeuvre Dakotas under clouds and through dangerous passes, [...] "dodging a peak here and cloud there", landing at high speeds. This required good visibility, but the weather over Owen Stanley Range was characterised by frequent storms, vertical drafts, and mists which rose from the jungle floor. The first landing at Wau was made by Ernest Mustard in his De Havilland DH.37 on 19 April 1927. Osmar White, who reached Wau in June 1942, wrote: and Bulolo were towns built sole by virtue of man's conquest of the air. Every nail, sheet of iron, weatherboard, spot of paint, pane of glass, crock, wire or sheet of paper was carried in by air at freight rates between 4d and 1/5d per pound. The wrecked trucks that now dotted the highways, rusted out and twisted by fire, were brought in by air. The billiard tables at the hotels were brought in by air. Easy chairs, refrigerators, bathtubs, stoves, dynamos, linoleum, <b>carpets,</b> <b>garden</b> statuary, even great mining dredges, bulldozers and power shovels—all were brought in by air, and this in a decade when most people in Australia were still thinking it adventurous to take a five-minute joy ride over an airfield.|$|R
