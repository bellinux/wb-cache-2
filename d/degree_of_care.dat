5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E

This allegedly included the bizarre claim of a hymen-restoration (hymenoplasty or hymenorrhaphy) procedure on Sr. Sephy which was discovered through gynecological tests conducted on her in late 2008. This was strongly refuted by the accused. The counsel for the accused dared CBI to prove that such an operation has ever been conducted in India. Further, the building where the crime was allegedly committed was extensively remodeled.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to model joint consumption decisions <b>of</b> individuals who <b>care</b> for each other. We assume noncooperative interaction between the different individuals and the within-group consumption outcome critically depends on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> between the group members. By varying the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>caring,</b> the model encompasses a whole continuum of group consumption models that are situated between the fully cooperative model (assuming a Pareto optimal outcome) and the noncooperative model without caring (assuming a public good game with voluntary contributions). This feature is used to define a measure for the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> cooperation within the group, which quantifies how close the observed group behavior is to the fully cooperative benchmark. We also establish a dual characterization of our noncooperative model with caring preferences: we show that the model is dually equivalent to a noncooperative model with non-caring preferences that is characterized by intra-group transfers. Following a revealed preference approach, we derive testable implications of the model for empirical data. Finally, we also use our model to analyze decisions made by dyads of children in an experimental setting. We find considerable heterogeneity in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> (or cooperation) across dyads, which correlates with assertiveness and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> interaction within dyads. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

500|$|This {{test has}} both an {{objective}} and subjective element. There is an objective baseline {{of care that}} every trustee, {{depending on the size}} and responsibility of their office, to exercise [...] "such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances". This codifies the common law and reflects company and insolvency law. It indicates that a professional trustee would be held to a higher standard than a family trustee. The subjective element requires a court to exercise greater scrutiny if a trustee had any special skills, which takes the trustee's ability above the objective baseline. So if a trustee had a special accountancy qualification that trustee would be expected to exercise a greater than normal <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> over the trust's accounts.|$|E

To criminalize command decisions in a theater of complex combat operations is a grave step indeed. It is also unnecessary, particularly in this case. It is possible for officers to err in judgment—and to thereby incur censure—without violating a criminal statute. This is particularly true where the errors are those of omission, where the standards come from multiple non-punitive doctrinal publications, where there is less than complete and certain knowledge of enemy capabilities and intent, and where commanders enjoy wide discretion in their exercise of their command prerogatives and responsibilities.|$|E

In search of an answer, we analyse the development <b>of</b> <b>care</b> need incidence in West Germany between 1986 and 2005 on the basis of longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP).

500|$|In {{chapters}} {{five and}} six Townsend discusses US-funded charitable organizations in China, especially missions. He points out that although the United States had given at least $160 million in philanthropy to China, these charities in China, even secular hospitals and schools, are generally preyed upon by the very Chinese people who the charitable workers seek to help. [...] These charities are subject to rampant looting, arson, and murderous mob violence by Chinese people who their government refuses to prosecute. Much of this violence is incited by the anti-foreigner propaganda of the KMT, a party described as being [...] "worse than the Ku Klux Klan at its most degenerate stage", and through US aid to China Townsend suggests that America is actually bankrolling propaganda against itself. Though the missionaries are sincere and hard-working, Townsend finds that they suffer from extreme delusion over the ultimate futility of their goal of reforming the Chinese. The missionaries, he states, have willfully ignored overwhelming evidence that no <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> or education can uproot the intrinsic sickness of Chinese culture. He calls {{for an end to}} all missionary and charitable work in China.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being the}} longest {{statement}} of the facts {{in any of the}} four appellate opinions generated by the case, Cardozo's was described by Posner as [...] "elliptical and slanted". It has also been deemed [...] "highly abstract". According to Professor Walter O. Weyrauch in his 1978 journal article, [...] "Cardozo's famous opinion reduced the complicated facts of the case to a bare minimum. Mrs. Palsgraf was transformed into a 'plaintiff' without age, family status, or occupation. The opinion omitted the nature of her injury, the amount of damages that she sought, {{and the size of the}} jury award." [...] For example, Cardozo describes Palsgraf (whom he does not name, nor mention her daughters) as standing on the LIRR's platform, rather than waiting for a train, thus downplaying her status as a customer entitled to a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> by the railroad. The explosive package is described as small, though the witnesses had described it as large. The scales are described as being [...] "at the other end of the platform, many feet away" [...] from the explosion, but the record does not support this statement. This characterization may have been based on testimony by Lillian Palsgraf, who had gone to buy a paper from a newsstand [...] "at the other end of the platform", but who was yet close enough to see the package fall. Cardozo's characterization of distance would be challenged by the plaintiff in her motion for reargument, which would be denied with the rejoinder that however close she was to the explosion, she was not so close as to bring her within the zone of foreseeable risk.|$|E

50|$|The defense {{behavior}} of daffodil cichlids {{has been shown}} to be linked to androgens, specifically the defense of their young. Dominant female breeders perform the most care and also display the highest levels of plasma testosterone compared to other individuals within the social group. Dominant male breeders provide a similar amount <b>of</b> <b>care</b> as the subordinate helpers, but breeding males also have the highest levels of 11-ketotestosterone, an important fish androgen. Breeders have higher levels of both androgens compared to helpers, but no matter what the sex or status of the fish, there is a weak but significant positive correlation between testosterone levels and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Androgens may promote defense of young, which contradicts the commonly reported trade-off between androgen levels and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>care</b> (androgen levels and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>care</b> are usually negatively correlated).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} two relatively independent {{forms of}} human development: waking up, {{the process and}} practices of psychospiritual awakening, and growing up, the process of moving from lesser narcissistic and ethnocentric self-identities towards mature postconventional self-identities with greater <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> inclusion, perspective-taking, <b>caring,</b> and compassion. Each is a unique type of growth, contemplative and transformative, with different ways of engaging and differing goals and results. The former is about transcending or deconstructing the ego and the latter about building, strengthening, and diversifying the ego. Whereas the Buddhist tradition and contemplative practices aim at awakening and transcending samsara (worldly conditions) by cultivating compassion and taming the mind, the Western tradition cultivates greater <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and compassion by developing a mature ego within samsara that is both social-justice and eco-justice informed.
