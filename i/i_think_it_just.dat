500|$|... "Soldier" [...] {{was written}} by Badu {{immediately}} after receiving Riggins' beat for the song. He said Badu wanted it to have a sound similar to J Dilla and his Detroit hip hop scene, which Riggins was inspired by: [...] "A lot of producers from Detroit have a certain sound, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> comes from being in the city." [...] Its sociopolitical lyrics have Badu expressing sympathy and solidarity for those facing oppression, with references to police corruption, black-on-black crime, and Hurricane Katrina. [...] "The Cell" [...] was produced by Husayn and features a lively, choral style and hard bop feel. Titled {{as a metaphor for}} both heredity and confinement, the song is a tableau of crime, drugs, and desperation in urban decay, streamlined by a stark story about Brenda, a character who falls victim to her environment. Cited by Chavarria as the album's most effects-heavy track, [...] "Twinkle" [...] features a futuristic sound, a convoluted beat, and abstract aural elements such as white noise bursts, high-pitched voices, abrasive instruments, and layers of twinkling keyboard bass. The lyrics lament the plight of the Black community and the cyclical effects on African Americans by the various failures of American social institutions such as the health care, education, and prison systems. Badu raps in the song's verse, [...] "Children of the matrix be hittin’ them car switches / Seen some virgin Virgos hanging out with Venus bitches", followed by her singing, [...] "They don’t know their language, they don’t know their God". Over humming keyboards, the closing minutes of the song feature a speech in the ancient African language of Mdw Ntchr, followed by a speaker's rant inspired by actor Peter Finch's own rant in the 1976 film Network. The speaker angrily laments the state {{of the world and the}} complacency of people. Philadelphia Weeklys Craig D. Linsey likened [...] "Twinkle" [...] to a denser version of Marvin Gaye's 1971 song [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)".|$|E

And I didn't want {{to be one of those}} guys, but a lot of people thought that it was the right time -- and it did turn out to be that.

2500|$|Responses to Gamergate have {{encouraged}} {{the video game}} industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them. Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a [...] "Diversity in Technology" [...] program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at {{increasing the number of}} women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in announcing the program that [...] "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent". Electronic Arts (EA) COO Peter Moore said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling Fortune [...] "f there's been any benefit to Gamergate, ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> makes us think twice at times". Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the Seattle Times, IGDA executive director Kate Edwards said, [...] "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, [...] "We need to stop this. This has got to change." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> has great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and she and I were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really good for you, sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{continues}} to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced {{themselves from their}} association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a [...] "rock band" [...] in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated [...] "I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, [...] "It was never a deliberate thing , but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> naturally happened because there's {{a lot of different}} styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained [...] "Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding [...] "we were never really a good ska band anyway".|$|E

5000|$|In April 2004, Muse {{frontman}} Matt Bellamy stated [...] "I {{think the}} absolution {{is not necessarily}} a religious word: [...] "It has meanings of purity (absolute), but it's not necessarily talking from a Christian or any particular religious point of view. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> suggesting that the act of making music is a way of understanding things." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sam's {{return to}} Walford saw her reignite {{an affair with}} her former, now married lover Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was embroiled in a feud with her brother Phil. Medcalf has {{revealed}} that she was extremely nervous when she was informed {{that she would have}} to enact love scenes with Kemp, who aside from his part in EastEnders, was renowned to viewers as a member of the 1980s pop band Spandau Ballet. Speaking about the characters' affair, Medcalf has said, [...] "Steve Owen basically made a play for her because he was using her to get back at Phil. He knew that Phil would hate it [...] they were rivals. But then, in her defence, he was a charmer, and he managed to keep it all from his wife. He just played the game very well." [...] The relationship ended in [...] "tragedy" [...] when Steve, in an attempt to kidnap Phil's daughter Louise, was killed in a road accident. Medcalf has suggested that Sam was [...] "devastated" [...] by Steve's death: [...] "She fell for [...] hook, line and sinker. She really believed that he was going to be the man." [...] She subsequently moved on to her former lover Beppe di Marco, but according to Medcalf, that relationship finished because Beppe [...] "thought [...] was a bit full on [...] she was so desperate for a relationship that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> scared [...]" [...] Another fling followed with abusive Trevor Morgan, played by Alex Ferns. According to Ferns, the relationship started because Trevor wanted to make his wife, Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) jealous. In the storyline, the romance ended when Trevor's true aggressive self emerged.|$|E

60|$|I {{have listened}} with great {{interest}} to the earnest appeal made to Illinois men by the gentleman from Lawrence [James S. Emery] who has just addressed us so eloquently and forcibly. I was deeply moved by his statement of the wrongs done to free-State men out there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> {{to say that all}} true men North should sympathize with them, and ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs. But we must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot; we must be calm and moderate, and consider the whole difficulty, and determine what is possible and just. We must not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments. We have higher aims; we will have more serious business than to dally with temporary measures.|$|E

In the intervals of her housework she has been with me nearly the whole morning; and I found out, among other things, that her sweetheart is a private soldier in the Guards, and that she expects to see him to-morrow. I have got money enough left, little as it is, to turn the head of any Private in the British army; and, if the person appointed to watch me to-morrow is a man, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> possible that he may find his attention disagreeably diverted from Miss Gwilt {{in the course of the}} evening.|$|E
60|$|These remains {{naturally}} suggest many interesting reflections. They {{establish the}} great {{age of the}} island, an opinion which the builders of theories concerning {{the creation of the}} various groups in the South Seas are not always inclined to admit. For my own part <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> as probable that human beings were living in the valleys of the Marquesas three thousand years ago as that they were inhabiting the land of Egypt. The origin of the island of Nukuheva cannot be imputed to the coral insect: for indefatigable as that wonderful creature is, it would be hardly muscular enough to pile rocks one upon the other more than three thousand feet above the level of the sea. That the land may have been thrown up by a submarine volcano is as possible as anything else. No one can make an affidavit to the contrary, and therefore I will say nothing against the supposition: indeed, were geologists to assert that the whole continent of America had in like manner been formed by the simultaneous explosion of a train of Etnas, laid under the water {{all the way from the}} North Pole to the parallel of Cape Horn, I am the last man in the world to contradict them.|$|E
