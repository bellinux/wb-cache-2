2500|$|Al-Karaji, in his {{treatise}} al-Fakhri, {{extends the}} methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. The historian of mathematics, F. Woepcke, praised Al-Karaji for being [...] "the first who introduced {{the theory of}} algebraic calculus." [...] Also in the 10th century, Abul Wafa translated the works of Diophantus into Arabic. Ibn al-Haytham would develop analytic geometry. Al-Haytham derived the formula for {{the sum of the}} fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. Al-Haytham performed an integration in order to find the volume of a paraboloid, and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of polynomials up to the fourth degree. [...] In the late 11th century, Omar Khayyam would develop algebraic geometry, wrote Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid, and wrote on the general <b>geometric</b> <b>solution</b> to cubic equations. Nasir al-Din Tusi (Nasireddin) made advances in spherical trigonometry. Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals.|$|E
2500|$|Another Persian {{mathematician}} Omar Khayyam {{is credited}} with identifying the foundations of algebraic geometry and found the general <b>geometric</b> <b>solution</b> of the cubic equation. His book Treatise on Demonstrations of Problems of Algebra (1070), which laid down the principles of algebra, {{is part of the}} body of Persian mathematics that was eventually transmitted to Europe. Yet another Persian mathematician, Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī, found algebraic and numerical solutions to various cases of cubic equations. He also developed the concept of a function. The Indian mathematicians Mahavira and Bhaskara II, the Persian mathematician Al-Karaji, + bxn = c (only equations with positive roots were considered)," [...] and the Chinese mathematician Zhu Shijie, solved various cases of cubic, quartic, quintic and higher-order polynomial equations using numerical methods. In the 13th century, the solution of a cubic equation by Fibonacci is representative of the beginning of a revival in European algebra. Abū al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī al-Qalaṣādī (1412–1486) took [...] "the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism". He also computed ∑n2, ∑n3 and used the method of successive approximation to determine square roots. As the Islamic world was declining, the European world was ascending. And it is here that algebra was further developed.|$|E

25|$|Omar Khayyám (c. 1050 – 1123) {{wrote a book}} on Algebra {{that went}} beyond Al-Jabr to include {{equations}} of the third degree. Omar Khayyám provided both arithmetic and <b>geometric</b> <b>solutions</b> for quadratic equations, but he only gave <b>geometric</b> <b>solutions</b> for general cubic equations since he mistakenly believed that arithmetic solutions were impossible. His method of solving cubic equations by using intersecting conics had been used by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), but Omar Khayyám generalized the method to cover all cubic equations with positive roots. He only considered positive roots {{and he did not}} go past the third degree. He also saw a strong relationship between Geometry and Algebra.|$|R
2500|$|In the 11th century, the Persian poet-mathematician, Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), made {{significant}} progress {{in the theory of}} cubic equations. In an early paper, he discovered that a cubic equation can have more than one solution and stated that it cannot be solved using compass and straightedge constructions. He also found a <b>geometric</b> <b>solution.</b> + 200x [...] 20x2 + 2000}} and he found a positive root of this cubic by considering the intersection of a rectangular hyperbola and a circle. An approximate numerical solution was then found by interpolation in trigonometric tables. The then in the last assertion is erroneous and should, at least, be replaced by also. The geometric construction was perfectly suitable for Omar Khayyam, as it occurs for solving a problem of geometric construction. At the end of his article he says only that, for this geometrical problem, if approximations are sufficient, then a simpler solution may be obtained by consulting trigonometric tables. Textually: If the seeker is satisfied with an estimate, it is up to him to look into the table of chords of Almagest, or the table of sines and versed sines of Mothmed Observatory. This is followed by a short description of this alternate method (seven lines). In his later work, the Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra, he wrote a complete classification of cubic equations with general geometric solutions found by means of intersecting conic sections.|$|E

First, we prove that the graph reduction that establishes the sequence in which to apply the construction steps defines a terminating confluent reduction system, {{in the case of}} well-constrained graphs. For overconstrained problems there may not be a unique normal form. Underconstrained problems, on the other hand, do have a unique normal form. Second, we prove that all <b>geometric</b> <b>solutions</b> found using simple root-selection rules must place certain triples of elements in the same topological order, no matter which graph reduction sequence they are based on. Moreover, we prove that this implies that the <b>geometric</b> <b>solutions</b> derived by different reduction sequences must be congruent.
