If the jalapeño plants were stressed by increased salinity in the water, erratic watering, temperature, light, soil nutrition, by insects, or illness this will increase the pungency of the produced jalapeños.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spark plug}} {{is said to}} be [...] "hot" [...] if it is a better heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the spark plug.

5000|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>range</b> of a {{spark plug}} is {{affected}} by the construction of the spark plug: the types of materials used, the length of insulator and the surface area of the plug exposed within the combustion chamber. For normal use, the selection of {{a spark plug}} <b>heat</b> <b>range</b> is a balance between keeping the tip hot enough at idle to prevent fouling and cold enough at maximal power to prevent pre-ignition or engine knocking. By examining [...] "hotter" [...] and [...] "cooler" [...] spark plugs of the same manufacturer side by side, the principle involved can be very clearly seen; the cooler plugs have a more substantial ceramic insulator filling the gap between the center electrode and the shell, effectively allowing more heat to be carried off by the shell, while the hotter plugs have less ceramic material, so that the tip is more isolated from the body of the plug and retains heat better.|$|E

50|$|It {{was common}} before {{the modern era}} of {{computerized}} fuel injection to specify {{at least a couple}} of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a hotter plug for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a colder plug for sustained high-speed highway use. This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars' fuel/air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions. Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug <b>heat</b> <b>range.</b> Very old racing engines will sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just for starting and another to be installed for driving once the engine is warmed up.|$|E
50|$|For {{metamorphic}} rocks, {{there are}} certain principles for measuring the decrepitations. What is known as D1 decrepitation, is classified as a temperature range of about 200-300℃, and {{is caused by the}} liquid phase which occupies intricate inclusions, as in hydrothermal minerals. D2 decrepitation is characterized by a starting <b>heat</b> <b>range</b> of about 300-700℃, the temperature can also increase rapidly for a few hundred degrees, such as in solid inclusions. D3 decrepitation is continuously heated until the rate reaches its maximum out at about 350-450℃, D3 decrepitation can be observed in carbonates and is defined by the effect of an inversion of the mineral. Once decrepitation of a D4 mineral is reached it should reach completion within a few degrees, which is seen in the decrepitation of quartz. Decrepitation as a result of decomposition is known as D5 decrepitation, it is characterized by a sharp upwards rate, a definite peak, and a sharp downwards rate, this can be detected by comparing the peaks of various minerals within a rock.|$|E
50|$|The F103 series were {{equipped}} {{exclusively with}} four-cylinder four-stroke engines. These were longitudinally mounted. This combination of front-wheel drive, which Auto Union's DKW brand had pioneered during the 1930s, and the longitudinal positioning of a four-cylinder engine {{would provide the}} basic template for Volkswagen's successful new Passat {{as well as the}} Audi models Audi 80 and Audi 100 after Volkswagenwerk AG acquired the Auto Union from Daimler-Benz late in 1964. Since the chassis on the F103 was taken from the DKW F102 with a three-cylinder two-stroke engine, the longer engine meant that the cooling system had to be offset {{to the left of the}} engine instead of the normal position in front of it. Because of the radiator’s location, the front cylinder of the engine had a tendency to run cooler than the other three and as a consequence the spark plug tended to foul up, particularly if the engine was often used in city traffic. To avoid this, it was often recommended to run a hotter spark plug (with a lower <b>heat</b> <b>range)</b> in the front cylinder than in the other three.|$|E

By carefully selecting the trap voltage update rate during adiabatic transport along a trap arm, we observe minimal heating {{relative to the}} anomalous heating background.

5000|$|The central {{electrode}} {{is connected to}} the terminal through an internal wire and commonly a ceramic series resistance to reduce emission of RF noise from the sparking. Non-resistor spark plugs, commonly sold without an [...] "R" [...] in the plug type part number, lack this element to reduce electro-magnetic interference with radios and other sensitive equipment. The tip can be made of a combination of copper, nickel-iron, chromium, or noble metals. In the late 1970s, the development of engines reached a stage where the <b>heat</b> <b>range</b> of conventional spark plugs with solid nickel alloy centre electrodes was unable to cope with their demands. A plug that was cold enough to cope with the demands of high speed driving {{would not be able to}} burn off the carbon deposits caused by stop-start urban conditions, and would foul in these conditions, making the engine misfire. Similarly, a plug that was hot enough to run smoothly in town could melt when called upon to cope with extended high speed running on motorways. The answer to this problem, devised by the spark plug manufacturers, was to use a different material and design for the centre electrode that would be able to carry the heat of combustion away from the tip more effectively than a solid nickel alloy could. Copper was the material chosen for the task and a method for manufacturing the copper-cored centre electrode was created by Floform.|$|E
