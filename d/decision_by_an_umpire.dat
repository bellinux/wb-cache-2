During each match, <b>a</b> video <b>umpire</b> was used to assist the on-field umpires in determining if a goal had been legally scored. The FIH also mandated that on a trial basis during the tournament, each team received the right to refer one <b>decision</b> made <b>by</b> <b>an</b> on-field <b>umpire</b> to the video umpire for assessment. Referrals were only permitted for decisions made within the 23 meter area relating to the award (or non-award) of goals, penalty strokes and penalty corners.

2500|$|If {{the ball}} {{goes over the}} crossbar, a point is scored and a white flag is raised <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> If the ball goes below the crossbar, a goal, worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> <b>A</b> goal must be scored <b>by</b> either <b>a</b> {{striking}} motion or by directly soloing {{the ball into the}} net. The goal is guarded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format {goal total} – {point total}. For example, the 1997 All-Ireland final finished: Clare 0–20 Tipperary 2–13. Thus Clare won by [...] "twenty points to nineteen" [...] (20 to 19). 2–0 would be referred to as [...] "two goals", never [...] "two zero". 0–0 is said [...] "no score".|$|R
50|$|Moran {{was still}} {{eligible}} for the minor grade {{when he made his}} senior debut with the Bennettsbridge senior team in 1956. He was at right wing-back as the Bridge faced John Lockes in the championship decider. John Lockes had <b>a</b> goal disallowed <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire,</b> <b>a</b> factor which contributed to a 2-8 to 3-3 victory for Bennettsbridge. It was Moran's first championship medal.|$|R
2500|$|A similar {{signal is}} also used to {{indicate}} a [...] "not out" [...] from the Decision Review System. This is signalled <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> crossing his hands in a horizontal position in front and above his waist three times.|$|R
5000|$|Half volley: {{technically}} not a mark. Sometimes players {{catch the}} ball {{so close to the}} ground {{that it is difficult to}} tell whether it hit or bounced off the ground. Sometimes a player is awarded <b>a</b> mark <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpires</b> benefit of the doubt.|$|R

50|$|If {{the ball}} {{goes over the}} crossbar, a point is scored and a white flag is raised <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> <b>A</b> point is scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar, or fisting it over, {{in which case the}} hand must be closed while {{striking}} the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a goal, worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> <b>A</b> goal is scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist passing the ball into it. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground prior to connection. The goal is guarded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0-21 Team B 4-8, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).|$|R
5000|$|When {{a player}} tries {{to check his}} swing but can't, Mark will use his famous line [...] "if he hits it, its a double", {{especially}} if a [...] "no-swing" [...] is called <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> This is likely in reference to Rondell White's famous check-swing triple for the Padres in the 2003 season.|$|R

50|$|In baseball, {{the strike}} zone is the volume of space through which a pitch must pass in order to count as a strike (if the batter does not swing). The strike zone {{is defined as the}} volume of space above home plate and between the batter's knees and the {{midpoint}} of their torso. Whether a pitch passed through the zone or not is decided <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire,</b> who is generally positioned behind the catcher.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1968 Scott umpired the Victoria versus South Australia clash at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His {{performance}} {{impressed the}} Victorian officials {{as they made}} a special request of the Australian National Football Council for Scott to control the Western Australia versus Victoria match that was played in Subiaco in July.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sports Sciences [© Taylor & Francis]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] this study a method for determining elbow extension and elbow abduction for a cricket bowling delivery was developed and assessed for Jenny Gunn who has hypermobility in both elbows and whose bowling action has been repeatedly queried <b>by</b> <b>umpires.</b> Bowling is <b>a</b> dynamic activity which is assessed visually in real time in <b>a</b> cricket match <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire.</b> When the legality of a bowler's action is questioned <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> <b>a</b> quantitative analysis is undertaken using a marker based motion analysis system. This method of quantifying elbow extension should agree with a visual assessment of when the arm is "straight'' and should minimise the effects of marker movement. A set of six markers on the bowling arm were used to calculate elbow angles. Differences of up to 1 degrees for elbow extension and up to 2 degrees for elbow abduction were found when angles calculated from the marker set for static straight arm trials were compared with measurements taken <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chartered sports physiotherapist. In addition comparison of elbow extension angles at ball release calculated from the markers during bowling trials with those measured from high speed video also showed good agreement with mean differences of 0 degrees +/- 2 degrees...|$|R

2500|$|Though an affable and laconic {{personality}} off the pitch, Clarke had a quick temper on {{the field}} and regarded the battle between batsman and bowler as a personal trial of strength and character.

50|$|Whenever <b>a</b> third <b>umpire</b> <b>decision</b> is signalled <b>by</b> <b>an</b> on-field <b>umpire,</b> {{the third}} umpire gets access to Instant Replay {{to make his}} decision.

Because {{in most of the}} cases, third umpire decisions end up in a tight gap between out and not out. A live crowd will make their decision on the replay shown. However, the third umpire is required to follow guidelines which may not be known by the crowd.|$|R
50|$|Major League Baseball (MLB) {{allows the}} use of instant replay review to allow league {{officials}} to review certain types of plays {{in order to determine}} the accuracy of the initial call of the umpires on the field. Reviews may be initiated either <b>by</b> <b>a</b> team's manager with limitations or by the umpires themselves. All instant-replay reviews are examined <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>umpire</b> at the Replay Command Center in New York City, who has the final decision as to whether to uphold or overturn the initial call.|$|R
5000|$|In baseball, hit by pitch (HBP) is a {{situation}} in which a batter or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitch from the pitcher; the batter is called a hit batsman (HB).
