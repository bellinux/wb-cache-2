40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{transmit}} energy in one direction, sonar flextensional transducers {{are combined into}} arrays of elements that are spaced a 1 / 4 wavelength apart. The directionality (<b>front-to-back</b> pressure <b>ratio)</b> is a modest of 6 dB. A single projector that is 1 / 3 wavelength in size and capable of developing unidirectional beams with <b>front-to-back</b> <b>ratios</b> greater than 20 dB that is independent of sound speed is described here. The directional Class VII “dogbone” flextensional is {{a modified version of}} an elliptical shaped Class IV flextensional having a concave shell rather than a convex one. The piezoelectric ceramic stack is a tri-laminar bar with two active sections separated by an inactive center section. By driving both sections of the stack in-phase, the shell is driven into omnidirectional radiation pattern. Driving each stack section 180 degrees out-phase causes a bending mode in the stack resulting in a dipole radiation pattern. By driving both sections using complex coefficients determined from the omnidirectional and dipole mode patterns, a cardioid directional radiation pattern is developed. Cardioid patterns are developed over an octave frequency band with a <b>front-to-back</b> pressure <b>ratio</b> of more than 50 dB.

The X-shaped dipoles give it a wide bandwidth to cover both the VHF (174 - 216 MHz) and UHF (470 - 700 MHz) bands. It has a gain of 5 dB VHF and 12 dB UHF and an 18 dB <b>front-to-back</b> <b>ratio.</b> The example shown is horizontally polarised.|$|E
50|$|The output {{indicates}} that the antenna has a maximum gain of 9.75 dBi, a little over three times the gain of an isotropic antenna. However, as the signal moves even five degrees to the side, this has dropped to 9.5. When you reach 75 degrees off the front, the antenna begins to have negative gain. This {{indicates that}} this antenna is fairly directional, and one would expect it {{to have a high}} <b>front-to-back</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A corner {{reflector}} antenna {{is a type of}} directional antenna used at VHF and UHF frequencies. It was invented by John D. Kraus in 1938. It consists of a dipole driven element mounted in front of two flat rectangular reflecting screens joined at an angle, usually 90°. [...] Corner reflectors have moderate gain of 10-15 dB, high <b>front-to-back</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20-30 dB, and wide bandwidth. They are widely used for UHF television receiving antennas, point-to-point communication links and data links for wireless WANs, and amateur radio antennas on the 144, 420, and 1296 MHz bands. [...] They radiate linearly polarized radio waves and can be mounted for either horizontal or vertical polarization.|$|E
50|$|Reflectors {{also have}} the {{advantage}} of reducing the signal received {{from the back of the}} antenna. Signals received from the rear and re-broadcast from the reflector have not undergone a change of phase, and do not add to the signal from the front. This greatly improves the <b>front-to-back</b> <b>ratio</b> of the antenna, making it more directional. This can be useful when a more directional signal is desired, or unwanted signals are present. There are cases when this is not desirable, and although reflectors are commonly seen in array antennas, they are not universal. For instance, while UHF television antennas often use an array of bowtie antennas with a reflector, a bowtie array without a reflector is a relatively common design in the microwave region.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{called a}} [...] "beam antenna", or [...] "parasitic array", the Yagi is very widely {{used as a}} high-gain antenna on the HF, VHF and UHF bands. [...] It has {{moderate}} to high gain which depends {{on the number of}} elements used, typically limited to about 20 dBi, [...] linear polarization, [...] unidirectional (end-fire) beam pattern [...] with high <b>front-to-back</b> <b>ratio</b> of up to 20 db. and is lightweight, inexpensive and simple to construct. [...] The bandwidth of a Yagi antenna, the frequency range over which it has high gain, is narrow, a few percent of the center frequency, and decreases with increasing gain, so it is often used in fixed-frequency applications. The largest and best-known use is as rooftop terrestrial television antennas, [...] but it is also used for point-to-point fixed communication links, in radar antennas, and for long distance shortwave communication by shortwave broadcasting stations and radio amateurs.|$|E

In general, the purpose of designing a microstrip Yagi antenna is to combine features of a Yagi antenna with those of a microstrip patch to obtain an antenna that can be manufactured at low cost, has a low profile, and radiates a directive beam that, as plotted on an elevation plane perpendicular to the antenna plane, appears tilted away from the broadside. Such antennas are suitable for flush mounting on surfaces of diverse objects, including spacecraft, aircraft, land vehicles, and computers.

Each element would include four microstrip-patch Yagi subelements: one reflector patch, one driven patch, and two director patches. To obtain circular polarization, each driven patch would be fed by use of a dual offset aperture-coupled feed featuring bow-tie-shaped apertures. The selection of the dual offset bow-tie aperture geometry is supported by results found in published literature that show that this geometry would enable matching of the impedances of the driven patches to the 50 -Omega impedance of the microstrip feedline while maintaining a desirably large <b>front-to-back</b> lobe <b>ratio...</b>|$|R

The high <b>front-to-back</b> (F/B) <b>ratio</b> (up to 15 dB) is attributed to the constructive interference that takes place between the individual printed Yagi arrays in the design.

The operational principles of this design are discussed to give insight on the radiation mechanism of the antenna. An initial design at around 32. 5 GHz is presented to show the performance capabilities of this configuration. An impedance bandwidth of 8. 3 % can be achieved around this frequency. Then, a parametric analysis is conducted to estimate {{the significance of the}} design parameters that affect the antenna’s performance. Finally, measured return loss and radiation pattern performance at 5. 2 GHz is displayed to validate the principles and simulated results of the design.
