The sense of presented thesis is to make survey of new approaches to DNA sequencing and demonstrate usage and constraints of bioinformatic analytical tools available to day. Discussed techniques are then applied to the case study of finding molecular basis for rare hereditary disease. Introductory part deals with overview of commercially available sequencing techniques (454 Life Science, Applied Biosystems, Illumina, Helicos). Fundamentals of each method are described and possible further development is outlined. Post sequencing data analysis is than discussed in details. In practical section we demonstrate <b>genome</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques</b> successfully used to reveal causal mutation in the gene responsible for adult form of autozomal neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL).

40|$|Until recently, {{genetic mapping}} in cereals has been {{exclusively}} applied to populations derived from simple crosses. Genetic studies are now targeting broader population structures {{to take advantage}} of association mapping and whole <b>genome</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques.</b> This paper presents a study of a Doubled Haploid (DH) population derived from the complex cross, Chieftan/Barque//Manley/VB 9104, which is a significant departure from conventional mapping population structures. The population has been extensively phenotyped for malt quality and adaptation characteristics, through evaluation as a mainstream breeding population within the SA Barley Improvement Program (SABIP). Of the 841 (DH) lines, 837 lines were evaluated in double row trials, with 350 individuals promoted to stage one, 70 individuals to stage two and 10 individuals to stage three. One line (WI 3408) has subsequently progressed to pilot scale malting and brewing trials, with potential for commercial release. Using high throughput technology the stage one DH lines (350) were extensively screened with fluorescently labelled simple sequence repeats (SSRs) based on their association with the traits of interest for this population. There was a 60 percent rate of polymorphism between one or more parents. In total, 200 SSRs were assayed and analysed using both Gene Flow and Gene Mapper data bases...|$|R
40|$|The advancements in Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) have {{increased}} the amount of genomic information available for epidemiological analyses. WGS opens many avenues for investigation into the tracking of pathogens, but the rapid advancements in WGS could soon lead to a situation where traditional analytical techniques might become computationally impractical. For example, the traditional method to determine the origin of an isolate is to use phylogenetic analyses. However, phylogenetic analyses become computationally prohibitive with larger datasets and are best for retrospective epidemiology. Therefore, I investigated if there might be less computationally demanding methods of analysing the same data to obtain similar conclusions. This thesis describes a proof-of-principle method for evaluating if such alternative <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques</b> might be viable. In this thesis Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was used, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (indel) genomic variation. I move away from whole <b>genome</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as phylogenetic analysis, and instead focus on individual SNPs. I showed that genetic signals (such as SNPs and indels) can be utilised in novel ways to rapidly produce {{a summary of the}} possible geographic origin of an isolate with a minimal demand on computational power. The methods described could be added to the suite of analytical epidemiological tools and are a promising indication of the viability of developing cheap, rapid diagnostic tools to be implemented in healthcare institutions. Furthermore, the principles behind the development of the methods described in this thesis could have much wider applications than just MRSA. This implies that further work based on the principles described in this thesis on alternative pathogens could prove to be promising avenues of investigation...|$|R

However, devising bioinformatics applications to analyse such large dataset is still challenging, as it often requires downloading large archives and parsing the relevant text files. Therefore, it is making it difficult to enable virtual data integration in order to collect the critical co-variates necessary for analysis. Methods: We address these issues by transforming the TCGA data into the Semantic Web standard Resource Description Format (RDF), link it to relevant datasets in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud and further propose an efficient data distribution strategy to host the resulting 20. 4 billion triples data via several SPARQL endpoints. Having the TCGA data distributed across multiple SPARQL endpoints, we enable biomedical scientists to query and retrieve information from these SPARQL endpoints by proposing a TCGA tailored federated SPARQL query processing engine named TopFed. Results: We compare TopFed with a well established federation engine FedX in terms of source selection and query execution time by using 10 different federated SPARQL queries with varying requirements. Our evaluation results show that TopFed selects on average {{less than half of the}} sources (with 100 % recall) with query execution time equal to one third to that of FedX. Conclusion: With TopFed, we aim to offer biomedical scientists a single-point-of-access through which distributed TCGA data can be accessed in unison. We believe the proposed system can greatly help researchers in the biomedical domain to carry out their research effectively with TCGA as the amount and diversity of data exceeds the ability of local resources to handle its retrieval and parsing.

Potentially useful RAPD markers can be cytogenetically mapped with more precision by in situ hybridization and, as they segregate as dominant markers in a Mendelian fashion, they can also be genetically mapped relative to other genes or rearrangements. Finally, we identified markers for their potential use in the identification of different mosquito strains...|$|R
