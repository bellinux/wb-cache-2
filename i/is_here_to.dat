5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

25|$|Because the P-array is 576 bits long, {{and the key}} bytes are XORed {{through all}} these 576 bits during the initialization, many {{implementations}} support key sizes up to 576 bits. While this is certainly possible, the 448 bits limit <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key, as the last four values of the P-array don't affect every bit of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.|$|E

Maria Raha, author of Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground, said that with the song, [...] "Madonna brought a trunk full of trite lyrics on the long-standing tradition of pop music, love." [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at 1986 Grammy Awards, but lost to Whitney Houston's [...] "Saving All My Love for You".

[...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{influence}} was most profound on the younger generation. Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman {{struck a chord}} with them.

Author William McKeen of Rock and roll <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna intermixed such middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. In addition, at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat-chested, stick-thin women as ideals of beauty, the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that it was fine to be in the shape they were. The term [...] "Madonna wannabe" [...] was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna's style. At one point, Macy's allotted an entire floor area for the sale of clothes styled according to Madonna's fashion. University professors, gender-studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post-modernist style and cultural icon. According to author Debbi Voller, [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] gave rise to the icon Madonna.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this decline in her career, Mukerji lost weight and underwent a complete makeover. In 2009, she collaborated for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy opposite Shahid Kapoor. Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket-obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man; it was hugely hyped before release and had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Economic Times critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed with the picture and wrote, [...] "Rani Mukherjee {{comes up with a}} spirited performance but her mock sob-whine-whimper do not amuse anymore. Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player." [...] The film was Mukerji's fourth economic failure in a row. When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner, she stated, [...] "An actor <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> act and pick great roles and scripts. I was getting great roles from Yash Raj at that point, roles that any actor would give an arm to do. I stand by those films regardless of their fate". Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the Sony Entertainment Television reality show Dance Premier League. She said that appearing on television would make her [...] "more accessible" [...] to the audiences and help her [...] "gain visibility" [...] when she was [...] "not doing too many films". Mukerji did not make any screen appearances in 2010.|$|E
