500|$|Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward {{appeared}} on <b>Independent</b> <b>Television</b> <b>News,</b> where he endorsed Profumo's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as [...] "baseless". Ward's own activities {{had become a}} matter of official concern, and on 1 April the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and tapped his telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house. The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.|$|E

That evening, both the BBC and the ITN (<b>Independent</b> <b>Television</b> <b>News)</b> reported that the IRA team had been involved in a [...] "shootout" [...] with the authorities. The following morning, BBC Radio 4 reported that the alleged bomb was [...] "packed with bits of metal and shrapnel", and later carried a statement from Ian Stewart, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, that [...] "military personnel were involved. A car bomb was found, which has been defused". Each of the eleven British daily newspapers reported the alleged finding of the car bomb, of which eight quoted its size as [...] The IRA issued a statement later on 7 March to the effect that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were [...] "on active service" [...] in Gibraltar and had [...] "access to and control over [...] " [...] of Semtex.|$|E

His report was broadcast on ITN's News at Ten programme. According to The Times correspondent Edward Mortimer, [...] "viewers were thus afforded {{a panoramic view of}} the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing." [...] After it was handed over, [...] "very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay flat on the ground, 'pancaked' in a manner which I am told can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside." [...] Mortimer concluded that the footage [...] "establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May—at a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra." ...|$|E

2500|$|Refugees {{reported}} that Trnopolje was a [...] "decent" [...] camp {{in comparison to}} Omarska and Keraterm as there were no systematic killings, only arbitrary ones. Indeed, many non-Serbs entered the camp voluntarily, [...] "simply to avoid the rampaging militias plundering their streets and villages". This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as [...] "a perverse haven" [...] for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor. Author Hariz Halilovich writes: [...] Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment. By August 1992, Trnopolje held about 3,500 people. On 7 August 1992, reporters from <b>Independent</b> <b>Television</b> <b>News</b> (ITN), a British television station, took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje, and recorded their living conditions. The images were shown {{around the world and}} caused public outrage. This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross (IRC) access to some of the Prijedor camps, but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye. Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Korićani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992. The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August. In mid-August, Trnopolje was placed {{into the hands of the}} IRC. The camp was officially shut down that November.|$|E

(Communication Studies) The aim of {{this study}} is to develop {{attitudinal}} scales with which expectations of the viewers of television in Namibia regarding <b>television</b> <b>news</b> as well as the perceived nature of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> in 1990 may be measured. The television viewership of the "Namibian Broadcasting Corporation" (NBC), representing all Namibians regardless of ethnic grouping in posession of television licenses, was used asuniversum. The data obtained may be used to develop a <b>television</b> <b>news</b> model which may satisfy the majority of the population of Namibia. A systems approach was used in this process. The study of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> on a macro-level can best be explained utilising a systems model. A systems model through which an attempt is made to explain the audio-visual transmission of information was thus developed. This model may be applied to television systems within any society. It was found that television is the primary source of news for a majority of targeted viewers. According to the viewers, NBC <b>television</b> <b>news</b> closely approaches an authoritarian <b>television</b> <b>news</b> model.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} and {{assesses the}} development of the UK <b>television</b> <b>news</b> industry during the period 1982 - 1998. Its aim is to ascertain {{the degree to which a}} market for <b>television</b> <b>news</b> has developed, how such a market operates, and how it coexists with the 'public service' goals of news provision. A major purpose of the research is to investigate whether 'the market' and 'public service' requirements have to be the conceptual polarities they are commonly supposed to be in much media academic analysis of the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> genre. It has conducted such an analysis through an examination of the development strategies ofthe major news organisations of the BBC, ITN and Sky News, and an assessment of the changes that have taken place to the structure of the news industry as a whole. It places these developments within the determining contexts of Government economic policy and broadcasting regulation. The research method employed was primarily that of the in-depth interview with <b>television</b> <b>news</b> management, politicians and regulators: in other words, those instrumental in directing the strategic development within the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> industry. Its main findings are that there has indeed been a development of market activity within the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> industry, but that the amount of this activity has been limited by the particular economic attributes of the <b>television</b> <b>news</b> product. What makes the provision of <b>television</b> <b>news</b> a worthwhile venture for news organisations is the degree to which <b>television</b> <b>news</b> confers status and political legitimacy upon its provider.
