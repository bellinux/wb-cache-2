50|$|An often {{overlooked}} part of Marrow's mutation is <b>her</b> unusual <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> hair color, {{which she has}} possessed since birth. In almost all of her appearances, Marrow has pink hair. While she is sometimes shown with a white skin tone, Marrow is more often shown to have a vivid pink tone in <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> During <b>her</b> time with Weapon X <b>her</b> hair <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> color was depicted as having a notable purple tone.|$|R

25|$|In {{some species}} of anglerfish, when a male finds a female, he bites into <b>her</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> {{releases}} an enzyme that digests {{the skin of}} his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule.|$|E
500|$|Bågenholm {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} at 21:10. Her body temperature {{at the time was}} , the lowest survived body temperature ever recorded in a human with accidental hypothermia, until fellow Swede Stella, 7 years old, survived [...] at Christmas 2010. Dr. Mads Gilbert, an anesthesiologist and the chief of the hospital's emergency room, proceeded with the resuscitation attempt. He commented on Bågenholm's state: [...] "She has completely dilated pupils. She is ashen, flaxen white. She's wet. She's ice cold when I touch <b>her</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> she looks absolutely dead." [...] Gilbert had treated many cases of hypothermia before because of the cold climate in Norway, and knew how to treat Bågenholm. The electrocardiogram connected to her showed no signs of life, but Gilbert knew patients should be [...] "warmed up before you declare them dead". He and his team hoped Bågenholm's brain had received enough oxygen from the CPR she was given after her rescue.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} emulates the title {{sequences}} of Bond films from the 1960s to present-day, high-tech 3D designs. In the opening sequence, {{one of the}} graphics turns into a wire frame of a beating electronic heart, which [...] "pulls out" [...] with each beat. As the camera zooms, the heart grows in size and [...] "weaves" [...] to become Duff. According to MTV News, while she doesn't [...] "take on" [...] Pussy Galore, Plenty O'Toole, Holly Goodhead, or any other Bond girl, she becomes a [...] "Bond girl in spirit", switching from era to era with different looks, with her hair blowing and flying around in graphic silhouettes. Instead of cutting from image to image, the shots evolve in a Bond-like style [...] "as shapes take on different forms to reveal something else". Duff performs in silhouette, with a microphone, [...] "where a gun would otherwise be". In another shot, her band is a silhouette. The edition of the video is matched {{to the beat of}} the song, [...] "zapping the view in and out, until a lull in the song, when the view travels back into her eyes, through <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> back to her beating heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liebeck {{was taken}} to the hospital, where it was {{determined}} that she had suffered third-degree burns on six percent of <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> lesser burns over sixteen percent. She remained in the hospital for eight days while she underwent skin grafting. During this period, Liebeck lost 20 pounds (9kg, nearly 20% of her body weight), reducing her to 83 pounds (38kg). [...] After the hospital stay, Liebeck needed care for 3 weeks, which was provided by her daughter. Liebeck suffered permanent disfigurement after the incident and was partially disabled for two years.|$|E
2500|$|She {{says that}} the most terrifying of all her {{memories}} there was when she (in common with other slaves) was marked by a process resembling both scarification and tattooing, which was a traditional practice throughout Sudan. As her mistress was watching her with a whip in her hand, a dish of white flour,ikllj a dish of salt and a razor were brought by a woman. She used the flour to draw patterns on <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> then she cut deeply along the lines before filling the wounds with salt to ensure permanent scarring. A total of 114 intricate patterns were cut into her breasts, belly, and into her right arm.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Bonduel McCourt (or {{according}} to some accounts Elizabeth Nellis McCourt) was born in 1854 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin to Irish-Catholic immigrants Peter and Elizabeth McCourt. She later {{claimed to have been}} born in 1860. She appears to have been christened on October 7, 1854 at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church. Called Lizzie as a child, the fourth of eleven children, she grew up in a middle-class family in a two-story house. [...] Her father was a partner in a local clothing store and owner of Oshkosh's first theater, McCourt Hall. Her mother fostered in her beautiful daughter the belief that her looks were of great worth, excusing her from domestic chores so as to preserve <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> allowing her to dream of a future as an actress. Concerned by his wife's indulgence in their young and striking daughter, Peter McCourt thought it prudent to put her to work at the clothing store, where she was often in the company of fashionable young men. At age 16, she was a [...] "fashionably plump" [...] blond-haired young woman with a hectic social schedule.|$|E

She begins to avoid mirrors, covering up <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> gloves <b>and</b> hats, and begins to see her hands as [...] "monkey's paws," [...] {{going so far as}} to say that [...] "this skin color of mine seemed to me like the brand of shame." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{the methods}} {{anglerfish}} use to locate mates vary. Some species have minute eyes that are unfit for identifying females, {{while others have}} underdeveloped nostrils, making them unlikely to effectively find females by smell. [...] When a male finds a female, he bites into <b>her</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> releases an enzyme that digests {{the skin of his}} mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return.

2500|$|Chimerism occurs {{naturally}} in adult Ceratioid anglerfish {{and is in}} fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. [...] Using strong olfactory (or smell) receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single hermaphroditic individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large testicles as their other organs atrophy. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.|$|E
