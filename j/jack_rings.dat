50|$|At {{the safe}} house, Freda {{exhibits}} more signs that her memory is returning as Gwen cuts her hair. Freda tells Gwen that she {{fell out of}} the sky after being trapped in a fire. Gwen then tells Freda about the Rift and how she wound up in the river in 2009, instead of her own time, 2069. <b>Jack</b> <b>rings</b> Gwen's phone and upon receiving orders to take Freda back to the Hub, Andy confronts Gwen about Freda's results. Andy chastises Gwen for not letting him know about Torchwood and refuses to let her take Freda into isolation. Gwen blurts out that Freda is an alien, which is followed by Freda jumping out of the window and running away.|$|E
50|$|Peggy takes a {{step toward}} life and wears <b>Jack's</b> <b>ring</b> again. Joanne, her defences shattered, her self esteem gone, resorts to the only {{reaction}} she knows, eating. Even Brock cannot reach her. Jack comes to the apartment but she throws him out. She never had an engagement ring. Peggy attempts to save Joanne from herself, but fails, even when {{she says she is}} returning the ring.|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{connectors}} {{reduced and}} special tools not needed. Clockwise rotation of screw tightens wedges against mounting body and right heat sink. Counterclockwise rotation of screw drives bottom wedge downward and <b>jacking</b> <b>ring</b> upward, pulling pins away from mating connector. Screw in mechanism turned to produce jacking force that disengages board from mating connector. Force parallel to connector pins do not bend or brake. When disengaged, board protrudes from assembly and readily grasped by operator...|$|R
5|$|Hager {{returned}} to professional wrestling on the independent circuit in 2017. He announced (using his <b>Jack</b> Swagger <b>ring</b> name) {{that he would}} be joining the House of Hardcore 2017 Australian tour. The Australia tour consists of four events between June 16 and June 24.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Holly is {{released}} on bail and finds Paul waiting, {{and they take}} a cab. He has her cat and a letter from José explaining he must end their relationship due to her arrest. Holly insists she will go to Brazil anyway, asks the cab to pull over, and releases the cat into the rain. Paul confronts Holly about his love and her behavior, then leaves, tossing the Cracker <b>Jack</b> <b>ring</b> they had engraved for her by Tiffany's into her lap and telling her to examine her life. She goes through a decision making moment, puts on the ring, and runs after Paul, who has gone looking for the cat. She searches the alley and finally finds the cat. Paul and Holly look into each other's eyes and shared a kiss.|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} Chang Ssu-Hsun was as follows: {{they built a}} tower of three storeys (totalling) more than ten feet in height, within which was {{concealed}} all the machinery. It was round (at the top to symbolize) the heavens, and square (at the bottom to symbolize) the earth. Below there was set up the lower wheel (ti lun), lower shaft (ti chu), and the framework base (ti tsu). There were also horizontal wheels (heng lun), (vertical) wheels fixed sideways (tshe lun), and slanting wheels (hsieh lun, i.e. oblique gearing); bearings for fixing them in place (ting shen kuan), a central coupling device (chung kuan) and a smaller coupling device (hsiao kuan)(i.e. the escapement); with a main transmission shaft (thien chu). Seven <b>jacks</b> <b>rang</b> bells on the left, struck a large bell on the right, and beat a drum in the middle to indicate clearly {{the passing of the}} quarter(-hours).|$|R
2500|$|Panel was {{installed}} in cities where many stations still used manual (non-dial) service. Calls from panel offices to manual offices required PCI (Panel Call Indicator) signals to tell the [...] "B Board Machine Incoming" [...] operator or incoming operator the phone number. The called number appeared on a lit display, enabling the operator to complete the call by plugging in the appropriate <b>jack,</b> and <b>ringing</b> the subscriber.|$|R
60|$|These cries had {{scarcely}} {{been made}} when <b>Jack's</b> gun <b>rang</b> {{out and the}} foremost of the three wolves {{was hit in the}} foreleg. He gave a plunge, and rolled over in the snow, snapping and snarling viciously. The report of the weapon was followed by the discharge of Randy's gun, but his aim was wild and the charge passed harmlessly {{over the heads of the}} wolves.|$|R
5000|$|Newman, as expected, informs Helen and Morty that Jerry {{was making}} out with Rachel during Schindler's List. Jerry, in [...] "trouble," [...] realizes that Newman {{would be the}} one {{responsible}} for it. <b>Jack</b> Klompus <b>rings</b> again to tell Morty that he had to break a window to get into the garage and that the Executives will be in New York City by 2:00 in the afternoon the next day. Morty decides that the trip to Paris will have to wait; since their flight is at 3:00 {{they will not be able}} to make it as the business deal is more important to him.|$|R
50|$|Jack Kracken is {{best remembered}} as the first boxer {{defeated}} by Joe Louis on July 4, 1934 {{in the first round}} of a scheduled six-round bout at Bacon Casino on Chicago’s South Side. Kracken was one of Chicago's top heavyweights at the time he fought Louis. It was Kracken's last appearance in the <b>ring.</b> <b>Jack</b> Kracken finished his career with 10 wins (all by knockout) and 7 losses.|$|R
50|$|Jack and Phyllis {{moved in}} together. Phyllis {{revealed}} to Jack {{that he was}} Summer's real dad and all three grew closer. After a fall at the MS Gala, Phyllis needed brain surgery, but {{was never able to}} tell Jack that Sharon had switched the results and Nick was really Summer's father before she slipped into a coma. <b>Jack</b> put a <b>ring</b> on Phyllis' finger and considered them engaged. Summer and Jack began to connect.|$|R
5000|$|At the beach, Sun has {{discovered}} that she has lost her wedding <b>ring.</b> <b>Jack</b> Shephard (Matthew Fox) offers to help Sun look for the ring, which Sun declines. Later, when Sun is angrily tearing apart her garden, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) arrives. Sun states {{that she does not}} remember ever seeing him angry. Locke laughs and replies that he used to be angry often. Sun asks him why he no longer becomes angry, and he replies that he is not lost any more. Sun asks him how he found himself. Locke answers, [...] "The same way anything lost gets found: I stopped looking." ...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the protagonist}} learns {{that the only}} way to break the curse is to prevent it from being cast in the first place. After {{defeating}} the evil twin four times, the protagonist is given four artifacts: the High Priest's amulet, the Necromancer's <b>ring,</b> <b>Jack</b> the Ripper's knife, and a vial of the Plant Monster's poison. The final level is unlocked, and takes the protagonist back in time to confront Ixona. Following Boris' instructions, the protagonist uses the artifacts to kill Ixona before she can place the curse. As a result, the curse is erased from existence for every afflicted generation of the protagonist's family line.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} precast tunnel segments for the Line T 02 of Saronno-Malpensa railway (Italy). After {{the experimental}} {{determination of the}} material properties, the structural behavior of the lining is simulated with FE analyses based on Non Linear Fracture Mechanics (NLFM). The numerical analyses presented herein will be mainly focused on the force exerted by hydraulic <b>jacks</b> on the <b>ring</b> during the excavation process. The numerical analyses were carried out considering different loading configurations and atypical boundary conditions in order to investigate the advantages coming {{from the use of}} Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) for a better crack control and for enhancing the bearing capacity. An optimized reinforcement based on the combination of rebars and steel fibers, is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|Mary arrives while Jack is {{inspecting}} his cheese vault, and he emerges {{wondering who}} has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him {{that this is a}} movie and not a television program, Don storming off in a huff when Jack refuses to let him do a scene. When Mary suggests a place, <b>Jack's</b> eyes <b>ring</b> up like an old cash register with a dollar sign ($) and [...] "no sale", they discuss other options (she sarcastically suggests the Monkey House at the Griffith Park Zoo). As they discuss their options, the cat writes a message extolling the [...] "Kit Kat Club" [...] ("entertainers free") and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While en route, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good [...] "mousecatel". Unbeknownst to them, the [...] "club" [...] is actually the maw of the cat, and as Jack and Mary enter, the cat's mouth closes on them.|$|R
6000|$|Stanley {{was true}} to his word. Not {{only did the}} men work almost without intermission, but he and Frank Morton scarce allowed {{themselves}} an hour's repose {{during the time that}} the work was going on. Night and day [...] "yo heave ho" [...] of the <b>Jack</b> Tars <b>rang</b> over the water; and the party on shore ran to and fro, from the beach to the store, with bales, kegs, barrels, and boxes on their shoulders. There were blankets and guns, and axes and knives, powder and shot, and beads and awls, and nets and twine. There were kettles of every sort and size; cloth of every hue; capotes of all dimensions, and minute etceteras without end: so that, had it been possible to prevail on the spirits of the ice to carry to the Esquimaux intelligence of the riches contained in the store at Chimo, an overwhelming flood of visitors would speedily have descended on that establishment. But no such messengers could be found--although Bryan asserted positively that more than [...] "wan o' them" [...] had been seen by him since his arrival; so the traders had nothing for it but to summon patience to their aid and bide their time.|$|R
50|$|Jack fights Darkness {{while the}} others relay {{the light of the}} setting sun. Jack loses his sword when Darkness has the upper-hand, but then uses the horn from the {{stallion}} to stab him. Exposed to the redirected sunlight, Darkness is expelled to a threshold to a dark void-like space, but uses the unicorn's horn to hold on. Darkness knows there is no physical escape; however, he laughs at Jack and warns him that evil and sin lurks in everyone; therefore, even though he will die, they will never truly defeat him. Jack accepts this, but decides to kill Darkness for the unicorn's safety. Jack strikes Darkness' hand, releasing the unicorn's horn, and Darkness is expelled into the void. As Gump returns the stallion's horn, returning him to life, <b>Jack</b> retrieves the <b>ring</b> from the pond and returns it to Lily, reviving her.|$|R
50|$|The {{square of}} the town hall was {{completely}} redeveloped in the 1990s. The city organised a large demonstration {{on the occasion of}} the fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy landings. The edges of the Vire were reconfigured with the rehabilitation of the towpath and the creation of a green beach, at the Place du Quai-à-Tangue. A scow was rebuilt and crossed the river, in order to remember former river traffic. In 2004, the rural area of Bois-Jugan was urbanised, with the creation of housing within a framework of preservation of green spaces and a large aquatic centre. Later, the Des Ronchettes water tower was built following an unusual method for the time, since the tank (strongly resembling a flying saucer) was built at the ground level, then raised by a system of <b>jacks,</b> as the <b>rings</b> composing its body were manufactured. As such, its elevation allows a mounting point for telecommunication (mobile phone, WiMAX, and FM radio) networks.|$|R
50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Port Charles {{is a major}} port. The Waterfront {{district}} has been {{under the control of}} Sonny Corinthos for over a decade, though rival gangs have tried to move in on his territory, such as Lorenzo Alcazar, the Ruiz brothers, and others. Kelly's, a local eatery, is located in this area and the Elm Street Pier is also located here. Majority of the Port Charles waterfront is owned by the Pride-Philips Company, which was given to Courtney Matthews as a thank you from a woman whose life she saved. Courtney later sold Pride-Philips to Lorenzo Alcazar. In 2008, Alexis Davis and Sam McCall are attacked here by the Text Message Killer. On March 17, 2008, one of the warehouses on the docks, an abandoned cannery, exploded. Sonny met with Claudia Zacchara to return Johnny to her. She arrived, and got on the phone with an ally to try and peace with them and Sonny. Meanwhile, Trevor Lansing and sniper stood on a loft in the warehouse, poised to shoot Claudia. Ric Lansing and Marianna Erosa were in another part of it, trying to cover the dead body of Randy. Carly finally finds Michael, where he confesses to shooting Kate Howard. They began to leave and go home. Meanwhile, a bomb is slowly ticking away. Right as the sniper pulls his trigger, the bomb goes of, and an explosion rips through the building. Everyone survives the event, but Carly miscarries her baby. Soon after The Docks became the site of a fake prescription drug ring headed up by Jerry <b>Jacks.</b> The <b>ring</b> produced placebos that claimed at least one life; a female heart patient. Matt Hunter was the prime suspect, but the extent of his involvement cleared. Andrei Karpov had a cargo ship, Odyssey, docked in the harbor.|$|R
5000|$|While {{his father}} was under investigation, Kyle stole <b>Jack's</b> Harvard class <b>ring</b> {{that the police were}} looking for as evidence. He {{reasoned}} that he already had his mother taken away from him, and he wanted to keep his dad. Later, Victor showed Jack the custody papers that Diane made him sign, and Jack was infuriated at Victor and his deceased ex-wife for trying to take his son away from him. Jack vowed to fight to keep Kyle with his biological family. Kyle and Jack revealed to everyone that Kyle would be moving to New York to attend a hockey boarding school, and he left two weeks later. Kyle returns a grown adult for his new cousin's christening in April 2012. Upon seeing Nikki, the woman who killed Diane, and Jack together, he expresses his anger and distaste towards their relationship, claiming that they were bashing his mother's memory by being together. Afterward, Kyle went to Victor to ask if he could move in with him as Victor always said he was [...] "welcome," [...] and takes a job at Newman Enterprises. He then began dating Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap), and made friends with many pillars of the town.|$|R
50|$|On {{finding out}} his {{manuscript}} has been rejected again, Miles drinks heavily, {{and when the}} server cuts him off, he ends up drinking from the spit bucket, but Jack eases {{him out of the}} room in time. That night, with Stephanie gone, Jack hooks up with another waitress named Cammi, who recognized him from his acting career. Hours later, Jack shows up back at the motel room he shares with Miles - naked and confessing that Cammi's husband came home early while she and Jack were having sex. Jack explains he was forced to flee without his clothes and wallet (which contains a pair of irreplaceable wedding <b>rings).</b> <b>Jack</b> convinces Miles to drive him back to Cammi's house and sneak inside, where he discovers Cammi and her husband having sex. Miles spies Jack's wallet, grabs it and runs from the house, barely escaping Cammi's irate husband, who pursues him in the nude. To explain the broken nose and cover up the infidelity to his fiancée, Jack runs Miles' Saab 900 convertible into a tree, giving the appearance they had been in an accident. The pair return to the home of Jack's fiancée, where he is welcomed with open arms, and Miles drives away in his battered car.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping <b>jacks</b> in the <b>ring,</b> showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero dropped to his knees, feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, the unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|R
50|$|Days later, Jack {{would wake}} up in a {{hospital}} with no memory of who he was. Knowing his name was Jack (from the inscription on his wedding <b>ring),</b> <b>Jack</b> met a dark haired nurse named Julia Larrabee and was convinced she was his wife. Julia did nothing to contradict him, and the two bonded. However, {{when he made the}} assumption that her son, J.J., was theirs, Julia revealed that she'd only gone with his assumptions because his doctor asked her to. (The doctor thought it would help Jack) Soon after, Jack was released, but with nowhere to go. Feeling sorry for him, Julia let him stay with her and J.J and promised to help him find out who he was. Staying with Julia, Jack developed feelings for this woman and her son, who were the only family he knew since he regained consciousness. Although the search for Jack's identity led nowhere, he and Julia got a clue when a pair of hippies suddenly recognized him from pictures they'd seen carried by a crazy woman who hitched a ride with them one day. She had called Jack her husband. The crazy hitchhiker happened to be Jack's murderous ex-wife Julia. Suddenly Jack had a memory flash of Julia trying to kill him! That memory scared Jack and he decided that his former life was better off buried, and he focused on creating a new future for himself.|$|R
5000|$|Ring′s {{second trial}} began on October 18, 2010. Following the two-week trial, the jury couldn’t reach a verdict {{and sent a}} note to Judge Huvelle, asking her to explain the {{difference}} between legal and illegal gifts. After four days of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on five counts on November 15, 2010. Ring was found “guilty on one count of conspiring to corrupt congressional and executive branch officials by providing things of value to them and their staffs to induce or reward those who took official actions benefiting Ring and his clients. In addition, {{he was convicted of}} one count of paying a gratuity to a public official and three counts of honest-services wire fraud for engaging in a scheme to deprive U.S. citizens of their right to the honest services of certain public officials. The jury acquitted him on three counts of honest-services fraud”. According to testimony, “Ring sought to further his clients’ interests by lobbying public officials in the legislative and executive branches of the federal government,... identified public officials who would assist them and their clients, and then groomed them by providing things of value with the intent of making them more receptive to requests on behalf of their clients in the future. The things of value ... included all-expenses-paid travel, meals, drinks, golf outings, as well as tickets to professional sporting events, concerts and other events, and an employment opportunity for the wife of a congressman - which were often billed to <b>Ring’s</b> and <b>Jack</b> Abramoff’s clients... <b>Ring’s</b> corrupt actions resulted in his clients receiving, among other actions, $14 million in congressional transportation appropriations and an additional $7 million from the Justice Department to build a jail.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the {{negative}} reviews, film critic Liz Braun's {{headline in the}} Toronto Sun summarized the opinion of most Toronto critics, [...] "Jack Richards is Amateurish at Best." [...] Hannah Guy from Now (newspaper) wrote, [...] "Benjamin Paquette's debut feature ... is an awkward fledgling of a movie with mediocre production values," [...] but concluded that, [...] "veteran thesp Vrana delivers an authentic performance." [...] Especially dismissive were Chris Knight at the National Post, and Liam Lacey at the Globe and Mail. The former declared, “Film critics see movies ... with pages of press notes. ... But the press notes can, however, make all the difference. A Year in the Death of Jack Richards ... is a labyrinth of a film and I would have been lost without the notes. As it was, I was merely disoriented. ... The press notes refer to the film’s ability to ‘trouble and perplex,’ which I got right away; its ‘warmth and deep understanding,’ which I missed and its ‘electrifying’ nature, which I presume is {{a reference to the}} joybuzzer shock cuts, always accompanied by the same ’70s-era photo of a greasyhaired guy with a thick moustache ... The press notes say this ‘challenging film experience ... is sure to be most appreciated by those viewers who are engaged by film as film.” If that sounds like you, enjoy some popcorn as popcorn and settle back, prepared to be shocked out of your seat as a seat.” The latter stated, “... often more ambitious than accomplished. ... With everything up in the air, a viewer might be forgiven for finding this chain of ambiguities more pretentious than intriguing ... The plot's Twilight Zone-like entanglements might be more palatable if the film's execution were more adept. ... the acting ranges from mediocre to amateur. The character who hires Jack ... wears possibly the worst bald wig outside a joke store. In some close-ups, Vrana's untrimmed eyebrows threaten to engulf the screen. There's one particularly static scene in a hotel room where the camera operator seems to have crouched into the corner and fallen asleep. Perhaps he or she dreamed the whole thing.” A rare negative review outside of Toronto came from Melora Koepke at the Hour Community, who concluded, “While it's a good thing that there are film students to write papers about classic auteur films, it's a bit weird to watch a movie that feels more like the paper than the film. Which is how A Year in the Death of <b>Jack</b> Richards <b>rings</b> - more like an idea than an actual movie. ... If puzzles and ambivalence are your bag, then A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is a godsend. Paquette is clearly just as concerned with muddling the edges of reality, blurring tenses in his storylines and inserting numerous homages to his cinema idols (Ingmar Bergman and Roman Polanski, probably) as he is with riveting his audience. Of course, if you have a film studies paper due, you're in luck. For others, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is definitely a matter of taste.” ...|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Triple H and Cactus Jack in a Street Fight for the WWF Championship. Jack gained the early {{advantage}} after repeated punches, and they fought outside the ring, where Triple H hit <b>Jack</b> with the <b>ring</b> bell. Triple H then hit Jack with a chair, but Jack got up, and performed a leg drop with the chair. The fight {{continued into the}} audience, with Jack performing a suplex onto pallets, and using a trash can. Triple H performed a belly to back suplex, but Jack {{came back with a}} running knee lift into the steel steps. Jack attempted to use a barbed wire two-by-four, but Triple H performed a low blow, and used the weapon on Jack. Jack came back, hit Triple H's groin with the weapon, and performed a double arm DDT. Jack attacked Triple H's head repeatedly with the weapon. Jack attempted a back to belly piledriver through the announce table, but Triple H countered with a back body drop. Jack countered a Pedigree attempt and performed a bulldog onto the two-by-four. Triple H performed a hip toss into the steps, and targeted Jack's knees, using the two-by-four. Triple H then handcuffed Jack's wrists behind his back. As Triple H tried to use the steel steps, Jack performed a drop toe hold, sending Triple H's head into the steps. Triple H came back by using the chair. The Rock came out, and hit Triple H with a chair, as a police officer removed Jack's handcuffs. Jack performed a pulling Texas piledriver on the announce table, and spilled a bag of thumbtacks in the ring. Triple H came back with a back body drop onto the thumbtacks, and a Pedigree. Triple H finally performed a Pedigree onto the thumbtacks to win, and retain his title. After the match, Triple H was lifted onto a stretcher but Jack caught up to the emergency staff as they left the ringside area, pushed Triple H on the stretcher back to the ring, and hit Triple H with the two-by-four again.The main event was the Royal Rumble match. During the match, non-participants Kaientai (Funaki and Taka Michinoku) repeatedly and randomly entered the ring, and attacked the participants. They were thrown out soon after each time. Rikishi, the fifth entrant, dominated upon entering, and eliminated all except Grand Master Sexay. Scotty 2 Hotty entered next, and the three Too Cool members danced in the ring until Rikishi eliminated the other two, and continued to dance. Rikishi eliminated the first to eighth entrants. The Big Boss Man, the ninth entrant, refused to enter the ring until Test, the following entrant, threw him in. During Kaientai's second interference, Taka was injured when he was thrown out of the ring, and sent to the hospital. Funaki continued to interfere by himself. It took six men to eliminate Rikishi. After Faarooq, the eighteenth entrant, entered, non-participants Mean Street Posse came out, and attacked Faarooq, helping The Big Boss Man eliminate him. Bradshaw, entering twenty-seventh, was attacked by the Mean Street Posse, and eliminated soon after. Faarooq came out and, with Bradshaw, fought with the Mean Street Posse backstage.|$|R
