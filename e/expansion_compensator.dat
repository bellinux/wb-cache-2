40|$|NASA LeRC is {{currently}} developing a FORTRAN based computer {{model of a}} complete nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) vehicle {{that can be used}} for piloted and cargo missions to the Moon or Mars. Proposed designs feature either a Brayton or a K-Rankine power conversion cycle to drive a turbine coupled with rotary alternators. Both ion and magnetoplasmodynamic (MPD) thrusters will be considered in the model. In support of the NEP model, Rocketdyne is developing power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution (PMAD) subroutines. The subroutines will be incorporated into the NEP vehicle model which will be written by NASA LeRC. The purpose is to document the heat pipe cooled heat rejection subsystem model and its supporting subroutines. The heat pipe cooled heat rejection subsystem model is designed to provide estimate of the mass and performance of the equipment used to reject heat from Brayton and Rankine cycle power conversion systems. The subroutine models the ductwork and heat pipe cooled manifold for a gas cooled Brayton; the heat sink heat exchanger, liquid loop piping, <b>expansion</b> <b>compensator,</b> pump and manifold for a liquid loop cooled Brayton; and a shear flow condenser for a K-Rankine system. In each case, the final heat rejection is made by way of a heat pipe radiator. The radiator is sized to reject the amount of heat necessary...|$|E

From a financial point of view, this indicates that traders are not up to date and do not have full access to the accounting data. In our analysis, different levels of information are distinguished including full market, company’s management, and investors information. We apply filtration <b>expansion</b> theory and <b>compensator</b> techniques to obtain semi-explicit solutions for locally risk minimizing hedging strategies from investors perspective.

Lowering hydraulic losses in the Mutnovskoe field has been realized with the replacement of U-shaped <b>compensators</b> (<b>expansion</b> unit) on the bellows (a U-shaped compensator has a resistance coefficient eight times that of a bellows expansion joint), flattening of pipelines (to reduce the overall length of pipelines and exclude local resistance at turning of flow), dismantling non-functional valves, etc. Lowering the hydraulic losses in Pauzhetskoe field was also realized with the improvement of transportation conditions to the separator, change of separators type, and redistribution of the flow rate among the main steam pipelines.|$|R
40|$|In a {{commercial}} aircraft, ventilation {{to the cabin}} is normally through environmental control system normal bleed air system, ECS emergency back-up pressurization system and ram air. Bleed air is primarily used to provide pressurization by supplying air to the environmental control system. Additionally, bleed air is used for de-icing of aircraft leading edges. The bleed air needs to be tapped from engine and conveyed to the ECS pack through pipe routings. The bleed air pipes that tap the air from engine would experience a varying pressure load (as high as 140 psi) and varying temperature (as high as 340 °C) at different segments. This would obviously produce the expansion/ contraction of pipes which will result in axial moment and swaying of pipelines from their nominal configuration. These movements should be compensated by means of providing suitable <b>expansion</b> joints/thermal <b>compensators</b> to avoid undesirable loads at the support points which may affect the overall functioning of the system. The real challenge lies in designing such a complex system where suitable expansion joints need to be provided within stipulated airframe configuration satisfying the installation requirements, yet cost and weight effective. In the present work, a methodology has been developed for design of ECS pipe routings, using flexible hose- metallic bellows as a thermal compensator, {{with the aid of}} finite element analysis. This paper also talks about the qualification of the bellows through acceptance tests and implementation on a typical light transport aircraft...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{analytic}} properties of <b>compensator</b> and Dulac <b>expansions</b> {{in a single}} variable.

We first consider Dulac expansions when {{the power of the}} logarithm is either 0 or 1. Here we construct an explicit exponential scaling in the space of coefficients which in an exponentially narrow horn, up to rescaling and division, leads to a polynomial expansion. A similar result holds for the compensator case. This result is applied to the bifurcation theory of limit cycles in planar vector fields. The setting consists of families that unfold a given Hamiltonian in a dissipative way. This leading part is of Morse type, which leads to the following three cases. The first concerns a Hamiltonian function that is regular on an annulus, and the second a Hamiltonian function with a non-degenerate minimum defined on a disc. In the third case the Hamiltonian function has a non-degenerate saddle point with a saddle connection. The first case, by an appropriate scaling, recovers the generic theory of the saddle node of limit cycles and its cuspoid degeneracies, while the second case similarly recovers the generic theory of limit cycles subordinate to the codimension k Hopf bifurcations k = 1, 2,.... The third case enables a novel study of generic bifurcations of limit cycles subordinate to homoclinic bifurcations. We then describe how the above analytic result is applied to bifurcations of limit cycles. For appropriate one-dimensional Poincaré maps, the fixed points correspond to the limit cycles. The fixed point sets (or zero-sets of the associated displacement functions) are studied by contact equivalence singularity theory. The cases where the Hamiltonian is defined on an annulus or a disc can be reduced directly to catastrophe theory. In the third case, the displacement functions are known to have <b>compensator</b> <b>expansions,</b> whose first approximations are Dulac expansions. Application of our analytic result implies that, in an exponentially narrow horn near a homoclinic loop, the bifucation theory of limit cycles again reduces to catastrophe theory. ...|$|R
