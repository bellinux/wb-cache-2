Moreover, the trend of microelements and packed division multiplex is obviously for the electrical industry. Hence, the high heat dissipative and the electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>device</b> have been popular and necessary. The thermal conduct coefficient of aluminum nitride (i. e., AlN) is many {{times larger than the}} other materials. Moreover, the green technology of composite with phase change materials (i. e., PCMs) is worked as a constant temperature cooler. Therefore, PCMs have been used frequently for saving energy and the green environment. Based on the above statements, it does show great potential in heat dissipative for the AlN film compositing with PCM. Therefore, this paper is focused on the research of thermal contact resistance and heat transfer between the AlN/PCM pairs. According to the experimental results, the heat transfer decreases and the thermal contact resistance increases under the melting process of PCM. However, the suitable parameters such as contact pressures can be used to improve the above defects...|$|E

Moreover, the tendency of microelements and dense division multiplex is significantly for the electrical industries.

Therefore, this paper is focused on the studies of heat conduction and thermal contact resistance between the AlN flake and the copper specimens. The heating temperatures and the contact pressures were selected as the experimental parameters.

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court’s {{important}} {{ruling in}} Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. v. Bartlett concerns whether the Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) {{approval of a}} generic drug insulates the drug manufacturer from liability under state tort laws from claims of injury due to an alleged “design defect. ” The Court previously ruled that FDA approval does not preempt state law claims based upon failure-to-warn, at least with respect to brand name products. In contrast, the Court previously ruled that the federal regulatory process leading to FDA approval of generic equivalents of brand drugs—and designation of the drug label—does preempt state law as to claims that challenge the warnings that accompany generic drugs. In each of these cases, the underlying issue has been whether the federal regulatory process leading to FDA approval of drugs and medical devices “preempt” state laws as to the safety issues addressed through the approval process. Thus, to summarize the applicable law prior to Bartlett, the Court had upheld failure-to-warn claims against the brand (preemption denied) but denied failure-to-warn claims against the generic (preemption upheld); the Court has also denied device manufacturers’ liability for most product liability-related claims (preemption upheld) pursuant to a specific statutory provision. By a vote of 5 - 4, Bartlett has now denied liability of generic manufacturers {{on the basis of}} design-defect. Following the Supreme Court opinion, however, the FDA set forth its agenda, which includes proposing a rule that would allow generic drug makers to revise their drug labels. If created and adopted, this rule could again alter the landscape of liability for generic manufacturers. Further, the related issue (which is still unresolved by the high court and {{is the subject of a}} split among the circuit courts) is whether FDA approval of medical devices preempts all state law actions, thus <b>insulating</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers from product liability claims under all circumstances. This Article will address each of these issues, as well as the related issue of whether off-label use of FDA-approved medical devices give rise to liability...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} has been the design and {{demonstration}} of refractive devices, not only for acoustic waves, but also for flexural waves in thin plates. Mathematically these problems have been treated {{by means of the}} multiple scattering theory, because the geometries of the problems were mainly circular and such theory is the best one in these cases. The multiple scattering theory, previously stated, is here explained. Additionally, a multilayer scattering theory for flexural waves is here introduced and successfully used to numerically simulate their behavior. Therefore, this PhD thesis is divided in two parts. The first part is devoted to describe two acoustic refractive devices: a gradient index lens and an omnidirectional broadband acoustic absorber, or “acoustic black hole”. Both are based on sonic crystals consisting of of rigid cylinders immersed in a fluid background. As the homogenization method states, the desired refractive index can be obtained by tailoring the radii of the cylinders. Thereafter, numerical simulations and measurements were conducted to test the behavior of each device. For this purpose, two specific measuring systems were developed: the two-dimensional chamber and the impedance chamber. Both are here explained in detail. The second part describes the design of refractive devices for flexural waves. Instead of using “platonic crystals”, we made use of the peculiar dispersion relationship of flexural waves. As the equation states, the wave speed is modified not only by the elastic properties of the plate, but also from its thickness. Using the latest approach a set of numerical simulations of known circularly symmetrical gradient index lenses have been performed. Additionally, an omnidirectional broadband <b>insulating</b> <b>device</b> for flexural waves has been designed. It consist of a well-like thickness profile in an annular region of the plate, that mimics the combination of an attractive and repulsive potentials. The waves are focused at its bottom and dissipated by means of an absorptive layer placed on top. Numerical simulations are here presented and discussed. Finally, we present an in-plane flexural resonator, consisting of a hole in a thin plate traversed by a beam. Here, a closed form of the transfer matrix is obtained by coupling the Kirchhoff-Love and the Euler-Bernoulli motion equations.

40|$|Surface charge {{accumulation}} on insulators under high {{dc voltage}} {{is a major}} factor that may lead to the reduction of insulation levels in gas <b>insulated</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, disc insulators made of Al 2 O 3 -filled epoxy resin were surface fluorinated using a F 2 /N 2 mixture (12. 5 % F 2) at 50 [*]°C and 0. 1 MPa for different durations of 15 min, 30 min and 60 min. A dc voltage was applied to the insulator for 30 min and the charge density on its surface was measured by an electrostatic probe. The results revealed significant lower surface charge densities on the fluorinated insulators in comparison with the original one. Surface conductivity measurements indicated a higher surface conductivity by over three orders of magnitude after fluorination, which would allow the charges to transfer along the surface and thus may suppress their accumulation. Further, attenuated total reflection infrared analysis and surface morphology observations of the samples revealed that the introduction of fluoride groups altered the surface physicochemical properties. These structure changes, especially the physical defects reduced the depth of charge traps in the surface layer, which was verified by the measurement of energy distributions of the electron and hole traps based on the isothermal current theory. The results in this paper demonstrate that fluorination can be a promising and effective method to suppress surface charge accumulation on epoxy insulators in gas <b>insulated</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

However, a fundamental understanding and knowledge of the whole acoustical transmission system of the transformer is needed. Beside the mechanical disturbances on site, found in or at the transformer itself, such as 50 Hz components, magnetostriction or external loose parts, also the mechanics of the tank have to be considered in a modal analysis. The adaptation of the sensors and hardware on the various propagation paths in the insulating system, determining the signal damping, is the basis for sensitive capturing of PD signals. With the aid of sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms, like the newly developed “FFT 2 D”, a detection and more important a distinction between mechanical disturbances and PD`s can be reached easily.

Nonthermal plasmas generated at atmospheric pressure have recently found many applications such as surface cleaning and pollution control. One plasma generation configuration consists of two dielectrically insulated parallel plates with application of an AC voltage of several kV and several kHz. Such a plasma generating structure is very similar to many HV insulating systems and equipment and as such they share much similarity in the evolving plasma and associated plasma-structure interaction. In this contribution, we develop a one-dimensional numerical model to simulate discharge plasmas supported by such an insulated electrode structure and for simplicity we consider helium as the working gas. Assuming that the hydrodynamic approximation applies, various ionization, excitation and recombination processes are considered as sources of generation of charged particles and excited species. Boltzmann equations are then solved in conjunction with the Poisson equation. Numerical examples are then used to explore the conditions under which the induced plasma is nonthermal.

Terrestrial applications where components and systems must operate in low temperature environments include cryogenic instrumentation, superconducting magnetic energy storage, magnetic levitation transportation system, and arctic exploration. An on-going research and development program on low temperature electronics at the NASA Glenn Research Center focuses {{on the development of}} efficient power systems capable of surviving and exploiting the advantages of low temperature environments. Inhouse efforts include the design, fabrication, and characterization of low temperature power systems and the development of supporting technologies for low temperature operations, such as dielectric and <b>insulating</b> materials, semiconductor <b>devices,</b> passive power components, opto-electronic devices, as well as packaging and integration of the developed components into prototype flight hardware...|$|R
