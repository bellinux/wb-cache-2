5|$|A {{portion of}} all <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> is {{functionally}} neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or {{significant difference in}} fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> through population bottlenecks. which among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E

5|$|A population's <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> can {{be greatly}} reduced by a bottleneck, and even {{beneficial}} adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E

Their ranges overlap, {{but they have been}} shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> between populations is significant, even among nearby populations.

5|$|Viral {{recombination}} produces <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> {{that likely}} {{contributes to the}} evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> that results in fitness differences. <b>Genetic</b> <b>variation</b> is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVitamin E (VE) is {{the generic}} term for four {{tocopherols}} and four tocotrienols that exhibit the biological activity of α-tocopherol. VE status, {{which is usually}} estimated by measuring fasting blood VE concentration, is affected by numerous factors, such as dietary VE intake, VE absorption efficiency, and VE catabolism. Several of these factors are in turn modulated by <b>genetic</b> <b>variations</b> in genes encoding proteins involved in these factors. To identify these <b>genetic</b> <b>variations,</b> two strategies have been used: genome-wide association studies and candidate gene association studies. Each of these strategies has its advantages and its drawbacks, nevertheless they have allowed us to identify a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with fasting blood VE concentration and α-tocopherol bioavailability. However, much work {{remains to be done}} to identify, and to replicate in different populations, all the single nucleotide polymorphisms involved, to assess the possible involvement of other kind of <b>genetic</b> <b>variations,</b> e. g., copy number variants and epigenetic modifications, in order to establish a reliable list of <b>genetic</b> <b>variations</b> {{that will allow us to}} predict the VE status of an individual by knowing their genotype in these <b>genetic</b> <b>variations.</b> Yet, the potential usefulness of this area of research is exciting with regard to personalized nutrition and for future clinical trials dedicated to assessing the biological effects of the various isoforms of VE...|$|R

5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Genetic testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> than gene duplication.

Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of <b>genetic</b> <b>variation.</b> The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
