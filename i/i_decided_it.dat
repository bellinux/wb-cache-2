500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it [...] "really an emotional decision", she explained: [...] "He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> would be fun to take a great leap with him." ...|$|E
500|$|In a January 2015 {{story with}} The Herald, it was {{reported}} that Hamlett was retiring from football due to knee problems. Hamlett said that [...] "after the season <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was time to hang it up. I didn’t want to be in pain every day. I felt like {{it was time to move}} on and live a normal life." [...] He also said, [...] "I’m sure I’ll wish I was still out there playing." [...] In a story with The Florida Times-Union shortly after signing with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hamlett said, [...] "I just took some time off because I was banged up" [...] and that [...] "I love the game of football, and I wanted to play. The whole [...] kind of got blown out of proportion." [...] He had previously returned to training and began feeling 100 percent in early March. Due to his break, he did not participate in the 2015 NFL Combine or Oregon State's Pro Day.|$|E
500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was what I wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E

500|$|In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on Rawhide, Eric Fleming, {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to star in an Italian-made western called A Fistful of Dollars, to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for elevenweeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of {{the transition from a}} television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was time to be an anti-hero." [...] Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the [...] "mask" [...] he was attempting to create for the loner character.|$|E
2500|$|May 25, 2004: In an {{interview}} with The Hill newspaper, published the following day, Clarke said: [...] "I take responsibility for it. I don't {{think it was a}} mistake, and I'd do it again." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It didn't get any higher than me... On 911, 912 and 913, many things didn't get any higher than me. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> in consultation with the FBI." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Charlie's Angels series {{formally}} debuted on September 22, 1976. Each of {{the three}} actresses was propelled to stardom, but Fawcett dominated popularity polls and was soon proclaimed a phenomenon. She subsequently won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Performer in a New TV Program. In a 1977 interview with TV Guide, she said, [...] "When the show was number three, I thought it was our acting. When we got to be number one, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> could only be because none of us wears a bra." ...|$|E

5000|$|By October 1931, the Starr Faithfull {{case was}} {{reported}} to be [...] "virtually closed", although Roberts' statements about being with her on the Carmania were not obtained until the planned last days of the investigation in early December. Later in December, a final inquest was held into her death. It lasted only 15 minutes, and reached no conclusion. Nassau County Coroner Edward Neu was quoted as saying, [...] "Whatever <b>I</b> <b>decide,</b> <b>it</b> will only be a matter of opinion." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2008 Dream Theater {{started the}} Progressive Nation 2008 tour, along with Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, and 3. The tour is {{the brainchild of}} Mike Portnoy, who stated, [...] "I've been wanting to {{assemble}} a package tour like this for many years now. With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{became known}} as [...] "Jiggle TV" [...] and [...] "T TV" [...] (or [...] "Tits & Ass Television") by critics who {{believed}} that the show had no intelligence or substance. These characterizations stemmed {{from the fact that}} the lead actresses frequently dressed scantily or provocatively as part of their undercover characters (including roller derby girl, beauty pageant contestant, maid, female prisoner, or just bikini-clad), and the belief that their clothing was a means of attracting viewers. Farrah Fawcett once attributed the show's success to this fact: [...] "When the show was number three, I figured it was our acting. When it got to be number one, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> could only be because none of us wears a bra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{the first}} actor {{approached}} to play the main character. Originally, Sergio Leone intended Henry Fonda to play the [...] "Man with No Name." [...] However, the production company could not afford to employ a major Hollywood star. Next, Leone offered Charles Bronson the part. He, too, declined, arguing that the script was bad. Both Fonda and Bronson would later star in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Other actors who turned the role down were Henry Silva, Rory Calhoun, Tony Russel, Steve Reeves, Ty Hardin, and James Coburn. Leone then turned his attention to Richard Harrison, an expatriate American actor who had recently starred in the very first Italian western, Duello nel Texas. Harrison, however, had not been impressed with his experience on that previous film and refused. The producers later presented a list of available, lesser-known American actors and asked Harrison for advice. Harrison suggested Eastwood, who he knew could play a cowboy convincingly. Harrison later stated, [...] "Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing A Fistful of Dollars and recommending Clint for the part." [...] Eastwood later spoke about transitioning from a television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide, I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat ... the hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was time to be an anti-hero." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a May 2007 interview, Miller relayed that he {{was still}} at work on the graphic novel, which he said was [...] "bound to offend just about everybody". Miller also said he was about 100 pages into it with 50 remaining. The {{following}} year Miller said the series, until then being billed as Holy War, Batman, would no longer feature Batman. [...] "As I worked on it, it became something that was no longer Batman," [...] he clarified. [...] "It's somewhere past that and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it's</b> {{going to be part of}} a new series that I'm starting." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Pike, {{his dark}} sack coat (put {{on for the}} meal) bulging and {{wrinkling}} over the lumps of muscles that padded his stooped shoulders, had {{nothing at all to}} say. But he had eaten too many years at captains' tables not to have proper table manners. At first I thought he was abashed by Miss West's presence. Later, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was due to the presence of the captain. For Captain West had a way with him that I was beginning to learn. Far removed as Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire were from the sailors, individuals as they were of an entirely different and superior breed, yet equally as different and far removed from his officers was Captain West. He was a serene and absolute aristocrat. He neither talked [...] "ship" [...] nor anything else to Mr. Pike.|$|E
60|$|I am supposing {{still that}} I saw Salem before I saw Boston, but however the fact may be, I {{am sure that}} <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> {{would be better to}} see shoemaking in Lynn, where I really did see it, thirty years later. For the {{purposes}} of the present visit, I contented myself with looking at a machine in Haverhill, which chewed a shoe sole full of pegs, and dropped it out of its iron jaws with an indifference as great as my own, and probably as little sense of how it had done its work. I may be unjust to that machine; Heaven knows I would not wrong it; and I must confess that my head had no room in it for the conception of any machinery but the mythological, which also I despised, in my revulsion from the eighteenth- century poets to those of my own day.|$|E

60|$|The {{fire was}} burning redly in the hall, though the lamps were out, when I ensconced {{myself in a}} deep chair behind a deerhide screen quaintly {{embroidered}} by Indian women. The cigar was a good one, and I had much to think about; {{so it was not}} until a shaft of light streamed athwart the screen that, looking round it, I noticed that Lucille Haldane, carrying a candle, had entered the long room. She set it down on a table, and stood still, glancing about her, while I effaced myself behind the screen. The girl had cast her hair loose, and it rippled in glossy masses from her shoulders to the delicate inward curve of her waist, setting forth the lithe shapeliness of her figure. Concluding that she would withdraw as soon as she was satisfied that all was safe, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> would be better if she remained unaware of my presence, and hoped that Cotton would delay his coming. To judge by the soft footsteps, she was returning, when a sudden coldness chilled the room. The light grew uncertain, as though the candle flickered in a draught, and a door I had not previously noticed opened noiselessly.|$|E
60|$|No; I can't harness up one horse. But I can four, which compels me to back {{up again}} {{to get to my}} beginning. Having {{selected}} Sonoma Valley for our abiding place, Charmian and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was about time we knew what we had in our own county and the neighbouring ones. How to do it, was the first question. Among our many weaknesses is the one of being old- fashioned. We don't mix with gasolene very well. And, as true sailors should, we naturally gravitate toward horses. Being one of those lucky individuals who carries his office under his hat, I should have to take a typewriter and a load of books along. This put saddle-horses out of the running. Charmian suggested driving a span. She had faith in me; besides, she could drive a span herself. But when I thought of the many mountains to cross, and of crossing them for three months with a poor tired span, I vetoed the proposition and said we'd have to come back to gasolene after all. This she vetoed just as emphatically, and a deadlock obtained until I received inspiration.|$|E
