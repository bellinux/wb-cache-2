5|$|Heydrich {{opened the}} conference with {{an account of}} the anti-Jewish {{measures}} taken in Germany since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. He said that between 1933 and October 1941, 537,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews had emigrated.

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the <b>information</b> <b>was</b> insufficient to identify it as such.

Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E

5|$|Information {{about the}} Bruneval radar {{installation}} was also gathered during this period, {{often with the}} help of the French Resistance, without whom detailed knowledge of the disposition of the German forces guarding the installation would have been impossible.

5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} cultivation of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961.

On its way back to India, while the ship docked in Singapore, the governor-general of Singapore remarked that “though the ship had no communication with the land, yet it left a bad effect” on the Indian troops stationed there. Clearly, <b>information</b> <b>was</b> reaching the sepoys through {{a wide range of}} channels many originating as far as North America, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and India.

5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking <b>information</b> <b>was</b> accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{general theory}} of <b>information</b> <b>is</b> a {{synthetic}} approach, which organizes and encompasses all main directions in <b>information</b> theory. It <b>is</b> developed on three levels: conceptual, methodological and theoretical. On the conceptual level, the concept of <b>information</b> <b>is</b> purified and <b>information</b> operations <b>are</b> separated and described. On the methodological level, it is formulated as system of principles, explaining what <b>information</b> <b>is</b> and how to measure information. On the theoretical level, mathematical models of <b>information</b> <b>are</b> constructed and studied. The goal {{of this paper is}} to clarify the concept of information and discuss its mathematical models, establishing relations with physics as the most developed science...|$|R

Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by Croatian security and intelligence system services, indicating the Soviet Union and its then-president Mikhail Gorbachev as the source of the information. At midnight during the night of the 67 October, the Soviet ambassador to Belgrade was reported to have received government instructions to warn the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb.|$|E
