In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, [...] "We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about the mural. To the best of my knowledge, New Seasons will make it right." [...] She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting the mural on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping the original mural in place and making it visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store's interior.|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{caused an}} uproar in the {{community}} it portrayed; it {{was taken off the}} shelves of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore — New York's only gay bookstore - and Kramer was banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store near his home on Fire Island. Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer says, [...] "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back when I walked by. You know what my real crime was? I put the truth in writing. That's what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met." [...] Faggots, however, became one of the best-selling gay novels of all time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126174240/http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=25 |archivedate=November 26, 2006 }} ...|$|E

2500|$|In more mixed reviews, The A.V. Club critic Steven Hyden {{wrote that}} while Era Extraña sounds [...] "fuller" [...] than Psychic Chasms and [...] "still {{has plenty of}} hooks to offer", Palomo [...] "has to take both feet {{out of the bedroom}} to move his music forward". He also {{compared}} it to another chillwave album that was released a few months before, Washed Out's Within And Without, saying that [...] "Where Within is an immaculately conceived graduation from [...] Greene's early lo-fi work, Extraña is a minor refinement that still feels chintzy in places". Beck and Robertson also discussed Washed Out, as well as Toro y Moi, dubbing the album an unfunny parody of chillwave and also criticized it as [...] "such a strong homage to everything that's cool about retro-chic that you can't help but smell a rat". At PopMatters, Wisnicki wrote that Era Extraña did not have the same quality tunes and aesthetic that Psychic Chasms had, declaring that while each song on Psychic Chasms [...] "felt like getting to open another piece of candy", Era Extraña [...] "feels more like opening one of those refrigerated boxed sandwiches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store".|$|E

60|$|There was a portentous {{quietness}} in {{the little}} wooden town which did not exactly please Mr. Faraday Slocum, the somewhat discredited local agent of Grant Devine, as he ascended the steep street <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store. The pines closed in upon it, but their sombre spires were growing dim, and the white mists clung about them, for dusk was creeping up the valley. The latter fact brought Slocum a sense of satisfaction, {{and at the same}} time a growing uneasiness. He had, as it happened, signally failed to collect a certain sum from the store-keeper, who had expressed his opinion of him and his doings with vitriolic candor, and it was partly as the result of this that very little escaped his notice as he proceeded with an ostentatious leisureliness towards his dwelling.|$|E
60|$|There are innumerable other {{portrait}} {{figures and}} busts {{in which the}} civic and social hour is expressed. The women's hair is dressed in this fashionable way or that; the men's beards are cut in conformity to the fashion or the personal preference in side whiskers or mustache or imperial or goatee; and their bronze or marble faces convey the contemporary character of aristocrat or bourgeois or politician or professional. I do not know just what the reader would expect me to say in defence of the full-length figure of a lady in decollete and trained evening dress, who enters from the tomb toward the spectator {{as if she were}} coming into a drawing-room after dinner. She is very beautiful, but she is no longer very young, and the bare arms, which hang gracefully at her side, respond to an intimation of embonpoint in the figure, with a slightly flabby over-largeness where they lose themselves in the ample shoulders. Whether this figure is the fancy of the sorrowing husband or the caprice of the defunct herself, who wished to be shown to after-time as she hoped she looked in the past, I do not know; but I had the same difficulty with it as I had with that father and son; it was romanticistic. Wholly realistic and rightly actual was that figure of an old woman who is said to have put by all her savings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> business that she might appear properly in the Campo Santo, and who is shown there short and stout and common, in her ill-fitting best dress, but motherly and kind and of an undeniable and touching dignity.|$|E

6000|$|The {{barrier that}} divided the little post-and-telegraph-office <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> was a frail {{structure}} {{of wood and}} wire; but the social, the professional separation was a gulf that fortune, by a stroke quite remarkable, had spared her the necessity of contributing at all publicly to bridge. When Mr. Cocker's young men stepped over from behind the other counter to change a five-pound note--and Mr. Cocker's situation, with {{the cream of the}} [...] "Court Guide" [...] and the dearest furnished apartments, Simpkin's, Ladle's, Thrupp's, just round the corner, was so select that his place was quite pervaded by the crisp rustle of these emblems--she pushed out the sovereigns as if the applicant were no more to her than one of the momentary, the practically featureless, appearances in the great procession; and this perhaps all the more from the very fact of the connexion (only recognised outside indeed) to which she had lent herself with ridiculous inconsequence. She recognised the others the less because she had at last so unreservedly, so irredeemably, recognised Mr. Mudge. However that might be, she was a little ashamed of having to admit to herself that Mr. Mudge's removal to a higher sphere--to a more commanding position, that is, though to a much lower neighbourhood--would have been described still better as a luxury than as the mere simplification, the corrected awkwardness, that she contented herself with calling it. He had at any rate ceased to be all day long in her eyes, and this left something a little fresh for them to rest on of a Sunday. During the three months of his happy survival at Cocker's after her consent to their engagement she had often asked herself what it was marriage would be able to add to a familiarity that seemed already to have scraped the platter so clean. Opposite there, behind the counter of which his superior stature, his whiter apron, his more clustering curls and more present, too present, h's had been {{for a couple of years}} the principal ornament, he had moved to and fro before her as on the small sanded floor of their contracted future. She was conscious now of the improvement of not having to take her present and her future at once. They were about as much as she could manage when taken separate.|$|E
