40|$|Supervisor: Professor Francesco Francioni, European University Institute. Award date: 26 November 2012 In its {{judgment}} of February 3, 2012, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{determined that the}} <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> State <b>immunity</b> by the Italian national courts was contrary to international law. The Court decided this matter on several grounds. The two main reasons for this finding were that: 1) Jus cogens norms do not impact on the procedural character of State immunity; and 2) the territorial tort exception, prescribed in the United Nations Convention <b>of</b> State <b>Immunity</b> and its property, is inapplicable {{in the context of}} an armed conflict. Additionally, the ICJ also determined that the ‘last resort’ argument presented by the Italian counsel did not justify the <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> Germany. This contribution looks at the extent to which the ICJ analyzed these arguments. It will consider what happens when a State repeatedly refuses to provide due reparation to individuals, either by failing to establish diplomatic negotiations, or by refusing to offer a legal and effective domestic remedy through its national courts. In this situation, this work asks whether the forum State, through the right of access to justice and the requirement of alternative means of redress, can exercise ‘subsidiary’ jurisdiction and provide a remedy for the victim of an armed conflict...|$|R

40|$|Aims {{and method}} A group of lawyers, psychiatrists, best {{interest}} assessors and independent mental capacity advocates {{were asked to}} make binary judgements about whether real-life situations in 12 vignettes amounted to <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty. Kappa coefficients were calculated to describe the level of agreement within each professional group and for the total group of professionals. Results There was total agreement between all professionals about <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty in only 1 of the 12 cases. The overall level of agreement for judgements made by all professionals was ‘slight’ (κ= 0. 16, P< 0. 01). Clinical implications There are practical difficulties involved in making reliable <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty judgements within the <b>Deprivation</b> <b>of</b> Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) legislation. A clear interpretation <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty is necessary to facilitate professionals’ decision-making in this area...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study <b>of</b> prison <b>deprivations</b> suffered by women, conducted at the Female Department of Correctional Facility in Požarevac within the scope of a wider study of women's prison system. It was supposed that female prisoners in this penal institution face similar prison experience and suffer the same or similar deprivations as women in other penal institutions do. The research sample included female prisoners sentenced to more than one year, staying in prison {{for more than a year}} (54 female prisoners, i. e. more than 50 % prisoners sentenced to long prison terms). Prisoners were interviewed employing a questionnaire measuring different types <b>of</b> <b>deprivations</b> using 26 indicators. Using the method of factor analysis - which was here used for the first time to study prison deprivations - six factors <b>of</b> women's prison <b>deprivations</b> were extracted: <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> maternity; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> autonomy; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> individuality; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> human kindness and empathy; <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> a key role - a woman's role, and <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> friendship relations. The outcomes of this research, together with the findings of other researchers, affirm the assumption that these types <b>of</b> <b>deprivations</b> are realistic and dominant types <b>of</b> women's prison <b>deprivations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{proportionality}} principle and the <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty of a foreigner in administrative law This thesis concerns the proportionality <b>of</b> the <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty of the foreigner in Czech Republic. It only covers those types <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty that are specifically applied on foreigners {{and that are}} covered by the administrative law. In the first chapter this thesis defines legal concepts of a personal freedom and a {{proportionality principle}}. The second chapter covers {{the level of the}} international law, namely the article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights, define legal conditions that a <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty must meet and offers a relevant judicature of the European Court of Human Rights. The third chapter covers a <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty from a view of the Return Directive (No. 2008 / 115 /EC), the Reception Conditions Directive (No. 2013 / 33 /EU) and the Dublin Regulation (No. 604 / 2013) and offers judicature of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The fourth chapter comprehends the Czech law and covers three acts, that enable a <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty of a foreigner - the Act on the Police of the Czech Republic No. 273 / 2008 Coll., the Asylum Act No. 325 / 1999 Coll. and the on the Residence of the Foreign Nationals in the Czech Republic No. 326 / 1999 Coll.

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{and understanding of}} living standards are overarching goals of the living standards surveys. Much of {{the focus is on}} poverty or <b>deprivation,</b> the lack <b>of</b> adequate living standards. Standard economic measure <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> are concerned with the lack of goods, or the lack of resources—income, expenditure, or assets—with which to obtain goods. But it is always {{important to keep in mind}} that many of the most important aspects <b>of</b> <b>deprivation</b> go beyond purely material <b>deprivation.</b> <b>Deprivation</b> <b>of</b> health, <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> education, <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> freedom from crime, and <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> political liberty are all important—and often more important than <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> material living standards. The role of development in freeing people from deprivation in a wide sense has been forcefully argued by Amartya Sen, see Sen (1999) for a recent and comprehensive account. Data from the living standards surveys frequently help us take a broad view of poverty, particularly data from the modules on health and education. Other important aspects of broadly construed living standards, such as lifeexpectancy, infant mortality, or the threat of crime, must be constructed in other ways. Nevertheless, measuring the material basis of living standards will always play an important role in the assessment of levels of living, and how to collect data for a consumption-based measure is the topic of this chapter. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the Cheshire West judgement, yearly {{applications}} for the Mental Health Act (MHA) and <b>Deprivation</b> <b>of</b> Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) have increased, though many patients are still admitted informally. To ensure lawfulness, informal admissions must be capacitous, informed, and without coercion. If fully capacitous consent is not obtained, {{then there is a}} risk of “de facto” detention and <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty. <b>Deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty is only lawful through appropriate legal frameworks (DoLS for incapacitous, non-objecting hospital inpatients, or MHA otherwise). Use of such legal frameworks might be hampered by the perceived stigma associated with them, though this may not be {{in the best interests of}} the patient. We aimed to examine the assessment of capacity and provision of adequate information required for an informed voluntary psychiatric admission, and any evidence of possible coercion into informal admission. We postulate variable use of legal frameworks designed to empower patients and prevent illegal <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> liberty...|$|R
