As of 2010, CSX has stopped making regular movements over the line, with trains being shifted to the nearby Louisville and Indiana Railroad via a trackage rights agreement.|$|E
500|$|After {{the arrest}} in Toronto, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a file on Hendrix, which grew to seven pages, {{including}} {{documents related to}} his previous arrests for stealing cars {{at the age of}} 19. Yorke and Fong-Torres wrote, [...] "The populace of Toronto are a very conservative lot, and tend to look with suspicion upon anybody who looks and dresses a little different from themselves. Hendrix looks a lot different." [...] Lawrence commented: [...] "The prevailing political attitude in Canada regarding Hendrix was 'We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> example of this fuzzy-haired black weirdo'." [...] Shapiro and Glebbeek asserted their suspicion regarding the presence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who did not typically make arrests at the airport. They also speculated that Canadian authorities had anticipated a public spectacle, intentionally searching the Hendrix entourage in plain view of people at the airport.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{candidates}} {{met with}} Interim President Rogombé in Libreville on 12 August to discuss {{issues related to}} the electoral process; Prime Minister Biyoghé Mba was also present at the meeting. At the meeting, candidates complained about problems in the electoral process, including the possibility that the electoral lists were unreliable. 11 candidates announced after the meeting that they wanted the elections to be delayed and would take the matter to the courts; according to one of the candidates, Bourdes-Ogouliguende, [...] "in the current climate, the irregularities and disparities are too flagrant." [...] Biyoghé Mba said that a delay was not necessary and that the electoral lists were being properly scrutinized; according to Biyoghé Mba, 120,000 duplicate names had been detected on the electoral lists by that point. Also on 12 August, Biyoghé Mba reiterated that no law required Bongo to resign from the government and that if Bongo decided his ministerial position was incompatible with his candidacy, then he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> individual decision to resign.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E
