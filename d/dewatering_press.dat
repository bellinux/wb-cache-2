50|$|An {{example of}} a <b>dewatering</b> <b>press</b> is a wine press. Dating back to Roman times, these {{machines}} worked similarly to the modern screw press but possessed some disadvantages which have been corrected and improved within modern presses. The ancient wine press only allowed for grapes to be juiced in batches and often a thick cake would form against the screen, {{making it difficult for}} the juice to flow through the screen and be collected for wine. Most modern screw presses allow for a continuous flow of material by surrounding the screw with a screen, which also helps to avoid the build up of a layer of solid material on the screen. One modern approach even removes the screen in favor of a system of fixed and moving rings, which often eliminates solids buildup entirely.|$|E

This information was gathered using structured questionnaires, which was designed and administered between March 2003 -May 2003. A total of 212 machines were observed, grating, 79 (37. 6 %) <b>dewatering</b> <b>press,</b> 61 (28. 8 %), chipping, 8 (3. 8 %), sifter 7 (3. 3 %), fryer, 1 (0. 5 %), milling, 51 (24. 1 %). Diesel engine (80. 4 %) was the most prominent prime mover. Greater numbers of processing centres were owned by individual. The relationship between the processors and the machines manufacturers was poor. More than 40 % of the machines observed had been abandoned and these could be attributed to adulterated spare parts, operation cost, inexperience machine repairers, untrained machine operators and quality of the construction materials. The sex of the machine operators was dependent on the type of prime mover. Diesel engines were operated majority by males while petrol engines were mostly operated by females. The detailed analyses of the observed cassava processing machines were discussed and recommendations were made based on the finds of this study.

40|$|Dewatering of pulp in a {{paper machine}} is a well {{established}} process. Nevertheless, {{it is far from}} being fully understood. One of the major steps in this process is the mechanical <b>dewatering</b> within the <b>press</b> section. It is achieved by applying large mechanical loads on the wet paper web {{while at the same time}} providing an escape route for the excess water. The quality of this process is influenced by many parameters. Besides the press nip parameters like pressure, roll diameters and press type (roll or shoe press), also other factors contribute to the mechanical dewatering performance. Among these factors the press felts, that transport the paper web through the press nip, are a major influence.

5000|$|A <b>Dewatering</b> screw <b>press</b> is a {{screw press}} that {{separates}} liquids from solids. A screw press {{can be used}} in place of a belt press, centrifuge, or filter paper. It is a simple, slow moving device that accomplishes dewatering by continuous gravitational drainage. Screw presses are often used for materials that are difficult to press, for example those that tend to pack together. The screw press squeezes the material against a screen or filter and the liquid is collected through the screen for collection and use.|$|R
50|$|Temperature {{of steam}} is about 160-220C. Uniform {{moisture}} from the water vapor of steam treatment, promotes uniform temperature of the feedstock. To promote even temperature distribution throughout the vessel, the total solids content of the feedstock is maintained from about 30-70 wt % by direct steam injection as higher moisture feedstocks hinders steam penetration and heat transfer throughout the feedstock. If necessary, feedstock may be dewatered by removing excess acidic liquid medium using a mechanical solid/liquid separation device such as a <b>dewatering</b> screw <b>press.</b>|$|R

Further, lab-scale experiments with a heated bark pressing process have been performed to investigate to what extent parameters such as temperature and pressure will influence the <b>dewatering</b> process. <b>Pressing</b> with a heated press at 150 °C was shown to increase the dewatering by over 20 % and more efficient dewatering is expected if the bark is more evenly heated before the press. In the drying area rotary and superheated steam dryers are replaced with bed dryers mainly {{due to the fact that}} the drying air can be heated with low-grade energy sources and that the maintenance costs are lower.

50|$|Some {{grades of}} paper use suction pick up rolls that use vacuum to {{transfer}} the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections. Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have {{a large number of}} drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed centrifugal force flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for <b>dewatering.</b> Pickup <b>presses</b> also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.|$|R

The sludge sample is mixed with a defined quantity of the additive and subjected to compression. The efficacy is judged based on {{one or more of}} the filtrate properties and one or more properties of the resulting filter cake. During the compression test process, the filtrate is pressed against the direction of flow in the test sedimentation unit. The press consists of a housing (2) resting on a base plate (1) and having a removable cap (9) incorporating a fluid outlet (10) which rests on a removable filter plate (12) and filter (13). The housing contains a piston (3) which rises vertically. The press can be linked to an appropriate computer-control and data logger unit. USE - Process and test assembly to determine the efficacy of sludge de- wa tering agents especially organic poly electrolytes, alone or in combination with other organic or inorganic substances.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve <b>press</b> <b>dewatering</b> and paper properties of kraft pulps by controlling hornification and internal fibrillation. Hornification was induced by drying and by pressing pulps, and internal fibrillation was developed in refining. Hornification and internal fibrillation {{are related to the}} change in fibre pore structure. In this thesis, a thermoporosimetry technique with cyclohexane as an absorbate was tested and found suitable for detecting the change in pore size and pore volume during drying and refining. The results show that for never-dried fibres, refining mainly expands the large pores in the cell wall, whereas it has only a slight effect on the small pores. Drying closes most of the large pores and a substantial amount of the small pores. For dried fibres, refining not only expands the large pores but also reopens the small pores to a certain extent. Even though the pore volume of previously dried pulps can be recovered by refining (i. e., the pulp can be reswollen), some small pores, which are closed in drying, ar...|$|R
40|$|In a {{mechanical}} pulping process, (TMP) wood is refined to pulp {{in a process}} with very high wood utilization. However, the power demand in the process is high. Thus efficient energy recovery, especially steam recov-ery, is very important. In high consistency (HC) refining the pulp wood is refined at high temperature (140 °C) and pressure. The high temperature {{makes it possible to}} recover process heat with usable steam properties. One strategy to decrease the power consumption is to split the refining into two stages, one HC-stage and one low consistency (LC) refining stage. This kind of sys-tem is quite common today. One drawback with LC-refining is that it operates at a low temperature normally below 100 °C. Hence, the steam recovery potential from conventional LC-refining is limited. In this project, we analyse three concepts of steam re-covery in LC-refining by increasing the temperature in the LC-stage. Two base cases: Conventional HC refin-ing only and conventional HC/LC refining is compared with three steam recovery cases: Pulp/Pulp heat ex-changing, Screw <b>Press</b> <b>Dewatering</b> combined with proc-ess water re-circulation and finally Pulp/Water Heat Exchanging. The study shows {{that it is possible to}} recover steam from the LC-stage and, hence, increase the energy effi-ciency of a combined HC/LC refining system. The screw press case has the highest steam recovery poten-tial of the HC/LC configurations. An initial economic estimate indicates that steam recovery in LC-refining is profitable compared to a conventional HC/LC-configuration...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the project}} done in {{co-operation}} of Battelle and the Institute of 'Mechanische Verfahrenstechnik und Mechanik' (MVM) of the University of Karlsruhe (TH) has been to enhance dewatering by applying additional electrical and acoustical fields. First of all, potential fields of application {{as well as the}} state-of-the-art of dewatering apparatus have been compiled as a basis. For different kinds of material characteristic parameters and data have been evaluated using an optimised laboratory device. This device can be utilised to measure the effects obtained by applying both electrical and acoustical fields during a filtration. As concerns the technical integration of the technology into the dewatering process the potential of modifying already existing aggregates has been examined. In order to find out problems during technical realisation of that procedure, tests have been performed using parts of the equipment and different kinds of material, so that in the end engineering parameters and constructive measures could already be included into the design. After several iterations of design and tests, finally, three different devices have been constructed or modified and tested to elaborate economical and technical data for relevant products. These data have been used to derive the effectiveness of the process and special characteristics of the so treated products. Furthermore, by comparing to data of conventional procedures as assessment can be performed about economical advantages, savings of energy, and reduction of CO_ 2 -emission. Laboratory test results have been verified successfully in the technical scale using a chamber filter press with integrated electrodes. The function and effectiveness of this device has been tested in an urban sewage sludge treatment plant. During the tests the arrangement of electrodes has been modified. The results show that a main parameter for the dewatering procedure is the concentration and kind of polymer flocculent and the resulting structure of the flocs. Furthermore, a belt filter press has been constructed {{that can be used for}} electrokinetic <b>dewatering.</b> This <b>press</b> has been used for continuous operation, with as well as without, applying the electrical field to derive the effectiveness from the differences. The third test device was a bag filter press that has been supplied with electrodes. The results show that the effectiveness of a chamber filter press as well as of a belt filter press can be enhanced by supplying additional fields. (orig.)

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is an energy intensive process often requiring {{the use of}} advanced treatment technologies. Stricter effluent standards have resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with advanced treatment over time. Accordingly, associated energy consumption has also increased. Concerns about lowering operating costs for WWTPs and reducing associated greenhouse gas generation present an incentive to investigate energy use in WWTPs. This research investigated the impact of wastewater strength and the introduction of advanced treatment technologies, to replace traditional technologies on energy use to treat wastewater in WWTPs. Major unit processes were designed for a 100 MGD plant and variables controlling energy were identified and used to compute energy consumption. Except for primary clarification and plate and frame <b>press</b> <b>dewatering,</b> energy consumption computed using fundamental equations are within values in the literature. Results show that energy consumption for dissolved air flotation thickeners, centrifuges, gravity thickeners, and aeration basins are heavily influence by wastewater strength. Secondary treatment and tertiary treatment require a significant amount of energy. Secondary treatment requires 104 times the energy of preliminary treatment, 17 times the energy of solids processing, and 2. 5 times the energy of tertiary treatment. Secondary treatment requires 41 times the energy of preliminary treatment, and 7 times the energy of solids processing. The results of this research provide a means of estimating energy consumption in the design and operation phase of a WWTP. By using the fundamental equations and methodology presented, alternative technologies can be compared or targeted for future energy savings implementation. Limitations of the methodology include design assumptions having to be made carefully, as well as assumptions of motor and equipment efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve <b>press</b> <b>dewatering</b> and paper properties of kraft pulps by controlling hornification and internal fibrillation. Hornification was induced by drying and by pressing pulps, and internal fibrillation was developed in refining. Hornification and internal fibrillation {{are related to the}} change in fibre pore structure. In this thesis, a thermoporosimetry technique with cyclohexane as an absorbate was tested and found suitable for detecting the change in pore size and pore volume during drying and refining. The results show that for never-dried fibres, refining mainly expands the large pores in the cell wall, whereas it has only a slight effect on the small pores. Drying closes most of the large pores and a substantial amount of the small pores. For dried fibres, refining not only expands the large pores but also reopens the small pores to a certain extent. Even though the pore volume of previously dried pulps can be recovered by refining (i. e., the pulp can be reswollen), some small pores, which are closed in drying, are not reopened by normal levels of refining. In other words, refining does not completely reverse hornification. Drying of pulps greatly reduces pulp swelling, enhancing dewatering but impairing tensile strength. Dried pulps offer a far better combination of dewatering and tensile strength than never-dried pulps. One possible reason is that some small hard-to-dewater pores in the fibre wall are irreversibly closed by drying, which enables better dewatering. However, pulp drying is energy-consuming. Pressing pulps may provide an economical way to improve dewatering, while maintaining paper strength properties. Pressing hornifies pulps, which promotes dewatering but impairs tensile strength to a certain extent. On the other hand, pressing causes fibres to flatten, with the flattened fibres providing more surface contact for bonding, thus increasing density and tensile strength. Never-dried pulps which were pressed before refining were found to give both improved dewatering and better tensile strength. The refining results support the earlier view that internal fibrillation is largely produced by a cyclic compressive action. It is suggested that fibres need to be turned over in refining and compressed from different directions in order to disrupt their internal structure and cause internal fibrillation. Compression also facilitates fibre straightening, but does not promote external fibrillation and fines generation. At the same swelling level, more straightened pulps give higher tensile strength, and pulps with less fines and external fibrillation enable better dewatering. Hence, to achieve an optimum combination of dewatering and tensile strength, chemical pulp refining should aim at increasing internal fibrillation, straightening fibres, and keeping the amount of fines and external fibrils at a low level. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} furnish in {{newsprint}} production is {{dictated by the}} raw material costs, production cost and the final quality demanded by printers. In addition to the raw material costs, energy cost {{is a major factor}} in papermaking economy. Modern newsprint machines have combinations of roll and shoe presses to increase web dryness to approximately 50 % after wet pressing and thus keeping drying cost as low as possible. Thermomechanical pulp and deinked pulp are commonly used for producing newsprint nowadays. The increasing use of deinked pulp and filler in newsprint production has improved <b>press</b> <b>dewatering.</b> However, {{there is a lack of}} published research on the effects of the nip types, furnish and filler distribution in the web on sheet dewatering and sheet structure after wet pressing. The dynamic wet pressing simulator at NTNU-PFI was used for the pressing experiments. A single sided dewatering setting was used. The wet pressed samples were freeze dried in liquid nitrogen after pressing. The cross-sections of the freeze dried samples were imaged in a SEM and the cross-sectional structures were quantified. The cross-section images were split into top, middle and felt or dewatering side layers based on equal solids per layer per line length. The Euclidean distance maps generated by ImageJ software were used to quantify the distribution of fines, pores size, porosity and thickness of the sample. To understand the filler, fibre and MFC interactions, images for surface characterization were acquired using FE-SEM. 3 D images for DIP and TMP samples pressed with shoe pulse were acquired using x-ray micro-(computed) tomography (X-μCT) for visual assessment of the densification across the sheet’s thickness. In addition, the surface roughness was quantified. As expected, deinked pulp (DIP) dewaters more easily than thermomechanical pulp (TMP) when pressed with a roll pulse. The in-plane moisture flow (crushing) in DIP samples started at higher peak pressure and higher solids content compared to the TMP samples. The TMP samples showed higher springback after wet pressing compared to DIP samples. When both TMP and DIP samples were designed to have a higher amount of small pores at the dewatering side’s surface layers, the samples with the coarser TMP pulp could achieve similar dryness as DIP samples when pressed with higher nip pressure. In addition, the DIP samples with the higher number of small pores at the dewatering layer also yielded lower dryness after pressing with roll pulse. The effect of filler (ground calcium carbonate, GCC) distribution in the paper’s zdirection on final dryness and sheet structure after the wet pressing with a roll pulse was also studied. The distribution of filler did not affect the maximum dryness after wet pressing (40 %) for sheets containing identical (13 %) amount of filler. However, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer dewater more easily and yield the 40 % maximum achievable dryness after wet pressing at a lower pressure. As a result, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer yielded higher thickness as compared to samples with filler distributed evenly in the z-direction. In the study on wet-pressing using two different shoe press pulse profiles, the samples made from TMP and DIP yielded identical after-press solids content. More water was pressed out of the TMP samples as compared to DIP samples since TMP samples had lower initial solids content. The wet webs with more porous structure in the dewatering layer yielded higher dryness after wet-pressing. This is a major advantage, as higher dryness after wet-pressing implies a reduction of steam consumption in the dryer. This study also showed that the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure at the end yielded higher solids content and apparently higher bulk after the wet-pressing compared to the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure in the beginning. Higher filler content in newsprint increases the risk of linting at the printing press. Recent advances in technology and research in producing microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) should enable the production of MFC with acceptable energy cost in the near future. MFC can be used to improve the strength properties of the paper. Optimal selection of MFC quality and filler content can improve the optical properties while maintaining or enhancing the surface strength of the sheets. Different qualities of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) were blended with TMP and ground calcium carbonate (GCC). The addition of MFC decreased the drainage rate of the pulp suspension but improved the strength properties. Wet pressing experiments showed that optimal use of MFC and filler could enhance the strength and optical properties without reducing the solids content after wet pressing. Field emission SEM revealed that the MFC particles adsorbed onto filler particles and fibres. The MFC binds the filler-MFC-fines aggregates to the fibre network, thus partly filled the pore network. As a result, MFC addition increased the air resistance and internal bonding of the sheet. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R
