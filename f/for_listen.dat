2500|$|In the meantime, the {{expected}} follow-up album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 2, was scrapped due to Michael's lawsuit with Sony. Michael complained that Sony had not completely supported {{the release of}} his second album, resulting in its poor performance in the US as compared to Faith. Sony responded that Michael's refusal to appear in promotional videos had caused the bad response. Michael ended the idea <b>for</b> <b>Listen</b> Without Prejudice Vol. 2 and donated three songs to the charity project Red Hot + Dance, for the Red Hot Organization which raised money for AIDS awareness; a fourth track [...] "Crazyman Dance" [...] was the B-side of 1992's [...] "Too Funky". Michael donated the royalties from [...] "Too Funky" [...] to the same cause.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 2014 they {{released}} a new single titled [...] "Down". Their new album, Listen, {{was released on}} 8 September 2014. According to reports, singer Luke Pritchard and 25-year-old London-based hip hop producer Inflo share co-producing credits. This is their first album with new drummer Alexis Nunez. In an interview in July 2014, Pritchard stated that Listen includes more improvisation and found that “that kind of fearlessness when you make the first album kind of crept back in.” Upon its release, the album debuted at No.16 on the UK Albums Chart, then fell to No.57 the week after, and the next week dropped off the chart. A remix album <b>for</b> <b>Listen,</b> entitled Hello, What's Your Name?, was released on 4 December 2015. It features remixes by Jack Beats, The Nextmen, Montmartre and Kove among others.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1991 Brit Awards, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 won {{the award}} for Best British Album. Later in 1991, Michael {{embarked}} on the [...] "Cover to Cover tour" [...] in Japan, England, the US, and Brazil, where he performed at Rock in Rio. In the audience in Rio, he saw and later met Anselmo Feleppa, who later became his partner. The tour was not a proper promotion <b>for</b> <b>Listen</b> Without Prejudice Vol. 1. Rather, it was more about Michael singing his favourite cover songs. Among his favourites was [...] "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me", a 1974 song by Elton John; Michael and John had performed the song together at the Live Aid concert in 1985, and again for Michael's concert at London's Wembley Arena on 25 March 1991, where the duet was recorded. The single was released {{at the end of}} 1991 and reached No. 1 in both the UK and US.|$|E

One month after the release of Listen Like Thieves, INXS set off on a two-leg tour of the US. The first US leg continued into February of the New Year, and was soon followed by a two-month break. During the band's time off, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Andrew Farriss joined singer-songwriter Jenny Morris, to write and produce [...] "You're Gonna Get Hurt", the first single of her 1987 debut album, Body and Soul. Vocalist and songwriter Michael Hutchence took up his first acting role, in the Australian film Dogs in Space, directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator Richard Lowenstein. In May, the band members reconvened and travelled to the UK to resume their Listen Like Thieves tour. For the next six months, they relentlessly toured Europe, the US and Australia.|$|E

60|$|Last of {{the miserable}} train comes a man clad in black, of small stature {{and a dark}} complexion, with a {{clerical}} band about his neck. Many a time, in the years gone by, that face has been uplifted heavenward from the pulpit of the East Meeting-House, when the Rev. Mr. Burroughs seemed to worship God. What!--he? The holy man!--the learned!--the wise! How has the Devil tempted him? His fellow-criminals, for the most part, are obtuse, uncultivated creatures, some of them scarcely half-witted by nature, and others greatly decayed in their intellects through age. They were an easy prey for the destroyer. Not so with this George Burroughs, as we judge by the inward light which glows through his dark countenance, and, we might almost say, glorifies his figure, {{in spite of the}} soil and haggardness of long imprisonment,--in spite of the heavy shadow that must fall on him, while death is walking by his side. What bribe could Satan offer, rich enough to tempt and overcome this mail? Alas! it may have been in the very strength of his high and searching intellect, that the Tempter found the weakness which betrayed him. He yearned for knowledge he went groping onward into a world of mystery; at first, as the witnesses have sworn, he summoned up the ghosts of his two dead wives, and talked with them of matters beyond the grave; and, when their responses failed to satisfy the intense and sinful craving of his spirit, he called on Satan, and was heard. Yet--to look at him--who, that had not known the proof, could believe him guilty? Who would not say, while we see him offering comfort to the weak and aged partners of his horrible crime,--while we hear his ejaculations of prayer, that seem to bubble up out of the depths of his heart, and fly heavenward, unawares,--while we behold a radiance brightening on his features as from the other world, which is but a few steps off,--who would not say, that, over the dusty track of the Main Street, a Christian saint is now going to a martyr's death? May not the Arch-Fiend have been too subtle for the court and jury, and betrayed them--laughing in his sleeve, the while--into the awful error of pouring out sanctified blood as an acceptable sacrifice upon God's altar? Ah! no; <b>for</b> <b>listen</b> to wise Cotton Mather, who, as he sits there on his horse, speaks comfortably to the perplexed multitude, and tells them that all has been religiously and justly done, and that Satan's power shall this day receive its death-blow in New England.|$|E

40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{in the past decade}} has shown that shadowing is an effective technique toward the improvement of listening comprehension skills. However, research has focused exclusively on the technical aspects of shadowing and less focused on learners’ psychological status. Thus, this study explores the relationship between the effectiveness of shadowing and learners’ psychological aspects mainly quantitatively, with follow-up qualitative analysis. The current study examines whether learners’ initial attitudinal motivation affects the improvement of listening skills and how learners’ self-confidence and motivation <b>for</b> <b>listening</b> and perceptions toward shadowing affects their improvement in listening. The participants were 80 Japanese sophomores at a national university, all majoring in health or engineering. After eight training sessions, the students’ score <b>for</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension skills improved with statistically significant differences, and eight students were interviewed about their and perceptions of shadowing, self-confidence and motivation <b>for</b> <b>listening.</b> The study demonstrates that the outcome of shadowing is influenced by learners’ initial level of attitudinal motivation, perception toward shadowing, and self-confidence and motivation <b>for</b> <b>listening...</b>|$|R
