5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of livermorium {{has not yet been}} established. In 2011, experiments were conducted to create nihonium, flerovium, and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. The targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively moscovium and livermorium. The produced nuclides bismuth-213 and polonium-212m were transported as the hydrides 213BiH3 and 212mPoH2 at 850°C through a quartz wool <b>filter</b> <b>unit</b> held with tantalum, showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable, although their heavier congeners McH3 and LvH2 would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p-block. Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. Moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future, a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium. Though no known isotopes of livermorium have long enough half-lives, 288Mc, 289Mc, and 290Mc may be chemically investigated with current methods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} stream filtering scenario, there usually exist many filtering {{rules that}} specify the filtering objectives and many <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> that estimate the filtering rules. A filtering rule may connect to several different <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> and a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> may connect to several different filtering rules. An open problem {{in such a}} filtering scenario is how to order the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods {{are based on a}} greedy strategy which orders the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> according to three factors of the <b>filtering</b> <b>units,</b> i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn’t been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set empirically, which is unable to adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive ordering framework (AOF) which executes an adaptive ordering strategy. In AOF, all the temporal filtering results are preserved in each sliding window. Accordingly, the selectivity can adjust automatically and thus all the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> can be ordered with respect to the adapted selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AOF method outperforms other simple filtering methods.

50|$|MERV 14 {{filters are}} capable of {{reducing}} smoke particles by approximately 80% when operating at the filter's design velocity, so a CADR smoke rating on a simple <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> that uses a MERV 14 filter will be approximately 0.80 times the fan flow rate in CFM. If the <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> does not mix the test room's air very well, it may receive a lower CADR measurement {{because it does not}} operate as efficiently as it should. If a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> uses a MERV 12 filter that removes roughly 40% of the smoke particles, then it may still obtain a smoke CADR of 80 by filtering 200 cubic feet per minute instead of 100 CFM. Conversely, a 99.97% HEPA filter (MERV 17) that removes over 99.9% of the smoke particles needs to filter 80 cubic feet per minute to get a CADR of 80. This shows the CFM airflow of a unit is always equal to or greater than the CADR rating.|$|R

50|$|In {{chemical}} engineering, {{biochemical engineering}} and protein purification, crossflow filtration (also known as tangential flow filtration) {{is a type}} of filtration (a particular unit operation). Crossflow filtration is different from dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels tangentially {{across the surface of the}} filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a <b>filter</b> <b>unit</b> can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike batch-wise dead-end filtration.|$|E
