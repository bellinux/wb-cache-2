5|$|Péraud's time {{remained}} untouched {{until the}} final group of riders set off, and with 's Simon Špilak coming closest to Péraud {{in a time of}} 19' 59", having faded from a similar time at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>point</b> of the Col des Quatre Chemins, the stage battle ultimately came down to the two riders in contention for the overall honours; Wiggins and 's Lieuwe Westra. Westra set off two minutes before Wiggins, and although noted as proficient in the time trial discipline, he left everything on the hill as he set the fastest time to the intermediate checkpoint; recording a time of 11' 29", taking around three seconds per kilometre out of Péraud's time of 11' 47". Two minutes later, Wiggins passed the same point two seconds slower than Westra, but a stronger second half to the stage sealed the victory for Wiggins; as the hill flattened, Wiggins' time-trial experience proved pivotal as he overhauled the deficit to Westra, and finished the stage with a two-second advantage over Westra, taking the stage win, overall victory and the points classification in one fell swoop. 's Alejandro Valverde, who had held the lead of the points classification prior to the stage, could only muster sixth on the stage, but this result was good enough for him to claim the final remaining place on the podium.|$|E

500|$|An inverted-F antenna {{is a type}} of antenna used in {{wireless}} communication. [...] It {{consists of}} a monopole antenna running parallel to a ground plane and grounded at one end. [...] The antenna is fed from an <b>intermediate</b> <b>point</b> a distance from the grounded end. [...] The design has two advantages over a simple monopole: the antenna is shorter and more compact, and the impedance matching can be controlled by the designer without the need for extraneous matching components.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} four [...] riders to start within the final twenty-five riders, Chris Froome got within eight seconds of Kelderman's time, {{but it was not}} until another of the team's riders, Michael Rogers, that the lead changed hands. Although he trailed at the first <b>intermediate</b> <b>point,</b> Rogers {{overhauled}} the time of Kelderman at the finish by fourteen seconds; he held the lead into the final five starters, where it was then taken by the world time trial champion Tony Martin, riding for the [...] team. Martin bettered the time of Rogers by 37 seconds, but it was not to last as Wiggins was cementing his overall lead. Wiggins made up a deficit of seven seconds to Martin at the first <b>intermediate</b> <b>point,</b> and turned it into a 36-second lead in the space of , eventually taking the stage victory by 34 seconds over Martin.

500|$|The inverted-F antenna is an {{evolution}} of the basic quarter-wave monopole antenna. [...] The wire F-type antenna was invented in the 1940s. [...] In this antenna the feed is connected to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>point</b> {{along the length of}} the antenna instead of to the base. [...] The base is connected to ground. [...] The advantage of doing this is that the input impedance of the antenna is dependent on the distance of the feed point from the grounded end. [...] The portion of the antenna between the feedpoint and the ground plane is essentially behaving as a short-circuit stub. [...] Thus, the designer can match the antenna to the system impedance by setting the position of the feed point (RF systems commonly have a system impedance of 50 Ω whereas a λ/4 monopole has an impedance of 36.5 Ω).|$|E

[...] rider Edvald Boasson Hagen marginally bettered Lancaster's time to assume the lead for a time, but French champion Sylvain Chavanel (...) set a mark of 7' 20" [...] for the course.

Cancellara, the pre-stage favourite, recorded the fastest time of 3' 35" [...] to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>point,</b> and extended his eventual stage-winning margin to seven seconds by the finish; in the process, Cancellara won his fifth Tour prologue stage, a record.|$|E

500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some <b>intermediate</b> <b>point,</b> is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E

2500|$|As the rider's whole weight must {{be carried}} {{at one side}} when mounting, on an English saddle, one stirrup leather often becomes {{stretched}} longer than the other, usually the left one, because most mounting occurs on that side.

As Cancellara was finishing, Sagan was starting the course and was six seconds quicker to the same time-point; Cancellara closed out the course quicker, but Sagan held on by four seconds to take the stage victory.
