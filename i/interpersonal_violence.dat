Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include harassment, embarrassment, abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, sexual abuse, partner battery, employment discrimination, police brutality, judicial corruption and misconduct, bullying, paternalism, domestic violence, indoctrination, being the victim of an alcoholic parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood), life-threatening medical conditions, and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, large scale transportation accidents, house or domestic fire, motor vehicle accident, mass <b>interpersonal</b> <b>violence</b> like war, terrorist attacks or other mass tortures like sex trafficking, being taken as a hostage or kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or milder forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.|$|E

The paper argues for the intervention programs and for the importance of a preventive focus in the provision of family oriented mental health services.

40|$|Violence-related injuries, {{including}} suicide, {{adversely affect}} {{the health and}} welfare of all Americans through premature death, disability, medical costs, and lost productivity. Estimating {{the magnitude of the}} economic burden of violence is critical for understanding the potential amount of resources that can be saved if cost-effective violence prevention efforts can be broadly applied. From 2003 to 2005, the lifetime medical costs and productivity losses associated with medically treated injuries due to <b>interpersonal</b> and self-directed <b>violence</b> occurring in the United States in 2000 were assessed. Several nationally representative data sets were combined to estimate the incidence of fatal and nonfatal injuries due to violence. Unit medical and productivity costs were computed and then multiplied by corresponding incidence estimates to yield total lifetime costs of violence-related injuries occurring in 2000. The total costs associated with nonfatal injuries and deaths due to violence in 2000 were more than $ 70 billion. Most of this cost ($ 64. 4 billion or 92 %) was due to lost productivity. However, an estimated $ 5. 6 billion was spent on medical care for the more than 2. 5 million injuries due to <b>interpersonal</b> and self-directed <b>violence...</b>|$|R

40|$|Violent actions such as {{suicide bombings}} are unusual and unnatural forms of human behaviour. Their mere {{occurrence}} indicates {{the presence of}} a serious problem in <b>interpersonal</b> interaction. <b>Violence</b> signals the collapse of dialogue and resort to unconventional means of communication. Believing that the Oslo peace talks between Israeli and PLO negotiators did not provide the proper conduit for achieving Palestinian national aspirations in statehood, radical groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have since 1984 unleashed a wave of suicide terror that has caused the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians. Palestinian violence has invited overwhelming Israeli retaliation that took the form of collective punishment, which has further escalated the pace of suicide bombing. Sacrificial death in perspective Valour in battle, including deliberate self-destruction, has always punctuated armed conflicts. For instance, Laqueur (1999 : 140) observes that ‘suicide missions have been carried out for as long as wars have been fought’. In moder...|$|R
40|$|Conjoint couple {{treatment}} for <b>Interpersonal</b> Partner <b>Violence</b> (IPV) remains controversial despite {{a growing body}} of research and practice experience indicating that it can be effective and safe. In addition, developing typologies of couples who are violent suggest that a “one size fits all ” treatment approach to IPV is not appropriate and conjoint treatment may have a place in the treatment of at least some couples. In this paper, we review the experimental studies and clinical practices of conjoint treatment. Based on this review, we suggest current best practices for this approach to treatment. Best practices include couples treatment as part of a larger community response to IPV, careful screening of couples for inclusion in couples treatment, modification of typical conjoint approaches to promote safety and on-going assessment of safety with contingency plans for increased risk. Couples Treatment of IPV 3 Couples treatment when there has been intimate partner violence (IPV) remains controversial and objections to it have generally taken two forms – one pragmatic an...|$|R
