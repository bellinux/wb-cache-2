25|$|The {{story begins}} in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls {{homestead}} in South Dakota {{on a hot}} September day in 1880 as Laura and her father ("Pa") are haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers {{that there will be}} seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.|$|E

He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think it will work... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon...

[...] "I looked at the different opportunities that I had {{and this was a}} team that won 83 games last year while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was {{during the second half of}} the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 111, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. [...] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit [...]259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.|$|E

After {{competing}} in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course Laura Bennett said that the swim was the hardest part of the course: “The swim was the most difficult, it was hard to get away from everyone.” Erin Densham said that: [...] "“The swim is going to play a big role.

Once passing Buckingham Palace, the cyclists turned and went back towards Hyde Park and eventually crossed through the transition area before starting the next lap. The final discipline was the run.

Jackie Brygel of TV Week said Susan {{has a lot to}} prove with Paul breathing down her neck, but her new role puts her health in jeopardy when she begins displaying signs of an MS relapse. Woodburne explained [...] "She's working 24 hours a day {{to try to get the}} paper to take on a different form and is running herself into the ground. She's unable to stop the trembling in her hand, is quite dizzy and her vision becomes blurred - all indications of an MS relapse, which would be her worst nightmare." [...] Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported Susan refuses to turn to Karl, who always helped her with an episode, and instead she relies on help from Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber). Woodburne revealed Karl asks Susan to slow down, but she ignores him. The actress said Karl is looking at the situation from the perspective of an ex-husband who has feelings for her, but also as a doctor. Susan finds herself unable to do the housework, but Rhys understands that she wants to keep her independence. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "She always knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> living alone but Karl is the last person she wants to turn to. She doesn't want to admit she needs him but she does. In the end she confides in Dr Rhys." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2008 with Downey's signing. Though Don Cheadle was also {{reported}} to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated {{that he did not}} think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man2, Thor (2011), and [...] (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. Lou Ferrigno, who voiced Hulk in The Incredible Hulk, stated that he would be involved in the film. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would [...] "definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard,</b> because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's {{going to take a lot}} of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The female superhero Wasp was included in an earlier draft of the script written before Johansson's involvement. The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.|$|E

How, then, does one demonstrate a link between a particular plan and the multiple criteria for fair districting? It is proposed that a reapportionment plan can be described in terms of the eigenfunctions of a connectivity matrix. By making explicit the valencies linking nodes in a network of polygons, and/or adjusting the values in the main diagonal, the mapable eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix representing the network provide a mathematical rationale for a districting plan. This creates the possibility of simultaneously taking into account joint, and sometimes conflicting, districting criteria such as contiguity, equal population, and the protection of communities of interest. ...|$|R
