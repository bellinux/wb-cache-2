25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{the policy of}} Don Javier and Fal Conde, dubbed javierismo or falcondismo, was {{increasingly}} contested within the Comunión. The Sivattistas pressed for terminating the regency and for Don Javier to declare himself the king. They suspected that the overdue regency was an element of Don Javier’s policy towards Franco; according to them, the regent intended to ensure the crown for the Bourbon-Parma by means of appeasement rather than by means of open challenge. In particular they were enraged by allegedly ambiguous stand versus the proposed Francoist , considering it an unacceptable backing of the regime. On the other hand, the possibilists were <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> what they perceived as ineffective intransigence and lack of legal outposts, recommending more flexible attitude. Especially following the 1949 news about Franco’s negotiations with Don Juan, Don Javier found himself under pressure to assume a more active stance.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Sufjan Stevens {{released}} {{an album of}} extra material left over from Illinois (originally conceived as a double album), titled , {{as well as an}} album of Christmas music titled Songs for Christmas (produced in parts between 2001 and 2006). Following the release of The Avalanche, Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music, stating in an interview with Pitchfork in 2006: [...] "I'm <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> my voice. I'm <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> ... the banjo. I'm <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> ... the trumpet". In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project—an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States—had been a [...] "promotional gimmick" [...] and not something that he had seriously intended to complete. In the same year he released The BQE, an orchestral suite accompanying a home-made film dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In an interview with BeatRoute Magazine in 2010, Stevens stated [...] " [...] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music, which was basically narrative long-form. It really opened things up for me. It also confused things as well. I don’t think I ever really fully recovered from that process". On August 20, 2010, without prior announcement, Stevens released the EP All Delighted People, and less than one week later, announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12.|$|E

500|$|Publisher {{and critic}} Gary Groth wrote that Elder's artwork in the Goodman Beaver stories [...] "clinched his {{reputation}} as the cartoon Brueghel [...] with his intricate portraits of a world cheerfully going mad". [...] Elder considered the stories to be the funniest of his collaborations with Kurtzman, though he said that {{towards the end of}} the run he was <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the painstaking work he put into the drawings. [...] The stories placed sixty-fourth on The Comics Journals [...] "Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century" [...] in 1999, along with four other works with which Kurtzman was involved. [...] Late-1990s talk of a Goodman Beaver feature film or television series circulated, but the Kurtzman estate was uninterested.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richardson, in The Observer, thought You Only Live Twice [...] "though {{far from}} the best Bond, is really almost as easy to read as any of them". He was {{critical}} {{of a number of}} aspects, saying that the [...] "narrative is a bit weak, action long delayed and disappointing when it comes but the surround of local colour... has been worked over with that unique combination of pubescent imagination and industry which is Mr. Fleming's speciality." [...] In The Guardian, Francis Iles wrote that [...] "I think he [...] must be <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the ineffable James Bond and perhaps even of writing thrillers at all". Iles reasoned that [...] "of the 260 pages of You Only Live Twice...only 60 are concerned with the actual business of a thriller", and his enjoyment was further diminished by what he considered [...] "the grossness of Bond's manners and his schoolboy obscenities".|$|E
500|$|By 1971, the {{projected}} start of construction had slipped to within {{three to four}} years from then; however, Caltrans had approved the project. In July1974, the California Coastal Commission unanimously decided to halt the entire project, since many of the necessary approvals from governmental bodies had not been obtained; this overrode an exemption granted by the San Diego Coast Regional Commission. Both the mayors of Chula Vista and National City were dismayed; Mayor Kile Morgan of National City stated that [...] "we in the South Bay are <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being kicked around", in reference to other stalled projects such as SR 157 and SR125. Meanwhile, the interchange at I-805 was under construction, with completion scheduled for the next year. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife report predicted that the project would destroy [...] of marshland and harm three bird species that were endangered, among other negative environmental consequences; the conclusions were disputed by local officials.|$|E
