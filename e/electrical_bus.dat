The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one <b>electrical</b> <b>bus,</b> whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one <b>electrical</b> <b>bus.</b> That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

There was no threat to local residents or the environment, and the alert, the second-lowest Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) emergency declaration, was terminated later that same day. The electrical fault caused an arc flash, resulting in a minor burn of a plant worker who was in the room and was treated at a local hospital. On March 22, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that it had initiated a special inspection into the failure of the <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> that resulted in the plant declaring an alert.|$|E
500|$|With {{the left}} wing stalled the {{aircraft}} began banking to the left, rolling over onto its side until it was partially inverted at a 112-degree bank angle (as seen in the Laughlin photograph) with its right wing over its left wing. As the cockpit had been equipped with a closed-circuit television camera positioned behind the captain's shoulder and connected to view screens in the passenger cabin, {{it is possible that}} passengers were able to witness these events from the cockpit as the aircraft dove towards the ground. Whether the camera's view was interrupted by the power loss from the number one <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> is not known. The aircraft eventually slammed into a field approximately [...] {{from the end of the}} runway. Large sections of aircraft debris were hurled by the force of the impact into an adjacent trailer park, destroying five trailers and several cars. The DC-10 had also crashed into an old aircraft hangar located at the edge of the airport at the former site of Ravenswood Airport, which was used for storage.|$|E

2500|$|The Alpine Sleigh Ride {{was a dark}} ride {{attraction}} {{which opened}} during the park's first season. It had a ride control system and vehicles (ArrowGlide) designed by Arrow Development. Riders passed through an alpine forest before reaching the show building {{which was designed to}} resemble a large mountain capped with snow. A waterfall cascaded from atop the mountain and down into a catch pond near the mountain's base. Once past the waterfall, riders would journey through many chambers within the mountain. These included an echo tunnel and an avalanche room with simulated snow. At several points throughout the ride, the vehicles would exit and travel along the exterior of the mountain-themed show building. The sleigh-themed vehicles were powered by an <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> bar where portions of the track ascended, and they were gravity powered during the descents which featured several surprise dips. Part of the show building was shared with the adjacent gas powered car ride (Le Taxi) which passed through a tunnel {{in the side of the}} mountain. The ride included an appearance by the [...] "Abominable Snowman". Alpine Sleigh Ride was retired after the 1983 operating season.|$|E
2500|$|Rule {{concluded}} that {{the primary cause of}} the sinking was a failure of the <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11 a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so it sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until it imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that even a small leak at test depth would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a [...] "minor problem".|$|E

The Rig for Reduced Electrical bill was immediately implemented as electrical service was switched to the submarine’s battery. All non-vital loads were dropped from the <b>electrical</b> <b>busses.</b> Limited propulsion was available from the emergency electrical motor operating the main shaft.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{bandwidth}} needed for transmitting the addresses in future symmetric multiprocessor machines (SMP), constructed around a shared bus {{due to the}} critical obligation to preserve the coherence of the memory hierarchy. We show that an address-transaction bandwidth as high as several hundreds of Gbit/s will be necessary not {{to slow down the}} execution of most applications in large SMP's. This communication bandwidth seems incompatible with the operation constraints of shared <b>electrical</b> <b>busses,</b> making necessary the search for other implementations of the address transmission network. We consider the introduction of optical interconnects (OI) in this context. We review several solutions, in the ascending order of complexity of the optical subsystems as one critical issue concerns the degree of sophistication of the optical solutions and their cost. We first consider simple point to point OI's for a SMP chipset. The interest for OI's comes from the low energy consumption and from the possibility, in the future, to integrate several thousands of optical input/outputs per electronic chip. Then we consider the implementation of an optical bus that is a multipoint optical line involving more optical functionality. We discuss the possibility of multiple accesses to the bus, and the constraints related to the necessity to maintain the coherence of caches...|$|R
40|$|A {{challenge}} for electric buses is to minimize {{heating and cooling}} power to maximally extend the driving range, but still provide sufficient thermal comfort for the driver and passengers. Therefore, we investigated the thermal sensation (TS) and thermal comfort (TC) of passengers in buses during a cool day (temperature 13. 4  ±  0. 5  °C, relative humidity (RH) 60  ±  5. 8 %) typical for the Dutch temperate maritime climate. 28 Males and 72 females rated TS and TC and gave information on age, stature, body weight and worn garments. The temperature in the bus of 22. 5  ±  1. 1  °C and RH of 59. 9  ±  5. 8 % corresponded to a slightly warm feeling (TS =  0. 85  ±  1. 06) and TC of 0. 39  ±  0. 65. TS related significantly to bus temperature, clothing insulation and age. Linear regression based on these parameters showed that {{the temperature in the}} bus corresponding to TC =  0 and TS =  0 would have been 20. 9  ±  0. 6  °C. In conclusion, a 1. 6  °C lower bus temperature during the investigated cool day probably would have led to less thermal discomfort and energy savings of <b>electrical</b> <b>busses.</b> The methodology to relate climatic measurements to subjective assessments is currently employed in a wider climatic range and may prove to be useful to find a better balance between thermal comfort and energy savings of the bus...|$|R
