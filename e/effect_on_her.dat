5|$|Princess Charlotte was a {{difficult}} child and indifferent student, with a nervous disposition. Her relationship with her demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality had little <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, {{in the care of}} family members. Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had {{a difficult}} relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's {{death at}} the age of ten had a devastating <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly {{attentive}} to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see Darwin-Wedgwood family).|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{appears in}} several StarCraft novels that greatly expand her backstory {{before the first}} StarCraft game. The novel Uprising portrays Kerrigan's {{training}} as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected to intense psychological abuse from her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When {{she was a young}} girl, an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a vegetative state. Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm's demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels Liberty's Crusade and Queen of Blades provide novelisations for Kerrigan's actions in Episodes I and II of StarCraft respectively. Liberty's Crusade develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while Queen of Blades serves to demonstrate Kerrigan's complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, and its <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> former love, Raynor.|$|E

After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E

25|$|In The Tenant vice is {{not unique}} to the men. Lady Lowborough's {{adultery}} has a particularly devastating <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband, and the malice of Eliza Millward is poisonous to the entire community. The eternal struggle between good and evil is emphasised by heavy use of biblical references: sinners who repent and listen to reason are brought within the fold, while those who remain stubborn tend to meet violent or miserable ends.|$|E
25|$|Katy Gallagher {{has also}} faced {{suggestions}} from the Daily Telegraph {{that she may}} be an Ecuadorian citizen, due to the 2008 Ecuadorian constitution which established the right of citizenship for anyone born in Ecuador, {{as well as their}} descendants even if born abroad. Gallagher has stated that the change in law in 2008 had no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> as the change does not apply retrospectively to the time of her mother's birth. The ALP has also obtained advice from an Ecuadorian legal expert and an Australian constitutional lawyer which it states confirmed that Gallagher is not an Ecuadorian citizen.|$|E
25|$|During {{high school}} Rosalie participated in theater as had her parents while in college. She acted and sang in many productions, garnering praise for her {{performances}} in the local media. It was during this period that Rosalie became pregnant and had an illegal abortion. This experience had a profound <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> showing up in later poetry and song. She earned a scholarship to the University of Idaho, {{but as a result}} of a rape, she became pregnant and went to a home for unwed mothers in California to await the birth of her child, a daughter. Again, the experience of making the difficult choice of adoption shows in her later writings and music.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{few years}} Burnett became well known in Washington society and hosted a {{literary}} salon on Tuesday evenings, often attended by politicians, {{as well as local}} literati. Swan's practice grew and had a good reputation, but his income lagged behind hers, so she believed she had to continue writing. Unfortunately she was often ill and suffered from the heat of D.C., which she escaped whenever possible. In the early 1880s she became interested in Christian Science as well as Spiritualism and Theosophy. These beliefs would have an <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> later life as well as being incorporated into her later fiction. She was a devoted mother and took great joy in her two sons. She doted on their appearance, continuing the practice of curling their long hair each day, which became the inspiration for Little Lord Fauntleroy.|$|E

In 1969 she dropped out of her university course rather than continue into her final year, but remained living in Wivenhoe around the university for several months. In early 1970 she was living in York Way in the King's Cross area of London, and was a close friend of a group including some university friends who were living a semi-communal life in Stamford Hill; among them was Hilary Creek. Mendleson and Creek were supporting a group which had squatted empty flats in Arbour Square in Stepney. She became a friend of Jim Greenfield after meeting him on leaving a political meeting.|$|E

Blunt, for her part, contributed the line where she tells Andy [...] "I'm hearing this", while opening and closing her hand, [...] "and I want to hear this" [...] keeping it closed. In 2015 she told Howard Stern that she had overheard a mother saying that to a child in a supermarket during production.|$|E

Her close friend and fellow poet Mandelstam was deported and then sentenced to a Gulag labour camp, where he would die.

The Austin Chronicles Josh Kupecki gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, finding it clichéd and melodramatic, and likening it to a public service announcement. Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, described Moore as giving [...] "a four-star performance in a two-star movie", drawing attention to the [...] "intrusive" [...] score and the [...] "maddeningly overwrought and heavy-handed" [...] storytelling.|$|E

The Second World War had little <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> life in the south of France.
