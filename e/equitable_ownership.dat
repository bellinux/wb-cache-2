2500|$|Normal express trusts are [...] "fixed" [...] trusts; the {{property}} is held for a fixed number of beneficiaries, and the trustee is obliged to distribute property without any discretion over who gets what. In a discretionary trust, however, the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to use it. Alastair Hudson gives {{the example of a}} trust [...] "that [...] shall divide the £1,000 between any of my sons who become unemployed, with the power to retain the whole of that £1,000 for the remainder beneficiary". This is a discretionary trust; the word [...] "shall" [...] means the trustee is forced to exercise his power, while the [...] "power to retain the whole of that £1,000" [...] gives him discretion over whether to retain the money. Discretionary trusts are regularly used, because they provide flexibility; in this situation, for example, the money could be retained and redistributed in a different form if one beneficiary develops some urgent need for it. They also help protect the trust fund. In fixed trusts, the potential beneficiaries have the <b>equitable</b> <b>ownership</b> of their property; in discretionary trusts, this is not the case. Because of this, {{the property}} cannot be made liable for their debts or controlled by them.|$|E

50|$|Vandervell donated {{a large sum}} {{of money}} to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) to {{establish}} a chair. He implemented a complex tax avoidance scheme. He instructed a bank, orally, to transfer complete ownership of 100,000 A-shares in his company, Vandervell Products, which they held on bare trust for him to the RCS and asked the RCS to grant an option simultaneously to purchase the shares to his trust company, Vandervell Trustees. He then instructed the VP to declare a dividend on the shares. The purpose of this was to avoid paying stamp duty by a written declaration of disposition of <b>equitable</b> <b>ownership,</b> and to avoid any liability for Vandervell to pay surtax on the dividends since the RCS was a charity and thus not liable to pay tax. This led to a leading case in English trusts law, Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners 1967 2 AC 291.|$|E
50|$|In {{a second}} case, Re Vandervell's Trusts 1974 Ch 269, Vandervell again {{attempted}} a tax avoidance scheme {{in relation to}} the same shares and the same option. He instructed the tax company to repurchase the shares through the option. Vandervell did not want to pay tax on the option or the shares (the trust of which he would be an object, the trustee being his trust company). The purchase money came from a trust, held by the same trust company but in favour of Vandervell's children. As such, the trust company took themselves as holding the purchased shares on trust for the children. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the option ceased to exist once it was exercised. Thus, there was no disposition and no consequent liability to pay tax. It also held that the children were the equitable owners of the shares, and, as such, Vandervell had divested himself of <b>equitable</b> <b>ownership</b> of the shares.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender <b>equitable</b> laws on <b>ownership</b> and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] paper explores {{some of the key}} challenges and opportunities in the implementation of the broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) deal of Kumba Resources, which subsequently {{led to the formation of}} Exxaro Limited, a large black-owned mining conglomerate in South Africa. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with a sample of 11 leaders involved directly in the deal. The data were content-analysed and the findings suggested that BEE transactions faced numerous challenges, including finding sustainable funding, securing suitable investors, merging various cultures, dealing with fronting and leadership, and planning management and leadership succession. The study concluded that the deal led successfully to both the <b>equitable</b> transfer of <b>ownership</b> and management and to the control of financial and economic resources to a wider base of the black population.

40|$|A survey {{based on}} a {{structured}} questionnaire was conducted {{at the beginning of}} 1995 to identify sources of capital and income for rural households in Kavango. The survey, which covered 80 households, revealed that there was a high dependence on external income sources. Pensions were the major source of income for the highest proportion of all households (33 per cent), followed by wages (23 per cent) and brewing (10 per cent). Other sources of income of similar importance to brewing were crop sales, non-formal work and cash remittances. Livestock were a minor source of income but a major source of capital and food security. Households with smaller cattle herds depended more on cattle for income and food security than those with larger herds. Cattle were a highly valued production resource that was only consumed during times of crisis and only in the absence of less valuable assets that could be easily liquidated. Grain storage was more popular among groups with the lowest income. By various criteria, female-headed households always tended to be in the group of households categorised as the poorest of the poor. However, given sufficient income, over one third of them would purchase cattle to diversify their investment portfolio. This article presents a number of potential strategies for improving the incomes of rural households in Kavango. These include the promotion of <b>equitable</b> livestock <b>ownership</b> and better use of the grazing resource through community management, intensification of cropping and the implementation of labour-intensive programmes to develop rural infrastructure. ...|$|R
50|$|The House of Lords, {{by three}} to two, found that Vandervell was indeed liable to pay {{tax on the}} £245,000 of {{dividends}} given to the Royal College of Surgeons. The House of Lords held that the Law of Property Act 1925, section 53(1)(c), was not applicable to situations where a beneficiary directs his trustees, by way of his Saunders v Vautier right to do so, to transfer full legal and <b>equitable</b> <b>ownership</b> to someone else. The case is a proposition that an oral declaration to a bare trustee to transfer the trust property to a third party absolutely for his own benefit is a valid disposition. However, Vandervell had not successfully divested himself of ownership (legal and equitable) in the shares, since the Trust Company had an option to purchase the shares back from the RCS. If the settlor does not divest himself adequately as in Vanderwell v IRC a resulting trust would operate. The option to purchase a substantial fraction of the company for only £5000 was extremely valuable. As such, Vandervell was liable to pay surtax on the option.|$|E

40|$|Creating and {{sustaining}} community-academic partnerships Growing interest among academics and health professionals in {{finding new ways}} to study and address complex health and social problems has manifested in recent years with increasing community demands for research and program implementation that is community-based, rather than merely community placed (Minkler & Wallerstein 2008). In the United States, community-based participatory research (CBPR), with its emphasis on the creation and use of community-university or community-academic partnerships, is the prevailing paradigm to address these complex problems, especially those concerned with racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. Essential principles of CBPR involve shared vision, <b>equitable</b> involvement, <b>ownership</b> and trust, capacity building, and immediate and long-term gains resulting in improved and relevant research (Minkler & Wallerstein 2008). For community and institutional partners, CBPR involves their active participation, mutual benefit and co-education, and sustained commitment to a process beyond studying an area of concern. It involves applying findings to achieve improved outcomes for the community. Once established, a challenge for community-academic partnerships is sustaining the partnership in the face of time and changes in its membership. While the need to strengthen the relationship between researchers and the community has been recognised, often from the viewpoint of the university partner, discussions on sustainability of partnerships have been few. Reflections are shared, through the eyes of community members, on the core elements that tie the community and academic members together and the challenges in understanding and nurturing those ties so that the community-academic partnership is sustained over time, and on possible recommendations for sustainability. It is based on a CBPR that was conducted to (1) evaluate the functioning and future sustainabilit...|$|R
40|$|In Peninsular Malaysia, {{it is well}} entrenched {{that the}} {{application}} of the statutory standard sale and purchase agreement (Schedules G, H, I and J) as provided in the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989, is mandatory for all house purchases pursuant to regulation ll(1) and (1 A) of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 and the principles decided in the case law. This paper seeks to examine the provisions contained in the statutory standard sale and purchase agreement (Schedules G, H, I and J) of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 ('the said agreement') of whether the said agreement is compatible with the requirement of Shariah (Islamic Law), insofar as it relates to abandoned housing projects in Peninsular Malaysia. The determination is paramount because due to the execution of the said agreement indicating the <b>equitable</b> or legal <b>ownership</b> of any purported purchase of housing unit and the validity of the purchase, parties to the agreement may later apply for loans to purchase the unit from Islamic banks in Malaysia. As the requirement for Islamic Bank is the upholding of the principles of Islamic Law in its operation, it subtly opens for a question - whether the said agreement too complies with the requirements as set out by Islamic Law? For otherwise, the subsequent loan agreement obtained from Islamic Bank would also contagiously be null and void...|$|R
40|$|A new {{initiative}} to combat world hunger has been launched. The {{aim is to}} double food production in the next thirty years by {{paying more attention to}} the needs of the poorest farmers, without jeopardizing the environment. The initiative has come from the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). This is a collection of public and private sector donors which supports the work of eighteen international agricultural research centres such as IITA in Nigeria, ICRAF in Kenya and ILRI in Ethiopia and Kenya. A strong recommendation is that all eighteen centres should widen the range of partners with which they work. This will mean extending the collaboration which they already have with national research organizations and universities to include NGOs, the private sector and farmers' organizations. The hope is that this will help the Centres to identify farmers' problems and speed up the how of technology from research centres, through the national systems to farmers. In the past the Centres were mandated to work on key crops. More attention will now be given to developing farmina systems that are sustainable and affordable. Centres will also move from having individual programmes, to setting up programmes across the international institutes to make better use of existing expertise. It is hoped that this will lead to research being planned across ecological regions. This initiative may also help to draw in expertise from the national research institutes, and further strengthen cooperation. All Centres will pay special attention to alleviating poverty and malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. More countries are now joining the CGIAR and it is hoped that this will lead to a more <b>equitable</b> North-South <b>ownership</b> of the system, and an increase in contributions to fund research.

40|$|English trusts are {{founded on}} the {{historical}} and doctrinal basis of equity and its consequent division of legal and <b>equitable</b> <b>ownership</b> of the trust fund. Evidently, this conceptualisation is not suitable for the civilian trust which lacks an equity heritage and is averse to fragmentation of ownership under the civilian numerus classus principle of real rights. Notwithstanding so, many civilian jurisdictions have transplanted the concept of trust into their respective jurisdictions. With growing international recognition and utilization of the trust concept, China also caught up the trend by enacting a Trust Law of China in 2001.

60|$|Rents {{could not}} be paid, and landlords either would not or could not reduce them. In the deepest {{interests}} of social order, and in confirmation of the tenant’s <b>equitable</b> and customary <b>ownership,</b> the only course open to the imperial legislature was to erect machinery for fixing fair rents. The alternative to what became matter of much objurgation as dual ownership, was a single ownership that was only a short name for allowing the landlord to deal as he liked with the equitable interest of the tenant. Without the machinery set up by Mr. Gladstone, {{there could be no}} security {{for the protection of the}} cultivator’s interest. What is more, even in view of a wide and general extension of the policy of buying out the landlord and turning the tenant into single owner, still a process of valuation for purposes of fair price would have been just as indispensable, as under the existing system was the tiresome and costly process of valuation for purposes of fair rent. It is true that if the policy of purchase had been adopted, this process would have been performed once for all. But opinion was not nearly ready either in England or Ireland for general purchase. And as Mr. Gladstone had put it to Bright in 1870, to turn a little handful of occupiers into owners would not have touched the fringe of the case of the bulk of the Irish cultivators, then undergoing acute mischief and urgently crying for prompt relief. Mr. Bright’s idea of purchase, moreover, assumed that the buyer would come with at least a quarter of the price in his hand,—an assumption not consistent with the practical possibilities of the case.|$|R
40|$|While {{residential}} courses generally {{exist only}} as spoken lectures (and thus, are not copyrightable), online courses are tangible, copyrightable property. With copyright come various rights to ownership, including control over {{content and the}} potential to earn profits. The rise of online education has pushed the issue of course ownership into the spotlight, as faculty and administrators argue over ownership. Unfortunately, the law is too vague to ascertain ownership; only through intellectual property policies will issues of ownership be determined. Using a case study design, two public and two private research universities were selected; all with a sufficient level of distance education activities to measure. The sample included two institutions with policies deemed permissive and two with policies deemed restrictive, in terms of ownership. Interviews were conducted {{with a total of}} seventy faculty members and administrators with a focus on their experiences with respect to distance education and intellectual property policy issues. In addition to interview data, other evidence was drawn from internal and external documents, such as course catalogs, faculty senate minutes, press releases and websites, to triangulate the interview data and frame it within the context in which it took place. The data revealed that faculty members are less knowledgeable about their respective institutional intellectual property policies and that such information plays a smaller role in their decision-making process concerning distance education participation than expected. Instead, other issues figure more prominently including a lack of time to devote to such projects, limited recognition for their efforts, no impact on tenure and promotion and a range of negative attitudes toward distance education from mild dislike to outright disdain. Accordingly, institutions which decide to embark on distance education ventures will need to address these issues in order to maximize faculty participation and sustain such programs. It is also recommended that, while intellectual property policies exert a limited influence, policies should seek to provide <b>equitable</b> distribution of <b>ownership</b> rights. Further, policies should clearly convey when they apply, explicitly discuss course materials of both digital and non-digital origin and articulate the definition and implications for use of institutional resources beyond those customarily supplied. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{property}} lawyers, {{we are all}} {{familiar with}} the general principle that a contract {{for the sale of}} land, which is capable of specific performance, operates in equity so as to confer a trust on the purchaser pending completion of the sale. Although some controversy exists as to the exact nature of the trust, it is well established that, upon exchange of contracts, equity will ‘‘treat that as done which ought to be done’’ 1 with the consequence that the purchaser acquires <b>equitable</b> <b>ownership</b> even though full (legal) title to the land will not pass until completion (and registration). As land is unique, specific performance is readily available in the context of sales of land where damages would, clearly, not be an adequate remedy. The same cannot be said for contracts for the purchase of personal property where invariably the subject matter is not unique and where a substitute can easily be acquired in the open market. In circumstances, however, where the property is unique or scarce (for example, a rare painting or vintage car), the maxim that ‘‘equity treats as done that which ought to be done’’ may be invoked so as to confer on the seller an equitable obligation to transfer the property to the purchaser in fulfilment of the contract. Where, therefore, the contract is specifically enforceable in this way, the seller, it is submitted, will again hold the property on trust for the purchaser where, as in a contract for the sale of land, there is an interval between the date of the contract and completion of the sale. The notion that a seller holds personal property upon trust for the purchaser pending completion of the sale is admittedly controversial, but this article seeks to argue that the same principles governing equity’s intervention in sales of land should apply in the context of sales of personalty. It is submitted that equity’s role in imposing a trust on the vendor both in relation to sales of land and personalty may be important in safeguarding the interests of the purchaser prior to, as well as after, completion of the transaction...|$|E
