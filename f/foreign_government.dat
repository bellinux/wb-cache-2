5|$|Following the Qatari–Bahraini War in 1868, British representatives signed another {{agreement}} with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any <b>foreign</b> <b>government</b> without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support {{the rule of the}} Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British.|$|E
5|$|Foreign states {{generally}} enjoy {{immunity from}} lawsuits in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The FSIA is the exclusive basis for U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over a <b>foreign</b> <b>government.</b> Prior to {{enactment of the}} FSIA in 1976, the executive branch was responsible for determining the immunity of foreign states on a case-by-case basis. By enacting the FSIA, Congress codified the guidelines for the immunity of foreign states and transferred responsibility for determining a foreign state's immunity from the executive branch to the judiciary.|$|E

50|$|This also {{includes}} any official {{source of information}} by the government such as speeches by government officials. <b>Government</b> attitudes to <b>foreign</b> <b>governments</b> often lead to information released to citizens that influence the way they think about <b>foreign</b> <b>governments</b> and <b>foreign</b> peoples.

5|$|In 1914, both Mississippi-class {{ships were}} sold to Greece; {{this was the only}} sale of {{functional}} US battleships to a <b>foreign</b> <b>government.</b> From 1914 to the early 1930s, the ships were active in the Greek Navy, serving mostly in coastal defense and attack roles. In these missions and in the calmer waters of the Mediterranean, their limitations were less pronounced. They served in the Russian Civil War and the Greco-Turkish War. By the mid-1930s, they were relegated to reserve and auxiliary roles, and Idahos guns were removed to coastal fortifications. Both were sunk by German aircraft in 1941, and raised in the 1950s to be sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{was first}} endorsed by a <b>foreign</b> <b>government</b> on 27 December 1917, when Serbian Zionist leader and diplomat David Albala announced {{the support of}} Serbia’s government in exile during a mission to the United States. Within two months, the French and Italian governments offered their endorsements, on 14 February and 9 May 1918, respectively. At a private meeting in London on 1 December 1918, Lloyd George and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau agreed to certain modifications to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, including British control of Palestine.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier {{signed an}} {{agreement}} between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, {{and it was the}} responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any <b>foreign</b> <b>government</b> any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails.|$|E
