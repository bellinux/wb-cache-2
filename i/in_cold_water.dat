5|$|The Russian {{imperial}} {{family was}} a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50miles (80km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan. They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{contagion}} and {{to preserve}} health, all employees {{should be involved}} in keeping the factory clean. Children should bathe occasionally. The clothes of those infected with fever should be washed <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> then in hot and be left to fumigate before being worn again. Those who died of fever should be wrapped promptly in cloth and those in the vicinity advised to smoke tobacco to avoid infection.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E

5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> diving, where a diver {{wearing a}} highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E
25|$|Blood flow to {{the muscles}} is lower <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> but {{exercise}} keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled. Blood flow to fat normally increases during exercise, but this is inhibited by immersion <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> Adaptation to cold reduces the extreme vasoconstriction which usually occurs with cold water immersion.|$|E
25|$|Marstonia comalensis lives <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> springs {{near their}} sources, and slack water {{riverine}} habitats. It {{has been most}} commonly found on mud, aquatic vegetation and dead leaves.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>cold</b> <b>waters</b> {{it is more}} {{difficult}} to precipitate dissolved calcium, which results in reduced body size of animals supported by calcium skeletons, leading to viviparity.|$|R

25|$|Cold brew {{coffee is}} made by {{steeping}} coarsely ground beans <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> for several hours, then filtering them. This results in a brew lower in acidity than most hot-brewing methods.|$|E
25|$|Protection {{from heat}} loss <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> is usually {{provided}} by wet suits or dry suits. These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. Where thermal insulation is not important, lycra suits/diving skins may be sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} may {{sometimes}} wear swimsuits covering more of the body when swimming <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> (see also wetsuit and dry suit). In colder temperatures, the swimwear is needed to conserve body heat and protect the body core from hypothermia.|$|E
50|$|Leptasterias polaris, {{the polar}} six-rayed star, is {{a species of}} starfish in the family Asteriidae. It is found <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> the {{northwest}} Atlantic Ocean and in polar regions.|$|R
50|$|The Helgoland {{underwater}} laboratory (UWL) is {{an underwater}} habitat. It {{was built in}} Lübeck, Germany in 1968, {{and was the first}} of its kind in the world built for use <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Extreme <b>cold</b> (such as <b>in</b> a glacial-fed lake, Arctic waters, the Great Lakes, etc.) {{slow the}} {{degradation}} of organic ship materials. Decay, corrosion and marine encrustation are inhibited or largely absent <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} used for windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, water skiing and other surface water sports where the user is {{frequently}} immersed <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> These suits are often made from very lightweight material for high flexibility. Membrane type suits are commonly used {{in the spring and}} autumn with moderate water temperatures, but Neoprene and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> These provide greater thermal protection {{in the event of a}} leak. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types of suits is important to water sports users that do not use a boat. A neoprene bottom also is less likely to allow trapped air to collect in the legs, causing the wearer to tend to float head down in the water.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{hypothermia}} {{may also}} be necessary. Because of the diving reflex, people submerged <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and apparently drowned may revive after a relatively long period of immersion. Rescuers retrieving a child from water significantly below body temperature should attempt resuscitation even after protracted immersion.|$|E
25|$|When {{the birds}} are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind, then rises, putting the birds to flight, {{allowing}} him a shot. The Toller then retrieves any downed birds. They are particularly suited for retrieving <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> climates because of their water-repellent double coat.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>colder</b> <b>waters,</b> {{they have}} more body fat and blood, and are more suited to deeper diving. Typically, 18%–20% of their {{bodyweight}} is blubber. Most {{research in this area}} has been restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5|$|The {{costs of}} {{albinism}} for marine mammals may include reduced heat absorption <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> <b>waters,</b> poor camouflage from predators, increased sensitivity to sunlight, and impaired visual communication.

50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} that differentiate in body length. The northern subspecies lives <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> <b>water,</b> matures at 3 cm and {{can reach}} a size of 7 - 8.5 cm. The {{size of the}} southern subspecies is 1.2 cm.|$|R
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} often worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|E
25|$|Taro {{contains}} {{oxalic acid}} which forms raphides. It {{is reduced to}} safe levels by steeping cubed taro roots <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> overnight and disposing of the water. Calcium oxalate is highly insoluble and contributes to kidney stones. It has been recommended to consume calcium-rich foods like milk together with taro.|$|E
25|$|Yup’ik cuisine is {{different}} from Alaskan Iñupiaq, Canadian Inuit, and Greenlandic diets. Yup'ik communities varied widely in what foods were available to them, but everyone used similar food processing and food preservation methods, including air drying and smoking, food storage <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and oil, fermentation, and freezing. Some foods were eaten raw.|$|E
