5000|$|Due to its {{electric}} propulsion, the torpedo swam smoothly out of {{the launch}} tube, {{instead of having to}} be ejected by pressurized air, therefore significantly reducing its acoustic launch signature. To allow for water flow around the torpedo while swimming out, several 1" [...] thick <b>guide</b> <b>studs</b> were attached to the torpedo, which although 19" [...] in diameter was designed to be used only from 21" [...] torpedo tubes.|$|R

5000|$|On 21 December, Seadragon sighted {{an enemy}} {{submarine}} near Cape St. George, made her approach, and launched three torpedoes at the target. The first missed ahead. The second exploded about 18 seconds after firing. The third torpedo hit the target. [...] sank with her bow vertical {{and with all}} hands lost. The second torpedo explosion, however, had damaged Seadragon. The force of the explosion had knocked down the personnel in the forward torpedo room, and the final bow torpedo in No. 1 tube, the outer door of which was open, was forced against the tail buffer. The countermining effect forced the torpedo forward shearing off the <b>guide</b> <b>stud</b> and tripping the starting lever. The outer door could not be closed. Depth control was lost. The final bow torpedo was fired. Control was regained as the torpedo exploded on Seadragons port quarter at an estimated 200 yards.|$|R

50|$|The third EVA began 6 December 1993 at 10:34 pm EST while Endeavour {{was over}} Australia. Hoffman {{installed}} <b>guide</b> <b>studs</b> on the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and prepared the WF/PC for removal while Musgrave {{set up a}} work platform and worked on opening an access door to allow observation of WF/PC status lights. Hoffman attached the support handle to the WF/PC and, with assistance by Claude Nicollier on the arm and a free floating Story Musgrave, removed the WF/PC during the night pass starting at 11:41 pm EST. The WF/PC was clear of the telescope by 11:48 pm EST and moved back into its storage container. A protective hood was then removed on the new WFPC2 camera (protecting its fragile external mirror) and the 620 lb WFPC2 was then installed at 1:05 am EST. Ground controllers then ran an Aliveness Test and 35 minutes later reported that the new camera successfully performed its series of initial tests. The new Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 had a higher rating than the previous model, especially in the ultraviolet range, and included its own spherical aberration correction system.|$|R

40|$|In Japan, metal fire {{shutters}} {{are used}} {{in all kinds of}} buildings as fire partition. However, in large spaces with high ceilings and long spans, it has been impossible to use metal fire shutters because of the size of their housings and their heavy weight. A system of fire-resistant screens chat can be used to form fire partitions has been developed to meet this need. The performance of this system is equal to that of conventional metal fire shutters. This paper describes experiments and simulations which confirm the system's fire resistance and motional performance. It also describes how this system is applied to a multipurpose gymnasium. ~lRODUCTION It has been impossible to compartmentalize a large space with metal fire shutters or metal fire doors in case of fire up to now because of the size of their housings and their heavy weight. Therefore, alternative measures were taken, {{such as the use of}} big water guns, to extinguish fires at an early stage or small areas within a large space to contain smoke and fire, Now, we have developed a fire-resistant screen system, to solve such problems. This system can prevent fire from spreading in a large space, and also enables an open plan without the need for <b>guide</b> <b>studs</b> for fire shutters. This paper outlines this fire-resistant screen system, its fire resistance, and its motional performance. It also introduces an example of a multipurpose gymnasium in which the system was first realized...|$|R
40|$|It {{is indeed}} true {{that one does}} not have to be old to become wise. This African Proverb {{provided}} a starting point for a journey into children‘s migration and engagement in load carrying activities. The study explores what goes into the girl child‘s migration from a rural area in Ghana to the city of Kumasi- the Capital of the Ashanti region to engage in the carrying of load for a fee. This study aims at getting knowledge about the girl child‘s lived experiences in the phenomenon. These kinds of experiences are deemed relevant in understanding the child‘s migration and work. The perspectives of the affected children on the phenomenon- they themselves telling their experiences, is the means by which the above aims have been achieved. The theoretical perspectives mainly rooted in the New Social Studies of Childhood will guide the focus of the study. Against the backdrop of these theoretical perspectives, the study examines the following- the girl child as a social actor in the exercise of agency, the girl child as both a ―being and becoming‖, the social structural child and a host of others. Several qualitative methods such as participant observation, semi structured interviews, informal focus group discussions, storytelling are employed to collect data. In all, 20 girls will be used as informants. The data will be analyzed and conclusions drawn. The study identifies that the girl child is a social actor, she is both ―being and ―becoming‖ however, she has limitations to the exercise of agency. The principal limitation the study identifies is poverty. Poverty at both national, regional, local levels pose a limitation to these girls in the exercise of their agency.. For instance, it has limited them on their schooling. It has also influenced them to migrate from home and has ultimately forced them to do the kind of job they are engaged in. Implications of the findings of this study are thoroughly discussed to serve as a <b>guide</b> for future <b>stud...</b>|$|R
