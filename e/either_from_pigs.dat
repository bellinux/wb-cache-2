40|$|Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis(PFGE) was {{developed}} for subspecific differentiation of Serpulina pilosicoli, and was applied to 52 isolates recovered from cases of intestinal spirochaetosis (IS) in pigs, dogs, human beings and various avian species. The technique was highly sensitive, differentiating the isolates into 40 groupings. Only six groups contained more than one isolate; in five of these groups isolates with the same banding pattern were <b>either</b> <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> in the same herds (four groups), or from humans in the same community: the sixth group contained two identical Australian porcine isolates from unrelated herds in different states. Overall S. pilosicoli isolates were genetically diverse, {{but in some cases}} isolates cultured from the same or different animal species were closely related. This suggested the likelihood of cross-species transmission, including zoonotic spread. PFGE was a powerful tool for epidemiological studies of S. pilosicoli and also allowed examination of genetic relationships between isolates...|$|E

Plasma membranes prepared in the presence of calcium possess this complex; those prepared in the absence of calcium (5 mM EGTA) do not. The complex associates itself with the inner cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane.

The complex dissociates from the plasma membrane during electrophoresis on 8 -M urea gels, irrespective of calcium levels during electrophoresis; at intermediate urea concentrations (4 - 6 M), the complex is not dissociated in the presence of calcium. Upon purification of the acidic protein band, SDS acrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and radioimmunoassay techniques suggest that the acidic protein band is composed of at least four peptides (designated 68 K, 59 K, 20 K, 20 K) : two of these (68 K, 20 K) are immunopositive for calcineurin and one (20 K) is immunopositive for calmodulin.

40|$|Membrane {{cofactor}} protein (MCP; CD 46) is a 50 – 60 000 MW glycoprotein, expressed on a {{wide variety}} of cells and tissues in man, which plays an important role in regulating complement activation. Human MCP has also been shown to be the receptor for measles virus. We have recently identified the pig analogue of MCP and demonstrated that pig MCP has cofactor activity for factor I-mediated cleavage of C 3 b when these components are derived <b>either</b> <b>from</b> <b>pig</b> or human. As a consequence, pig MCP is an efficient regulator of the classic and alternative pathways of human and pig complement. In order to define the potential importance of MCP in protecting against complement activation in the pig, we have conducted a comprehensive survey of its distribution in pig cells and organs. As in humans, MCP in the pig is broadly and abundantly distributed. Pig MCP is highly expressed on all circulating cells, including erythrocytes, in contrast to its absence on human erythrocytes. Multiple isoforms of MCP are found on cells and in tissues, probably representing products of alternative splicing analogous to those found in man. MCP is abundantly expressed throughout all tissues examined with particularly strong staining on the vascular endothelium. Connective tissue elements within liver and testis are also strongly stained by anti-pig MCP antibodies. Pig MCP is expressed only weakly on skeletal muscle cells and expression is absent from smooth muscle cells in the lung and vessel walls, sites at which human MCP is expressed. Of particular note, MCP is not expressed in B-cell areas of the germinal centres of lymph nodes...|$|R

Forty-eight S. aureus isolates <b>from</b> <b>pig</b> farmers and veterinarians and 130 isolates <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> collected in Western Switzerland were genotyped by spa typing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined for representative sample of the isolates.

The genotype composition of S. aureus isolates <b>from</b> <b>pig</b> farmers and veterinarians was similar to isolates <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> with predominant AFLP clusters CC 398, CC 9, and CC 49. The resistance to tetracycline and macrolides (clarithromycin) was common among the isolates from farmers and veterinarians (52 and 21 %, respectively) and similar to resistance levels in isolates <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> (39 and 23 %, respectively).

40|$|All 59 group B streptococcal {{cultures}} isolated <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> and nutrias {{reacted with}} group B-specific antiserum {{and gave a}} positive CAMP reaction in the zone of staphylococcal beta-lysin. Most of the cultures were pigmented; all cultures hydrolyzed Na hippurate and utilized salicin, maltose, and saccharose but not esculin, mannitol, or inulin. Fifty-three percent of the group B streptococci <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> and none of those from nutrias were lactose positive. Serotyping revealed {{that most of the}} group B streptococci <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> were of serotype III and most of those from nutrias were of type Ia/c. Protein c was present as c beta antigen. All group B streptococci were susceptible to penicillin and bacitracin (10 U), and most of the porcine cultures were resistant to tetracycline. According to these results, group B streptococci <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> and nutrias differ from bovine and human group B streptococci and seem to play no role in cross-infections between animals or between animals and humans...|$|R
