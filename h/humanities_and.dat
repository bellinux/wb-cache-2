40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effects of personal characteristics (empathy and authoritarianism) and religious orientations (Christian humanitarianism and religious fundamentalism) on identification with all <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> resulting humanitarian behavior. This research also tested two hypothetical models (personality is primary, religion is primary) for the relationship between identification with all <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> resulting humanitarian behavior. Two samples, consisting of 221 students and 158 adults, completed measures of authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism, dispositional empathy, Christian humanitarianism, identification with all <b>humanity,</b> <b>and</b> an assessment of humanitarian behaviors. As hypothesized, Christian humanitarianism and empathy were positively correlated with identification with all <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> humanitarian behavior. Furthermore, authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism were negatively correlated with identification with all <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> humanitarian behavior. Results also suggest that religious views may lead to the strengthening of specific personality characteristics and these, in turn, influence whether or not one identifies with all <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> engages in humanitarian behaviors. Directions for future research are discussed as well as the implications of this research to real-world settings...|$|R

5|$|Smith {{founded the}} Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first {{interdisciplinary}} academic organization {{devoted to the}} study of metals in the United States.

He applied the techniques of metallurgy {{to the study of}} the production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of <b>Humanities</b> <b>and</b> Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the {{brothers}} were both accepted to New York University. They had initial {{plans to attend}} the university {{in the fall of}} 2010; however, they deferred for one year. Dylan initially planned on majoring in fine/studio arts and minoring in economics while Cole planned on majoring in film and television production and minoring in drama. Instead, they both enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which allows students to plan their own curriculum. Cole focused his curriculum on the <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> archaeology while Dylan focused on video game design. In 2011, Dylan was elected president of the Third Avenue North residence hall at New York University. Both brothers graduated in May 2015; they told Entertainment magazine that they had walked away with each other's diplomas at the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 1959, Churchill College, Cambridge, was {{formally}} recognised by the University. Two days later, the Trustees announced that Cockcroft would be its first Master. Although {{it would also}} teach the <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> social sciences, 70 per cent {{of the student body}} would study science and technology related subjects. Cockcroft nominated the first fellows, and he oversaw the initial construction. Controversy arose over the chapel. A 1961 plan to build it {{at the entrance to the}} college, as was traditional at Cambridge, led to the immediate resignation of Francis Crick, a staunch atheist, as a fellow. The first undergraduates arrived in 1961, and the college, still incomplete, {{was formally}} opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on 5 June 1964.|$|E
