5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called <b>for</b> <b>separation</b> from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United <b>for</b> <b>Separation</b> of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|In 1646–47, Ashmole {{made several}} {{simultaneous}} approaches to rich widows {{in the hope}} of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit <b>for</b> <b>separation</b> and alimony but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{living and}} {{economic}} activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot.

From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses.

At each eccentricity, the 2 -dot separation discrimination thresholds howed a V-shaped dependence on <b>separation.</b> <b>For</b> <b>separations</b> less than approximately twice the resolution threshold, performance deteriorated from photopic to scotopic conditions and appeared to be limited by ganglion cell receptive field size or spacing. <b>For</b> <b>separations</b> maller than 10 % of the effective eccentricity (eccentricily + 0. 6 deg), the photopic 2 dot separation discrimination thresholds were significantly better than 3 -dot bisection thresholds previously measured under similar experimental conditions, supporting the hypothesis that 3 -dot bisection suffers from spatial interference <b>for</b> these <b>separations.</b> Interestingly, under scotopic conditions, 2 -dot separation discrimination thresholds were better than resolution for a range of separations at each eccentricity, implying that cone input was not necessary for hyperacuity performance. 2 -dot <b>separation</b> discrimination thresholds <b>for</b> large <b>separations</b> were little changed from photopic to scotopic luminance conditions.

5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support <b>for</b> <b>separation</b> from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used <b>for</b> <b>separation</b> of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the lowest energy configurations for string - antistring pairs at fixed separations by numerically minimizing the energy.

Consequently, well defined string - antistring pairs do not exist <b>for</b> such <b>separations.</b> We present an example of vortex - antivortex production by vacuum bubbles where this effect seems to play a dynamical role in the annihilation of the pair. We also study the dependence of the energy of an string-antistring pair on their separation and find deviations from a simple logarithmic dependence <b>for</b> small <b>separations.</b> Comment: 14 pages, in LATEX, 7 figures (not included...|$|R

40|$|A {{review is}} given of the {{literature}} on the design, development and use of micromachined devices <b>for</b> <b>separations</b> in the liquid phase. The emphasis is on those devices that offer more than just an empty channel for, e. g., electrophoretic separation. Topographic structures have been incorporated in the channels during their microfabrication, offering a variety of possibilities <b>for</b> the <b>separation</b> of (mainly) DNA molecules based on different principles. Supports for a stationary phase <b>for</b> chromatographic <b>separations</b> have been introduced in the channels in different ways: by packing of the channels with stationary phase particles, by polymerization of monolithic structures, or by lithographic machining of pillars in the channels. It is shown that the latter strategy gives the highest potential <b>for</b> increasing the <b>separation</b> power of the devices. Still, more conventional approaches are closer to a routine application...|$|R
