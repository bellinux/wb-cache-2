5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover. When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover, <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> that she be shown on a Venus elegans shell.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Odin Lieberman, {{commander}} of the V-22 squadron at Marine Corps Air Station New River, was relieved of duty after allegations that <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> his unit to falsify maintenance records to make the aircraft appear more reliable. A total of three USMC officers were later implicated as having {{played a role in}} the falsification scandal.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). <b>He</b> <b>instructed</b> {{the newly created}} Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

5|$|Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew {{concerned}} with Amer's inability {{to train and}} modernize the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.|$|E
5|$|Moodu Pani marked A. R. Rahman's first {{association}} with Ilaiyaraaja; the former (then known by his birth name Dilip) {{worked as a}} keyboardist in the film. During the re-recording of Moodu Pani soundtrack and score, Ilaiyaraaja fired his original keyboardist, due to the person's drinking behaviour. At that time, another one of his troupe members asked Ilaiyaraaja to meet a boy named Dilip, {{who knew how to}} play the keyboard. Ilaiyaraaja agreed and sent for Dilip, whom <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> regarding the notes and tune he had to play. Dilip, under Ilaiyaraaja's supervision, successfully completed the re-recording process.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was {{approached}} by the FAI to manage the Republic of Ireland in December 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to the role. In May 1986, Ireland won the Iceland Triangular Tournament at Laugardalsvöllur, in Iceland's capital of Reykjavík, with a 2–1 victory over Iceland and a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia. By this time Charlton had developed his tactics, which {{were based on the}} traditional British 4–4–2 system, as opposed to the continental approach of using deep-lying midfielders, as he noted that most of the Ireland international players plied their trade in England. Crucially <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> all members of his team to pressure opposition players and in particular force ball-playing defenders into mistakes.|$|E

5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. <b>He</b> <b>instructed</b> his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could {{not hope to}} hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded that he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> Walther and his cavalry to establish {{a position on the}} Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E
5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's {{watertight}} doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 40 Marines {{from the}} 9th MAB on the USS Hancock were flown in by Air America {{helicopters}} {{in civilian clothes}} to the DAO compound to augment the 18 Marine Security Guards assigned to defend the Embassy; an additional six Marines were assigned to protect Ambassador Martin. Martin had remained optimistic that a negotiated settlement could be reached whereby the US {{would not have to}} pull out of South Vietnam and, in an effort to avert defeatism and panic <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> Major James Kean, Commanding Officer of the Marine Security Guard Battalion and Ground Support Force Commander United States Embassy Compound, that he could begin to remove the tamarind tree and other trees and shrubbery which prevented the use of the Embassy parking lot as a helicopter landing zone.|$|E
5|$|San Martín did {{not take}} hostages or ask for ransoms, but rather <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> his people to avoid further {{conflicts}} {{and to try to}} restore peaceful relations with the royalists. Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers, which San Martín provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast, which he accepted. San Martín was aware that the new enlightened ideas at stake in the Napoleonic Wars influenced many of the Spanish military, and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend. He succeeded, as Zabala joined the patriot forces under San Martín's command during his administration in Mendoza.|$|E

5|$|The {{paramount}} chief maintained some loyalty for his subjects. He {{persuaded the}} Germans {{to carry out}} infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom <b>he</b> <b>instructed</b> in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. <b>He</b> <b>instructed</b> the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E
