2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in <b>immersion</b> <b>lithography.</b> The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of opposite polarity. In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E

The work presented in this thesis explores the use of an immersion scheme to improve the performance of a maskless lithographic technique known as Zone-Plate-Array Lithography (ZPAL). This {{is believed to be the}} first implementation of an immersion scheme in a maskless lithography system. This thesis provides a complete description of the <b>Immersion</b> Zone-Plate-Array <b>Lithography</b> (iZPAL) system. Since the zone plate component of the system is largely responsible for its lithographic performance, a thorough analysis of zone plate theory, design, and fabrication is also presented. The focusing performance of an immersion zone plate is then characterized through the experimental reconstruction of its point spread function. Finally, lithography results obtained with the iZPAL system are compared to those obtained with the non-immersion ZPAL system, demonstrating the improvement in resolution, exposure latitude, and depth-of-focus achieved with the immersion scheme. by David Chao.

For inks of 2. 0 mM OTS concentration, we found that effective area coverages of 38 % can be obtained.

In this research we have been working with ultra-high NA evanescent wave lithography (EWL) where the NA of the projection system is allowed to exceed the corresponding acceptance angle of one or more materials of the system. This approach is made possible by frustrating the total internal reflection (TIR) evanescent field into propagation. With photoresist as the frustrating media, the allowable gap for adequate exposure latitude is in the sub- 100 nm range. Through static imaging, we have demonstrated the ability to resolve 26 nm half-pitch features at 193 nm and 1. 85 NA using existing materials. Such imaging could lead to the attainment of 13 nm half-pitch through double patterning. In addition, a scanning EWL imaging system was designed, prototyped with a two-stage gap control imaging head including a DC noise canceling carrying air-bearing, and a AC noise canceling piezoelectric transducer with real-time closed-loop feedback from gap detection. Various design aspects of the system including gap detection, feedback actuation, prism design and fabrication, software integration, and scanning scheme have been carefully considered to ensure sub- 100 nm scanning. Experiments performed showed successful gap gauging at sub- 100 nm scanning height.

40|$|Optical lithography, the {{backbone}} of the industry for more than 50 years, has been pushing up against a number of physical barriers that have led to massive investments in development of alternative patterning techniques. Next generation lithography, based on extreme ultraviolet source (EUV), promises to overcome these issues, enabling the advancement into sub- 32 -nm nodes. However, EUV lithography has been confronted with a series of material and source issues, restricting its practical use for the semiconductor industry. Alternative advanced patterning options, such as multiple patterning (MP) for lines/spaces and directed self-assembly (DSA) for vias, offer significant improvements which allow the extension of conventional optical lithography down to sub- 5 -nm technology nodes. Multiple patterning options introduce variations in wire dimensions and spacing, while DSA vias require strict definition of the commensurable via grouping patterns in circuits. In this PhD, we aim to: a) analyze and evaluate the variability impact of the main variants of line/space MP on circuit design and performance, b) compare the results with next generation EUV lithography, c) provide a design solution for via patterning in advanced nodes, utilizing MP and templated DSA, and d) evaluate the provided solution with respect to its impact on circuit performance. In order {{to assess the impact of}} process variation, we developed a circuit-level variability analysis framework. We use this framework to generate statistical distributions of circuit performance metrics for logic circuits and SRAM arrays patterned with the considered MP options and EUV. Our results show a negligible impact of process variation related to MP options on the performance of logic circuits. This is not the case in SRAM arrays, where the impact can be substantial. For the via patterning, we propose a design method for DSA-aware via grouping and decomposition. Based on this method, we develop a fully parameterized EDA tool which can provide fast and efficient decomposition of any via layout into separate DSA-friendly masks. Running benchmark studies on a fully routed 32 -bit processor, we demonstrate a drastic reduction in the number of masks per metal layer, providing a manufacturable solution with <b>immersion</b> ArF <b>lithography.</b> Finally, we show that the increased resistance variation in vias, introduced by the DSA process, has a negligible impact on circuit performance. nrpages: 210 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis first {{presents}} a novel and highly accurate methodology for investigating the kinetics of photoacid diffusion and catalyzed-deprotection of positive-tone chemically amplified resists during post exposure bake (PEB) by in-situ monitoring {{the change of}} resist and capacitance (RC) of resist film during PEB. Deprotection converts the protecting group to volatile group, which changes the dielectric constant of resist. So the deprotection rate can be extracted from the change of capacitance. The photoacid diffusivity is extracted from the resistance change because diffusivity determines {{the rate of change}} of the acid distribution. Furthermore, by comparing the R and C curves, the dependence of acid diffusivity on reaction state can be extracted. The kinetics of non-Fickean acid transportation, deprotection, free volume generation and absorption/escaping, and resist shrinkage is analyzed and a comprehensive model is proposed that includes these chemical/physical mechanisms. Then in this thesis a novel lithographic technique, liquid <b>immersion</b> contact <b>lithography</b> (LICL) is proposed and the simulations are performed to illustrate its main features and advantages. Significant depth-of-field (DOF) enhancement can be achieved for large pitch gratings with deep-UV light (????= 248 nm) illumination with both TM and TE polarizations by liquid immersion. Better than 100 nm DOF can be achieved by when printing 70 nm apertures. The simulation results show that it is very promising to apply this technique in scanning near field optical microscopy. Finally, a rigorous, full vector imaging model of non-ideal mask is developed and the simulation of the imaging of such a mask with 2 D roughness is performed. Line edge roughness (LER) has been a major issue limiting the performance of sub- 100 nm photolithography. A lot of factors contribute to LER, including mask roughness, lens imperfection, resist chemistry, process variation, etc. To evaluate the effect of mask roughness on LER, a rigorous full vector model has been developed by the author. We calculate the electromagnetic (EM) field immediately after a rough mask by using TEMPEST and simulate the projected wafer image with SPLAT. The EM field and wafer image deviate from those from an ideal mask. LER is finally calculated based on the projected image...|$|R
