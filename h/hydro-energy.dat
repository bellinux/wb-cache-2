Impacts of climate change patterns on water resources supply to dams for <b>hydro-energy</b> generation is now evident.

The objective of this work was to analyze the link of climate change to water shortages for hydro-power generation in the Mtera reservoir, which supply 50 % of the hydro-power to the national grid. Literature survey, records collection and analyses and observations were research tools used. The study revealed that, 64 % of increasing variability in rainfall over years in the watersheds described declining water levels in Mtera dam.

We analyse what types of reservoir management policies enable an owner or a public authority to achieve their respective objectives. By "policy" we understand simple, easily applicable decision rules, which enable a decision maker to decide when {{and how much to}} produce based on currently available information. We use a stylised deterministic simulation model of a hydro-power producer (HP) who behaves strategically. We study a non-liberalised market, where the authorities aim to minimise the total electricity cost for customers and a liberalised market where the HP attempts to maximise his contribution. This enables us to evaluate the impact of the liberalisation of HS production decisions on production volumes and electricity prices. We conclude that imposing rigid policies with the aim of limiting the potential for strategic behaviour can create incentives to produce only at very high prices throughout the year. This can lead to very high total costs, especially when the producer has most flexibility (large reservoirs combined with large turbine capacity). More surprisingly, we observe lower total production in a non-liberalised market. <b>Hydro-energy</b> Simulation Policy...|$|E

In particular, we quantify the uncertainties associated with the glacier area and meltwater flux changes due to uncertainty in climate data, a critical problem for much of High Asia.

In contrast, the phase difference between pitch and plunge increases with the increase of the reduced velocity.

In Romania, as well as in all the countries of the European Union, which have chosen to promote renewable energy, governments have come up with support frameworks for investors in this field. In Romania’s case, the option for green schemes and compulsory quotas was selected, meaning that each energy producer, which produces renewable energy, receives a number of green certificates for each MW produced, depending on the technology it uses. The price of such a green certificate varies between 27 – 55 Euros. The statistics of the European Energy Association show that Romania is ranked 7 th among E.

In Europe, the development of small <b>hydro-energy</b> had a new growing since the seventies, due to the world energy crisis and, more and more the concerns of negative environmental impacts, as well as due to the development of new technologies. Nowadays, small hydro is one of the most valuable answers to the question of how to offer to isolated rural communities the benefits of electrification and the progress associated with it, as well as to improve the quality of life. The hydroelectric power plant utilises a natural or artificial fall of a river. The hydraulic conveyance circuit can be integrated in other components for multiple purposes (e. g. irrigation or water supply systems). This type of electricity production does not consume water, being considered so far one of the most important renewable energy source. At present, the economic utilisation of renewable energies is based on new technologies and on environmental protection techniques. Small hydropower, with its multiple advantages, as a decentralised, low-cost and reliable form of energy, is in the forefront of many developing countries to achieve energy self-sufficiency. It represents an important environmental benefit to aid sustainable development due to no release of carbon dioxide that contributes to ozone depletion and global warming.
