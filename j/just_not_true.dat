5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

500|$|In 1978, Lizzy {{released}} {{their first}} live album Live and Dangerous. There is some disagreement over {{just how much}} of the album is actually recorded live – producer Tony Visconti claimed that the only parts that were not overdubbed were the drums and the audience. However Brian Robertson has disputed this, saying that he had refused Lynott's request to re-record a guitar solo, and that the only overdubs were backing vocals and some guitar parts by Gorham. He added, [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> The only reason we said that it was recorded all over was obviously for tax reasons... so everything that Visconti claims is bollocks." [...] Gorham concurs, stating that he attempted to re-record a solo but could not recreate the live sound, adding, [...] "I re-did one rhythm track and a few backing vocals. But that's it." [...] The album was a huge success, reaching no. 2 in the UK, and was ranked as the best live album of all time by Classic Rock Magazine in 2004. But this success was overshadowed by the permanent departure of Robertson some time after a gig in Ibiza on 6 July 1978, the disagreements with Lynott having developed to an impossible level. Robertson soon teamed up with Jimmy Bain to front their new band, Wild Horses.|$|E

50|$|In Etruria, the pseudo-red-figure {{style was}} <b>not</b> <b>just</b> an early phenomenon, {{as it had}} been in Athens. Especially in the 4th century BC, some {{workshops}} specialised in this technique, although true red-figure was widespread in Etruscan workshops at the same time. Examples include the workshops of the Sokra Group and the Phantom Group. The somewhat older Sokra Group had a preference for cups with interior images from Greek mythology, sometimes also with Etruscan motifs. The Phantom Group mostly painted cloaked figures in combination with compositions of plant or palmette patterns. The workshops of both groups are supposed to have been located in Caere, Falerii and Tarquinia. The Phantom Group produced its wares until the early 3rd century BC.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years a number of {{backtracking}} algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems have been developed. This survey describes the basic backtrack search within the search space framework and then presents a number of improvements including look-back methods such as backjumping, constraint recording, backmarking, and look-ahead methods such as forward checking and dynamic variable ordering. 1 Introduction Constraint networks have proven successful in modeling mundane cognitive tasks such as vision, language comprehension, default reasoning, and abduction, as well as specialized reasoning tasks including diagnosis, design, and temporal and spatial reasoning. The constraint paradigm can be considered a generalization of propositional logic, in that variables may be assigned values from a set with any number of elements <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>true</b> and false. This flexibility in the number of values can improve the ease and naturalness with which interesting problems are modeled. [...] ...|$|R
