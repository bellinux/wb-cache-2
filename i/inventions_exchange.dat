Argonne National Laboratory is operated by the University of Chicago for the U. S. Department of Energy...|$|E
5000|$|Frank {{participates in}} the weekly <b>invention</b> <b>exchanges</b> that are {{primarily}} {{a feature of the}} Joel Robinson years. His first invention was a rip-off of Joel's invention, the BGC-1.9 drum machine. He repeated his thievery by introducing the [...] "Cheese Phone", which Joel had supposedly recorded in his notes from the 1970s. Unlike Forrester (who rarely even remembered Crow and Servo's names), Frank took a liking to Joel (and later Mike) and the 'Bots, who reciprocated his friendship.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his tenure}} as the show's host, Nelson {{terminated}} the <b>invention</b> <b>exchanges</b> (last exchange during episode 519, Outlaw) and letter readings (episode 705, Escape 2000) that were {{a staple of the}} show's first five years, ending some popular traditions but giving the writers much more freedom in creating the opening and closing sketches. As co-star and writer Kevin Murphy explained, Nelson was many things [...] "but he's not a tinkerer"; the <b>invention</b> <b>exchanges</b> had in any case been vehicles for Joel to engage in the sort of prop-based comedy he had specialised in before MST3K, and Nelson's strengths lay more in the portrayal of comic characters. Unlike Joel, who was resigned to his fate at being stranded in space, Mike is more desperate and proactive in trying to escape, making wild attempts during his run of the show. At one point, after seeing a bad Joe Don Baker film, he assumed he would leave as Joel did and boxed himself in a case of Hamdingers (a sort of spam sandwich). However, what he thought was an escape pod was in fact the ship's water heater.|$|R
50|$|While {{working at}} Gizmonic Institute, Forrester and his assistant, (Dr. Laurence Earhardt from K-01 {{to the end}} of Season One, at which point he was {{replaced}} by TV's Frank without explanation) sent Joel cheesy movies which he was forced to watch, in order to find a movie that would drive people mad and allow him to take over the world. In response, Joel built several robot friends to keep him company, and keep himself from being driven mad. Joel, Crow T. Robot, and Tom Servo mocked each of the movies they were forced to watch. During Joel's time on MST3K, Forrester participated in <b>Invention</b> <b>Exchanges</b> with Joel and the 'bots. He would show his invention, then Joel would show his invention.|$|R
2500|$|Hodgson {{aimed to}} follow in the pattern of what made for fan-favorite episodes from the {{original}} series, borrowing equally from the Joel and Mike eras; he noted there were about thirty episodes that he and fans universally agreed were the show's best, and expects to use these as templates as the basis of the new show. The new episodes include the <b>Invention</b> <b>Exchange</b> that {{had been part of the}} Joel era of the show. Additionally, while not required by the streaming format of Netflix, the new episodes include bumpers that would have wrapped around commercial breaks if shown on network television; Hodgson considered these breaks necessary as a [...] "palate cleanser" [...] as well as to support the narrative for Kinga attempting to commercialize on the MST3K brand.|$|R
5000|$|Filippo Brunelleschi, famous Florentine {{architect}} and engineer, who claimed ownership over engineering techniques against [...] "corporatist interests and monopoly of the guilds." [...] In 1421, he effectively obtained a patent for a cargo boat. The Republic of Florence granted him a three-year exclusive right on his <b>invention</b> in <b>exchange</b> for disclosing {{it to the}} public.|$|R
50|$|Athenaeus {{described}} {{what may be}} considered the first patents (i.e. exclusive right granted by a government to an inventor to practice his/her <b>invention</b> in <b>exchange</b> for disclosure of the invention). He mentions that in 500 BC, in the Greek city of Sybaris (located {{in what is now}} southern Italy), there were annual culinary competitions. The victor was given the exclusive right to prepare his dish for one year.|$|R
5000|$|Joel's {{tenure as}} host {{was marked by}} [...] "invention exchanges", where Joel and his mad {{scientist}} tormentors {{would come up with}} wacky inventions in a contest with each other. These sketches were a good match for Hodgson, who {{began his career as a}} prop comic; indeed, many of the inventions were items originally found in his standup act. The gag remained during early episodes with the show's second host, but was quickly done away with (since the writers wanted to focus on Mike's strengths in portraying comic characters), as were any references to Gizmonic Institute, which Hodgson owned the rights to. The in-show reasoning behind the disposal of <b>invention</b> <b>exchanges</b> was that they were part of Gizmonic corporate culture, which Mike (having never worked at the Institute) knew nothing of. Another change was the relationship between host and bots; whereas Joel was more of a parental authority figure to Crow and Servo (in keeping with his status as their creator), the pair treated Mike more as a peer, occasionally subjecting him to pranks which they never would have considered playing on Joel.|$|R
5000|$|Henry II {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} publishing the description of an invention {{in the form of}} a patent. The idea was to require an inventor to disclose his <b>invention</b> in <b>exchange</b> for monopoly rights to the patent. The description is called a patent “specification”. The first patent specification was submitted by the inventor Abel Foullon for [...] "Usaige & Description de l'holmetre" [...] (a type of rangefinder). Publication was delayed until after the patent expired in 1561.|$|R
50|$|Australian {{patent law}} is law {{governing}} {{the granting of}} a temporary monopoly {{on the use of}} an <b>invention,</b> in <b>exchange</b> for the publication and free use of the invention after a certain time. The primary piece of legislation is the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). Patents are administered by the Commonwealth Government agency IP Australia. Australia is a member state of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and compliant with Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). This makes Australian patent law broadly comparable with patent law in other major countries (see Patent).|$|R

40|$|Many {{emerging}} {{economies are}} dangling the patent system to stimulate bio-technological innovations {{with the ultimate}} premise that these will improve their economic and social growth. The patent system mandates full disclosure of the patented <b>invention</b> in <b>exchange</b> of a temporary exclusive patent right. Recently, however, patent offices have fallen short of complying with such a mandate, especially for genetic inventions. Most patent offices provide only static information about disclosed patent sequences and even some do not {{keep track of the}} sequence listing data in their own database. The successful partnership of QUT Library and Cambia exemplifies advocacy in Open Access, Open Innovation and User Participation. The library extends its services to various departments within the university, builds and encourages research networks to complement skills needed to make a contribution in the real world. ...|$|R
5000|$|Seth Brundle, a {{brilliant}} but eccentric scientist, meets Veronica Quaife, a science journalist, {{at a press}} event. He takes her back to his warehouse home and laboratory and shows her his invention: a set of [...] "telepods" [...] that allows instantaneous teleportation from one pod to another. Seth convinces Veronica to keep the <b>invention</b> secret in <b>exchange</b> for exclusive rights to the story, and she begins to document his work. Although the telepods can transport inanimate objects, they mutilate live tissue, as is demonstrated when a baboon is turned inside-out during an experiment.|$|R
40|$|Congress {{recently}} enacted {{legislation that}} provides for Statutory Invention Registration (SIR) {{as an alternative}} for an inventor who {{does not want to}} obtain a patent. To obtain a SIR, an inventor must file a complete application for a patent accompanied by a waiver of the rights obtained under a patent grant. This waiver of rights takes effect when the SIR is published and leaves the inventor with only defensive protection. The inventor completely loses his offensive rights, i. e., the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the <b>invention.</b> In <b>exchange</b> for an inventor 2 ̆ 7 s right to exploit his invention, the SIR program provides the inventor with an abbreviated prosecution process which is more expedient and less costly. The SIR program also replaces the Patent and Trademark Office 2 ̆ 7 s (PTO) Defensive Publication Program, and provides an effective reference date equal to the date the SIR application is filed instead of the date the SIR is published. The SIR program will, therefore, be of considerable benefit to governmental agencies and organizations who publish research results for defensive purposes, but of little benefit to individuals and organizations who seek commercial profit from their inventions...|$|R
40|$|A bedrock {{principle}} of patent law {{is that an}} applicant must sufficiently disclose the <b>invention</b> in <b>exchange</b> {{for the right to}} exclude. The essential facet of the disclosure requirement is enablement, which compels a patent applicant to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art (PHOSITA) how to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation. Enablement problems may arise when the applicant claims an invention broadly with a dearth of supporting data or examples. This is problematic in unpredictable fields like chemistry because a PHOSITA often needs a specific and detailed teaching in order to practice the full scope of the claimed invention. Yet the current patent examination framework allows a patentee to obtain a broad claim encompassing millions of compounds enabled by a trivial amount of supporting disclosure. The problem here is that undue patent scope can have a chilling effect on other scientists who are trying to elucidate how to make and use the claimed invention while the inventor does not know how to do so. In an effort to bridge the disconnect between patent law and the experimental sciences, I propose a new approach to the prima facie case of nonenablement for patent applications in the unpredictable arts. After examining the PHOSITA's role in the enablement analysis, I elucidate the problems with the current framework for the enablement inquiry, propose a new framework, and explain why it mitigates problems with the current framework. I conclude by discussing some of the concerns that accompany the new framework and explain how the proposal mitigates these concerns...|$|R

40|$|A patent is a {{contract}} between the inventor and the state, granting {{a limited time}} period to the inventor to exploit his <b>invention.</b> In <b>exchange,</b> the inventor must put {{a detailed description of}} his invention in the public domain. Patents can encourage innovation and economic growth but at the time of economic crisis patents can hamper such growth. The long duration of the application process is a big obstacle {{that needs to be addressed}} to maximize the benefit of patents on innovation and economy. This time can be significantly improved by changing the way we search the patent and non-patent literature. Despite the recent advancement of general information retrieval and the revolution of Web Search engines, there is still a huge gap between the emerging technologies from the research labs and adapted by major Internet search engines, and the systems which are in use by the patent search communities. In this thesis we investigate the problem of patent prior art search in patent retrieval with the goal of finding documents which describe the idea of a query patent. A query patent is a full patent application composed of hundreds of terms which does not represent a single focused information need. Other relevance evidences (e. g. classification tags, and bibliographical data) provide additional details about the underlying information need of the query patent. The first goal of this thesis is to estimate a uni-gram query model from the textual fields of a query patent. We then improve the initial query representation using noun phrases extracted from the query patent. We show that expansion in a query-dependent manner is useful. The second contribution of this thesis is to address the term mismatch problem from a query formulation point of view by integrating multiple relevance evidences associated with the query patent. To do this, we enhance the initial representation of the query with the term distribution of the community of inventors related to the topic of the query patent. We then build a lexicon using classification tags and show that query expansion using this lexicon and considering proximity information (between query and expansion terms) can improve the retrieval performance. We perform an empirical evaluation of our proposed models on two patent datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed models can achieve significantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models...|$|R
40|$|The German law on employees' inventions {{requires}} {{employees to}} report to their employer any invention made in relation with the work contract. An employer claiming the right to the invention is obliged to pay a compensation to the employee. Up to now, this compensation {{is a matter of}} negotiations. A reform proposal seeks to introduce a combination of a fixed payment and a share of the project value. Regulations like this can also be found at U. S. universities. Up to now, German scholars enjoyed the privilege of not having to report their inventions to their universities. The new German law concerning inventions made by university scholars has abolished this privilege. Universities now have the right to claim the <b>invention</b> in <b>exchange</b> for a mandatory 30 -percent share of the project value. Our model draws on Principal-Agent theory and combines elements of moral hazard and hold-up. We derive a unique efficient payment scheme that consists only of a lump-sum payment. We show that freedom to negotiate over the compensation after the invention has been done provides inefficient incentives. Efficient incentives would require the compensation to be fixed ex-ante, as it is provided by both the proposed law (concerning employees in general) and the new law (concerning university scholars). However, both set the payment schemes in an inefficient way. With suboptimal incentives to spend effort into inventions, the government's goal, {{an increase in the number}} of patents, is likely to be missed. Dieser Beitrag befa sich mit der geplanten und zum Teil schon verwirklichten Reform des Gesetzes Arbeitnehmererfindungen (ArbEG). Im Mittelpunkt steht die bisher in der Literatur wenig beachtete Analyse der Anreize, die sich aus der Zahlung einer Verg durch den Arbeitgeber ergeben. Art und H 6 he der Verg beeinflussen sowohl das Anstrengungsniveau des Arbeitnehmers bei der Erstellung, als auch das des Arbeitgebers bei der Verwertung der Erfindung. Unsere Analyse basiert auf einem einfachen Prinzipal-Agenten-Modell und verbindet Aspekte des Moral Hazard mit der Hold-Up-Problematik. Es werden zwei Szenarien vorgestellt, die sich bez des Zeitpunktes und der Art der Festlegung der Verg unterscheiden. Es wird ein eindeutiges effizientes Ergebnis hergeleitet: Die Verg von Arbeitnehmererfindungen sollte sich auf die einmalige Zahlung einer festen Verg beschr 4 nken, die ex ante festzulegen ist.
