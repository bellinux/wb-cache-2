The dissent argued that it was not fair to have the entire burden of preserving Grand Central fall on its owners.

Special formal halls are organised for events such as Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.|$|E
25|$|Latter-day Saints {{believe that}} one of the most {{important}} aspects of life on Earth <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> for individuals to learn and grow.

25|$|Within the {{hypothesis}} of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> of {{a huge number of}} theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle, actually a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. Such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles which would have allowed Darwinian natural selection.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to win another trophy. When you play against good teams {{you have to do}} your best. I am not thinking about the past and that we won the Champions League." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{corporations}} happily publicized {{the efforts}} of these “literary mill girls”, boasting {{that they were the}} “most superior class of factory operative,” which greatly impressed foreign visitors to Lowell. But this masked the bitter opposition of many workers to the twelve to fourteen hours of monotonous, exhausting work, which they saw was corrosive to their desire to learn and educate themselves. “Who,” asked an operative writing in the Voice, “after thirteen hours of steady application to monotonous work, can sit down and apply her mind to deep and long continued thought? …Where <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> for mental improvement?” ...|$|E

[...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E

500|$|The {{slope of}} the production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) at any given point is called the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). The slope defines {{the rate at which}} production of one good can be redirected (by reallocation of productive resources) into production of the other. It is also called the (marginal) [...] "opportunity cost" [...] of a commodity, that is, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> cost of X in terms of Y at the margin. It measures how much of good Y is given up for one more unit of good X or vice versa. The shape of a PPF is commonly drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good. Thus, MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF.|$|E
500|$|Ferber was {{at first}} shocked that {{anyone would want to}} adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern {{that he did not want}} to adapt it as the typical {{frivolous}} [...] "girlie" [...] show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work. Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, [...] "This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> of my life..."Show Boat, with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it [...] "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Bart on the Road" [...] is an episode which is built upon a [...] "frankly ludicrous" [...] idea which if the writers were to [...] "stumble upon" [...] now, [...] "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup {{a great deal of}} consideration {{both on and off the}} screen." [...] He thought the story was [...] "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." [...] Foster thinks, [...] "what saves the episode <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he [...] "loves" [...] the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, [...] "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: [...] "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and summarizing his review with: [...] ""Bart on the Road" [...] is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable." ...|$|E
