5|$|Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US8) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was {{a locally}} {{maintained}} business loop highway routing through the {{central business district}} of the city. The route was designated when US8 was shifted to a bypass of <b>downtown</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s. The former routing of US8 through the area {{was turned over to}} the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the main highway south of town. The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH-P.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the MSHD signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, and the east–west highway through Port Huron {{was part of the}} {{original}} M-19, and the north–south highway was part of the original M-27. M-21 was extended over M-19 into Port Huron by 1924. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO, and the new US25 replaced M-27 in the area. In 1964, a section of I-94 in the Port Huron area was completed. The former route of US25 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US25 when the main highway was shifted out to the freeway. The first freeway segment of M-21 was built into the Port Huron area in 1966; the freeway directly tied into the western end of the old route into <b>downtown.</b> <b>In</b> 1973, US25 was decommissioned in the state, and the former Bus. US25 was renumbered BL I-94. The remaining segment of freeway along the M-21 corridor opened in 1984 as I-69; after this freeway opened, M-21 was shortened to Flint, and the former M-21 in Port Huron became Business SpurI-69. To connect back to I-69, the business route was extended northward along BL I-94 when that highway was designated through <b>downtown</b> <b>in</b> 1986.|$|E

5|$|Mass transit in Lethbridge {{consists}} of 40buses (with {{an average age}} of 10years) operating on more than a dozen routes. Traditionally, bus routes in the city started and ended <b>downtown.</b> <b>In</b> the early 21st century, however, Lethbridge Transit introduced cross-town and shuttle routes, such as University of Lethbridge to Lethbridge College, University of Lethbridge to the North Lethbridge terminal, and Lethbridge College to the North Lethbridge terminal. Several routes converge near the Chinook Regional Hospital, although it is not officially a terminal.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1960s and {{following}} the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began {{to move away from}} <b>downtown</b> <b>in</b> favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985.|$|E

5|$|An {{expressway}} through Isabella and Clare counties {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Clare to the east. The former route of US27 along McEwan Street and Clare Avenue was designated Bus. US27 at this time. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US10 was rerouted along the US27 freeway to connect {{from the new}} bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US10 at this time, running along Bus. US27 to connect to US27/US10 north of <b>downtown.</b> <b>In</b> 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway16 (Bus. US16) was a {{business}} route in the Grand Rapids area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US16 around the southern and western sides {{of the city in}} 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into <b>downtown.</b> <b>In</b> downtown Grand Rapids, Bus. US16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East Grand Rapids. There the loop followed Cascade Road into Cascade Township where it reconnected to US16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US16 lasted until 1962 when US16 was decommissioned in Michigan.|$|E

5|$|Half a {{mile from}} the start of the bypass and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a four-way intersection. Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into <b>downtown,</b> <b>in</b> this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs the bypass, following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 bypass of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits.|$|E

5|$|Railroad {{stations}} have been located in downtown Pittsfield since the Western Railroad opened in 1841.

A second, larger union station replaced it in 1914. The New Haven Railroad and New York Central Railroad moved to smaller depots in 1960 and 1965, and Union Station was demolished in 1968. Rail service to Pittsfield ended in 1971 but returned in 1975 {{and moved to a}} new shelter <b>downtown</b> <b>in</b> 1981.
