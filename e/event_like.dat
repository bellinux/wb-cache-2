5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An <b>event</b> <b>like</b> take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contests}} between {{animals are}} now regarded as sports for example, horse racing {{is regarded as}} both a sport and {{an important source of}} entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual <b>event.</b> <b>Like</b> horse racing, camel racing requires human riders, while greyhound racing does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like cockroaches.|$|E

30|$|Event {{filtration}} {{is applied}} to remove dull <b>events</b> <b>like</b> just passing {{the ball on the}} ground, audience views etc. After obtaining meaningful events, event categorization {{is applied to}} separate out high-impact and low-impact classes of events. High-impact class of events is lengthy as well as involve more view transitions. High-impact class consists of <b>events</b> <b>like</b> goal, injury, player exchange etc. while low-impact class consists of <b>events</b> <b>like</b> goal attacks or corner and other <b>events</b> <b>like</b> throw in, offside etc.|$|R

25|$|A {{constraint}} can {{be caused}} when a particular branch of a network reaches its thermal limit or when a potential overload will occur due to a contingent event (e.g., failure of a generator or transformer or a line outage) on {{another part of the}} network. The latter is referred to as a security constraint. Transmission systems are operated to allow for continuity of supply even if a contingent <b>event,</b> <b>like</b> the loss of a line, were to occur. This is known as a security constrained system.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the NDP {{was held at the}} National Stadium (for the first time) in 1976, the NDP Guard of Honour, {{composed}} of officers and personnel of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force made its first appearance, followed after the parade proper by the very first evening presentations by various groups, a prelude to future evening NDPs in 1980 and from 1984 onward. 1977's parade was a decentralized <b>event</b> <b>like</b> two years before (and like 1968's was damped by the rain) while 1978 would see the parade back at the Padang grounds. 1979's parade was yet another decentralized one, held in several high schools and sports stadiums nationwide.|$|E
25|$|For skiers {{with visual}} {{impairment}}s, guides {{are used to}} assist the skier down the course. Guides are skiers {{who do not have}} a vision impairment who assist a skier down the slopes by telling the skier where to go using their voice or a radio. Skiers can use more than one guide {{in the course of a}} competition, but the guide is only eligible for a medal if they have competed with the same skier for the duration of the discipline <b>event.</b> <b>Like</b> the skier, the guide is required to have an IPCAS Licence in order to participate in a competition and adhere to anti-doping rules.|$|E
25|$|The {{impaired}} {{functioning of}} autobiographical memory due to damage or disease can have profound effects on an individual's episodic memory. This can skew an individual's lifespan retrieval curve and influence {{the presentation of}} the reminiscence bump. Memories an individual has for personal life events can show a different pattern than the average individual if they have brain damage caused by an <b>event</b> <b>like</b> an accident, a blow to the head or disease. For these individuals with brain damage, the lifespan retrieval curve can look different. An example of this is an individual having the reminiscence bump between the age of 5 and 13 rather than 10 to 30, which is the pattern for the average individual.|$|E

25|$|A {{survey by}} the {{government}} of the damage done found that few buildings from one to five stories suffered serious damage; the same was true for buildings over fifteen stories. When the buildings were built seemed to have an effect as well. Before the 1957 earthquake, there were no building codes with respect to earthquake resistance. Some regulations were passed in that year and more in 1976 after another, stronger earthquake shook the city. However, none of these regulations had an <b>event</b> <b>like</b> 1985's in mind when passed. Most of the seriously damaged buildings were built between 1957 and 1976, when the city was starting to build upwards, in the six-to-fifteen floor range. In second place were buildings from before 1957, possibly because they were weakened by the earlier earthquakes. Structures built between 1976 and 1985 suffered the least damage.|$|E
25|$|The light cone has an {{essential}} role within the concept of causality. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time ofnbsp&O to the position and time of D (Fig.nbsp&2‑4). It is hence possible for eventnbsp&O to have a causal influence on eventnbsp&D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, {{it is possible for}} a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any <b>event,</b> <b>like</b> e.g.nbsp&B ornbsp&C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either effect eventnbsp&O, nor can they be affected by eventnbsp&O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between eventnbsp&O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an <b>event</b> <b>like</b> a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E

500|$|The {{publication}} of the leaked material, particularly the diplomatic cables, attracted in-depth coverage worldwide, with several governments blocking websites that contained embarrassing details. Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said: [...] "I can't think {{of a time when}} there was ever a story generated by a news organisation where the White House, the Kremlin, Chávez, India, China, everyone in the world was talking about these things. ... I've never known a story that created such mayhem that wasn't an <b>event</b> <b>like</b> a war or a terrorist attack." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} a women's race that took place {{as part of the}} Tour de Yorkshire event. This took place {{on the second day of}} the men's race over four laps of the [...] route around York that was also the final part of the men's racing that day. Lizzie Armitstead, who did not compete in the event due to a {{conflicting}} event in Europe, expressed a hope that the women's race in future would be a three-day <b>event</b> <b>like</b> the men's race. The women's race was won by Louse Mahé (Ikon-Mazada) in a sprint finish.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} year since 1927 that the main race was not covered in full {{on any of the}} BBC's {{national}} radio networks. [...] Its 4.15pm start coincided with the conclusion of the FA Cup semi-finals, and it had been decided that the rowing would be broadcast in full on the BBC World Service and BBC Radio Oxford only. [...] Commentator John Snagge who had described every race since 1931 was disappointed: [...] "I {{do not want to be}} unreasonable but I am a little surprised that for an <b>event</b> <b>like</b> the Boat Race, with its tradition and history, the BBC cannot find 20 minutes on one of its four networks to carry it in full." ...|$|E

500|$|Researchers {{from the}} University of California, Santa Barbara began {{collecting}} samples {{within hours of}} the spill to monitor the impact on the marine environment. Researchers and volunteers returned to the area many times to collect additional samples. Since students and researchers had previously used this area for study purposes, baseline data was available. David Valentine, a professor in the university’s Department of Earth Science said, “The discharge of heavy oil at Refugio presents a unique opportunity to discover novel metabolic, genomic and ecological feedbacks among marine microbial communities, heavy oil and ecosystem response. We have the opportunity to study ecosystem changes and microbial reactions from the very early stages through an entire year. It’s really rare for scientists to get day zero access to any sort of <b>event</b> <b>like</b> this.” ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Raimi and Campbell, {{film critics}} were largely dismissive of the film. A writer for Time Out gave a {{negative}} review, writing [...] "despite its ambition and a Coen Brothers script credit, Raimi's second film {{was a disappointment}} after his astonishing debut The Evil Dead." [...] The writer did however compliment some of the set pieces featured in the film, ultimately commenting that only people interested in the early work by Raimi would be interested. Film Junk writer Sean Harley commented that the main appeal {{of the film is}} that it was directed and written by notable artists, insisting [...] "based on their impressive filmographies and the cult followings that both have amassed, a collaboration of this magnitude would be a cinematic <b>event</b> <b>like</b> no other." [...] However, he commented that the film was a disappointment, noting that fans of the films by Raimi could likely enjoy it. He summarized that the film was [...] "not a particularly brilliant movie, and it's easily one of the weakest projects that any of these great filmmakers have been involved in", giving it a weak recommendation.|$|E
500|$|Arcade Fire {{also contributed}} to the movie's {{original}} score, The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled [...] "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. [...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there’s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It’s like the Capitol’s idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting <b>event</b> <b>like</b> the [...] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, [...] "'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem." ...|$|E
