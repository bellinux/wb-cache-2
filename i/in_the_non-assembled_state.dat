40|$|A new triacid {{scaffold}} {{is described}} {{based on the}} cone-shaped cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) molecule that facilitates the triple helical folding of peptides containing either a unique blood platelet binding collagen sequence or collagen peptides composed of Pro-Hyp-Gly repeats. The latter were synthesized by segment condensation using Fmoc-Pro-Hyp-Gly-OH. Peptides were coupled to this CTV scaffold and also coupled to the Kemp's triacid (KTA) scaffold. After assembly of peptide H-Gly-[Pro-Hyp-Gly] 2 -Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu(OAll) -Arg-Gly-Val-Glu(OAll) -Gly-[Pro-Hyp-Gly] 2 -NH 2 (13) by an orthogonal synthesis strategy to both triacid scaffolds, followed by deprotection of the allyl groups, the molecular constructs spontaneously folded into a triple helical structure. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> <b>non-assembled</b> peptides did not. The melting temperature (Tm) of (+/−) CTV[CH 2 C(O) N(H) Gly-[Pro-Hyp-Gly] 2 -Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly-Val-Glu-Gly-[Pro-Hyp-Gly] 2 -NH 2] 3 (14) is 19 [*]°C, whereas KTA[Gly-Gly-[Pro-Hyp-Gly] 2 -Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly-Val-Glu-Gly-[Pro-Hyp-Gly] 2 -NH 2] 3 (15) has a Tm of 20 [*]°C. Thus, it was shown {{for the first time}} that scaffolds were also effective <b>in</b> stabilizing <b>the</b> triple helix of native collagen sequences. The different stabilizing properties of the two CTV enantiomers could be measured after coupling of racemic CTV triacid to the collagen peptide, and subsequent chromatographic separation of the diastereomers. After assembly of the two chiral CTV scaffolds to the model peptide H-Gly-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly) 5 -NH 2 (24), the (+) -enantiomer of CTV 28 [*]b was found to serve as a better triple helix-inducing scaffold than the (−) -enantiomer 28 [*]a. In addition to an effect of the chirality of the CTV scaffold, a certain degree of flexibility between the CTV cone and the folded peptide was also shown to be of importance. Restricting the flexibility from two to one glycine residues resulted in a significant difference between the two collagen mimics 20 [*]a and 20 [*]b, whereas the difference was only slight when two glycine residues were present between the CTV scaffold and <b>the</b> peptide sequence <b>in</b> collagen mimics 30 [*]a and 30 [*]b...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe found {{conditions}} {{to obtain the}} Leu- 169 → Arg mutant of human ferritin H chain in a stable and <b>non-assembled</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> protein obtained is an oligomer of subunits {{with a high degree}} of structured conformation, and when concentrated it re-assembles into ferritin cages. Functional studies showed that (i) it promotes iron oxidation like the assembled ferritin, but at slower rate, (ii) it is readily precipitated by the oxidised iron unless apotransferrin or L-chain ferritin are added to sequester Fe(III). The results confirm that ferroxidase activity is located within the H-chain, and indicate that the cages of the fully assembled ferritins are important not only in maintaining iron in a soluble form, but also <b>in</b> eliciting <b>the</b> activity of the ferroxidase centres...|$|R
3000|$|Strategy E 1 is {{the most}} basic one; this {{strategy}} is studied in [10] and, in that work, it is known as <b>the</b> <b>non-assembling</b> (NA) strategy. Strategy E 2 is also proposed in [10] to improve system performance. Strategy E 2 is characterized by using spectrum adaptation. Also, under strategy E 2, interrupted secondary calls are selected randomly among data and voice calls (that is, the selective interruption mechanism is not considered), no buffer is used for exploiting the elasticity of the data traffic, and neither channel reservation nor double preemptive mechanisms are considered. Strategy E 3 represents the reference strategy, {{and it is also}} the most complete strategy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense that it employs most of the mechanisms to improve <b>the</b> QoS <b>in</b> CR networks. Strategies E 4 and E 5 represent two alternatives of our reference E 3 strategy (for instance, from Table  2, it is observed that strategy E 4 considers channel reservation for ongoing secondary calls and does not consider the use of a buffer for new data calls). To finely control the different performance metrics, strategy E 4 considers fractional channel reservation. Thus, to reserve, on average, a real number r [...]...|$|R
40|$|Microtubule protein {{preparations}} purified by {{cycles of}} assembly-disassembly contain the enzyme tubulinyltyrosine carboxypeptidase (TTCPase). Using these preparations, containing tubulinyl[14 C]tyrosine, we studied {{the release of}} [14 C]tyrosine from assembled and non-assembled tubulin under steady-state conditions. It was found that both states of aggregation were detyrosinated at similar rates {{by the action of}} the endogenous TTCPase. However, practically no release of [14 C]tyrosine from <b>the</b> <b>non-assembled</b> tubulin pool was found when microtubules were previously eliminated from the incubation mixture. These results indicated that non-assembled tubulin requires to interact with microtubules to be detyrosinated. This interaction seems to occur through the incorporation of dimers into microtubules, since when the capability of tubulin to incorporate into microtubules was diminished by binding of colchicine a concomitant decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rate of release of tyrosine was observed. When detyrosination was accelerated by increasing the concentration of TTCPase relative to the microtubule protein concentration, microtubules were found to be detyrosinated faster than was non-assembled tubulin. Using exogenous TTCPase in an incubation system <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> formation of microtubules was not allowed, tubulinyl[14 C]tyrosine and tubulinyl[14 C]tyrosine-colchicine complex were shown to have similar capabilities to act as substrates for this enzyme.

40|$|The biosynthesis, {{assembly}} and secretion of fibrinogen were investigated in cultured rat hepatocytes which were incubated with [35 S]methionine. When initial {{rates of the}} synthesis of three fibrinogen subunits were compared, the A alpha-subunit {{was found to be}} synthesized significantly slower than the B beta- and gamma-subunits. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the secreted fibrinogen contained different proportions of the newly synthesized subunits, depending upon the chase times. Radioactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> A alpha subunit, which initially had the highest level of the three, was rapidly decreased <b>in</b> parallel with <b>the</b> chase time. The gamma-subunit had an increasing amount of <b>the</b> radioactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secreted molecule during the chase periods, whereas that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> B beta-subunit was gradually decreased at the later stages of chase. Analysis of intracellular components of fibrinogen confirmed that the nascent A alpha-subunit was most rapidly exhausted, and the gamma-subunit occupied the largest proportion among <b>the</b> <b>non-assembled</b> subunits at later stages of chase. Taken together, these results suggest that the synthesis of A alpha-subunit, which has the lowest rate, could be <b>the</b> rate-limiting step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production and secretion of fibrinogen in cultured rat hepatocytes, in contrast with what has been proposed for human and rabbit fibrinogen, namely that the synthesis of B beta-subunit is the rate-limiting step.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to inform {{researchers}} and practitioners about the fuzzy front-end (FFE) of <b>the</b> innovation process <b>in</b> process firms. Design/methodology/approach – A multiple case study of four process firms was conducted, with a total of 64 semi-structured interviews. Findings – The paper gives new insights into <b>the</b> FFE <b>in</b> <b>non-assembled</b> product and process development <b>in</b> process firms. <b>The</b> FFE of <b>non-assembled</b> product and process development is first conceptualized and key activities are identified. Further, how the strong relationship between product and process development can be managed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FFE is discussed. Research limitations/implications – All four firms are from the mineral and metals industry, prompting caution when generalizing the results to other contexts. This research offers insights about <b>the</b> FFE <b>in</b> process firms. Theoretical implications are added to the existing literature on the FFE and general process development literature, and the paper increases our understanding of innovation management in general. Practical implications – From a practical point of view, the paper gives advice on how managers in process firms can increase speed and clarity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FFE. The conceptualizations and the identified front-end key activities are suggested as checklists for improving the FFE stage. Originality/value – This study compares how the FFE within two different types of innovations is conceptualized and managed.

40|$|Abstract Background Nothofagus nervosa {{is one of}} {{the most}} emblematic native tree species of Patagonian {{temperate}} forests. Here, the shotgun RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the transcriptome of N. nervosa, including de novo assembly, functional annotation, and in silico discovery of potential molecular markers to support population and associations genetic studies, are described. Results Pyrosequencing of a young leaf cDNA library generated a total of 111, 814 high quality reads, with an average length of 447 bp. De novo assembly using Newbler resulted into 3, 005 tentative isotigs (including alternative transcripts). <b>The</b> <b>non-assembled</b> sequences (singletons) were clustered with CD-HIT- 454 to identify natural and artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads, leading to 21, 881 unique singletons. 15, 497 out of 24, 886 non-redundant sequences or unigenes, were successfully annotated against a plant protein database. A substantial number of simple sequence repeat markers (SSRs) were discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assembled and annotated sequences. More than 40 % of the SSR sequences were inside ORF sequences. To confirm the validity of these predicted markers, a subset of 73 SSRs selected through functional annotation evidences were successfully amplified from six seedlings DNA samples, being 14 polymorphic. Conclusions This paper is the first report that shows a highly precise representation of the mRNAs diversity present in young leaves of a native South American tree, N. nervosa, as well as its in silico deduced putative functionality. The reported Nothofagus transcriptome sequences represent a unique resource for genetic studies and provide a tool to discover genes of interest and genetic markers that will greatly aid questions involving evolution, ecology, and conservation using genetic and genomic approaches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric {{micelles}} (PMs) {{composed of}} self-assembled amphiphilic block copolymers were synthesized from vinylbenzyl thymine (VBT) and vinylbenzyl triethylammonium chloride (VBA) exhibiting improved physical stability. Three diblock copolymers of different chemical compositions and similar molecular weights (polydispersities below 1. 5) were obtained via nitroxide mediated radical polymerization. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) {{was determined by}} dye micellization method, the shift of the absorption peak of the anionic (EY) due to <b>the</b> interactions with <b>non-assembled</b> chains and auto-assembled copolymers was followed. Polymeric systems exhibited good stability revealing that {{a higher proportion of}} cationic monomers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diblock reduce the CMC. Furthermore, after the core of PMs was photocrosslinked by UV irradiation, the CMC decreases notably.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{hundreds}} of mitochondrial proteins are nuclear encoded and are synthesised on cytosolic polyribosomes as precursor proteins. Most of these precursors contain an N-terminal extension called presequence which functions as targeting signal {{and which is}} cleaved off after import. Despite {{the fact that there}} are no sequence similarities and no consensus for <b>the</b> cleavage site <b>in</b> mitochondrial presequences, cleavage of almost all presequences is catalysed by a single, highly specific metalloendopeptidase, called general mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). MPP in plants is integrated into the bc 1, complex of the respiratory chain and both subunits, α-MPP and β-MPP, are identical to the core proteins of the complex. Despite the fact that the bc 1 complex in plants is bifunctional, catalysing both electron transport and protein processing, these two functions are distinct. MPP belongs to the Pitrilysin family of peptidases, characterised by a zinc binding motif, HXXEH 74 – 76 E, involved <b>in</b> catalysis. Both <b>the</b> membrane-bound integrated MPP/bc 1 complex of plants and the soluble mammalian MPP recognise similar higher-order structural elements upstream from the cleavage site that are important for processing. The secondary structure with flexibility and stabilising elements, hydrofobicity, charge and length seem to influence the interaction with MPP. <b>The</b> newly imported <b>non-assembled</b> precursor inside mitochondria is degraded by a proteinase that is distinct from MPP or any other previously characterised proteinases, a novel ATP-dependent, membrane-associated serine-type proteinase...|$|R
