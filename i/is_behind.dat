5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female.

A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E

5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored.

The ovaries are primitive {{in that they}} are polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E
