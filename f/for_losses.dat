5|$|Shirayuki {{handed over}} the rescued seamen to troops on Endau the {{following}} day. They were never seen again, but {{are believed to have}} been executed in retaliation <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion, which occurred south of Mersing {{about the same time as}} the naval action off Endau. Davies, four other officers, and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore and made their way to Singapore, together with shot down aircrew.|$|E
5|$|Although Florida outgained the Crimson Tide {{in total}} offense 281 to 273 yards, their three {{turnovers}} resulted in 21 Alabama points. In addition to Mosley, Nico Johnson intercepted Trey Burton {{in the end zone}} and Dre Kirkpatrick intercepted a John Brantley pass. The game marked the first time Florida had been held without a touchdown since their previous visit to Tuscaloosa in 2005, and resulted in Alabama leading the nation in scoring defense by allowing only 45 points through five games. Courtney Upshaw was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week after making seven total tackles, with four <b>for</b> <b>losses,</b> a fumble recovery and two pass deflections. Chance Warmack was recognized as the SEC's Offensive Lineman of the Week for his performance. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 21–14 (22–14 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory).|$|E

5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich led {{all players}} with nine tackles. Of the nine stops, {{one and a}} half were for {{negative}} yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was Cody Grimm, who had eight tackles, two and a half of which were <b>for</b> <b>losses.</b> One and a half of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced a fumble and broke up one Boston College pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. Boston College sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States gaining {{independence}} {{after their}} American Revolutionary War, in 1784, about 10,000 United Empire Loyalists settled in Upper Canada (what is now southern Ontario), chiefly in Niagara, around the Bay of Quinte, {{and along the}} St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal. The Crown granted them land in these areas {{in order to develop}} Upper Canada and to compensate them <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> in the United States. With former First Nations lands available for purchase, these new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans, attracted by the availability of inexpensive, arable land. At the same time, large numbers of Iroquois who had been allied with Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the United States.|$|E
50|$|While {{attending}} Penn State University, Morris {{played for}} the Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 2009 to 2012.

5|$|On November21, {{insurance}} payments <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> {{were expected}} to exceed $12million. On January1, 1963, a $2million relief fund was authorized by President Kennedy. Another $5.4million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February15, 1964. The United States Congress provided Guam with $60million, including $45million through federal loans, mainly to help rebuild the territory and promote expansion of the economy. Additionally, the storm brought {{about the end of}} military security on the island, which in turn aided economic growth. Within five years of this decision, Japanese tourism to the island dramatically increased, prompting a major {{increase in the number of}} hotels. In the long term, Typhoon Karen, along with other destructive storms, shaped the development of the island's infrastructure. It led to higher quality buildings and more efficient utilities that could withstand powerful typhoons. Since Karen, most buildings on the island have been constructed with concrete and steel.|$|E
5|$|Rural {{areas in}} South Dakota are {{experiencing}} a trend of falling populations, despite an overall increase in population. The effect of rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area and the Black Hills have gained population. In fact, Lincoln County, near Sioux Falls, is the ninth fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States. The growth in these areas has compensated <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> {{in the rest of}} the state, and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E
5|$|Several Phillies hold National League {{and major}} league records. Pitcher/outfielder John Coleman {{is the most}} {{decorated}} in this category, holding three major league records, all from the franchise's inaugural season. Coleman set records <b>for</b> <b>losses,</b> earned runs allowed, and hits allowed, all in 1883 when he also set three additional franchise pitching records. Shortstop Jimmy Rollins broke Willie Wilson's record for at-bats in a single season with 716 in 2007, and first baseman Ryan Howard also set the major league record for strikeouts in a single season that same year with 199, before it was broken by Mark Reynolds of the Arizona Diamondbacks the following year. The 1930 Phillies, who went 52–102, set two more National League records, allowing 1,993 hits and 1,193 runs in the regular season.|$|E
50|$|Defense {{also was}} a staple as it {{dominated}} the Warhawks after allowing a touchdown on their opening possession. The dandy defensive effort included three interceptions, one for a touchdown, four sacks and 11 tackles <b>for</b> <b>loss.</b> Chris McCoy continued his stellar campaign with ferocious play that included three tackles <b>for</b> <b>loss.</b> Alex Suber was a defensive wizard with eight tackles, including one <b>for</b> <b>loss,</b> an interception and a pass break-up, and linebacker Danny Carmichael continued to make plays {{from one side of}} the field to the other, collecting 10 tackles including one <b>for</b> <b>loss.</b> Suber, Jeremy Kellem and Kevin Brown had the interceptions.|$|R

5|$|The U.S. had intervened {{repeatedly}} in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón {{was unwilling to}} sign a treaty before being recognized, and worked to improve the relationship between American business and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors, and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} rural flight {{has not been}} spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural {{counties}} and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. As the reservations have exercised more sovereignty, some Sioux have returned to them from urban areas. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls was the seventh fastest-growing county (by percentage) in the United States in 2010. The growth in these areas has compensated <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> {{in the rest of}} the state. South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.|$|E
5|$|The kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tennessee 17-yard line, and Tennessee's offense began work. The Volunteers were aided by a five-yard offsides penalty against Virginia Tech on the first play of the drive, but the Hokies stopped the Tennessee offense <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> or no gain until Manning threw a 14-yard pass on third down, pushing Tennessee to the 34-yard line. After two incomplete passes, Manning scrambled 27 yards for another first down, this time at the Tech 39-yard line. Once there, however, the Virginia Tech defense stiffened and did not allow another first down during the drive. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort came into the game, seemingly to attempt a 48-yard field goal. The kick {{turned out to be}} a trick play—an attempted pass by the kick holder—but Hokie defender Mike Williams tackled the holder for a loss.|$|E
50|$|As a sophomore, Sapp {{played all}} 13 games and had 52 tackles, second-most among {{defensive}} linemen. He also had 10 tackles <b>for</b> <b>loss,</b> five sacks, and 22 quarterback pressures.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} Indiana's post-touchdown kickoff to its 27-yard line, and Tech's offense {{returned to}} the field hoping to answer the Hoosiers' score. Two rushes by Thomas gave Tech a first down near the 40-yard line. Aided by a penalty against Indiana, Tech gained another first down in the Hoosiers' {{side of the field}} with a pass by DeShazo. A 15-yard late-hit penalty against Indiana gave Tech another first down and pushed the Hokies to the Indiana 31-yard line. Tech continued to drive with runs from DeShazo, Thomas, and fullback Joe Swarm. Inside the Indiana 10-yard line, Tech was stopped <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> on consecutive plays before DeShazo connected on a 14-yard touchdown pass to Thomas. The extra point was good, and with nineseconds remaining in the first quarter, Virginia Tech tied the game at 77.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{possession}} of the game began at its own 32-yard line after Louisville's post-touchdown kickoff. Tech running back Cedric Humes gained 12yards and a first down on the Hokies' first play of the game, and quarterback Marcus Vick completed a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Hyman three plays later to get another first down and drive the Hokies into Louisville territory. After Vick was stopped <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> on two consecutive rushing plays, he completed another long pass to Hyman for a first down. Subsequent plays saw Tech advance into the Louisville red zone but fail to gain another first down. Kicker Brandon Pace entered the game to attempt a 36-yard field goal kick, which was successful. With six minutes remaining in the first quarter, Tech cut Louisville's lead to 7–3.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of King CharlesII in 1660 his father's {{fortunes}} took a {{turn for}} the better, although he remained far from prosperous. In 1661, Winston became Member of Parliament for Weymouth, and as a mark of royal favour he received rewards <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> incurred fighting against the Parliamentarians during the civil war, including the appointment as a Commissioner for Irish Land Claims in Dublin in 1661. When Winston departed for Ireland the following year, John enrolled at the Dublin Free School; but by 1664, following his father's recall to the position of Junior Clerk Comptroller of the King's Household at Whitehall, John had transferred his studies to St Paul's School in London. The King's own penury meant the old Cavaliers received scant financial reward, but the prodigal monarch could offer something which would cost him nothing – positions at court for their progeny. Thus in 1665, John's sister Arabella became Maid of Honour to Anne Hyde, the Duchess of York. Some months later John, 15, joined her at court serving as page to Anne's husband, James, Duke of York, the King's brother, destined to be king himself. It was also known that John Churchill, a keen student, was educated in the University of Oxford, where he studied philosophy, classics and mathematics. He was well-educated and proficient in French, Latin, Greek and German.|$|E
