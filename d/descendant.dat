40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} if {{the different}} results {{of prostate cancer}} risk {{between black and white}} Brazilian men may be associated with the varying methodology used to define participants as either Blacks or Whites. Patients and Methods We evaluated median PSA values, rate of PSA level &# 8805; 4. 0 ng/mL, indications for prostate biopsy, prostate cancer detection rate, biopsy/cancer rate, cancer/biopsy rate, and the relative risk of cancer between blacks versus whites, blacks versus non-blacks (browns and whites), non-whites (browns and blacks) versus whites, African versus non-African <b>descendants,</b> and African <b>descendants</b> or blacks versus non-African <b>descendants</b> and non-blacks. Results From 1544 participants, there were 51. 4 % whites, 37. 2 % browns, 11. 4 % blacks, and 5. 4 % African <b>descendants.</b> Median PSA level was 0. 9 ng/mL in whites, browns, and non-African <b>descendants,</b> compared to 1. 2 ng/mL in blacks, and African <b>descendants</b> or blacks, and 1. 3 ng/mL in African <b>descendants.</b> Indications for prostate biopsy were present in 16. 9 % for African <b>descendants,</b> 15. 9 % of black, 12. 3 % of white, 11. 4 % for non-African <b>descendants,</b> and 9. 9 % of brown participants. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 30. 3 % of performed biopsies: 6. 2 % of African <b>descendants,</b> 5. 1 % of blacks, 3. 3 % of whites, 3. 0 % of non-African <b>descendants,</b> and 2. 6 % of browns. Conclusions Median PSA values were higher for Blacks versus Whites in all classification systems, except for non-white versus white men. The rate of prostate biopsy, prostate cancer detection rate, and relative risk for cancer was increased in African <b>descendants,</b> and African <b>descendants</b> or blacks, compared to non-African <b>descendants,</b> and non-African <b>descendants</b> and non-blacks, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Te Ngako (whose <b>descendants</b> are Ngāti Maru) {{was younger}} than his half-brothers Tamatepō (whose <b>descendants</b> are Ngāti Rongoū), Tamaterā (whose <b>descendants</b> are Ngāti Tamaterā) and Whanaunga (whose <b>descendants</b> are Ngāti Whanaunga). Marutūāhu married two sisters, Hineurunga and Paremoehau. Hineurunga was the tuakana (eldest sister). This gave Te Ngako the mana of being tuakana to his older brothers. Hence the name given to the <b>descendants</b> of Te Ngako was not Ngāti Te Ngako but Ngāti Maru. The Ngāti Maru of Taranaki are descended from Marutūāhu's brother Maruwharanui.

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived <b>descendant</b> group. This is especially important where the <b>descendant</b> group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
