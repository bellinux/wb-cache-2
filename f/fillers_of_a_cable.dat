40|$|Bridge {{stay cables}} are {{vulnerable}} to dynamic excitations by wind. There are different countermeasures to suppress unfavorable bridge stay cable vibrations {{and one of the}} effective countermeasures is to connect stay cables by cross-ties to form <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> network. However, the dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> network is not clearly understood and most of the current designs are based on physical tests and numerical simulations. In this thesis, an effort has been made to understand the in-plane free vibration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> network. Three analytical models have been developed to investigate the in-plane free vibration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> basic <b>cable</b> network with <b>a</b> rigid transverse cross-tie, <b>a</b> general <b>cable</b> network with <b>a</b> single line <b>of</b> rigid transverse cross-ties, and <b>a</b> basic <b>cable</b> network with <b>a</b> flexible transverse cross-tie. The key system parameters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> network have been identified, which include the segment ratio, the frequency ratio, the mass-tension ratio, the length ratio, the cross-tie flexibility parameter, and the total number of interconnected cables. Extensive parametric study has been conducted to evaluate the role of each parameter in affecting the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> network. All the analytical model results are verified by numerical simulations using the Finite Element software ABAQUS 6. 9...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of dynamical behavior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> under influence <b>of</b> various types of excitations. Such element has a low rigidity and is sensitive to dynamic effect. The structural scheme is <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> which ends are located at different level. The analysis of dynamical behavior of the cable under effect of kinematical excitation which is represented by the oscillations of the upper part of tower is given. The scheme of cable is accepted such, that lower end <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inclined <b>cable</b> is motionless. The motion of the upper end is assumed only in horizontal direction. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method was realized in software. The fast Fourier transform was used for spectral analysis. Standard graphical software was adopted for presenting results of investigations. The mathematical model <b>of</b> oscillations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> was developed by the account of the viscous damping. The analysis of dynamical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> for various parameters of damping and kinematical excitation was carried out. The time series, spectral characteristics and amplitude-frequencies characteristics was obtained. The resonance amplitude for different oscillating regimes was estimated. It is noted that increasing of the coefficient of the viscous damping and decreasing of the amplitude of tower's oscillations reduces the value of the critical frequency and the resonant amplitudes...|$|R
