5|$|There {{is not the}} {{slightest}} doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this brainy man was hoodwinked, and that his confidence was betrayed by the so-called mediums that he tested. His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist the influence.|$|E
5|$|There's no {{question}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this president and this administration {{would never have}} invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that {{was presented to the}} Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no doubt}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Adelaide {{represent}} the very nadir of the Australian tour...The reasons behind the ease of their successful loss were fourfold: unenterprising captaincy, bad England batting, a good Lillee bowling performance {{and a lack of}} penetration in the depleted touring attack.|$|E

500|$|Berg {{served on}} Princeton University's Board of Trustees from 1999 to 2003. In 2000, he began researching a {{biography}} of Woodrow Wilson, of whom Berg says, [...] "I have an image of him <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> is unlike any picture I have seen anywhere else, based on material at Princeton and 35 years of researching and thinking about him". Wilson was published on September 10, 2013.|$|E
500|$|DeConcini later {{charged that}} McCain had {{leaked to the}} press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded that McCain {{had been one of the}} main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely no doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> McCain made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography that McCain and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|E

500|$|Intra-conference {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2007, when Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "'s only got onemore year, though. He'll be there onemore year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. [...] At the Pac-10 Conference media day (July 26, 2007), Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is no question <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football"; the declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There is no doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the world was headed for grief".|$|E

2500|$|Some of Lindner’s critics {{invited him}} to join their {{upcoming}} trip to in Washington, D.C. for Holocaust Remembrance Day. Lindner said he would only consider the offer “if others pay for his trip and time off.” Lindner claimed that “no one can fully know what happened 60 years ago...” and said [...] "I just think it's strange that over 58, 60 years it's just willing to come out about that. We know there's {{been a lot of}} rewriting of history lately and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that's</b> possibly an area where that's happening." ...|$|R
500|$|Wayne Kramer, a guitarist for MC5, {{suggested}} that Hendrix {{had been set}} up as part of a wide-scale crackdown on rock musicians: [...] "I don't have any doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the right-wing government forces were behind all of that... There was an effort, a movement, to stop this threat that rock and roll represented." [...] Hendrix was not the only prominent rock musician who found himself in legal trouble during May 1969. On May 16, the US embassy in London revoked John Lennon's visa in response to his 1968 drug conviction, describing him as [...] "an inadmissible immigrant". That same day, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady was arrested for possession of marijuana, and on May 28, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were arrested at their London home for marijuana possession.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the series that Duchovny wrote by himself. He had {{previously}} co-developed the stories for the second season episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "Anasazi" [...] - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes [...] "Avatar" [...] and [...] "Talitha Cumi". As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the confidence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> I could write a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." [...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E
500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just no question <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E

500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there is no doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E
500|$|Romeo Void {{formed at}} the San Francisco Art Institute in February 1979. Vocalist Debora Iyall {{occasionally}} visited the Bay Area to see Patti Smith perform. She {{decided to pursue}} an art education after reading a fortune cookie. [...] "It was in the late '70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California," [...] she said. [...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> {{you had to be}} skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Shadows Fall {{released}} their sixth album, Retribution, on September 15, 2009, {{through the}} band's own label, Everblack Industries, {{which was created}} in conjunction with Warner Music Group's ILG, Ferret Music and ChannelZERO Entertainment. It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There is no doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010.

2500|$|Jackson's {{influence}} {{on foreign policy}} has been cited as foundational to the George W. Bush administration's foreign policy, and the Iraq War.
