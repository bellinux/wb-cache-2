60|$|For a {{while the}} poor country lad sat stupidly bewildered. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of people coming and going; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of talk and {{laughter}} sounding around him; but he thought of nothing but his aching homesickness and the oppression of his utter littleness in the busy life of this great castle.|$|R

Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him {{that he has the}} ability to choose his future now that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> of it.

Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge.

5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy {{that he is going to}} let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

25|$|Fans {{have noted}} {{similarities}} to the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander. Ellis stated that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> of the similarities, {{and went on}} to say that he considered and attempted to take legal action. Ellis was asked about the similarities in a 2005 BBC interview. In the response to the question, he said that he is unable to discuss the similarities due to an out-of-court settlement.|$|E
25|$|His wide-ranging {{interests}} {{included the}} Greeks and the Romans. Again, {{like all other}} Arabic historians, he was unclear on Greece before the Macedonian dynasty that produced Alexander the Great. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> that there were kings before this, but is unclear on their names and reigns. He also seems unfamiliar with such additional aspects of Greek political life as Athenian democratic institutions. The same holds for Rome prior to Caesar. He is, though, the earliest extant Arabic author to mention the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.|$|E
25|$|Wynand {{offers to}} marry Francon, even though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> {{that she is}} not in love with him. Francon defers the offer until she feels a great need to punish herself. She learns Roark's true {{identity}} when they are introduced at the party opening the Enright House, the new building that Roark has designed which The Banner has campaigned against. Francon goes to Roark's apartment and offers to marry him if he gives up architecture to save himself from a hopeless struggle. Roark rejects her fears and says that they face many years apart until she adjusts her thinking.|$|E

25|$|In the Hellsing manga {{series by}} Kouta Hirano, {{one of the}} {{depicted}} Nazis is an artificial catboy named Schrödinger. He claims that he is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, {{which is similar to}} the cat being alive and dead at the same time. It is also said that he can only exist as long as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> of himself. In the second anime adaption, he eventually allows himself to be absorbed by the vampire Alucard, which causes his awareness to be clouded. This then spreads to Alucard, who vanishes for thirty years. Alucard returns after destroying the millions of souls within himself, giving him access to all of Schrödinger's abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a {{fundamentally}} different, {{new kind of}} epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised {{in the form of}} a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another ‒ if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> that what he is doing is wrong.|$|E
25|$|Carlito is apprehended {{by police}} {{and taken to}} the office of District Attorney Norwalk (James Rebhorn), where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld {{offering}} to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where he confesses to selling him out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito deftly unloads Kleinfeld's revolver and parts ways with him. The man turns out to be Tony T's other son, Vinnie (Joseph Siravo), seeking vengeance for his brother and father. Vinnie sneaks into Kleinfeld's room and executes him without incident because of Kleinfeld's empty gun.|$|E
