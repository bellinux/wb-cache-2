5000|$|In Germany and Austria, Maestro {{replaced}} the <b>Eurocheque</b> <b>system.</b> Austrian Maestro cards are virtually always pure Maestro cards. German Maestro cards, however, are {{in most cases}} co-branded with the German Girocard logo. These co-branded cards work like normal Maestro cards within the Maestro network and as Girocards within the Girocard network, but they cannot be used as Maestro over the telephone or on the internet.|$|E
5000|$|When the <b>Eurocheque</b> <b>system</b> was disbanded {{at the end}} of 2001, {{the cards}} could no longer use the Eurocheque brand. However, German banks {{continued}} to use the EC logo, which was simply re-interpreted as [...] "electronic cash". Consequently, the cards were colloquially known as EC card (German EC-Karte). However, the ATM network still did not have a trade name and was generically called [...] "Deutsches Geldautomaten-System".|$|E

50|$|Electronic cash is {{the debit}} card {{system of the}} German Banking Industry Committee, the {{association}} which represents the top German financial interest groups. Usually paired with a Transaction account or Current Account, cards with an Electronic Cash logo are only handed out by proper credit institutions. An electronic card payment is generally made by the card owner entering their PIN (Personal Identification Number) at a so-called EFT-POS-terminal (Electronic-Funds-Transfer-Terminal). The name “EC” originally comes from the unified European checking <b>system</b> <b>Eurocheque.</b> Comparable debit card systems are Maestro and Visa Electron. Banks and credit institutions who issue these cards often pair EC debit cards with Maestro functionality. These combined cards, recognizable by an additional Maestro logo, {{are referred to as}} “EC/Maestro cards”.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the <b>Eurocheque</b> <b>system</b> was {{phased out}} and {{replaced}} with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. At that time, {{a number of countries}} took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signalled that they would do so in the future.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to end the}} issuing of Eurocheques was taken because increasing numbers of retailers and banks started to decline payment by Eurocheque and because the use of cash machines and credit cards by international travellers grew within Europe. The relatively high cost of processing Eurocheques, together with the costs resulting from fraud, were also among the factors. In advance of the move, the European Commission expressed concern that [...] "the benefits of the existing <b>eurocheque</b> <b>system,</b> in particular its standardised cheque format and its clearing facilities in all European countries should not be lost." ...|$|E
50|$|Eurocheques were {{particularly}} popular in German-speaking countries, {{where they were}} often issued as standard domestic cheques. They usually had {{to be accompanied by}} a cheque guarantee card in order to be accepted in payment at a point of sale. The Eurocheque guarantee card also had the functionality of an ATM card. In some countries, such as Austria and Germany, virtually all Eurocheque cards were co-branded with the logo of the respective domestic debit card system and were actually debit cards. After its phase-out, virtually all of these Eurocheque cards were replaced by Maestro cards. Therefore, Maestro is very often considered to be the successor to the <b>Eurocheque</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Debit cards {{have enjoyed}} wide {{acceptance}} in Germany for years. Facilities already existed before EFTPOS became {{popular with the}} Eurocheque card, an authorization system initially developed for paper checks where, in addition to signing the actual check, customers also needed to show the card alongside the check as a security measure. Those cards {{could also be used}} at ATMs and for card-based electronic funds transfer (called Girocard) with PIN entry. These are now the only functions of such cards: the <b>Eurocheque</b> <b>system</b> (along with the brand) was abandoned in 2002 during the transition from the Deutsche Mark to the euro. As of 2005, most stores and petrol outlets have EFTPOS facilities. Processing fees are paid by the businesses, which leads to some business owners refusing debit card payments for sales totalling less than a certain amount, usually 5 or 10 euro.|$|E
