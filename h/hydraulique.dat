5000|$|The {{original}} hydropneumatic {{system used}} a vegetable oil liquide <b>hydraulique</b> végétal (LHV), {{similar to that}} used in other cars at the time, but later switched to a synthetic fluid liquide <b>hydraulique</b> synthétique (LHS). Both of these had the disadvantage that they are hygroscopic, {{as is the case with}} most brake fluids. Disuse allows water to enter the hydraulic components causing deterioration and expensive maintenance work. The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every [...] "inhalation" [...] of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water.|$|E

50|$|To {{overcome}} these shortcomings of LHS, Citroën {{developed a new}} green fluid, LHM (Liquide <b>Hydraulique</b> Minéral). LHM is a mineral oil, quite close to automatic transmission fluid. Mineral oil is hydrophobic, unlike standard brake fluid; therefore, gas bubbles do not form in the system, as {{would be the case}} with standard brake fluid, creating a 'spongy' brake feel. Use of mineral oil has thus spread beyond Citroën, Rolls-Royce, Peugeot, and Mercedes-Benz, to include Jaguar, Audi, and BMW.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} fluid change in 1967 was another brain teaser for U.S. automotive regulators at the Department of Transportation. NHTSA follows the precautionary principle, also {{used by the}} Food and Drug Administration, where new innovations are prohibited until their developers can prove them to the regulators; this stifles the experimentation that automakers need to advance their products. NHTSA had already approved a brake fluid they considered safe - DOT 3 brake fluid, which is red and hygroscopic to promote internal rust. This completely different fluid, used in aircraft applications - the technically superior green LHM (Liquide <b>Hydraulique</b> Mineral) - took NHTSA two years to analyze for automotive use. Approval finally came in January 1969, so half the U.S. cars of the 1969 model year use red fluid and half use green fluid.|$|E
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Jean Baptiste Foret de Belidor, {{an officer}} of dragoons, and his wife, Marie Héber but was {{orphaned}} at five months old and brought up by the family of his godfather, an artillery officer named de Fossiébourg. Bélidor enlisted in the army at a young age. After leaving the army, he developed an interest in science and engineering, and became professor of artillery at the school of Fère-en-Tardenois in Aisne. For a while he worked on measuring the arc of the earth. In the years to come he published several works of great importance, {{on a wide range of}} subjects, including hydraulics, mathematics, and civil and military engineering. His most famous book is L'architecture <b>hydraulique</b> (published in four volumes from 1737-1753). Here, integral calculus is used for the first time in solving technical problems.|$|E
50|$|The {{experiments}} of JB Francis (Lowell Hydraulic Experiments, Boston, Mass., 1855) led him {{to propose}} variations in the accepted formulae for the discharge over weirs, and a generation later a very complete investigation of this subject {{was carried out by}} H Bazin. An elaborate inquiry on the flow of water in pipes and channels was conducted by HGP Darcy (1803-1858) and continued by H Bazin, {{at the expense of the}} French government (Recherches <b>hydrauliques,</b> Paris, 1866).|$|R

50|$|The {{typographical}} symbol {{developed in}} the 18th century as an abstraction from arrow projectiles. Its use is {{comparable to that of}} the older (medieval) manicule (pointing hand, ☞). Also comparable is the use of a fleur-de-lis symbol indicating north in a compass rose by Pedro Reinel (c. 1504).An early arrow symbol is found in an illustration of Bernard Forest de Bélidor's treatise L'architecture <b>hydraulique,</b> printed in France in 1737. The arrow is here used to illustrate the direction of the flow of water and of the water wheel's rotation. At about the same time, arrow symbols were used to indicate the flow of rivers in maps.A trend towards abstraction, in which the arrow's fletching is removed, can be observed in the mid-to-late 19th century. In a further abstraction of the symbol, John Richard Green's A Short History of the English People of 1874 contained maps by cartographer Emil Reich, which indicated army movements by curved lines, with solid triangular arrowheads placed intermittently along the lines.Use of arrow symbols in mathematical notation originates in the early 20th century. David Hilbert in 1922 introduced the arrow symbol representing logical implication. The double-headed arrow representing logical equivalence was introduced by Albrecht Becker in Die Aristotelische Theorie der Möglichkeitsschlüsse, Berlin, 1933.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Four {{hydraulic}} {{properties of}} the xylem, the Huber value (HV), hydraulic conductivity (Kh), and specific (Ks) and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (Kl) were studied during the spring before leaf-out and during the summer after full leaf-out for 14 co-occurring tree and shrub species in the sub-boreal mixedwood forests of central British Colum-bia. The 14 studied species were divided into deciduous and evergreen angiosperm and gymnosperm groups, including one deciduous gymnosperm species, the tamarack, Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch. I tested whether species with dif-ferent life forms and classification divisions have different hydraulic properties. HVs were statistically similar for all angiosperms but significantly different among gymnosperms. Long-lived, late-successional species had higher HVs than pioneer and early-successional species. Ks and Kl values for all species except one, subalpine fir, Abies lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., were significantly higher in the spring than in the summer. Conductivity was higher in angio-sperms than in gymnosperms in both the spring and the summer, and was highest in deciduous species in both seasons. The results indicate that requirements for mechanical strength {{may account for the}} high HVs in conifers, and that the high HVs compensate for low Ks and Kl values. The high hydraulic conductivities observed in the spring coincide with high water availability and high water demand by trees with emerging leaves. The subsequent reduction in Ks and Kl values could be caused by drought-induced embolism and cavitation in early summer.

40|$|The Economic Mentalité and Great Hydrological Works At the Origins of a Model: The Drainage of Lake Fucino Swamplands {{have long}} been {{regarded}} as undesirable ecological features and their drainage a wholly beneficial operation. In modern times, the disappearance of marshes has been advanced as a benefit brought by conquering European societies to colonial peoples. As in many other cases, the Roman precedent has been widely cited. Yet a close examination of the historical record indicates that the comparison of modern with Roman imperial ends and methods is not entirely accurate. This becomes especially apparent {{when we consider the}} draining of Lake Fucino, an enormous undertaking that serves as a point of reference for modern engineers. Still, with respect to the means at their disposal and their objectives, the Emperor Claudius and his successors did not fail; rather, the results are not what we would expect when those expectations are based on the observation of modern drainage operations.

40|$|Some of the {{important}} elements to be considered by the designer {{in the field of}} water defenses and hydraulic structures include the determination of the maximum environmental loads such as maximum wave height, maximum water level and maximum river discharge at locations of interest. These maxima can be estimated by various statistical methods based on observations. The main point of interest is the behaviour of each method for predicting these extrema and its deviation from the true value. An overview of statistical methods is given to determine the extreme values of river and sea related variables. The method of Regional Frequency Analysis (RFA) is proposed to predict the occurrence probabilities of these extrema. The RFA intends to extend the dataset by pooling the data of neighboring locations and establishes the regional growth curve of a so-called “homogenous region”. An important aspect is the formation of the homogeneous regions because only for those regions data can be pooled. Statistical methods will also be presented to derive homogeneous clusters. Applications include the prediction of extreme river discharges in Northwest and Central Europe and extreme waves along the Dutch North Sea coasts.
