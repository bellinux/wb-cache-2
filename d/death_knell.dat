5|$|The Citroën AX was {{launched}} without a twin in 1986, {{and the only}} other Talbot in development, the Arizona family hatchback, {{was launched}} instead as the Peugeot 309 {{at the end of}} 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling {{the beginning of the end}} of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon rolled off the production line in Finland, although the brand survived on commercial vehicles until 1994.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Clements faced Republican state {{attorney}} general Eldon S. Dummit. While Clements managed to keep the Democrats united following the primary, Dummit had fractured the Republicans by attacking the administration of sitting Republican governor Simeon S. Willis and his preferred successor during the Republican primary. Dummit mounted a meager challenge by citing Clements' opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, {{but this was not}} very effective. Dummit had replaced his campaign manager from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E

40|$|The {{psychology}} of the Republican party {{in the early days}} of 2009 reveals a coalition humiliated by defeat, insecure in its principles, and fearful of a new president who may prove to have Ronald Reagan‘s gifts for charming his way into the support of people with whom he is ideologically incompatible. This hyperventilation – though characteristically American – is both over-stated and premature. The GOP has had its fair share of false <b>death</b> <b>knells</b> over the past half-century – and each time it has quickly come roaring back...|$|R

5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 {{would be hard-pressed to}} imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever come back from the total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E
5|$|The first streetcars {{appeared}} in 1889 and {{were instrumental in}} the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>death</b> of <b>Knell</b> has {{provided}} a convenient explanation for how Shakespeare came into the acting profession. As Samuel Schoenbaum puts it, [...] "When the Queen's Men stopped in Stratford in 1587, they were short a man, William Knell having been lately killed in a brawl with a fellow actor. Maybe Shakespeare took Knell's place and thus found his way to London and stage-land."

25|$|The <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> or the tolling of {{the church}} bell is a popular {{practice}} among rural congregations.

25|$|The Great Depression greatly {{impacted}} No Man's Land, {{forcing the}} closure of Vista del Lago. A fire that {{broke out in the}} Miralago on the night of March 8, 1932 severely damaged the building along with many nearby properties (such as the structures abandoned by the defunct Breaker's Beach Club and Vista del Lago), thus tolling the final <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for an exuberant era of No Man's Land's history.|$|E
25|$|Reasons for {{the decline}} of the Kew railway line are varied. A {{commonly}} held idea is that tramway competition led to a loss of passengers. The remoteness of the Kew railway station compared to the tramway which ran along High Street was almost certainly a factor.

25|$|To {{combat the}} Great Northern, {{in a few}} {{instances}} Villard built branch line mileage simply to occupy a territory, {{regardless of whether the}} territory offered the railroad any business. Mismanagement, sparse traffic, and the Panic of 1893 sounded the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the Northern Pacific and Villard's interest in railroading. The company slipped into its second bankruptcy on October 20, 1893. Oakes was named receiver and Brayton Ives, {{a former chairman of the}} New York Stock Exchange, became president.|$|E

25|$|John Bonser {{returned}} to the Skeena River in 1911 and piloted the Inlander for the 1911 and ‘12 seasons of navigation. Then, that August, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway line was finished to from Prince Rupert to Hazelton, a <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the local sternwheelers. On September 13, 1912 the Inlander left Hazelton for the final time, {{the last of the}} sternwheelers on the Skeena River. When she reached Port Essington, the Inlander was pulled up onto ways and left to rot.|$|E
25|$|At about 1245, Lexington — heavily damaged though {{apparently}} in satisfactory condition afloat and underway – suffered severe internal explosions that rang her <b>death</b> <b>knell.</b> Fires raged {{out of control}} and, by 1630, her engines stopped.

Once rescue operations were completed, and Lexingtons end was hastened by torpedoes from , TF 17 began a slow retirement from the Coral Sea, having suffered heavy losses but also having inflicted a decisive strategic defeat on the Japanese by barring the Port Moresby invasion.|$|E
25|$|The Police Act of 1919 was the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> of NUPPO. It {{established}} the Police Federation, a public sector {{version of a}} company union, to replace NUPPO. Under the Act, NUPPO was outlawed as a representative body for the police and forbade them from belonging to a trade union. NUPPO had no options but to fight or fold; unsurprisingly, it chose to fight. This time, however, it was the union that misread {{the mood of the}} men when it called for another strike. Out of a force of 18,200 men in the Metropolitan Police, only 1,156 participated in the strike in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{farming in}} the area started to decline about the time Ihmsen Ranch fruit {{production}} was at its prime. Water rates shot up with a switch to electric pumps. World War I took owners and workers away with the draft. During the Great Depression many families left the mostly agricultural area looking for work. Washington and British Columbia apple growers were able to cut prices because they shipped their produce by river transportation, whereas Apple Valley apples were transported by rail or by truck. The <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> {{was a series of}} outbreaks of a virulent fungus infections coupled with frost, heat and hail in 1944, 1945 and 1946.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 William Murphy {{purchased}} {{the land that}} contained the monument, intending to cover the pyramid with advertising. The Union Pacific Railroad Company had other plans. The company obtained a special deed to the property in 1889. The railroad company's decision to twice relocate the tracks farther south {{to take advantage of}} more gradual grades over the Laramie Mountains threatened Sherman's tenuous existence a few hundred yards west of the monument. The town's <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> came in 1918. The railroad company closed its station house and relocated the tracks about three miles (5km) south. Residents soon abandoned Sherman, leaving behind a small cemetery that is still present today.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1492 was marked {{the decline of the}} League, he having been one of its {{greatest}} supporters and prime maintainer, recognising the advantage of maintaining a balance among the five powers as opposed to trying to eliminate his enemies. Whilst the League failed to prevent the French invasion in 1494 the began the Italian Wars, it did enable (as the League of Venice) the creation of the army that repelled Charles VIII's army after their sack of Naples. The League army engaged the French at Fornovo and retained control of the battlefield but failed to prevent an orderly French retreat. The Venetian alliance with France and Spain against Milan and Naples in the Italian War of 1499–1504, however, sounded the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the League.|$|E
25|$|Michael Banach, {{the current}} Vatican {{representative}} to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that the Japanese nuclear disaster created new concerns {{about the safety of}} nuclear plants globally. Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this serious nuclear power incident should be a lesson for Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. He called on the worldwide Christian solidarity to provide wide support for this anti-nuclear campaign. Statements from bishops’ conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power. Columban priest Fr Seán McDonagh's forthcoming book is entitled Is Fukushima the <b>Death</b> <b>Knell</b> for Nuclear Energy?. Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Kenzaburō Ōe has said Japan should decide quickly to abandon its nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for white political power and ushered {{in a new era}} of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and the provocative attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had a greater impact on the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year. A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe's violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, {{the last}} sternwheeler built {{for work on}} the Skeena River was the Inlander. She was owned by {{residents}} and businessmen of the area and was piloted by Captain Joseph Bucey for that season of navigation. In 1911, Bucey left for the upper Fraser River where he would work on the sternwheeler BC Express until 1921. Captain John Bonser, now back from the upper Fraser, replaced Bucey on the Inlander and piloted her for the 1911 and 1912 seasons. Then, that August, the rail line was finished to Hazelton, a <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for the Inlander. She left Hazelton for the final time on September 13, 1912, under Captain Bonser. When she reached Port Essington, the Inlander was pulled up onto ways and left to rot. Like the Inlander, Captain Bonser had also made his last trip. He died on December 26, 1913.|$|E
25|$|Passenger traffic {{began to}} drop {{following}} the Second World War as bus services became more popular; the East Kent Road Car Company ran buses which passed close to Smeeth {{on their way}} between Ashford and Folkestone, drawing off much of the railway's custom. Nationalisation in 1947 saw the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) take over responsibility for the station, and it began to implement a new policy of centring goods traffic at larger railhead depots, thereby sounding the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> for many wayside stations across the country whose income was largely down to goods traffic. In 1953, BR proposed the closure of Smeeth Station, arguing that it would save nearly £10,000 in wages and other expenses linked with the renewal of the two platforms; the station, it said, brought in £10,322 in goods receipts and only £143 would be lost from withdrawing passenger services. The local Member of Parliament, Bill Deedes, encouraged villagers to fight the closure, but the local newspaper noted that most preferred to travel by bus or motor car. The station's last passenger train therefore departed at 9.50pm on Sunday 3 January 1954, leaving goods traffic to last for ten more years before Smeeth closed entirely.|$|E
25|$|From around 1950 to 1965, {{the support}} for these {{theories}} was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising {{from the fact that}} the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of hydrogen and helium, whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as quasars and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 was considered the <b>death</b> <b>knell</b> of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and physically paradoxical singularity at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as Richard Tolman's oscillating universe. In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable, and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.|$|E
