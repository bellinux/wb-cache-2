Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> {{have not yet fully}} {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] {{that it was one of}} the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light girdling darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
60|$|At least, so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
60|$|I {{should be}} a fool <b>to</b> be that. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so natural, so horribly natural.

60|$|I {{hesitate}} and add {{here one}} other confession. I {{want to tell}} this thing because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are altogether too restrained and secretive about such matters. The cardinal thing in life sneaks in to us darkly and shamefully like a thief in the night.|$|E
60|$|Please {{come over}} here. The fact {{of one of}} our {{officers}} being killed on the Patuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> could send white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate homicides on punctilio.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a miracle had happened. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are}} other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France, [...] Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking [...] other dialects; And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I could know those men, I should become {{attached}} to [...] them, as I do to men in my own lands. O I know we should be brethren and lovers; I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I've been thinkin' of, Carrots," [...] Teddy said, as they walked slowly along. [...] "Ikey is in a pretty bad way, an' <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> ought ter do somethin' more'n jest feed him up on lamb, if he ever expects to get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{must have}} fallen {{over the bridge}} and struck his head. There are stones yonder, {{and you can see}} the bruise,” said one. “Still, it might not have {{happened}} that way, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> had better push on to the hall, and send somebody for the police.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Alma {{said she}} was drawing in Mr. Wetmore's class, and Miss Woodburn said: [...] "Well, it's just beautiful, Miss Leighton; it's grand. Ah suppose it's raght expensive, now? Mah goodness! we have to cyoant the coast so much nowadays; <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> do nothing but cyoant it.

60|$|I may be mistaken, but <b>it</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer {{is not a}} work of art in any sense; <b>it</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of {{a work of art}}; in truth, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and {{thoughtful}} sitting alone, [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are other}} men in other lands yearning {{and thoughtful}}, [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy, [...] France, Spain, [...] Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects, [...] And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if I could know those men I should become [...] attached to them as I do to men in my own lands, [...] O I know we should be brethren and lovers, [...] I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
60|$|I refuse <b>to</b> answer that. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{excessively}} impertinent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you wanted a respite for her," [...] said Peterkin, as we sat round our fire, [...] "that you might have time to {{consider}} how to act, and I backed up your request accordingly, as you know. But now, I confess, I'm very much at a loss what to suggest. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> have only purchased a brief delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my daughter, be plain, I pray of you, for I cannot {{understand}} your counsels. Were it not better {{to give to}} these people the red stones which they desire, and send them secretly from the land, saying that they had vanished into the earth again, for so <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> should be rid of much shame and trouble?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{rose and}} {{stretched}} himself. [...] "I wouldn't worry about me. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are {{both of us}} feeling lonely, and that's curious, because when we had him Okanagan wasn't any special kind of a companionable man.

6000|$|... "Every man has his secrets, I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "and all {{men have}} a right to their enj'yment. We've got low enough in this chist in my {{judgment}} to answer our wants, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> should do well by going no farther; and by letting Master Hutter have to himself, and his own feelin's, all that's beneath this cover.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{should we}} gain, Master Hutter, by {{changing}} the position?" [...] asked Deerslayer, with {{a good deal of}} earnestness; [...] "this is a safe cover, and a stout defence might be made from the inside of this cabin. I've never fou't unless in the way of tradition; but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> might beat off twenty Mingos, with palisades like them afore us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow! {{his case}} is hopeless; {{she will never}} wed him," [...] thought Fred, but he only said, [...] "I, too, would not waste time, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> shall lose much if we go in that direction. The longer I study {{the nature of the}} ground, and {{calculate}} our rate of travelling since we left the diggings, the more am I convinced that our way lies westward." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sir Claude, {{resting on}} his elbows, fixed his eyes {{a moment on the}} white marble beneath them.

60|$|Whence, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>we</b> may gather {{one of two}} things; {{either that}} there is nothing in any European form of {{religion}} so reasonable or ascertained, as that it can be taught securely to our youth, or fastened in their minds by any rivets of proof which they shall not be able to loosen the moment they begin to think; or else, that no means are taken to train them in such demonstrable creeds.|$|E
6000|$|... "To a very {{possible}} Prime Minister," [...] Norgate replied, [...] "but I {{am going to}} tell you what I think, all the same. I'm fed up with you all. I bring you some certain and sure information, proving conclusively that Germany is maintaining an extraordinary system of espionage over here, and you tell me to mind my own business.

I've had enough. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> thoroughly deserve the shaking up we're going to get. I am going to turn German spy myself and work for the other side." ...|$|E
