Butt was provisionally suspended from playing International Cricket {{due to the fact that}} the ICC wanted his name cleared before he resumed playing cricket. In late September, Butt filed an appeal to the ICC asking them to lift his temporary suspension. After Mohammad Asif had dropped his appeal against the charges so that he could understand the charges filed against him, Butt said he was determined to prove his innocence and that his appeal was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, gave the episode a {{positive}} review, and wrote that it was [...] "A magnificent end to the season." [...] They wrote that the episode was [...] "thoroughly racist" [...] but [...] "completely inoffensive because it's simply very funny." [...] Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also favourable, considering it {{to be one of}} the better episodes of the season. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has [...] "some funny moments." [...] Aaron Roxby of Collider was more critical, denouncing the episode's dated references. He wrote: [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> and give this one the benefit of the doubt and assume that making fun of Japanese junk culture and game shows felt fresher in 1999 than it does do now." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode [...] "mediocre". He wrote that, though the episode's concept should [...] "open up lots of interesting possibilities", it [...] "doesn't explore them particularly well". While he did not consider it to be a bad episode, he thought it [...] "fail to live up to its potential".|$|E

40|$|Our {{lives are}} like smoke. They weave and wend, blend and shred on the breeze, disperse; one moment vividly here, {{the next moment}} gone from sight. In a broad sense, the stories in Life Like Smoke explore the differentiations between self and other, the {{loneliness}} inherent to being a singular human subject, and the miraculous fact of connection and union that occur nonetheless. They are also stories that explore {{the nature of human}} narratives, first in the vast expanse of the Patagonian desert, where the overwhelming narrative of nature threatens to destroy the human narratives that arise within it, and then in the city of Buenos Aires, where the deluge of human narratives constantly compete, spitting sparks, coming together, breaking apart. And, of course, these stories are whatever you make of them, yours to map onto or make associations with, to analyze, to viscerally feel. Flannery O’Connor says it takes every word of a story to tell what that story is about. I would go further. Every word of a story comes together with you, the reader, to continually create itself. So {{if you want to know}} what the stories are about, you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> and read them...|$|R

5000|$|Controversies {{began in}} 1980, {{starting}} with the DFO {{and the federal government}} when they realized Alcan was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with the Kemano Completion project without addressing the existing water level and temperature concerns. The proposed Kemano Completion Project would result in an additional 12% reduction in the Nechako River water levels. To avoid increased tensions Alcan waited until 1985, while the DFO performed studies on the potential effects on the Nechako's salmon population, and then made plans to take the DFO to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Both parties armed with their own scientists. However, the issue was never brought to the courts and was instead settled through the 1987 negotiations involving Alcan, the provincial government and the federal government, resulting in the 1987 settlement agreement. Aspects of the agreement include: Alcan promised to build a cold water release valve in the Nechako Reservoir to cool the water temperature for migrating salmon [...] and the company gave up its Nanika River water rights. In addition, the federal and provincial governments agreed to allow Alcan to proceed with its completion project. Critics and opposition governments accused all three parties of not doing a proper environmental assessment.|$|E

Fellow IGN editor Martin Robinson described it as [...] "characterful" [...] and [...] "adorable", the latter a sentiment shared by fellow IGN editor Jack DeVries. Official Nintendo Magazines Chris Schilling used the headline [...] "Oshawott's New?" [...] while discussing the [...] "safe, slightly boring designs" [...] of Pokémon earlier in the game.
