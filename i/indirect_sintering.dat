This paper presents mechanical, physical properties and geometric distortion of Cu-Ni <b>indirect</b> <b>sintering</b> products used to develop Cu-Ni bimaterial products. The experiment was executed with the following method: firstly, Cu and/or Ni powders were deposited into cast iron powder as the supporting powder. Secondly, it was heated in a furnace with varying temperatures of 870 C, 900 C and 930 C with a holding time of four hours. Lastly, deposition orientation was varied to observe the effect on the occurence of shrinkage. To initiate the multi materials sintering process, single material sintering was performed to observe the physical and mechanical properties. Based onprevious work, multi material sintering of Cu and Ni powders was conducted. The experiment results showed that the geometric distortion of the sintering products was influenced by deposition orientation. The Cu and Ni products shrinkage were 49 % and 35. 33 %, respectively.

These materials have a strengthening affect such as high thermal conductivity, good wear resistance, high corrosion resistance, good insulation, high-strength material which applicable in industry of aerospace, automotive, tooling manufacture and also in biomedical industry. The material tested is FeCuSn hybrid metal material which machined by {{wire electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM). However, there are some difficulties in generating a model that can accurately correlate the input parameters of WEDM with the responses because the parameters setting are restricted with the operator's experience. Hence, there are no specific parameters for hybrid metal materials in WEDM. The machining parameters such as pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak current and voltage will be reset according to the Design of experiment (DOE) while the analysis will be focused upon the effect of the working surface and the hardness of work material.

Design/Methodology/Approach – In this paper we characterised the shrinkage of indirect SLS aluminium parts during the various stages of production. Standard scale parts were measured using a Giddings and Lewis co-ordinate measuring machine in both the green and infiltrated condition. Findings – The conducted experiments show that the most accuracy is lost during furnace cycle and that the greatest loss of accuracy occurred in the Z dimensions. Additionally the position of parts within the part bed in both X, Y and Z is shown to influence accuracy, with smaller parts being built closer {{to the edge of the}} bed later in the build. These results have been interpreted as being a result of the phenomenon of “Z-growth”. Finally the research shows that the overall accuracy of the <b>indirect</b> selective laser <b>sintering</b> of aluminium process is comparable with many existing processes such as investment casting.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM; aka 3 D printing) has {{the potential}} to rapidly shape parts with an almost unlimited shape freedom. Variants of the following powder metallurgy (PM) process route, which includes additive manufacturing as a shaping step, were explored to produce ceramic parts: (i) powder synthesis, (ii) additive manufacturing, (iii) binder removal, (iv) furnace sintering and alternative post-SLS densification steps. In this study, alumina (Al 2 O 3) parts were produced, since Al 2 O 3 is currently the most commonly used ceramic material for technical applications. For the production of the alumina parts, <b>indirect</b> Selective Laser <b>Sintering</b> (<b>indirect</b> SLS) was used as the AM method during the shaping step. To explore indirect SLS, different powders, with a particle/agglomerate size of about 10 - 100 µm and consisting of a 0. 3 µm alumina powder and a polymer binder phase (i. e. composite alumina-binder agglomerates), were irradiated by a laser beam. Five different alumina-binder agglomerates were investigated: alumina-polyamide agglomerates produced through ball milling, alumina-polystyrene powder produced through dispersion polymerization and alumina-polyamide, alumina-polypropylene and alumina-carnauba_wax-low_density_polyethylene powders produced through temperature induced phase separation. During subsequent SLS, the laser irradiation, which melted only the binder phase, selectively consolidated the powder agglomerates layer by layer. After subsequent binder removal and furnace sintering, alumina parts, containing inter-agglomerate pores, were obtained. In order to reduce the inter-agglomerate voids, the possibility to include the following steps into the PM process chain was explored: (i) irradiating the powder layers multiple times instead of only once (i. e. laser re-melting), (ii) cold, quasi and warm isostatic pressing the SLSed parts and (iii) infiltrating the parts obtained at different stages of the PM process. As a result, freeform shaped alumina parts with densities up to approximately 90 % could be obtained. In order to produce higher quality ceramic parts through indirect SLS, the inter-agglomerate pores should be avoided or eliminated. status: accepte...|$|R

Two binder formulations have been studied: 100 % carnauba wax and carnauba wax mixed with 18 wt% low density polyethylene (LDPE). Three dimensional parts could successfully be produced by SLS using both binder systems. However, the geometrical stability during debinding and sintering of the parts composed of the 100 % carnauba wax binder was insufficient. The presence of low density polyethylene in the binder resulted in good geometrical stability during post-processing but at the ex-pense of the green density after SLS.

With respect to medical application the generative techniques mostly used synonymously with RP techniques allow to fabricate individual, complex shaped implants in a relative short time. The {{objective of the}} work was to evaluate the generative techniques 3 D-printing (3 DP) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) concerning their potentials for fabrication of individual and complex shaped bioactive implants based on hydroxyapatite (HAP). At 3 DP the ceramic part is generated layer wise from a powder bed. Via a printing head a liquid {{is added to the}} powder which is specific solidified by the reaction between powder, liquid and binder. The binder can be contained both in the printing liquid or in the powder bed. A special system powder/ binder/ liquid was developed for 3 DP of HAP. With this system HAP-components were generated, for example cuboids with channels (diameter  1 mm) in all three directions in space and fragments of the human mandible as demonstrator parts. After sintering the HAP-components with micro- and macro-porosity are qualified for application as implants. The results verify the performance of 3 DP for the fabrication of complex three-dimensional hydroxyapatite structures which can be applied as bioactive implants. This powder printing technique is applicably also to other calciumphosphates (e. g. tri-calciumphosphate).

40|$|<b>Indirect</b> {{selective}} laser <b>sintering</b> (SLS) is a promising additive manufacturing technique to produce ceramic parts with complex shapes in a two-step process. In the first step, the polymer phase in a deposited polymer/alumina composite microsphere layer is locally molten by a scanning laser beam, resulting in local ceramic particle bonding. In the second step, the binder {{is removed from}} the green parts by slowly heating and subsequently furnace sintered to increase the density. In this work, polyamide 12 and submicrometer sized alumina were used. Homogeneous spherical composite powders in the form of microspheres were prepared by a novel phase inversion technique. The composite powder showed good flowability and formability. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the thermal properties and laser processing window of the composite powder. The effect of the laser beam scanning parameters such as laser power, scan speed and scan spacing on the fabrication of green parts was assessed. Green parts were subsequently debinded and furnace sintered to produce crack-free alumina components.

It has been found that the electrical conductivity increases significantly (> 200 S/cm) with a corresponding increase in pyrolyzing temperature which correlates well with literature on the carbonization of phenol formaldehyde resins. The brown parts are subsequently infiltrated with low viscosity (~ 5 - 10 cps) cyanoacrylate to seal up the open pores, rendering the plates fluid impermeable.

40|$|Innovative powder {{preparation}} and post-processing techniques {{can be employed}} to obtain high density ceramic parts by means of <b>indirect</b> selective laser <b>sintering.</b> Homogeneous spherical alumina-polypropylene (PP) composite powder agglomerates with an average size of ~ 70 µm are synthesized by the non-solvent immersion phase separation technique. Polypropylene and submicrometer alumina are added to p-xylene and heated to 135 °C to form a homogeneous alumina particle suspension in a solution of polypropylene in p-xylene. Upon adding ethanol as a non-solvent, spherical PP-Al 2 O 3 agglomerates are precipitated which are suitable for conventional roller deposition. Green component parts with a density of 40 - 50 % can be produced by selective laser melting (SLM) of the polymer under optimized laser power, scan speed, scan spacing and powder preheating temperature. Various post-processing techniques like squeeze suspension infiltration (SI), warm isostatic pressing (WIPing) {{or a combination of}} both can be applied to increase the green density of the SLM parts. Infiltrating the green SLM parts with open porosity with a 40 vol. % alumina-powder based ethanol suspension allows to increase the sintered density, i. e. after polymer debinding and pressureless sintering in air at 1600 °C, from 38 to 90 % of the theoretical density (TD). WIPing of the green SLM parts at 100 °C and 64 MPa allows raising the sintered density up to 65 % TD, but results in internal cracks upon polymer debinding and sintering.

40|$|Manufacturing {{functional}} prototypes {{and tools}} using conventional methods usually {{is a time}} consuming procedure with multiple steps. The pressure to get products to market faster {{has resulted in the}} creation of several Rapid Prototyping (RP) techniques. However, potentially {{one of the most important}} areas of Rapid Manufacturing (RM) technology lies in the field of Rapid Tooling (RT). Layer manufacture technologies are gaining increasing attention in the manufacturing sector for the production of polymer mould tooling. Layer manufacture techniques can be used in this potential manufacturing area to produce tooling either indirectly or directly, and powder metal based layer manufacture systems are considered an effective way of producing rapid tooling. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is one of available layer manufacture technologies. SLS is a sintering process in which shaped parts are built up layer by layer from bottom to top of powder material.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess a new powder {{metallurgy}} process to make alumina parts through <b>indirect</b> Selective Laser <b>Sintering</b> (SLS). Density measurements, some geometrical assessments and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microstructural analyses are performed after each stage of the process, allowing to provide an objective overview of the challenges and possibilities for the processing of high density technical ceramic parts through SLS of ball milled alumina/polyamide powder agglomerates. Design/methodology/approach –The powder production by ball milling, SLS, cold isostatic pressing (CIP) or quasi isostatic pressing (QIP), debinding and sintering (FS) stages of the powder metallurgy process were sequentially investigated. Findings – Alumina parts with a density up to 94. 1 % could be produced by a powder metallurgy process containing an SLS step. Microstructural investigation of the sintered samples reveals an alumina matrix with a grain size of ~ 5 µm and two different kind of pore morphologies, i. e. long elongated pores, which stem from the intergranular spacings during SLS, and intermediate pores, which likely originate from larger polyamide agglomerates in the ball milled powder. Besides, QIPing at elevated temperatures is found to be a promising alternative for CIPing at room temperature to increase the final part density. Research limitations/implications – Cracks, long elongated pores and intermediate pores remained in the sintered parts. Homogenizing the microstructure of the parts through optimizing the composite starting powder, the deposition during SLS, the SLS parameters and QIPing parameters is essential to overcome these limitations. Practical implications – Homogenizing the starting powder mixture and the microstructure of the SLS material is the key issue for producing ceramic parts through indirect SLS. Originality/value – Indirect SLS of ceramics has hardly been reported and the combined use of SLS and QIPing is innovative in the field of indirect SLS of ceramics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using <b>indirect</b> selective laser <b>sintering</b> (SLS) to produce parts for bone replacement applications from glass-ceramic materials. A castable glass based on the system SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 "P 2 O 5 -CaO-CaFth 2 a t crystallises to a glass-ceramic with apatite and mullite phases was produced, ground to a powder and blended with an acrylic binder at various ratios by mass. An experimental sinterstation with a 250 W CO 2 laser was used to determine the viability of indirectly sintering the glass ceramic across a range of processing parameters. Green parts with good structural integrity were produced using a wide range of processing conditions, allowing both monolayer and multilayer components to be constructed. The effect of powder properties, such as glass particle size and binder content, on the surface qualities and structural integrity of the parts was also examined. Following SLS the parts were post-processed to remove the binder which may otherwise have rendered them unsuitable for biological use, and fully crystallise the material, evolving the apatite and mullite phases to improve both biological and mechanical properties. The parts were heated to 1200 °C using a number of different time-temperature profiles, following which the processed material was analysed by DTA, XRD, SEM, gCT, and tested for its flexural strength. An increase in strength was achieved by infiltrating the brown parts with PMMA and a resorbable phosphate glass, although the latter altered the crystal phases present in the material. In vitro cytotoxicity and bioactivity tests were carried out to assess the biological properties of the produced parts. The laser sintered material was found to be non-toxic by both contact and extract methods. There was no evidence of an apatite layer forming {{on the surface of the}} material when soaked in a simulated body fluid suggesting that the material was unlikely to exhibit bioactive behaviour in vivo. However, following implantation in rabbit tibiae for 4 weeks, bone was seen to have grown into the porous structure of the laser sintered parts, and appeared to form a close bond with the material surface.
