5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lack of {{tactical}} flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle {{and that the}} British {{should have known better}} than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage. The British fought an uncoordinated infantry and tank battle during the morning and the Germans did much the same throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Bowes was <b>disappointing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests but his bowling was a {{significant}} factor in another Yorkshire championship.|$|R
25|$|Play did {{not start}} until 4pm {{on the second day}} because of rain. Set 237 on the third day the batting of {{combined}} team proved <b>disappointing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> match Sydney Smith scored 41 and 32 and took 6/56 and 5/49.|$|R
50|$|Gormley {{started his}} intercounty {{management}} career with Down. After a promising {{start to the}} 2006 National League, Down's challenge tailed off, and they were <b>disappointing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 Ulster Senior Football Championship, and were knocked out of the qualifiers by Sligo, after which, Gormley stepped down.|$|R
5|$|Niedermayer played {{three seasons}} of junior hockey with the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) between 1989 and 1992. He {{recorded}} 69 points in 64 games {{in his first}} season, 1989–90, and helped the Blazers win the President's Cup as WHL champions. The Blazers advanced to the 1990 Memorial Cup as the top ranked team in Canada, but <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament by losing all three games. Niedermayer earned several accolades in 1990–91. He scored 26 goals and 82 points in 57 games to earn {{a place on the}} Western Conference All-Star Team. Additionally, he was named the recipient of the Daryl K. (Doc) Seaman Trophy as the WHL's scholastic player of the year and won the Canadian Hockey League Scholastic Player of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} were <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of an explanation for Lisa's obsession with Derek. Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, who is white, was unexplored. The storyline of Obsessed has been compared with that of Fatal Attraction (1987) - a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the Michael Douglas and Anne Archer roles, respectively, while Larter is in Glenn Close's - although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. Obsessed spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8million from theaters, internationally. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for home viewing on August4,2009, in the US and has sold 1.3million DVDs, worth $21million of consumer spending.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 Hitmen battled the Medicine Hat Tigers for the {{top spot}} in the Western Hockey League {{for most of the}} season. Calgary {{finished}} with 101 points, their best total since 1999–2000, however, finishing two points behind Medicine Hat for {{the best record in the}} league. The team again <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, falling to the Moose Jaw Warriors in the Eastern Conference semi-final. Pogge's performance during the season earned him honours as both the WHL player of the year and CHL goaltender of the year. Calgary fell to third in the Central Division in 2006–07. In the playoffs, they upset the Kootenay Ice, who finished 19-points ahead of Calgary in the regular season. The Hitmen then defeated the East Division champion Brandon Wheat Kings to reach the Eastern Conference final for the fourth time in franchise history, where they were subsequently defeated by the Tigers.|$|E
25|$|Coventry {{currently}} {{plays for}} Matabeleland Tuskers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Zimbabwean domestic competition.

5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William is {{surprisingly}} favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.|$|E
25|$|Speaking for the National Republicans for Environmental Protection Association, President Martha Marks {{said that}} the {{organization}} was <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bill {{because it did not}} support conservation enough, and continued to subsidize the well-established oil and gas industries that didn't require subsidizing.|$|E
25|$|Babbage {{arrived at}} Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810. He was already self-taught {{in some parts}} of {{contemporary}} mathematics; he had read in Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Marie Agnesi. As a result, he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standard mathematical instruction available at the university.|$|E
25|$|Fiorentina's 1995–96 {{season was}} <b>disappointing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league, {{but they did}} reach the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final by beating Gloria Bistrița, Sparta Prague and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the {{eventual}} winner of the competition, Barcelona (away 1–1; home 0–2). The season's main signings were Luís Oliveira and Andrei Kanchelskis, the latter of whom suffered from many injuries.|$|R

George and his brother Charles toured Australia <b>in</b> 1882/3 with <b>the</b> MCC captained by the Honourable Ivo Bligh. The team won back the Ashes, but George was very <b>disappointing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four Tests <b>in</b> which he played, scoring only 31 runs in 7 innings.|$|R
40|$|In 1975, Courzon and Ahlborn {{studied a}} Carnot engine with thermal losses and got an {{expression}} for its efficiency that described better {{the performance of}} actual heat machines than the traditional result due to Carnot. In their original derivation, time appears explicitly and this is <b>disappointing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of classical thermodynamics. In this note a derivation is given without any explicit reference to time...|$|R
25|$|Only {{a few of}} Pigneau's men {{stayed for}} {{more than two or three}} year, <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lack of a quick fortune. Pigneau himself had wanted a Catholic as ruler of Vietnam. His {{ambition}} never materialised with the failure to convert Canh, who predeceased his father Nguyễn Ánh by twenty years in any case.|$|E
25|$|Auld {{spent the}} 2004–05 NHL lockout {{back with the}} Manitoba Moose in the AHL, this time pairing with veteran netminder Wade Flaherty. Despite {{holding on to the}} {{starting}} role for much of the season, Auld <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, and Flaherty took over as starter, helping the team reach the third round of the Calder Cup playoffs. He also appeared for Canada at the Spengler Cup in December 2004, carrying the team to a third-place finish.|$|E
25|$|Houston later {{embarked}} on a world tour, entitled the Nothing but Love World Tour. It was her first world tour in over ten years and was announced as a triumphant comeback. However, some poor reviews and rescheduled concerts brought some negative media attention. Houston canceled some concerts because of illness and received widespread negative reviews from fans who were <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quality of her voice and performance. Some fans reportedly walked out of her concerts.|$|E

25|$|The Olympic {{marathon}} was run on 10 April (or 29 March by the Julian Calendar then {{in use in}} Greece). The Greek {{public had}} been very enthusiastic about the Games, but was <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that no track and field event had yet been won by a Greek competitor. The victory in the discus throw, a classical Greek event, by the American Robert Garrett had been particularly painful. Because of its close connection with Greek history, the public desperately yearned for the marathon to be won by one of their countrymen.|$|E
25|$|Days of Thunder {{received}} {{very little}} critical reception, {{with only one}} review published for the PlayStation 3 NASCAR Edition and very few published for the Xbox 360 Arcade version. Of the reviews published critics gave generally negative reviews. The PlayStation 3 version single GameRankings score comes from the reviewer from PSNStores, who gave the game a 3/5. The critic gave high marks for the PlayStation 3 version's inclusion of real-world NASCAR drivers, but was <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lack of customization. Two scores were reported at GameRankings for the Xbox 360 version, from the US and UK editions of Official Xbox Magazine. The scored the game a 3/10 and 2/10, respectively.|$|E
25|$|All of this {{encouraged}} two further expeditions: {{the first}} in 1518 {{under the command of}} Juan de Grijalva, and the second in 1519 under the command of Hernán Cortés, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and subsequent Spanish colonization in present-day Mexico. Hernández did not live to see the continuation of his work; he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, {{as the result of the}} injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage and <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge that Diego Velázquez had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucatán.|$|E

The central neurobiologic mechanism(s) involved in cocaine toxicity are poorly understood. Without a cocaine antagonist, pharmacologic approaches have been less than promising in preventing relapse. Various psychoactive medications have been tried in early cocaine abstinence, with some success...|$|R

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Dimitar Penev took the lead as coach for a second time. CSKA reached {{the second round of}} the UEFA Cup, and won the Bulgarian Cup, but <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{domestic}} league, finishing in fifth place in 1999. That season, the young talents of Martin Petrov, Stilian Petrov, Dimitar Berbatov and Vladimir Manchev started to play a bigger role in the team. There were problems with player-indexing due to some unpaid obligations to Neftochimik. In the domestic championship, CSKA had only 16 players registered for the 1999–2000 season and some un-indexed players took part in official UEFA games. Consequently, at the shareholders meeting at the end of 1999, the club ownership was transferred to businessman Vasil Bozhkov, who became majority owner.|$|E
25|$|Their Championship cricket {{was less}} impressive, as they {{lost sight of}} the leaders after a four-wicket defeat to Kent, where they conceded 232 in 35 overs to lose the match, and their one-day form was as woeful as usual, as they conceded 219 runs in 22 overs to Sussex in a {{shortened}} Sunday League game at Guildford, which they lost by 48 runs. A draw - their sixth of the Championship season - with Nottinghamshire followed, to leave them fourth in the table, twenty points adrift of the leaders Nottinghamshire. The Twenty20 Cup semi-finals and final was hosted at Surrey's home ground The Oval, but the home fans were <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team as Surrey went out in the semi-finals to Lancashire Lightning.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Toulouse contested the Challenge Yves du Manoir against US Dax, losing 18 to 8. Eleven {{years after}} the CA Bègles defeat, the club was again <b>disappointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final, being {{defeated}} by AS Béziers {{in the championship game}} of 1980. The latter end of the decade was however, reminiscent of the 1920s sides. Toulouse were again contesting the Challenge Yves du Manoir for the 1984 season, though they lost to RC Narbonne 17 to 3. They did however claim their first championship since 1947, defeating RC Toulon in the 1985 final. The following season saw them successfully defend their championship, defeating SU Agen in the final. After a number of defeats in the Challenge Yves du Manoir finals, Toulouse defeated US Dax to win the 1988 competition. Both Toulon and Agen won the following premierships (1987 and 1988) but Toulouse won another championship in 1989.|$|E
