40|$|The use {{of falling}} weight <b>deflectometers</b> and {{portable}} falling weight <b>deflectometers</b> (PFWDs) is now common for field characterization of pavement system layers. In particular, {{the application of}} portable <b>deflectometers</b> in quality assurance of newly constructed granular base has become more widespread. Typically, these devices are used for an in situ assessment of the Young’s modulus of the base layer. The tradi-tional backcalculation uses an elastostatic half-space framework to relate Young’s modulus of the pavement foundation to the stiffness estimates obtained from force and velocity measurements. The data interpreta-tion method that is customarily used for stiffness estimation uses peak values of the force and displacement records in lieu of their static counterparts. The performance of a particular device, PRIMA 100, was examined with the newly developed beam verification tester (BVT) of known static stiffness.

40|$|Data {{collected}} from heavy weight <b>deflectometers</b> (HWD) tests at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instrumented Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement test site at Denver International Airport (DIA) {{are used to}} analyze the deflection response of the pavement. The HWD tests are conducted routinely for slabs in both the traffic and the nontraffic area. The deflection measurements show that a linear relationship exists between surface deflection and load {{at the center of the}} slabs and at the mid-points of the joints. Some of the tests were also run with the HWD weight dropped directly over multidepth <b>deflectometers</b> (MDDs) in the pavement. Deflections at the interior, joints, and corners of a slab measured by the HWD are compared to those measured by the MDDs at different depths. The analysis shows that the movement of an anchor at 3 meter (10 feet) below the slab surface had significant effects on the measured pavement surface deflection while the effects of movement of an anchor at 6 -meter (20 -feet) depth may be negligible.

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the ICE: Transport [© Thomas Telford]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] {{the construction of the}} foundations of paved infrastructure followed a recipe approach where specified materials are laid using specified plant in an approved way following a method specification. This approach is prescriptive and limits material use to those that meet the recipe assuming a given level of performance after completion. To encourage sustainability the UK Highways Agency launched new pavement and foundation design guidance that is moving away from this prescriptive approach (IAN 73 / 06 revised in 2009, and HA 26 / 06). The guidance aims to allow a more flexible design and assessment of the required foundation performance parameters of strength and resistance to permanent deformation. This also introduced a stiffness assessment of the constructed foundation to confirm compliance with design. In contrast to the previous regime, the actual performance of the foundation can influence (and provide savings to) the design of the structural pavement layers above. The new guidance permits the use of lightweight <b>deflectometers</b> to assess stiffness compliance. These are becoming increasingly common tools in the checking of foundations of paved infrastructure.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{performance of}} surface slope metrology instrumentation, such as long trace profilers and auto collimator based <b>deflectometers,</b> {{is limited by}} systematic errors that are increased when the entire angular range is used for metrology of significantly curved optics. At the ALS X Ray Optics Laboratory, {{in collaboration with the}} HZB BESSY II and PTB Germany metrology teams, we are working on a calibration method for <b>deflectometers,</b> based on a concept of a universal test mirror UTM [V. V. Yashchuk et al., Proc. SPIE 6704, 67040 A 2007]. Potentially, the UTM method provides high performance calibration and accounts for peculiarities of the optics under test e. g., slope distribution and the experimental arrangement e. g., the distance between the sensor and the optic under test. At the same time, the UTM calibration method is inherently universal, applicable to a variety of optics and experimental arrangements. In this work, we present the results of tests with a key component of the UTM system, a custom high precision tilt stage, which has been recently developed in collaboration with Physik Instrumente, GmbH. The tests have demonstrated high performance of the stage and its capability after additional calibration to provide angular calibration of surface slope measuring profilers over the entire instrumental dynamic range with absolute accuracy better than 30 nrad.

The purpose of the given work is to research the actual stress-train state of the point of connection of the stringers with the floor beams on condition of their staged interposition.

To reach {{the purpose of the}} study the testing of the existing bridge was conducted. To measure strains (stresses) in the span elements we used the strain gages glued to flange angles of stringers and floor beams and to fillets of lower flange angles of stringers in the points of their support on floor beams. To measure deflections of the truss, stringers and floor beams from static loads we used Aistov’s and Maksimov’s <b>deflectometers,</b> that were installed on lower boom in the middle of span 0 - 1, as well as on both stringers and floor beams in the middle of the span. <b>Deflectometers</b> were fastened to the span and, by wire communication, to the ground surface.

40|$|Pavement {{management}} systems (PMS) have historically relied on distress (e. g., cracking, and rutting) and roughness (e. g., International Roughness Index or IRI) as key pavement performance indicators in the decisions-making process. Both are important indicators that merit emphasis within the PMS process, {{but they are}} not the only ones. Structural adequacy, for example, is another important pavement performance indicator that is critical to making rational pavement rehabilitation decisions.

Deflection testing for the structural evaluation of pavements has been around for decades. Falling Weight <b>Deflectometers</b> (FWDs) represent the state-of-the-practice in pavement deflection testing; however, FWD testing is a stop-and-go operation that requires lane closures (hence can cause traffic disruptions and create a safety hazard) and that has limited production rates.

40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} high-definition surveys within {{cultural}} heritage-related projects {{represents one of}} the main factors which promoted the use of laser scanning technology. By measuring millions of points within relatively short time periods, terrestrial laser scanners allows to derive complete and very detailed 3 D models of real objects from acquired point clouds. These features drew in recent years the interest of surveyors, engineers, architects and archaeologists towards the laser scanning technique as an invaluable surveying mean for 3 D modeling of sites and artifacts of cultural heritage. A wide variety of objects, e. g., small pieces of pottery, statues, buildings, and large areas of archaeological sites, have been scanned and modeled for various purposes like preservation, reconstruction, study, and museum exhibitions. However, the use of TLS systems for stability control is still a research field not much investigated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{light weight}} <b>deflectometer</b> (LWD), {{also known as}} the light falling weight <b>deflectometer,</b> light drop weight tester, and dynamic plate load test, is a hand {{portable}} device that was developed in Germany to measure the soil in situ LWD dynamic modulus. Typically, this modulus is used to evaluate the subsoil degree of compaction. Thus it is suitable for compaction quality control of soil-surfaced roads, embankments and replacement fill. As a dynamic test, the device is suited, in particular, for coarse and mixed grained soils with a maximum grain size of 63 mm. The response of poorly graded calcareous and siliceous sands is the focus of this research. First, the index soil properties of the tested soils including grain size distribution; maximum and minimum void ratios and specific gravity were obtained. Petrographic analyses of the tested sands were also performed to determine their mineralogical composition. A 1 -m 3 chamber was built for performing the LWD testing in the laboratory. The study was performed for relative densities of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % to represent the behavior of very loose, loose, medium dense and dense sands.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to provide a}} qualitative assessment of the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s Intelligent Compaction (IC) Specifications. IC is an attractive approach to evaluate the compaction quality because it involves continuous and instantaneous evaluation of the soil through machine-drive power or drum vibration monitoring. Four construction sites utilizing IC were visited: (1) TH 36 in North St. Paul, involving both granular and nongranular soils; (2) US 10 in Staples, with granular soil; (3) TH 60 in Bigelow, with nongranular soil; (4) US 10 in Detroit Lakes, involving both granular and nongranular soils. The report integrates comments from the four site visits and provides an interpretation on the use of IC at each site. As the technology now exists on the equipment used at these locations, IC provides only an index, which is specific to the conditions associated with a particular site. An interpretation of comments provided the basis for the following recommendations: • Use light weight <b>deflectometers</b> (LWD) for quality assurance of stiffness • Establish a procedure to determine the target LWD value • Eliminate calibration areas (control strips) • Simplify IC data evaluation and presentation • Calibrate the IC roller and related transducers • Support development of alternative IC methodologies • Simplify or eliminate moisture correctionsMinnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
