This ranking came from The Learning Curve global <b>education</b> <b>report,</b> published by education firm Pearson. The report assesses performance rates of pupils in reading, writing and maths and is based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

25|$|Wesley himself opened {{schools at}} The Foundery in London, and Kingswood School. A Wesleyan report in 1832 {{said that for}} the church to prosper the system of Sunday schools should be {{augmented}} by day-schools with educated teachers. It was proposed in 1843 that 700 new day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited by the number of suitably qualified teachers. Most teachers came from one institution in Glasgow. The Wesleyan <b>Education</b> <b>Report</b> for 1844 called for a permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college. The result was the foundation of Westminster Training College at Horseferry Road, Westminster in 1851.|$|E
25|$|As per the Annual Status of <b>Education</b> <b>Report</b> (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural {{children}} between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. Another report from 2013 stated that there were 22.9 crore students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 23 lakh students over 2002 total enrollment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrollment. While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day. States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.|$|E
25|$|The School serves 176 {{students}} in grades 9-11. The school is operated in partnership with Eastern University.

Students receive extra help through tutoring during and after school using computer assisted programs such as Achieve 3000 (reading) and Apangea for mathematics.
