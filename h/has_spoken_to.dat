2500|$|Don {{was once}} nearly {{married to a}} fellow agent named Kim Hall, but that {{relationship}} ended {{when he returned to}} L.A. [...] Owing to his distant demeanor and predilection for isolation, Charlie was unaware of this relationship. As Don's fiancée long ago, Kim Hall had a chance to come to know Don and observed that the brothers had [...] "one part exuberance, two parts obsession," [...] after she was assigned to a case working alongside the two. He had also once dated an ATF agent, and was pained to find out that she called him before she was killed. The prosecutor Nadine Hodges (Sarah Carter [...] ) seems to be smitten with him and vice versa. In the episode [...] "Guns and Roses", he decides to investigate his flirtation with AUSA Robin Brooks (Michelle Nolden [...] ). In [...] "Blackout," [...] after Robin broke up with him, Don became involved in a brief romance with Special Agent Liz Warner, whom he remembers for having an issue with adrenaline and being wild. He often makes reference to the difficulties in maintaining a relationship, given his career, as does his family.

2500|$|Flair {{engaged in}} an {{off-screen}} rivalry with Bret Hart. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview {{in which he said}} Flair [...] "sucks" [...] and described his workplace, WCW, as [...] "minor league". In Flair's autobiography, Flair criticizes Hart for over-exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as [...] "plain ridiculous" [...] in a column written for the Calgary Sun. Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart acknowledged a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he and others felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well publicized sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWF stars. In contrast to Flair's claims, prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer said there was [...] "no denying" [...] Hart's major drawing power in the United States. WWE owner Vince McMahon asserted that whichever company hired Hart could [...] "have built the entire franchise around Hart" [...] and described him as an [...] "extraordinary star". McMahon added that it was [...] "fortunate for me, in terms of my company", that his chief competitor, WCW, did not utilize Hart to his full potential. WCW described Hart as [...] "an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe". Professional wrestling magazine Power Slam <b>has</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Hart's drawing power, placing him number 7 in [...] "The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders", a list that considered drawing ability along with workrate and promo skills. Hart also criticized Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle blading. However, they have reconciled and are now friends.|$|E
