5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> {{and cost of}} living is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, {{much of the}} area between Tyldesley and Astley has been built on for housing. Indicators show that the {{township}} has a strong <b>housing</b> <b>market,</b> with a high owner occupancy rate of almost 80%. Parts of Astley are among the 5% least deprived areas in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, whilst parts of the Blackmoor area, where social housing is concentrated, are within the 10–20% most deprived neighbourhoods nationally. Facilities in the village include a small local shopping centre at Blackmoor. The development of Astley Green Colliery Museum and the heritage centre at Damhouse attract visitors interested in the area's heritage.|$|E

50|$|In <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> where commuters are wealthier {{and small}} town <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> weaker than city <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> or suburbs, the {{development}} of a bedroom community may raise local housing prices and attract upscale service businesses in a process called gentrification. Long-time residents may be displaced by new commuter residents due to rising house prices. This can also be influenced by zoning restrictions in urbanised areas that prevent the construction of suitably cheap housing closer to places of employment.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how Spain’s <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> {{reacted to}} the far-reaching changes that affected the demand for dwellings during {{the first phase of}} the rural-urban transition process. To this end, we construct a new hedonic index of real housing prices and assemble a cross-regional panel dataset of price fundamentals. The results of our econometric analysis suggest that <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> did not face supply constraints, responded swiftly to the growing demand for accommodation and were efficient. In light of this new evidence, we conclude that <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> were not a burden for Spanish economic development and that Spain’s institutional and regulatory frameworks were suitable for the housing needs at the time.

5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

40|$|Please do not quote without {{permission}} This paper proposes a simple statistical {{explanation for the}} phenomenon of extreme bids observed during <b>house</b> <b>market</b> booms. During a boom period the <b>house</b> <b>market</b> regime switches from a single bidder to a multiple bidder environment. The sale price in a multiple bidder auction is the maximum bid, {{and the distribution of}} maximum bids contains a much higher proportion of extreme bids compared with the distribution of single bidder valuations. The inevitability and simplicity of this statistical explanation of extreme bids in a rising <b>house</b> <b>market</b> justifies its claim to be the default explanation under the principle of Occam's razor. This statistical explanation of extreme bids during a <b>house</b> <b>market</b> boom is consistent with the observed phenomenon of estate agents lowering their offers over price during a boom...|$|R

30|$|Explanations for co-movements of {{regional}} house prices are manifold, complex {{and could be}} drawn from social, economic and political linkages among regional territories. Meen (1999) provides four possible explanations {{that may lead to}} spillover effects among regional <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> – inter-regional migration, equity transfer, spatial arbitrage and local economic developments. Jones and Leishman (2006) also indicate that ripple effects are partly caused by spatial arbitrage process through household migration between local <b>housing</b> <b>markets.</b> They believe that various determinants of house prices in local <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> (i.e. regional heterogeneity) result in a multitude of spatial patterns, and as a result, it may influence household migration.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{interpretation}} of the role of emotions in animating <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> which complements more traditional economic and behavioural studies of locally based house-price inflation. Looking to debates within social psychology and cultural studies we suggest that emotions permeate the materiality and meaning of <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> as well as the experience of individuals acting within them. Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in Edinburgh, with households who bought in a rising market, we argue that housing transactions are emotional as well as economic affairs. We reconsider the fears that underpin what might appear to be ‘irrational exuberance’ and we argue that <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> are propelled by a search for returns on emotional as well as financial investments. ...|$|R
