40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to the existing literature focused on the stability of the classical gold exchange standard. Thus, it aims at explaining how the French Central Bank managed, between 1880 and 1913, to soften the tensions induced by international financial shocks. Until 1901, the use of the well known « gold devices » made it possible to depreciate the exchange rate to a much larger extent {{than it would have been}} feasible under a pure gold exchange system. But this policy was fiercely questioned among the private bankers who were also regents of the Bank, as they argued that it fostered a loss of confidence in the currency. It was then left over and gradually supplanted by direct intervention on English monetary markets, whose role was to soften financial tensions at their roots, instead of widening the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margin</b> of the exchange rate.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the authors}} propose the {{supercapacitor}} integration strategy in a hybrid series vehicle. The designed vehicle is an experimental test bench {{developed at the}} Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Systems (L 2 ES) {{in collaboration with the}} Research in Electrical Engineering and Electronics Center of Belfort (CREEBEL). This test bench currently has two diesel motors (each connected to one alternator) and lead-acid batteries with a voltage rating of 540 V and a <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margin</b> between + 12 % and − 20 % of the rated voltage. The alternators are connected to the dc link by rectifiers. An original strategy of the supercapacitor integration in this vehicle with their control is presented to find a better compromise between the dimensions of the embarked devices, the share energy efficiency, the dynamics of the supply, and the electric power storage. The supercapacitor packs are made up of two modules of 108 cells each and present a maximum voltage of 270 V. The main objective is to provide a peak power of 216 kW over 20 s from supercapacitors to the dc link. Various topologies of dc/dc converters are presented with effective methodologies of electric power management in the hybrid vehicle...|$|E

Because of {{the liquid}} phase’s driving action, {{particles}} would be collided the surface and impacted {{with each other in}} the flow passage, the surface will be machined though the continuous action of impact force and friction force. The finishing results of structural surface is related to the collision frequency and the pressure, abrasion situation in different area of the structural surface can be analyzed obviously by investigating dynamic characteristic and distribution of particle group. Based on coupled wave theory of liquid-solid two phases flow, using mixture model which belongs to Euler-Euler multiphase flow model and realizable k-ε turbulence model, turbulence effects of liquid-solid two-phase flow in the wall is numerical simulated and some parameters such as turbulent velocity and turbulent energy are calculated with different particles concentration in the flow passage which has V-shaped texture and semicircular cross-section. The simulation results show that the disorder degree of turbulence can be improved by assembling V-shaped constrained component, because V-shaped passage is benefit of eddy current’s generation. As the concentration of particles being enhanced, the velocity of particle would be increased in a certain range, turbulence energy reduces gradually, <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margin</b> of particle volume fraction is smaller and smaller, and curves of every kind of parameters change as continuous oscillation, area of surface corresponded with crest of the curve.

40|$|In {{this report}} the {{capability}} of nuclear power plants {{to adapt to the}} demand is examined and several types of regulations needed for this are explained. From design there exists a power <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margin</b> and this is also an important characteristic of the design rules agreed upon by the European Utility Requirements (EUR rules) that should apply to the new builds in Europe. In the last chapter of this report the fluctuation margins as needed from wind farms are estimated from the experience gained in the wind turbines installations from Scandinavia and from the US. This allows an estimation of the compatibility of wind and nuclear generating units in a geographic area. A central point {{of this study was to}} consider to what extent the contribution of NPPs to grid regulation impairs their economical profitability due to possible higher O&M costs. In a liberalised electricity market price components are not communicated. Consequently no precise cost data were available and the study is based on personal communication and on aggregated data from an IAEA database collecting yearly average loss of production of NPPs worldwide. The study shows that the supplementary O&M costs due to load-following like operating mode can be majored by 2 % of the theoretical available capacity of a power plant. These supplementary costs allow a power plant to be eligible for regulation which is associated with much higher electricity prices than if the unit is always producing base-load electricity. The conclusion may need to be reconsidered in case of a larger share of intermittent electricity generation. The decisive factor on this is the price at which reserve capacity is to be sold. This will be the adjustment factor and this last is more dependent on the share of the intermittent energy than of the nature of the backup plants. JRC. DDG.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} alternative {{exchange rate}} regimes for the East European accession candidates, both prior to EU accession and following EU accession but prior to EMU membership. We conclude that, {{from an economic}} point of view, EMU membership should be as early as possible. There is, however, a risk that prevailing interpretations of the inflation and exchange rate criteria for EMU membership could lead to unnecessary delays in EMU membership for the accession countries. The exchange rate criterion for EMU membership requires that the candidate "has respected the normal <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margins</b> provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System without severe tensions {{for at least the}} last two years before the examination. " Both this text and the precedents of Finland, Italy and Greece, support the view that the exchange rate criterion can be satisfied without two years of formal ERM II membership. Insistence on at least two years of formal ERM II membership for the accession countries would result in an unnecessary, costly and potentially risky stay in EMU purgatory.               JEL Codes: F 33, P 33, F 15 Keywords: EMU, EU, Exchange Rates</p...|$|R

40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the European Union raises {{a series of questions}} related to new member states' entry to the EU's exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II) and their subsequent adoption of the euro. This paper considers how to determine the best initial central parity for new EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe toward entering ERM II.

In this paper, the issue of how to determine the central parity for the acceding countries with which to enter ERM-II is tackled. This is followed by a discussion of the asymmetric nature of the fluctuation bands around the central parity that could be deemed as compatible with the Maastricht criterion on exchange rate stability, i. e. + 2. 25 %/- 15 % within the officially announced ± 15 % <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margins.</b> Then, practices of the European Monetary Institute/ECB and the European Commission are compared when assessing the criterion on exchange rate stability.

Based on this, given ex post exchange rate variability and the limited intra-marginal intervention facilities ERM-II participant countries have at their disposal, the defence of the asymmetric band appears a tricky task even though the + 2. 25 % limit on the weaker side of the band is rendered somewhat intangible by a 10 -day moving average rule used by the EMI/ECB and further flexibility is given to the system in that a depreciation of more than 2. 25 % is not automatically viewed as a non-fulfilment of the criterion on exchange rate stability...|$|R

The fluctuation {{of the ice}} margins of the Tete de Cirque, Glacier 12, Windy Lake, Niflheim and Glacier 20 A glaciers were analysed using geometrically rectified aerial photographs taken between 1948 and 1977. IKONOS and LANDSAT 7 ETM+ satellite imagery covering the 1977 to 2003 period were also used. The results indicate a mean annual ice margin retreat of 8. 9 m per year during the 1948 to 2003 period. Compared to south and west-facing glaciers, the ones facing north are characterize by a smaller annual retreat rate. Ice <b>margin</b> <b>fluctuations</b> since the Little Ice Age were evaluated using lichenometric measurements of Rhizocarpon geographicum found on the moraines of the Turnweather, Tete de Cirques, Glacier 12, Windy Lake, Niflheim, Glacier 20 A and Sivingavuk glaciers.

40|$|Estimation and {{simulation}} of sustainable real exchange rates {{in some of}} the new EU accession countries point to potential difficulties in sustaining the ERM 2 regime if entered too soon and with weak policies. According to the estimates, the Czech, Hungarian, and Polish currencies were overvalued in 2003. Simulations, conditional on large-model macroeconomic projections, suggest that under current policies those currencies would be unlikely to stay within the ERM 2 stability corridor during 2004 - 10. In-sample simulations for Greece, Portugal, and Spain indicate both a much smaller misalignment of national currencies prior to ERM 2, and a more stable path of real exchange rates over the medium term than can be expected for the new accession countries.

This significant short-term variability highlights the need for geologic records of preinstrumental GIS <b>margin</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in order to better predict future GIS response to climate change. Using 10 Be surface exposure ages and radiocarbon-dated lake sediments, we constructed a detailed chronology of ice-margin fluctuations over the past 10 k. y. for Jakobshavn Isbræ, Greenland's largest outlet glacier. In addition, we present new estimates of corresponding local temperature changes using a continuous record of insect (Chironomidae) remains preserved in lake sediments. We find that following an early Holocene advance just prior to 8 ka, Jakobshavn Isbræ retreated rapidly at a rate of ∼ 100 m yr− 1, likely in response to increasing regional and local temperatures. Ice remained behind its present margin for ∼ 7 k. y. during a warm period in the middle Holocene with sustained temperatures ∼ 2 °C warmer than today, then the land-based margin advanced at least 2 – 4 km between A.

A portion of the 1962 image (37. 5 km x 37. 5 km) taken on May 17, 1962 (Figure l(a)) shows the calving margin of Jakobshavn Glacier, one of the world's fastest moving glaciers reaching speeds up to 7 kin/year near the calving front [lken et al., 1993]. Figure 1 also includes subsequent, similar images acquired by aerial photography on July 10, 1985 (Figure l(b)), by the SPOT (System Pour IObservation de la Terre) visible imaging satellite on May 30, 1988 (Figure l(c)) and by the 1996, the terminus of Jakobshavn Glacier seasonally European Space Agency's SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) fluctuated- 2. 5 km around its annual mean position. The total calving flux during the summer is more than six times that during winter.

We constrain the onset of ice-margin retreat from outer Disko Bugt to 10. 8 ± 0. 5 ka. When combined with previous chronologies, these results place the final Greenland Ice Sheet retreat out of Disko Bugt onto land at Jakobshavn Isfjord and Qasigiaanguit at 10. 1 ± 0. 3 ka, and later at 9. 2 ± 0. 1 ka in southeastern Disko Bugt. The rate of retreat during this time period is between ∼ 50 – 450 m a− 1 for central Disko Bugt and ∼ 50 – 70 m a− 1 along the southern coast of Disko Bugt. Deglaciation of Disko Bugt occurred ∼ 1000 years later than in neighboring Uummannaq Fjord to the north. This asynchrony in the timing of deglaciation suggests that local ice dynamics played an important role in the retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet from large marine embayments in western Greenland...|$|R
40|$|The Younger Dryas (YD) is a well-constrained cold event from 12, 900 to 11, 700 {{years ago}} but it remains unclear how the cooling and {{subsequent}} abrupt warming recorded in ice cores was translated into ice <b>margin</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in Greenland. Here we present 10 Be surface exposure ages from three moraines in front of local glaciers on a 50 km stretch along the north coast of Greenland, facing the Arctic Ocean. Ten ages range from 11. 6 ± 0. 5 to. 2 ± 0. 9 ka {{with a mean age}} of 12. 5 ± 0. 7 ka after exclusion of two outliers. We consider this to be a minimum age for the abandonment of the moraines. The ages of the moraines are furthermore constrained using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of epishelf sediments, which were deposited prior to the ice advance that formed the moraines, yielding a maximum age of 12. 4 ± 0. 6 ka, and bracketing the formation and subsequent abandonment of the moraines to within the interval 11. 8 - 13. 0 ka ago. This is the first time a synchronous YD glacier advance and subsequent retreat has been recorded for several independent glaciers in Greenland. In most other areas, there is no evidence for re-advance and glaciers were retreating during YD. We explain the different behaviour of the glaciers in northernmost Greenland as a function of their remoteness from the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which in other areas has been held responsible for modifying the YD drop in temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} have {{called into question}} the established principles of successful business management. These developments find expression in the increasing saturation of "first world" markets, where demand tends towards individualization. Reasons are a demographic shift resulting in an aging population and a fragmentation of target groups. In addition, an ongoing and deepening process of internationalization and deregulation has taken place over the past years. It has opened up new sales and supply markets, but also initiated {{a new type of}} competition at international level. From a technological point of view, the innovation cycles have steadily shortened due to new technological solutions at product and process level and in information and communication technology. Numerous expert papers on manufacturing engineering describe the trend towards a more dynamic environment, along with more customized products, using the terms "turbulence" or "environmental turbulence". A highly complex and dynamic environment makes it difficult to generate forecasts and confronts manufacturing companies with new challenges in global competition. Customers call for highly customized products with state-of-the art technology to be delivered as soon as possible, while being less and less willing to pay for it. To remain successful, companies must counteract the increasing requirements at product, price and service level. The future will only see those companies survive in the market that continue to meet the exact needs of their customers. These companies must be able, at any time, to identify new trends or spark new ones. With a lower degree of vertical integration, they need to focus on their core competencies and produce products in value chains or networks of competent, creative and innovative companies. That is why learning how to manage a network, and to think and to act in terms of a network, are essential capabilities. Many of the activities carried out by companies - often to cut down on costs - increase the significance of high-quality network management. Examples are known as "global sourcing", "outsourcing" (focus on core competencies by contracting out value-adding activities, e. g. modularization in vehicle construction), but also the ongoing reduction of stocks and the amount of capital tied-up. A greater inclusion of partners distributed across the world, as well as the reduction of safety stocks to a minimum, require a well-functioning network. To this must be added the growing market demand for short delivery times, for a more flexible handling of customer change requests and for high schedule reliability. As a result, the call for greater stability and flexibility does not only affect the network as a whole, but each individual customer-supplier interface in the network. Moreover, the number of interfaces grows with ongoing intertwining of the network. Above all, these changes require raising the quality of process synchronization in order to optimize the customer-supplier-interfaces. Several solutions have been pursued as part of supply chain management, but they do not go far enough. The following three key problems arise in industrial practice: - There are no universal indicators - resulting in a lack of visibility - which allow to measure the quality of a customer's order and call-off patterns. That's why this advance information is not considered appropriately, even though it has a considerable impact on the delivery performance of the supplier. - There are numerous turbulence germs in the companies that trigger fluctuations in the order and call-off patterns. There is a lack of methods to identify and eliminate self-induced turbulence. - Growing environmental turbulence results more often in externally driven turbulence, i. e. market- or consumer-driven turbulence. There are no appropriate approaches in science and business that enable arrangements which minimize turbulence between customer and supplier. The aim of this thesis is therefore to find concrete solutions to the three problems described above in order to contribute to the process synchronization of customer-supplier interfaces. The quality of the customer-supplier interface is a key determinant of competitiveness in a manufacturing environment where series products are manufactured at regular intervals over an extended period. Both the continuous order flow and the deliveries at short intervals provide the necessary basis for a model that allows analyzing and designing the order pattern. The model developed in this thesis is based on two key components for the analysis and design of order patterns. The first part describes a method to quantify order patterns {{so that they can be}} sorted into quality categories. A company can thus assess both its own order pattern as well as that of its customers. The outcome allows interpreting the order pattern. The interpretation determines if and how problematic the measured order pattern is for the network and if this order pattern is "logically comprehensible". The analysis model considers the four key trouble spots identified when assessing the state of the art. These four areas of action require taking into full consideration the three dimensions of order quantity, order date and delivery date, the identification of actual customer needs, the risks associated with fluctuation, and the relationship between fluctuation characteristics and possible causes of fluctuations. This interpretation provides the basis for the design part of the developed model. It recommends specific actions to eliminate self- and externally induced turbulence germs. Specific cause-and-effect relationships referring to exemplary fluctuation patterns and associated typical 'obstacles' in real life help to reduce the self-induced order fluctuations. Due to the fact that many turbulence germs are externally induced and therefore cannot be avoided, this thesis suggests how customer and supplier can handle the expected fluctuations by agreeing on <b>fluctuation</b> <b>margins.</b> The analysis of the "state of the art" revealed two major criteria: specific dependencies between products or variants in terms of flexible delivery need to be considered, and a practical approach developed for customers and suppliers to come to such an agreement. The model presented here makes an important contribution to improving collaboration at the customer-supplier interface and thus to making networks more stable. The model has been verified by an abstract data model proving that the requirements set for such a model can be satisfied. Moreover, it is also possible to apply subcomponents of the developed model in practice, for example, when working out customer-supplier agreements, which is also possible without an advance retrograde analysis of the order pattern...|$|R

For coverage plans that have additional benefits, a minimum reserve surplus of $500,000 to $2,000,000 must be established. The applicable authority can permit the plan sponsor to substitute cash holdings with securities, guarantees, hold-harmless arrangements, or any other financial arrangement to fulfill the AHP's financial obligations on a timely basis. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, a Solvency Standards Working Group is to be established to enforce the Act's solvency standards, consisting of at least one representative from NAIC, the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA), the state government, existing self-insured arrangements, the associations, and of group health plans. In its quarterly reports, if the board of trustees determines the plan to be failing to meet solvency standards, then the board must consult with a qualified health actuary to enact corrective measures. If these measures are not enacted or if the solvency of the plan remains questioned, and the applicable authority believes the plan to continue to fail to meet solvency standards, then the board of trustees, under direction of the applicable authority, shall terminate the plan and take actions to satisfy any claims, as necessary to ensure that the plan provides benefits in a timely manner to its participants and beneficiaries.

Cuando se producen discrepancias, el auditor debe generar hipótesis sobre las posibles causas, evaluarlas y elegir la más plausible. Los estándares de auditoría requieren que los auditores consulten a la dirección para encontrar explicaciones que justifiquen fluctuaciones inesperadas. Investigaciones empíricas anteriores revelan que las explicaciones de la dirección influyen en la generación de hipótesis y en los procedimientos analíticos.

In case of discrepancies, the auditor has to generate hypotheses with regard to potential causes, evaluate these hypotheses and select the most plausible one.

40|$|Rapidly {{increased}} {{demands for}} memory in electronic {{industry and the}} significant technical scaling challenges of all conventional memory technologies motivated the researches on the next generation memory technology. As one promising candidate, spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) features fast access time, high density, non-volatility, and good CMOS process compatibility. In recent years, many researches have been conducted to improve the storage density and enhance the scalability of STT-RAM, such as reducing the write current and switching time of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) devices. In parallel with these efforts, the continuous increasing of tunnel magneto-resistance(TMR) ratio of the MTJ inspires the development of multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM, which allows multiple data bits be stored in a single memory cell. Two types of MLC STT-RAM cells, namely, parallel MLC and series MLC, were also proposed. However, like all other nanoscale devices, the performance and reliability of STT-RAM cells are severely affected by process variations, intrinsic device operating uncertainties and environmental <b>fluctuations.</b> The storage <b>margin</b> of a MLC STT-RAM cell, i. e., {{the distinction between the}} lowest and highest resistance states, is partitioned into multiple segments for multi-level data representation. As a result, the performance and reliability of MLC STT-RAM cells become more sensitive to the MOS and MTJ device variations and the thermal-induced randomness of MTJ switching. In this work, we systematically analyze the impacts of CMOS and MTJ process variations, MTJ resistance switching randomness that induced by intrinsic thermal fluctuations, and working temperature changes on STT-RAM cell designs. The STT-RAM cell reliability issues in both read and write operations are first investigated. A combined circuit and magnetic simulation platform is then established to quantitatively study the persistent and non-persistent errors in STT-RAM cell operations. Then, we analyzed the extension of STT-RAM cell behaviors from SLC (single-level- cell) to MLC (multi-level- cell). On top of that, we also discuss the optimal device parameters of the MLC MTJ for the minimization of the operation error rate of the MLC STT-RAM cells from statistical design perspective. Our simulation results show that under the current available technology, series MLC STT-RAM demonstrates overwhelming benefits in the read and write reliability compared to parallel MLC STT-RAM and could potentially satisfy the requirement of commercial practices. Finally, with the detail analysis study of STT-RAM cells, we proposed several error reduction design, such as ADAMS structure, and FA-STT structure...|$|R
40|$|Auditing {{standards}} require auditors {{to collect}} 'sufficient appropriate' audit evidence, but fails to provide auditors with guidance {{on how to}} do so. Research in psychology calls the cognitive mechanisms to terminate the information search process "stopping rules". The limited literature in psychology identifies four main stopping rules used by decision-makers: magnitude threshold, difference threshold, mental model and mental list. The literature gives little guidance on which of these stopping rules would be used by auditors of financial statements. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the stopping rules used by auditors and to use behavioural decision theory to investigate the impact of the auditor&# 146;s knowledge, environment and motivation on auditor stopping rules and decision-making performance. Study One was a verbal protocol study using detailed case study to examine the identification of significant risks at the pre-planning stage of the audit. Participants conducted the task while thinking-aloud to capture their conscious cognitive processes. A checklist similar to those provided to audit staff was provided and used at their discretion. The results identified that auditors used multiple stopping rules during the large, complex and unstructured task. The mental model stopping rule was used to the greatest extent and supplemented by use of the other rules (most often the mental list). This is a significant extension to the stopping rule literature as previously it was reported that decision-makers use only a single stopping rule when determining to cease searching for information. It was also found that the stopping rule itself did not affect performance, but how the participant used the stopping rule; for example use of the mental model alone does not improve performance, but how an auditor uses the mental model. The second study was a behavioural experiment with the smaller, less complex task of identifying the cause of an unexpected gross <b>margin</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> Participants continued to use multiple stopping rules during the conduct of the task, though the magnitude threshold stopping rule was used to a greater extent. The level of risk impacted auditor performance, due to both increasing the accuracy of the participant&# 146;s initial cause selection and also {{the extent to which the}} participant used the mental model stopping rule. Time budget pressure was found to impact performance via its effect on selecting the correct initial cause...|$|R
40|$|Ein immer turbulenter werdendes Umfeld und die damit verbundenen höheren Anforderungen an die Stabilität und Flexibilität von ganzen Netzwerken stellt Industrieunternehmen vor eine neue Ausgangssituation. Die veränderten Umfeldbedingungen sind mit Risiken verbundenen, bieten aber allen Beteiligten auch die große Chance, sich zukünftige Wettbewerbsvorteile zu sichern. Das Thema gewinnt insofern an Bedeutung, als eigentlich jedes Industrieunternehmen ungeachtet seiner Größe tagtäglich in Netzwerken über seine zahlreichen Schnittstellen agiert. Genau hier unterstützt die vorliegende Arbeit die Schaffung einer neuen Qualität der Prozess-Synchronisation an der Schnittstelle zu anderen Unternehmen. Die hier formulierten Anforderungen und die Darstellung des Standes der Technik zeigen, dass verbesserte und neue Prinzipien, Verfahren und Modelle zur Harmonisierung von Kunden-Lieferanten-Beziehungen notwendig sind. Das in dieser Arbeit entwickelte Modell basiert auf den zwei Kernbausteinen Analyse und Gestaltung von Bestellverhalten. Im ersten Teil wird eine Methode zur Quantifizierung von Bestellverhalten beschrieben, mit deren Hilfe das Bestellverhaltens einer Güteklasse zugeordnet wird. Ein Unternehmen kann damit sowohl sein eigenes Bestellverhalten oder das seines Kunden bewerten. Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse wird dann das Bestellverhalten interpretiert. Diese Interpretation belegt, inwieweit das gemessene Bestellverhalten ein Problem im Netzwerk darstellt, und inwieweit dieses Bestellverhalten „logisch nachvollziehbar“ ist. Das Analysemodell berücksichtigt dabei die wesentlichen vier Handlungsbedarfe, die bei der Bewertung des Standes der Technik identifiziert wurden. Diese vier Handlungsbedarfe beziehen sich auf die ganzheitliche Berücksichtigung der drei Dimensionen Bestellmenge, Bestelltermin und Zeitpunkt der Bestellung, die Identifikation des tatsächlichen Kundenwunsches, die mit einer Schwankung verbundenen Risiken sowie den Zusammenhang zwischen Schwankungscharakteristik und möglichen Schwankungsursachen. Diese Interpretation liefert damit die Basis für den Gestaltungsteil des hier entwickelten Modells. Darin werden konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen für eigen- und fremdinduzierte Turbulenzkeime vorgeschlagen. Bei der Reduzierung eigeninduzierter Bestellschwankungen helfen konkrete Ursachen-Wirkungs-Zusammenhänge zwischen beispielhaften Schwankungsmustern und dazugehörenden typischen „Stolpersteinen“ aus der Praxis. Da sich eine Vielzahl an Turbulenzen aufgrund ihres fremdinduzierten Charakters nicht vermeiden lassen, wird dargestellt, wie Kunde und Lieferant die zu erwartenden Turbulenzen mittels Schwankungskorridoren vereinbaren können. Bei der Analyse des „Standes der Technik“ wurden zwei besonders wichtige Kriterien identifiziert: die Berücksichtigung spezifischer Abhängigkeiten zwischen Produkten oder Varianten bezüglich der Lieferflexibilität sowie eine praxisnahe Vorgehensweise für Kunde und Lieferant zur Erlangung einer derartigen Vereinbarung. Das hier vorgestellte Modell leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur besseren Zusammenarbeit an der Schnittstelle Kunde-Lieferant und damit zur Stabilität ganzer Netzwerke. Die Verifizierung des Modells mit einem abstrahierten Datenmodell belegt, dass die Anforderungen an ein derartiges Modell erfüllt werden können. Darüber hinaus können auch Teilelemente des entwickelten Modells in der Praxis eingesetzt werden, etwa bei der Vereinbarung einer Kunden-Lieferanten-Vereinbarung, die auch ohne vorangehende {{retrograde}} Analyse des Bestellverhaltens möglich ist.

On {{the basis of}} morphology, the margin has been subdivided into shelf, upper continental slope, and a lower slope region cut by basins and ridges. Grain size, Sand component, and clay mineralogy were determined as well as water, organic carbon and carbonate contents. In addition, vane shear strength, magnetic intensity {{and the proportion of}} ice-rafted debris were measured, dating was done by detailed magnetic stratigraphy, the biofluctuation of the radiolarian Cycladophora davisiana and 230 -Thorium analyses. Sediment facies distribution is controlled by numerous factors such as regional bathymetry and circulation, biogenic productivity, seasonal ice cover and the deposition of terrigenous detritus by ice-rafting, bottom water transport and/or slumping. The complex interrelationship between these factors results in three main categories of sediment facies. The diamict facies is interpreted as an interglacial facies. It is composed of clayey silt and silt and is characterised by a large component of coarse, ice-rafted material such as gravel and sand (IRD). This generally strongly bioturbated sediment contains radiolarian and diatom-rich layers as well as horizons of lower water and organic carbon content. Magnetic intensities, related to volcanic ash particles, glauconite, and micromanganese nodules as well as a large quantity of rock fragments, are low. The biosiliceous and IRD content decreases from north to south along the South Orkney transect because of seasonal ice <b>margin</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> thus resulting in barren and IRD-poor interglacial deposits in the southern region. Apart from ice-rafting and biogenic productivity, bottom currents also exert a strong control on the distribution of this facies. Strong and fluctuating bottom current influence is documented by the sediment structures in this facies. The homogenous clay facies was deposited during glacial periods. These silty clays are generally barren with little ice-rafted material or rock fragments because of ice cover during glacial periods. The homogenous clay facies was probably deposited by bottom currents (contourite). In comparison to interglacial periods, current velocities during glacial periods must have been relatively weak due to the decreased formation of Antarctic Bottom Water and reduced water mass circulation. The homogenous clays are additionally characterised by higher water and organic carbon contents as well as higher magnetic intensity. They are only weakly bioturbated with burrows size smaller than in the diamictite facies. A bioturbated clay-size facies, with a composition {{similar to that of the}} diamictite facies, was deposited during the glacial to interglacial transition. The difference lies in the lower IRD and microfossil content. A weak current regime is indicated by the texture and sediment structures. On the basis of sediment sequences, three glacial and four interglacial periods have been distinguished in cores PS 1175 - 3, PS 1170, and PS 1167 - 9. The time span ranges from the Holocene to the interglacial at 340, 000 - 300, 000 Y. Increased IRD deposition by icebergs and an increase in the production of siliceous organisms occured during the maximum of the last glacial due to several short surges of the Antarctic ice shelf...|$|R
