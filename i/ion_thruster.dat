25|$|Deep Space 1 (DS1), which NASA {{launched}} in 1998, demonstrated the long-duration {{use of a}} xenon-propelled <b>ion</b> <b>thruster</b> on a science mission, and validated a number of technologies, including the NSTAR electrostatic <b>ion</b> <b>thruster,</b> as well as performing a flyby of an asteroid and a comet. In addition to the <b>ion</b> <b>thruster,</b> among the other technologies validated by the DS1 was the Small Deep Space Transponder, which is used on Dawn for long-range communication.|$|E
25|$|The first working <b>ion</b> <b>{{thruster}}</b> {{was built}} by Harold R. Kaufman in 1959 at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Ohio. The thruster {{was similar to the}} general design of a gridded electrostatic <b>ion</b> <b>thruster</b> with mercury as its propellant. Suborbital tests of the engine followed during the 1960s, and in 1964 the engine was tested on a suborbital flight aboard the Space Electric Rocket Test 1 (SERT 1). It successfully operated for the planned 31 minutes before falling back to Earth. This test was followed by an orbital test, SERT-2, in 1970.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2014, Dawn <b>ion</b> <b>thruster</b> {{unexpectedly}} ceased firing and {{the probe}} began {{operating in a}} triggered safe mode. To avoid a lapse in propulsion, the mission team hastily exchanged the active ion engine and electrical controller with another. The team stated {{that they had a}} plan in place to revive this disabled component later in 2014. The controller in the ion propulsion system may have been damaged by a high-energy particle. Upon exiting the safe mode on September 15, 2014, the probe's <b>ion</b> <b>thruster</b> resumed normal operation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> {{are used}} on some {{satellites}} and spacecraft. They are only effective in a vacuum, which limits their use to spaceborne vehicles. <b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> run primarily off electricity, {{but they also}} need a propellant such as caesium, or more recently xenon. <b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> can achieve extremely high speeds and use little propellant; however they are power-hungry.|$|R
40|$|To {{dispose of}} {{long-lived}} fission products (LLFPs) into outer space, an <b>ions</b> <b>thruster</b> {{can be used}} instead of a static accelerator. The specifications of the <b>ions</b> <b>thrusters</b> which are presently studies for space propulsion are presented, and their usability discussed. Using of a rocket with an <b>ions</b> <b>thruster</b> for disposing of the LLFPs directly into the sun required a larger amount of energy than does {{the use of an}} accelerator...|$|R
50|$|Among {{electric}} <b>thrusters,</b> <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> {{have received}} the most serious commercial and academic consideration. <b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> are seen as the best solution for these missions, as they require high change in velocity but do not require rapid acceleration.|$|R
25|$|Rockets {{deriving}} {{their power}} from external sources, {{such as a}} laser, could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing {{the mass of the}} ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds. Geoffrey A. Landis has proposed for an interstellar probe, with energy supplied by an external laser from a base station powering an <b>Ion</b> <b>thruster.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dawn {{carries a}} memory chip bearing {{the names of}} more than 360,000 space enthusiasts. The names were {{submitted}} online {{as part of a}} public outreach effort between September 2005 and November 4, 2006. The microchip, which is two centimetres in diameter, was installed on May 17, 2007, above the spacecraft's forward <b>ion</b> <b>thruster,</b> underneath its high-gain antenna. More than one microchip was made, with a back-up copy put on display at the 2007 Open House event at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.|$|E
500|$|Mercury was a {{propellant}} {{for early}} ion engines in electric space propulsion systems. Advantages were mercury's high molecular weight, low ionization energy, low dual-ionization energy, high liquid density and liquid storability at room temperature. Disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing {{and concerns about}} eventual cooling and condensation {{of some of the}} propellant on the spacecraft in long-duration operations. The first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercury-fueled <b>ion</b> <b>thruster</b> developed by NASA Lewis and flown on the Space Electric Rocket Test [...] "SERT-1" [...] spacecraft launched by NASA at its Wallops Flight Facility in 1964. The SERT-1 flight was followed up by the SERT-2 flight in 1970. Mercury and caesium were preferred propellants for ion engines until Hughes Research Laboratory performed studies finding xenon gas to be a suitable replacement. Xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight, little or no reactivity due to its noble gas nature, and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage.|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of high-power processing units (PPUs) for multimegawatt solar electric propulsion (SEP) vehicles using advanced <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> is presented. Significant savings of scale are possible for PPUs used to supply power to <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> operating at 0. 1 to 1. 5 MWe per thruster. The PPU specific mass {{is found to}} be strongly sensitive to variations in the <b>ion</b> <b>thruster's</b> power per thruster and moderately sensitive to variations in the thruster's screen voltage due to varying the I(sp) of the thruster. Each PPU consists of a dc-to-dc converter to increase the voltage from the 500 V dc of the photovoltaic power system to the 5 to 13 kV dc required by the <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters...</b>|$|R

50|$|Electrostatic <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> use the Coulomb {{force and}} {{accelerate}} the ions {{in the direction}} of the electric field.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> use {{beams of}} ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust in {{accordance}} with momentum conservation. The method of accelerating the ions varies, but all designs {{take advantage of the}} charge/mass ratio of the ions. This ratio means that relatively small potential differences can create high exhaust velocities. This reduces the amount of reaction mass or propellant required, but increases the amount of specific power required compared to chemical rockets. <b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> are therefore able to achieve high specific impulses. The drawback of the low thrust is low acceleration because the mass of the electric power unit directly correlates with the amount of power. This low thrust makes <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> unsuited for launching spacecraft into orbit, but effective for in-space propulsion.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order for}} a rocket to work, it needs two things: {{reaction}} mass and energy. [...] The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass having mass m at velocity v is mv. [...] But this particle has kinetic energy mv²/2, which must come from somewhere. In a conventional solid, liquid, or hybrid rocket, the fuel is burned, providing the energy, and the reaction products are allowed to flow out the back, providing the reaction mass. [...] In an <b>ion</b> <b>thruster,</b> electricity is used to accelerate ions out the back. Here some other source must provide the electrical energy (perhaps a solar panel or a nuclear reactor), whereas the ions provide the reaction mass.|$|E

This program examines several possible options for interconnecting power processors to the mercury <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> {{in order to enhance}} mission reliability and to reduce SEP subsystem weight. The quantity of power processors and <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> required to perform the mission successfully depends not only on the total required thrust, but also on the individual thruster and power processor performance and reliability.

40|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> {{for space}} {{propulsion}} often exploit {{the efficiency of}} helicon sources to produce the plasma. These sources normally require a large electromagnet to produce the magnetic field, since small solenoids have closed field lines from which the plasma cannot be detached unless it is of high beta. Permanent magnets suffer from the same defect unless one uses the far-field of ring magnets, which is a slowly diverging field extending to infinity. This concept {{has been used to}} design helicon sources suitable for etching of and deposition on large substrates and can easily be applied to <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters.</b> Computations for the higher density and magnetic field conditions required show that considerable savings in size and weight of the helicon component of <b>ion</b> <b>thrusters</b> can be gained by using permanent magnets.
