A 2014 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 58 percent of adults in the United States owned a smartphone. 1 With that rapid expansion of mobile devices, one concern is that the hospitality industry might not be ready for the level of mobile accessibility and functionality that customers expect. In that regard, an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that although most travel companies recognize that mobile is increasing in importance, they do not yet understand its <b>full</b> <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> impact. 2 Compared to PCs, mobile use patterns, behaviors, and expectations are different, and each phase of the travel cycle requires a distinctive approach for mobile...|$|R

The internet is a bold challenge to the [...] "natural limit to the reach of the law", and therein lies the quandary. The presence of the internet instigates and fans the flames of the piracy war by virtue of its inherent ability to very quickly and indiscriminately spread content.|$|R

40|$|By {{acting as}} a trader, a State may {{influence}} the direction of international trade through its purchases and sales decisions without resort to other more direct means of intervention such as the application of tariffs and quotas. The GATT recognizes that States may choose to participate in international commerce in competition with private firms, {{but it does not}} leave them with a free hand when it comes to carrying out their trading activities. The core rules regulating a State's trading operations are found in Article XVII and related provisions of the GATT 1994. In the 70 years since their adoption, developments in both the GATT 1947 and the WTO have uncovered a set of seldom employed and relatively shallow disciplines rooted in the principle of non-discrimination, raising doubts about their relevance to the kinds "State trading" activities undertaken today. It remains true, however, that while State trading enterprises continue to operate across the world, and fundamental questions about the <b>full</b> <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> scope of the existing rules endure, it cannot be excluded that the limits of Article XVII and related provisions of the GATT 1994 may well be explored in the future practice of WTO Members, thereby clarifying their regulatory function in the modern trading system...|$|R
