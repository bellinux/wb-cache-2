A stitched carbon-epoxy material system was developed to reduce the weight and cost of transport aircraft structure, first in the NASA Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) Program in the 1990 's and now in the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project. By stitching through the thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dry carbon fiber material prior to cure, the need for mechanical fasteners is almost eliminated. Stitching also provides the benefit of reducing or eliminating delaminations, including those between stiffener flanges and skin.

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we propose <b>an</b> {{efficient}} way <b>of</b> localization and parametric identification of metallic plate-stiffener debonding. A concept and experimental results based on <b>a</b> circular array <b>of</b> Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors (PWASs) is presented. Implementation of this circular array of PWASs combines the Lamb wave technique and symmetry breaking in the signal pattern to monitor the growth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debonding <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiffener</b> on <b>a</b> metallic plate. Wavelet time-frequency maps of the sensor signals are employed and a damage index is plotted against the damage parameters for frequency sweep of the excitation signal (a windowed sine signal). Wavelet coefficient in time gives an insight regarding the effect of debonding growth on the Lamb wave transmission in time-frequency scale. We present here a method to eliminate the time scale effect which helps in identifying easily the signature of damage in the measured signals including the reflection from the boundary of the plate. The proposed method becomes useful in determining the approximate location of the damage {{with respect to the}} location of three neighboring sensors in the circular array.

Specifically, the geometry <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>stiffener</b> <b>of</b> carbon/epoxy {{embedded in a}} beam, periodically spaced stiffeners along the length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beam, and single stiffeners of different materials embedded in beams were all investigated. Because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> methods to sufficiently model the details of spatially varying material properties, experimental data were used to identify important parameters {{that needed to be}} included in a model. Vibration testing was performed for three frequency ranges: 500 Hz to 1500 Hz, 1500 Hz to 2500 Hz, and 2500 Hz to 3500 Hz. The geometry <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>stiffener</b> <b>of</b> carbon/epoxy affected the region of the stiffener that radiated sound. Periodically spaced stiffeners tended to have a global stiffening effect at lower frequencies and to act like individual stiffeners for frequencies where the wavelength is shorter than the <b>stiffener.</b> <b>A</b> <b>stiffener</b> <b>of</b> viscoelastic material reduced the sound power radiated from the region of the stiffener, and stiffeners of other materials radiated sound from the ends of the stiffener. Vibration experiments were performed on fiber-reinforced composite beams to verify a cubic spline based solution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple Euler-Bernoulli beam model. The model seemed to accurately predict the shape and location of farfield sound radiation from stiffeners. However, limitations on the available boundary conditions prevented accurate prediction of the magnitude of sound radiation. The model was then used to predict sound radiation from beams with varying stiffener bond lengths and these results were experimentally verified.

40|$|The recent {{application}} of Glass Reinforced Aluminium (Glare) in the Airbus A 380 {{has proven to}} be a suitable candidate to replace metal structures. The reduction in weight and increased performance results in lower emissions and cost reduction. Therefore research has been performed at the Delft University of Technology, dedicated to the residual strength of fibre metal laminates. This has resulted in reliable prediction methods for flat structures. However in practise these structures are reinforced, to be able to support the loads present in aircraft, while minimising mass. The addition of these local reinforcement features has revealed interesting residual strength characteristics. It was observed that these structures may possess the ability to arrest unstable crack growth, when damaged, which is of great interest for the analysis of damage tolerance aircraft structures. Currently no simple prediction method is available, giving insight in the crack growth characteristics and enabling crack growth predictions in the early design phase. Therefore the objective of this thesis is to predict the damage arrest capabilities of stiffened structures in a simplified manner. Based on the literature study it was observed that the current understanding of fibre metal laminate stiffened structures was insufficient for predicting the fracture mechanics of built-up structures. Therefore the available linear elastic fracture mechanics for metal structures is modified to account for plasticity and stiffeners ahead of the crack-tip, by assuming isostrain conditions. As result, the stress intensity reduction factor is successfully implemented, incorporating the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiffener</b> in combination with the Irwin plasticity correction method. This configuration results in accurate crack growth predictions for residual strength data obtained from literature. The model verification is expanded with experimental test results to validate the crackarrest capabilities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stiffened structure. Therefore four test samples were tested and analysed, representing the different stages of the residual strength diagram. Based on the test results some difference were obtained in the model, which can be appointed to the negligence of stiffener yielding and stiffener effect on the plastic zone growth. Nevertheless a residual strength has been predicted within 7. 5 % of the experimental data. Finally it is concluded that the model is able to predict the crack growth characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stiffened structure in a simplified manner for both metal and fibre metal laminates.

In {{order to increase}} their capacity, they are stiffened with transverse and longitudinal stiffeners of different shapes. Thin plated girders used to support loads over long spans develop significant post-critical resistance after the plate buckling occurs. To achieve better understanding of longitudinally stiffened plated girders subjected to high bending moments and shear forces, four experimental tests on large scale test specimens were performed. The results of these tests were used to verify the numerical model, which was employed for further parametric studies. With numerical simulations the influence of initial imperfections and residual stresses on the capacity of girders was investigated. Initial imperfections were considered as actual measured initial imperfections, as positive buckling modes and as deformed shapes, based on preliminary nonlinear calculations of perfect girders. Residual stresses were considered with a simplified stress pattern where the level of compression stresses was varied. The final residual stresses were determined {{on the basis of}} residual stresses measured in the tested girder. With a verified simplified numerical model a parametric nonlinear analysis was systematically carried out to determine the resistance of longitudinally stiffened plated girders. Based on 630 numerical simulations a new equation for interaction at high bending moments and shear forces, as well as the section, where the check should be performed is proposed. An extensive reliability analysis of five different design models was made, i. e., the EN 1993 - 1 - 5 interaction model, the proposed new model, the gross cross-section bending resistance model and two models, which are <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> the first three. The purpose of this reliability analysis is to determine partial safety factors and study the adequacy of the EN 1993 - 1 - 5 resistance model. The studies have shown, that the capacity of longitudinally stiffened plated girders can satisfactory be determined according to EN 1993 - 1 - 5 under the condition, that the check is made at a distance hwi,max/ 2 and that the gross cross-section bending capacity includes safety factor �M 1 = 1, 1. Finally, the influence of the tension field action on intermediate transverse stiffeners was studied. Two tests on a full scale girder were performed to determine the axial forces in transverse stiffeners. Parametric study, where the influence of stiffener’s stiffnesses on the girders limit capacity was investigated, followed. The EN design rule for axial forces in transverse stiffeners, proved to be conservative, thereby a new design rule for rigid intermediate transverse stiffeners, based on the minimum flexural stiffness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiffener</b> is proposed...|$|R
