5|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the {{building}} was destroyed by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> in the London Blitz. Despite much lobbying for the hall to be rebuilt, the government decided against doing so. The main musical functions of the Queen's Hall were {{taken over by the}} Royal Albert Hall for the Proms, and the new Royal Festival Hall for the general concert season.|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} later that Kehoe had cut all his wire fences {{as part of}} his preparations to destroy his farm, girdling young shade trees to kill them and cutting off his grapevine plants before putting them back on their stumps to hide the damage. He gathered lumber and other materials {{and put them in the}} tool shed, which he later exploded with an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E

Although Manchester was heavily bombed during the Blitz, the gardens sustained only minor damage. The Scenic Railway was hit by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> and the Reptile House was damaged by shell splinters from ack-ack guns, which also caused the death of a bull bison.|$|E
5|$|The Jin–Song Wars were {{notable for}} the {{appearance}} of new technological innovations. The siege of De'an in 1132 included the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early gunpowder weapon and an ancestor of the firearm. The huopao, an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb,</b> was employed {{in a number of}} battles and gunpowder bombs made of cast iron were used in a siege in 1221. The Jurchens migrated south and settled in northern China, where they adopted the language and Confucian culture of the local inhabitants. The Jin dynasty government grew into a centralized imperial bureaucracy structured {{in the same manner as}} previous dynasties of China. Both the Song and Jin dynasties ended in the 13th century as the Mongol Empire expanded across Asia.|$|E
5|$|USS Downes entered {{service in}} January 1937. The {{following}} November, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego, California. While based there, Downes participated in exercises {{along the west}} coast, in the Caribbean and in Hawaiian waters until April 1940. Pearl Harbor then became her homeport. In early 1941, Downes joined a cruise to Samoa, the Fiji Islands, and Australia, then visited the west coast later in the year. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Downes was in dry-dock with the battleship Pennsylvania and the destroyer Cassin. Both destroyers were {{at the southern end}} of the dock when an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> struck Downes, setting unstoppable fires on both ships. Cassin slipped her blocks and rolled over onto the burning Downes, and Downes was later decommissioned.|$|E

50|$|Thermite {{was used}} in both German and Allied <b>incendiary</b> <b>bombs</b> during World War II. <b>Incendiary</b> <b>bombs</b> usually {{consisted}} of dozens of thin thermite-filled canisters (bomblets) ignited by a magnesium fuse. <b>Incendiary</b> <b>bombs</b> created massive damage in many cities due to fires started by the thermite. Cities that primarily consisted of wooden buildings were especially susceptible. These <b>incendiary</b> <b>bombs</b> were utilized primarily during nighttime air raids. Bombsights {{could not be used}} at night, creating the need to use munitions that could destroy targets without the need for precision placement. In recent times, thermite was used by Russia (under Putin's administration) in the Syrian Civil War. In mid 2016, Russian Television by mistake showed video of RBK-500 cluster bombs loaded with ZAB-2.5SM thermite incendiaries mounted on Su-34 bomber aircraft. In the video, the defense minister of Russia can be seen supervising the attacks on civilian areas.|$|R

5|$|Located in {{the town}} centre {{opposite}} the railway station, Calverley Grounds is a historic park with ornamental gardens and a bandstand (now demolished). The park was part of Mount Pleasant House, which was converted into a hotel in 1837, until 1920 when the Borough Council purchased it for the town. The bandstand dated from 1924 and was damaged by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> in 1940 {{and parts of the}} metalwork were sold for scrap metal. The subsequently repaired bandstand and the adjacent pavilion were intended to form part of a new centre to the park but were never completed. The bandstand was demolished in 2010 although the pavilion still exists as a café. Just inside the entrance to the park coming from the station is a memorial to Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, hero of the Battle of Britain, who lived and died in Tunbridge Wells.|$|E

Car no.31 was destroyed by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> on 30 November 1940, the only loss of the war. To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II, they were painted grey, regular services ceased at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common.|$|E

25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory {{was turned into a}} munitions factory {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed. Some adjacent land was loaned by a market gardener who subsequently joined the board years later.|$|E
25|$|Holyoake House is {{also home}} to the Co-operative College (although between 1940 and 2001, the College moved to Stanford Hall, near Loughborough), the Association of British Credit Unions Limited (ABCUL) and The Co-operative News. The {{building}} was extended in the 1930s, and the Training Centre on the top floor was destroyed by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> in the Manchester Blitz of 1940. A collection of Holyoake's letters, papers and other writings are held in store in the National Co-operative Archive, also housed in the building, whilst the building itself received Grade II listed building status on 20 June 1988.|$|E
25|$|The worst raid {{took place}} in the night of 10/11May 1941, when the Palace took at least twelve hits and three people (two policemen and the Resident Superintendent of the House of Lords, Edward Elliott) were killed. An <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set it on fire; another set the roof of Westminster Hall alight. The firefighters could not save both, and a {{decision}} was taken to try to rescue the Hall. In this they were successful; the abandoned Commons Chamber, on the other hand, was destroyed, as was the Members' Lobby. A bomb also struck the Lords Chamber, but went through the floor without exploding. The Clock Tower took a hit by a small bomb or anti-aircraft shell at the eaves of the roof, suffering much damage there. All the glass on the south dial was blown out, but the hands and bells were not affected, and the Great Clock continued to keep time accurately.|$|E

500|$|On 20 February 1944, between 01:53 to 05:04, Frank {{became an}} [...] "ace-in-a-day", {{shooting}} down five Lancaster bombers {{on their way}} to attack Leipzig. He was sent on a mission against intruding de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters on 7 March, but did not achieve any victories. He claimed his next victories on 22 March, a Lancaster shot down near Osnabrück and a Halifax near Gütersloh. On the same mission, while attacking a third bomber, his Messerschmitt Bf 110 [...] "D5+BL" [...] was damaged. An <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb,</b> probably released by the bomber, penetrated the right wing and damaged the engine. Frank managed to bring the aircraft down at Gießen.|$|E
500|$|USS Cassin began naval {{service in}} August 1936, but {{alterations}} {{kept her from}} sea duty until March 1937. The next year, she joined the forces at Pearl Harbor for annual fleet exercises. In April 1940, Cassin was assigned to a Hawaiian unit. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Cassin was in dry-dock with the battleship [...] and the destroyer [...] Both destroyers were {{at the southern end}} of the dock when an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> struck Downes, starting unstoppable fires on both destroyers. Cassin slipped off her blocks and rolled over onto the burning Downes. She was salvaged and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard and decommissioned.|$|E
500|$|Between July 1940 and May 1944, {{the city}} was hit by 67 air raids which {{destroyed}} 6625 houses and severely damaged 6549 of them. The air raids caused 930 deaths and wounded almost 3000 people, {{many of them in}} the dockyard and military establishments. On the night of the city's heaviest raid on 10January 1941, the Luftwaffe dropped 140 tonnes of high explosive bombs, killing 171 people and leaving 3000 homeless. Many of the city's houses were damaged and areas of Landport and Old Portsmouth destroyed, with the future site of Gunwharf Quays being razed to the ground. On the same night, the Guildhall was hit by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> which burnt out the interior and destroyed its inner walls, although the civic plate was retrieved unharmed from the vault under the front steps. Following the heaviest raid on the city, Portsmouth's mayor, Sir Denis Daley, wrote in the Evening News: ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, The Oval was {{the site}} of a protest by the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster against a {{decision}} by the Irish Football Association to allow football matches to be played on Sundays, a first in Northern Ireland due to traditional sabbatarianism. The protesters were concerned that regular Sunday matches would attract churchgoers away from attending church. The protest was led by Reverend David McIlveen, who said [...] "Fundamentally, it is a desecration of God's day." [...] In October 2010 the British National Party (BNP), who were trying to gain electoral support, held a rally outside The Oval. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Member of the Legislative Assembly, Robin Newton described the BNP's presence outside The Oval as [...] "nauseous". In July 2011, an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> was discovered outside The Oval requiring evacuation of surrounding streets. In October 2011 during an Irish Cup match between Glentoran and Portadown, a Portadown fan threw fireworks onto the pitch, injuring Glentoran's assistant manager Pete Batey and goalkeeping coach Davy McClelland.|$|E
500|$|USAAF {{planners}} began {{assessing the}} feasibility of a firebombing campaign against Japanese cities in 1943. Japan's main industrial facilities were vulnerable to such attacks as they were concentrated in several large cities and {{a high proportion of}} production took place in homes and small factories in urban areas. The planners estimated that <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> attacks on Japan's six largest cities could cause physical damage to almost 40percent of industrial facilities and result in the loss of 7.6million man-months of labor. It was also estimated that these attacks would kill over 500,000 people, render about 7.75million homeless and force almost 3.5million to be evacuated. The USAAF tested the effectiveness of incendiary bombs on Japanese-style buildings at Eglin Field and the [...] "Japanese village" [...] at Dugway Proving Ground. The American military also attempted to develop [...] "bat bombs", using incendiary bombs attached to bats dropped by aircraft to attack Japanese cities, but this project was abandoned in 1944.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 10 May 1941, there was an Elgar concert at the hall. Sargent conducted the Enigma Variations and The Dream of Gerontius. The soloists were Muriel Brunskill, Webster Booth and Ronald Stear, with the London Philharmonic and the Royal Choral Society. This concert, the last given at the hall, comprised {{in the view of}} The Times [...] "performances of real distinction". That night there was an intensive air raid in which the chamber of the House of Commons and many other buildings were destroyed, and the British Museum and Westminster Abbey were seriously damaged. A single <b>incendiary</b> <b>bomb</b> hit the Queen's Hall, and the auditorium was completely gutted by fire beyond any hope of replacement. The building was a smouldering ruin in heaps of rubble; the London Philharmonic lost thousands of pounds' worth of instruments. All that remained intact on the site was a bronze bust of Wood retrieved from the debris. Concerts continued in London at the Royal Albert Hall and other venues. The Proms were relocated at the Albert Hall, which remains their principal venue. In 1951, the Royal Festival Hall was opened and succeeded the Queen's Hall as the main London venue for symphony concerts other than the Proms.|$|E
