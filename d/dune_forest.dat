40|$|The {{history of}} dune {{afforestation}} in the Netherlands {{was described in}} six periods varying in maintenance. Afforestation of dunes in other countries of Europe was reviewed. The origin and evolution of the Dutch dunes were traced, and data were mentioned on the mineralogical and chemical composition of the dune sands. After discussion of other ecological factors those of importance for afforestation were listed as nutrient deficiency, low content of humus and of fine sand, adverse watertable, wide range of soil temperature, the mobility of the sand, windiness, less rainfall than further inland, and damage by rabbits. Further special attention must be paid to local differences in lime content, exposure of slopes and height above the watertable (valleys). Techniques of dune afforestation were discussed: landscaping, soil preparation, drainage, fixation, road making, planting (chiefly Pinus spp.), {{the differences between the}} results of direct sowing and of planting out, the protection of forest margins, thinning and exploitation. Plant diseases and damage and some data on cost were discussed. The importance of <b>dune</b> <b>forests</b> (enlargement of the forest area, defence against drifting, wood production and regional social advantage were examined and the most important <b>dune</b> <b>forests</b> were described...|$|R
50|$|In 1948, 9 square {{kilometres}} of <b>dune</b> <b>forests,</b> {{lakes and}} lagoon at Mtunzini was proclaimed a nature reserve {{known as the}} Umlalazi Nature Reserve.
