40|$|Repeat {{breeding}} <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> {{was evaluated}} <b>in</b> terms of incidence, {{risk factors and}} diagnosis. The incidence of repeat breeding is low <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> however <b>in</b> different studies the incidence varied from 0. 70 % to 30 %. Because of seasonal suppression of fertility repeat breeding <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> {{should be limited to}} the breeding season. Spring and winter calving, first parity, peri-parturient disease and lactation are significant risk factors for repeat breeding <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> The etiologies of repeat breeding <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> can be failure of fertilization and early embryonic deaths. Only a few of causes of failure of fertilization have been identified <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Ovulatory disturbances and ovarian cysts are uncommon <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> and cysts have poor clinical manifestation. Endometritis is the common female cause of fertilization failures <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> whereas poor semen quality and improper insemination are the bull side factors for fertilization failures. Early embryonic deaths are common <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> mated/inseminated during the end of the breeding season due to a low luteal progesterone however embryonic deaths occur late (< 25 days) <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Diagnostic approaches for repeat breeding include vaginoscopic and transrectal examination and uterine cytology for genital health. More precise evaluations of the ovarian and uterine function can be obtained by ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic examinations performed sequentially however, precise diagnosis of the cause of repeat breeding seems difficult...|$|R
40|$|Thermo-regulation <b>in</b> swamp <b>buffaloes</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} as an adaptive system to hot-humid climates, and several distinctive physiological responses were noted. When rectal temperature increased in hot conditions, blood volume, {{blood flow to the}} skin surface and skin temperature markedly increased <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> relatively to cattle. On the other hand, the correlation between blood volume and plasma concentration of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was compared between buffaloes and cattle under dehydration. Although plasma AVP in cattle increased immediately for reducing urine volume against a decrease in blood volume as well as the response observed in most animal species, the increase in plasma AVP was delayed <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes,</b> even after a large decrease in blood volume. <b>In</b> <b>buffaloes,</b> a marked increase in blood volume facilitated the dissipation of excess heat from the skin surface during wallowing. In addition, the change in plasma AVP observed <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> was consistent with that of other animals living in habitats with the high availability of water. These results suggest that the thermo-regulatory system <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> accelerates body-water circulation internally and externally. This system may be adaptive for heat dissipation in hot-humid climates, where an abundance of water is common...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the potential of cationic and anionic diets, on nutrients intake, involution period, ovarian activity, follicle growth and uterus tonicity <b>in</b> early lactating <b>buffaloes</b> during winter. Twelve early lactating buffaloes were randomly divided into four groups, three <b>buffaloes</b> <b>in</b> each. Four isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were formulated to have- 110, + 110, + 220 and + 330 dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) mEq/kg dry matter and mar Ked as A, LC, MC and HC diet, respectively. Diet allocation to four groups was random. A linear increase in dry matter intake (DMI) was observed with increased DCAD level. Maximum and minimum DMI was observed <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> fed HC and A diets, respectively. Similar trend was followed by crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber. Rectal palpation on 40 th day post partum revealed that buffaloes fed HC diet had completed uterus involution period while buffaloes fed A and LC diets didn’t complete involution period. Higher uterus tonicity was palpated <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> fed HC diet compared to those receiving A, LC and MC diets. Lower ovarian activity was noticed <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> fed A diet while its reverse was true <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> on HC diet.

40|$|This review brings {{together}} information on ovarian physiology <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> including folliculogenesis, ovulation, {{and the development}} and function of the corpus luteum. Features of embryonic development are also considered. The buffalo is classified as a short-day breeder but in equatorial zones can show oestrous cycles throughout the year provided that nutrition is adequate to maintain reproductive function. In sub-tropical zones and at higher latitudes, day length is often the major determinant of reproductive function including the occurrence of regular oestrous cycles, duration of oestrus, and the period to resumption of ovulation postpartum. Indeed, at higher latitudes buffaloes that give birth {{during the period of}} increasing day length may not show a resumption of ovulation until the following period of decreasing day length. This can {{have a major impact on}} the productive value of buffaloes and requires the development and utilisation of practical and effective assisted breeding technology for out-of-season breeding <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Embryonic development <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> occurs at a faster rate than in cattle and this has implications for the earlier establishment and functionality of the corpus luteum <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> It would appear that the interrelationships between the development of the early conceptus, corpus luteum function, uterine preparation, and maternal recognition of pregnancy, are more closely time-bound <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> compared with cattle.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Botulism is a {{poisoning}} {{caused by}} botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). BoNTs serotypes C and D {{are involved in}} botulism outbreaks in cattle in several countries. Despite {{the high number of}} buffaloes worldwide, the real impact of botulism <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> is not known, because it is not a notifiable disease in Brazil and only few studies have evaluated the occurrence of the disease <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Those studies did not conduct diagnostic tests to confirm the presence of BoNTs. The objective {{of the present study was}} to describe three outbreaks of botulism <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> <b>in</b> the Brazilian Amazon region considering epidemiological and clinical data as well as laboratory diagnosis to confirm the presence of BoNTs. The results of the bioassay were negative in the tissues and in feed samples, but positive for BoNT C in water samples. Confirmation of the occurrence of botulism <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> allows the implementation of preventive strategies in susceptible herds. Waterborne botulism <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> is prevented by ensuring the constant circulation of water collections and restricting the presence of dead animals and bones in order to prevent the accumulation of organic matter and the development of anaerobic conditions, which might favor the replication of Clostridium botulinum. Another measure that can be adopted is the shading of the pasture, in order to maintain the thermal comfort for the buffaloes and to avoid the excess of permanence of them in the water pools...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the prevalence of various reproductive disorders and to estimate the economic losses due to genital prolapse <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> <b>in</b> Sir Shamir area of District Faisalabad, Pakistan. The survey was conducted in 8 villages during the 12 months period from June 2005 to May 2006 and the data from 400 farmers (50 farmers from each village) were collected. The total buffalo population of this area was 7, 785, out of which 2, 135 (27. 42 %) animals were included in the study. The overall prevalence of reproductive disorders <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> was recorded as 46. 18 %. Among all the reproductive disorders, repeat breeding showed the highest prevalence (15. 69 %), followed by anestrous (9. 74 %), genital prolapse (7. 73 %), abortion (5. 99 %), retained placenta (2. 58 %), uterine torsion (2. 39 %) and dystocia (2. 06 %). The total economic losses due to genital prolapse <b>in</b> <b>buffaloes</b> <b>in</b> eight villages during the period of study were estimated to be Rs. 4, 59, 500 /- Among these, the highest losses were due to mortality of dam (39. 17 %), followed by milk losses (25. 14 %), service charges (21. 33 %) and medicine cost (14. 36 %).
