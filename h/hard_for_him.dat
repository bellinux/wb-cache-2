5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to make a quick}} or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Lowell {{is forced}} to leave Nantucket and enter the Witness Protection Program after {{witnessing}} a mob hit. Although it is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to leave the people he has known all his life, Lowell decides he would rather go into hiding than let a guilty man go free to possibly kill again.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2004, a {{tour was}} {{cancelled}} and {{the recording of}} a new studio album stopped when Green left the band and moved to Sweden. Shortly afterwards he joined The British Blues All Stars, for a tour scheduled for the next year. However, this tour was cancelled {{after the death of}} saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith. At the time, Green stated that the medication he was taking to treat his psychological problems was making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to concentrate and sapped his desire to play guitar.|$|E

50|$|After sixth grade, {{the very}} worst year of his life, Rafe Khatchadorian thinks he has it made in seventh grade. He has been {{accepted}} to art school {{in the big city}} and imagines a math-and-history-free fun zone. Wrong! It will get <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

"Dear Lurene, Thank you {{for pulling}} me {{through so many}} broadcasts—fondly, Ronnie."—A note Tuttle {{received}} from actor Ronald Colman, who was fond of radio and accepted numerous radio jobs himself when film roles became <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to come by in his later years.|$|R
25|$|Sunao is {{a second}} year student from class 2-A {{and the head of}} the drama club. Incidentally, she was Leo's classmate at junior high school. Sunao has a strong sense of justice. She hates Erika Kiriya who is self-righteous. At {{beginning}} of the story, she has a hatred for Leo, and she is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to deal with. Her story was added in the PS2 version. The Minikiss for PC contains her story added sexual content with her path on the PS2 version.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{separation}} from Bernhardt, Damala attempted {{returning to the}} diplomatic world. His re-entrance in the diplomatic profession proved very <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> though, and he remained in the acting profession. That same year, in 1883, he performed the most memorable role of his career (save for Armand) as Philippe Berlay opposite Jane Hading in the stage adaptation of Georges Ohnet's novel, Maître de Forges (Ironmaster). The play was a great success and ran through the entire year in the Théâtre du Gymnase, in Marseille.|$|E
25|$|Qazi {{was tried}} by a Virginia state court jury {{over a period}} of ten days in November 1997, on a plea of not guilty to all charges. During the trial the defense {{introduced}} testimony from Dr. Richard Restak, a neurologist and also a neuropsychiatrist, that Kansi was missing tissue from his frontal lobes, a congenital defect that made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to judge the consequence of his actions. This testimony was re-iterated by another psychiatrist for the defense based upon independent examination. The jury found him guilty, and fixed punishment for the capital murder charge at death.|$|E

25|$|Ewan's {{possessions}} on {{the islands}} were held from the king of Norway, whilst his possessions on the mainland were held from the king of Scotland. This made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to remain loyal to both. In 1263 Haakon IV of Norway arrived with a huge fleet {{off the coast of}} Oban for an invasion of the west coast of Scotland. However Ewan decided not to join the invasion and thanks to old blood ties Haakon left him in peace. The Battle of Largs then took place and Ewan joined the side of Scots and attacked part of the Norse fleet. The Vikings were utterly defeated and three years later Norway ceded all of the Hebrides to Scotland.|$|E
25|$|At a party, Zoe meets {{fraternity}} president Kyle Spencer (Evan Peters), {{who takes}} a liking to her. Madison is gang-raped by Kyle's frat brothers and, as revenge, uses her power to flip their bus, killing Kyle and six others. Two of the boys survive and are placed in critical care. Zoe goes {{to the hospital and}} kills the remaining rapist with her power. To repay Zoe, Madison revives a dismembered Kyle by attaching his frat brothers' severed limbs to his head and casting a resurrection spell, but he returns frightened and simple-minded. It is revealed that Kyle's mother sexually abused him, making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be trusting of physical touch. His revived corpse attracts Misty Day (Lily Rabe), a witch who resurrected herself after being burned at the stake.|$|E
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. They said they would expect to find several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E
50|$|Thorbjørn Sindballe {{weighs in}} at 80 kg and is 190 cm tall, {{which is an}} unusual size for an elite triathlete. His size makes him less aerodynamic, heavier for running, and makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to endure the heat, which is a strong factor in several {{important}} competitions.|$|R

25|$|The {{advent of}} the First World War brought a time of {{hardship}} for Burnet's practice, and during this period a disagreement resulted in Tait leaving the practice to work in America. After the war, the London office began to receive commissions once more, including work on completing the Selfridges department store on Oxford Street. The Imperial War Graves Commission also commissioned war memorials from Burnet's firm in Gallipoli, Palestine and Suez (1919). Burnet took {{a leading role in}} the design of the memorials and in the work on Adelaide House, London Bridge. His health was deteriorating, however; stress-related eczema, brought on by wartime hardship, professional disagreements and financial scandals in the Glasgow office, made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to work. Thomas Tait had returned to the practice after a reconciliation, and he began to take {{a leading role in the}} practice, working on the Daily Telegraph Building and Lloyds Bank on Cornhill. Burnet himself dealt with the redesign on Lomax Simpson's Unilever House project, but otherwise acted as a consultant and went into semi-retirement.|$|E
25|$|Sixty-four-year-old William Frawley, a {{seasoned}} vaudevillian and movie character actor with nearly 100 film credits to his name, {{was a long}} shot to play Fred Mertz and only came into consideration after he telephoned Ball personally to ask {{if there was a}} role for him on her new show. Ball, who had only briefly known Frawley from her days at RKO, suggested him to both Arnaz and CBS. The network objected to the idea of casting Frawley, fearing that his excessive drinking—which was well known in Hollywood—would interfere with a commitment to a live show. Arnaz nonetheless liked Frawley and lobbied <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have the role, {{even to the point of}} having Lucy scribes re-tailor the role of Fred Mertz to be a less financially successful and more curmudgeonly (in contrast to Gale Gordon's Mr. Atterbury) character to fit Frawley's persona. CBS relented only after Arnaz contractually bound Frawley to complete sobriety during the production of the show, and reportedly told the veteran actor that if he ever appeared on-set more than once in an intoxicated state he would be fired. Not once during Lucys nine seasons did Frawley's drinking ever interfere with his performance, and over time Arnaz became one of Frawley's few close friends.|$|E
500|$|Inspired, David {{assembled}} a team, including producer Lawrence Bender {{and former president}} of eBay Jeffrey Skoll, who met with Gore about the possibility of making the slide show into a movie. It took some convincing. The slide show, she says, [...] "was his baby, and he felt proprietary about it and it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to let go." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{spoke the}} gentle old priest, who looked from his {{peaceful}} haven with dreamy eyes upon the sweat and tussle of the world's battle. Had he instead {{been in the}} thick of the fight, it might have been <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to believe that his enemies ever had right upon their side.|$|R

50|$|It's {{all part}} of the New Journalism, or the Now Journalism, and it's practiced widely these days. Some editors and reporters vigorously defend it. Others just as vigorously attack it.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into {{a story about the}} relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to do Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
500|$|Boit's {{time was}} 47 minutes and 25.25 seconds. After the race, he {{explained}} to the international media, [...] "My goal, my aim, {{is to become a}} world or Olympic champion. I'm dreaming about becoming the first African to do it. I will do it." [...] Daehlie meanwhile said of Boit, [...] "He deserves to be encouraged. It was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> but he never gave up." [...] Boit became a celebrity in Kenya following his return, and would continue as a professional skier until 2011, taking part in two further Winter Olympics, and continuing to be friends with Daehlie. Shortly after the 1998 Games, Boit's first child was born, the Kenyan naming him Daehlie Boit.|$|E
500|$|The man {{only known}} as [...] "Espantito" [...] (Spanish for [...] "Little Terror" [...] or [...] "Little Scare") {{was born on}} April 25, 1968 in Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. Growing up in Torreón he became a wrestling fan at a young age, often {{watching}} local wrestlers Espanto II and Espanto III wrestle in his home town. In a 1999 interview he remarked that while his friends would cheer the técnicos (the faces, those that portray the [...] "good guys") while he personally always favored the rudos (those that portray the bad guys, also known as [...] "Heels"). While he {{wanted to become a}} luchador, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to find a trainer willing to train someone of his diminutive stature, standing only [...] in his teens.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, Chespirito's age {{began to}} catch up with him and it became <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to {{adequately}} portray some of his characters, especially El Chavo and El Chapulin Colorado. In 1992, at the age of sixty-three, Chespirito retired the El Chavo character from his show (he did the same thing to El Chapulin Colorado one year later).|$|R
50|$|Melton led {{the league}} in walks and wild pitches during the 1942 season. Due to his arm injury from World War 2, this made it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to play ball. He was forced to make his career short but will {{certainly}} not be forgotten. Melton died in an automobile accident in Greer, South Carolina in 1971.|$|R
60|$|He walked jauntily away, being hungry, and {{the unfortunate}} Matthew {{was left to}} do that which was <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> than bearding a lion in its den--walk up to a girl--a strange girl--an orphan girl--and demand of her why she wasn't a boy. Matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the {{platform}} towards her.|$|R
500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Georges-Claude Guilbert, {{author of}} Madonna as Postmodern Myth, {{compared}} her {{look in the}} video as a [...] "combination of Marilyn Monroe, Jean Seberg and Kim Novak." [...] He added that it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to believe that [...] " [...] {{did not know that}} she was going to cause a huge controversy with the video... With such a song and video, she was throwing in America's face the image of a country ravaged by the abortion debate, which is far from being resolved." [...] Lynda Hart, one of the authors of Acting Out: Feminist Performances, felt that the video [...] "alternated between two competing representations of Madonna... Charging coercion, both sides make the video as an invitation to a certain way of life, in the process denying it the stylistic invocation of a rhetoric of self-authorization." [...] At the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, the [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] video won the Best Female Video award, and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Overall Performance.|$|E
500|$|Political assassinations, {{attempted}} or successful, commonly occurred {{throughout the}} revolt. Al-Hajj Muhammad's refusal to participate did not seriously damage {{his relations with}} al-Husayni or the Central Committee, an organization which he depended on for war material. He frequented Damascus to obtain weapons and supplies {{as well as to}} discuss the situation in Palestine. However, an intelligence document from the British Mandatory authorities revealed that al-Hajj Muhammad left Palestine for Syria in October 1938 after being disaffected with the Central Committee's activities. The report states that he refused to send funds to the Committee, remarking [...] "The shoe of the most insignificant mujahid (fighter) is nobler than {{all the members of the}} Society, who have indulged in pleasure, while their brethren suffer in the mountains." [...] At one point, tensions emanating from al-Hajj Muhammad's refusal to carry out the killings of several men provided to him in a hit list by Da'ud al-Husayni on behalf of the Committee resulted in the cutting off of financial and material support for a certain period of time in 1938. This forced al-Hajj Muhammad to go to Jerusalem's chamber of commerce and the Ramallah municipality for funds. Another reason for his departure was the increased presence of informants within rebel ranks, making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to continue military activities.|$|E
50|$|Kurata {{is a man}} {{who refuses}} to leave the frontlines of the war against the BOOMERS. He has had many chances for {{promotion}} but has always refused the jobs that would take him away from the action. He cares for his crew members, and refuses to leave their side. His love with his ex-girlfriend, Nancy, also makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to leave his job.|$|R
60|$|Rollo sat still, and listened, but {{his father}} saw, from his looks, {{that he was not}} much {{interested}} in what he was saying; and he perceived that it was not at all probable that so small a boy could be reasoned into liking work. In fact, it was rather <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Rollo to understand all that his father said,--and still <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to feel the force of it. He began to grow sleepy, and so his father let him go to bed.|$|R
