50|$|Bhogali Bihu (mid-January, {{also called}} Magh Bihu) {{comes from the}} word Bhog that is eating and enjoyment. It is a harvest festival and {{marks the end of}} {{harvesting}} season. Since the granaries are full, {{there is a lot of}} feasting and eating during this period. On the eve of the day called uruka, i.e., the last day of pausa, menfolk, more particularly young men go to the field, preferably near a river, build a makeshift cottage called Bhelaghar with the hay of the harvest fields and the bonfire or Meji, the most important thing for the night. During the night, they prepare food and there is community feasting everywhere. There is also exchange of sweets and greetings at this time. The entire night (called Uruka) is spent around a Meji with people singing bihu songs, beating Dhol, a typical kind of drums or playing games. Boys roam about in the dark stealing firewood and vegetables for fun. The next morning they take a bath and burn the main Meji. People gather around the Meji and throw Pithas (rice cakes) and betel nuts to it while burning it at the same time. They offer their prayers to the God of Fire and mark the end of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>year.</b> Thereafter they come back home carrying pieces of half burnt firewood for being thrown among fruit trees for favourable results. All the trees in the compound are tied to bamboo strips or paddy stems. Different types of sports like Buffalo-fight, Egg-fight, Cock-fight, Nightingale-fight etc. are held throughout the day. There are other conventional festivals observed by various ethnic-cultural groups. Me-dam-me-phi, Ali-aye-ligang, Porag, Garja, Hapsa Hatarnai, Kherai are few among them. The koch celebrates this bihu as pushna.|$|E

There are plenty of analytical methods for assessing the antioxidant content of wines but unfortunately, {{there is not a}} standardized method. The antioxidant content of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’, ‘Merlot ’ and ‘Pinot Noir ’ wines obtained from cultivated grapes varieties from Recas and Minis Romanian vineyard from different harvesting years were investigated. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, using the 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -hydroxypiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempol) free stable radical, was used to determine the antioxidant content of wines. Measurements were done in order to analyze the effects of the grape varieties, the <b>harvesting</b> <b>year</b> and the vineyard on the antioxidant content of wines.

40|$|HIGHLIGHTSBiomass {{production}} and cell wall composition are differentially impacted by <b>harvesting</b> <b>year</b> and genotypes, influencing then cellulose conversion in miniaturized assay. Using a high-throughput miniaturized and semi-automated method for performing the pretreatment and saccharification steps at laboratory scale {{allows for the}} assessment of these factors on the biomass potential for producing bioethanol before moving to the industrial scale. The large genetic diversity of the perennial grass miscanthus makes it suitable for producing cellulosic ethanol in biorefineries. The saccharification potential and year variability of five genotypes belonging to Miscanthus × giganteus and Miscanthus sinensis were explored using a miniaturized and semi-automated method, allowing the application of a hot water treatment followed by an enzymatic hydrolysis. The studied genotypes highlighted distinct cellulose conversion yields due to their distinct cell wall compositions. An inter-year comparison revealed significant variations in the biomass productivity and cell wall compositions. Compared to the recalcitrant genotypes, more digestible genotypes contained higher amounts of hemicellulosic carbohydrates and lower amounts of cellulose and lignin. In contrast to hemicellulosic carbohydrates, the relationships analysis between the biomass traits and cellulose conversion clearly showed the same negative effect of cellulose and lignin on cellulose digestion. The miniaturized and semi-automated method we developed was usable at the laboratory scale and was reliable for mimicking the saccharification at the pilot scale using a steam explosion pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, this miniaturized method will allow the reliable screening of many genotypes for saccharification potential. These findings provide valuable information and tools for breeders to create genotypes combining high yield, suitable biomass composition, and high saccharification yields...|$|E

Increasing amounts of vermicompost applied to the soils of experimental plots had significantly influenced the overall shoot growth parameters viz. number of leaves per plant, average leaf length, leaf width, plant girth, etc. Number of leaves per plant was not differed significantly in different vermicompost treatment plots compared to control during the first harvesting period. However, during the second harvesting period, difference was significant (Table  2). A gradual increase in number of leaves per plant up to T 3 followed by a sudden decrease in case of T 4 was noticeable. Highest number of leaves was observed in case of T 3 plot (Table  2). Unlike leaf number, the average leaf length and leaf width of pineapple plants of different treatment plots differed significantly compared to control during both the harvesting seasons (Table  2). However, the influence of vermicompost was clearly greater during the second year of fruit harvesting. In case of plant growth parameters like leaf length and leaf width, T 3 plot exhibited best results during both the harvesting seasons. Pineapple plant girth also followed the same trend and significantly increased with higher amounts of vermicompost but up to T 3 plot (20 tons ha− 1 year− 1). All the parameters had significantly (p <  0.05) higher values during the second <b>harvesting</b> <b>year</b> compared to the first one (Table  2).

Clear-cutting is the primary harvesting method for poplar plantation management in southern China. However, the effect of harvesting on ecosystem carbon fluxes limits our ability to estimate its carbon sequestration. A consecutive, three-year observation on ecosystem CO 2 and CH 4 flux (F-CO 2 and F-CH 4) of a Populus dettoides plantation on the floodplain of Yangtze River was made prior and post to the clear-cutting using an eddy-covariance system. We found that clear-cutting turned the ecosystem from a strong carbon sink to a mediate carbon source only in several months, July to next January, after the harvest. The ecosystem turned to a net carbon sink {{at the beginning of}} the first growing season following clear-cutting due to the large productivity of understory vegetation in this region. The annual carbon budget was - 424. 3 +/- 52. 5 g-C m(- 2) (95 % confidence interval) in the <b>harvesting</b> <b>year,</b> with - 53. 6 +/- 22. 8 g-C m(- 2) the first year and - 290. 7 +/- 34. 2 g-C m(- 2) the second year after clear-cutting. Clear-cutting turned the ecosystem from a net CH 4 sink to a net CH 4 source after the third month, but during the three years the CH 4 emission only balanced out a very small portion (0. 3 %) of F-CO 2. In non-inundation periods, F-CH 4 varied from - 0. 01 to 0. 24 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1), with a mean (SD) of 0. 11 +/- 0. 08 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1), while it ranged from 0. 33 to 4. 39 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1) during inundation, with a mean (+/- SD) of 2. 17 +/- 1. 16 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1). Daily and weekly F-CH 4 during non-inundation period were highly correlated with ground water table, soil moisture, and friction velocity, while F-CH 4 during inundation depended on inundation depth.

40|$|Falcarinol type polyacetylenes (FaTP) in carrots {{have been}} {{assigned}} both positive health effects and negative effects on taste, in connection with human consumption. The aim of this thesis was {{to contribute to the}} description of factors influencing the concentrations of FaTP in carrot. Some 465 different samples, from 77 different plots, harvested at 17 different occasions during the period 2005 – 2008 were used in the investigations. The samples were analyzed concerning their size, root morphology, concentrations of soluble sugars and concentrations of polyacetylenes. Only the three major polyacetylenes in carrots; falcarinol (FaOH), falcarindiol (FaDOH) and falcarindiol- 3 -acetate (FaDOAc) were considered in this thesis. No single factor was found to explain all of the variation in the levels of FaTP. Factors such as <b>harvesting</b> <b>year,</b> location of growing site, length of the growing season, storage and soil conditions were shown to have a stronger impact on the FaTP concentrations than for example manuring strategy. Increased concentrations of FaDOH, and sometimes also of FaOH, appeared to be a reaction on stress, i. e. a way of resisting stress. The concentration of FaTP increased until 110 - 115 days after sowing and then decreased during {{the latter part of the}} season. Initially the levels of FaTP increased as the roots grew larger. However, roots heavier than 70 g exhibited lower levels of FaDOH and roots heavier than 107 g were lower also in their total concentration of FaTP. It was not possible to assign a specific root shape as an indicator of the composition of FaTP in the carrot samples. The levels of FaOH were mainly correlated to regular changes occurring during root development, but they could occasionally increase if the carrots were grown under stressful conditions. The FaDOH concentration exhibited a pattern of variation more dependent on external factors, such as annular variation and soil conditions. The concentration of FaDOAc was more dependent on factors such as the levels of hexoses and on root length or root shape. The variation in the concentration of FaOH indicated the existence of a critical level below which the synthesis of this compound was triggered. The enzymes transforming FaOH into FaDOH appeared to be active under similar conditions as the enzymes converting sucrose to hexoses...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this work {{concerned}} the synthesis of N-linked peptideresorcarenes and the study of their surface interaction with enzymes. As known, an important class of protein surface receptors based on the attachment of four cyclic peptides to a calix[4]arene scaffold was developed by Hamilton and targeted to the serine protease α-chymotrypsin (ChT). Moving from Hamilton’s results and from some preliminary molecular modeling studies, valyl-leucine, leucyl-valine and valyl-aspartic peptidoresorc[4]arenes have been designed with the aim to target the predominantly cationic region surrounding the active site of ChT. By varying sequence, nature, and stereochemistry of the side chains, we prepared anionically functionalized N-linked peptidoresorc[4]arenes by hydrogenation of their precursor benzyl esters. From this family of receptors we have identified noncompetitive inhibitors of ChT, which function by binding {{to the surface of the}} enzyme in the neighborhood of the active site cleft (Ki values ranging from 13 to 0. 8 µM). The second topic of the work was the NMR characterization of the Italian virgin olive oils from the harvesting seasons 2009 / 10, 2010 / 11. Following the experimental protocol established in the Annalaura Segre NMR Laboratory (CMI, CNR in Montelibretti, Rome), based on 1 H-NMR and statistical multivariate analysis of the data (ANOVA, PCA and LDA), nearly 300 Italian virgin olive oil samples, produced in two harvesting years, 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11, by certified chains in different italian regions have been studied.

Major symptoms of CI include mealiness, graininess, flesh browning, loss of flavor (off flavor), and red pigmentation (bleeding). These symptoms were evaluated over 2 years in an intra-specific progeny population {{derived from the}} cross of cultivars ‘Venus’ (freestone, melting and yellow-flesh nectarine) and ‘BigTop’ (clingstone, melting and yellow-flesh nectarine) after storage of fruit at 5 °C (CI inducing conditions) for 2 and 4 weeks. All the evaluated traits in the progeny showed continuous variation which is typical of quantitative or polygenic inheritance. Longer cold storage periods increased the incidence and severity of CI symptoms, except for bleeding and leatheriness, which were not affected by time of storage. CI symptoms showed high and significant heritability or genotype effect in the studied population, with no significant effect of <b>harvesting</b> <b>year.</b> Browning, mealiness and graininess were significantly correlated and were the main CI symptoms observed in this population. Mealiness and graininess were negatively correlated with stone adhesion which reflects the higher susceptibility to CI disorders of freestone fruit. A genetic linkage map of linkage group 4 (LG 4) was constructed with SSR and candidate genes (CGs). Significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mealiness, graininess, leatheriness and bleeding were found in this linkage group, validating QTLs for CI symptoms previously reported in this linkage group from an unrelated progeny population. In addition, QTLs controlling other agronomic and fruit quality traits were also localized in this linkage group.

40|$|The seed of Santalum spicatum {{is rich in}} a {{fixed oil}} (59 % by weight), which is characterised by a high {{percentage}} of acetylenic, ethylenic ximenynic acid (35 % of total fatty acids). A number of important aspects of the seed fixed oil, its composition in developing seeds, its triacylglycerols molecular species in the oil, the nutrition and toxicity of the oil feeding, and the possible bioactivity of ximenynic acid in mice were investigated. The identification of cis and trans isomers of ximenynic acid in the seed oil, and the metabolite of ximenynic acid in mouse liver lipid fractions were achieved using 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol to form 2 -substituted 4, 4 -dimethyloxazoline derivatives, which were analysed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Changes in proximate and fatty acid composition were investigated in developing seed collected weekly from about seven days after flowering to maturity. It was determined that moisture and carbohydrate contents decreased significantly during the development sequence, while fixed oil content increased from 0. 3 % to 50 % (by weight) with seed development. A corresponding increase in the proportions of both oleic and ximenynic acids occurred suggesting a precursor/product relationship. Mature seed collected from different locations in Western Australia showed minor differences in characteristics and lipid composition, which may have been influenced by geographical origin and <b>harvesting</b> <b>year</b> of samples. The lipid components from the seed oil were separated using thin-layer chromatography and the individual triglyceride bands were characterised by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography using flame ionisation and mass spectrometric detection after removal from the plate. The triximenynin (trisantalbin) band showed no other contaminating fatty acids and was obtained in a relatively pure state. A ++nutrition and toxicity study was performed by feeding a semi-synthetic diet containing sandalwood seed oil to a level of 15 % of total energy content to a group of mice for one month and another group for two months. The most significant effect of sandalwood seed oil ingestion when compared with a standard lab diet (5 % fat, by weight) and a canola oil-enriched diet (15 % fat, by weight) was an apparent reduction in body weight gain, which may be the effect of ximenynic acid as a growth retardant. Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were determined in the mice as an indicator of hepatotoxicity. These levels were higher in mice fed the sandalwood seed oil diet than those fed the standard lab diet, suggesting that ximenynic acid may affect liver-specific enzyme activity. Analysis of the total lipid fatty acids of various tissues and organs of mice showed only a low incorporation of ximenynic acid into the general tissues (0. 3 - 3 % by weight), and its absence in the brain. This study suggests a few health benefits from consumption of large quantities of sandalwood seed oil in the diet. These include a low lipid content in blood, heart, muscle, increase in the 16 : 1 / 16 : 0 and 18 : 1 / 18 : 0 ratios, production of increased levels of 18 : 1 (n- 9) and docosahexaenoic acid, and decreased levels of arachidonic acid in certain tissues.

40|$|Nos Ãltimos anos, com a evoluÃÃo {{explosiva}} da informÃtica e da eletrÃnica, a comunidade cientÃfica mundial tem intensificado os estudos no sentido de desenvolver e aplicar pesquisas baseada no aprimoramento da alta precisÃo. Os avanÃos na Ãrea de informÃtica, principalmente na elaboraÃÃo de interfaces com sensores eletrÃnicos, permitiram o desenvolvimento e aplicaÃÃo de vÃrios transdutores na Engenharia AgrÃcola. No que diz respeito Ã agricultura irrigada uma grande preocupaÃÃo Ã com o enorme volume de Ãgua utilizado. Segundo a FAO atÃ 2030 serÃ necessÃrio um incremento de 14 % da Ãgua potÃvel, na irrigaÃÃo, a fim de suprir a demanda provocada pelo crescimento da populaÃÃo mundial. No intuito de aprimorar o uso da Ãgua na irrigaÃÃo, vÃrios trabalhos foram e estÃo sendo desenvolvidos, principalmente na busca de se avaliar, economicamente, a conversÃo da Ãgua em alimento e a real necessidade hÃdrica das culturas para seu desenvolvimento pleno. O kc Ã um fator que relaciona a necessidade hÃdrica da cultura em {{estudo e a}} necessidade hÃdrica de uma cultura hipotÃtica. O balanÃo hÃdrico do solo contabiliza todas as adiÃÃes e retiradas de Ãgua que realmente ocorrem em certo volume de solo, utilizado na produÃÃo agrÃcola, permitindo avaliar a situaÃÃo hÃdrica pela qual uma cultura passa. Pelo exposto acima, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo geral a avaliaÃÃo do uso do sensor capacitivo FDR em substituiÃÃo ao tensiÃmetro para o cÃlculo do coeficiente de cultivo (kc), por meio do balanÃo hÃdrico do solo. O experimento foi realizado no PerÃmetro Irrigado do Baixo AcaraÃ â CearÃ, em uma Ãrea de 1, 0 ha, em dois ciclos com a cultura da melancia nos anos de 2009 e 2010. Os sensores foram calibrados, em laboratÃrio, atravÃs de anÃlise de regressÃo entre umidade da amostra e frequÃncia produzida pelo sensor, e entre esta Ãltima e a tensÃo verificada em um tensiÃmetro com mercÃrio partindo do ponto de saturaÃÃo atÃ aproximadamente 8, 0 % de umidade volumÃtrica. A avaliaÃÃo da equaÃÃo de calibraÃÃo ocorreu atravÃs da comparaÃÃo entre os dados dos sensores e os dados dos tensiÃmetros para umidade e tempo de irrigaÃÃo. A equaÃÃo de calibraÃÃo tanto para a umidade, como para tensÃo foi do tipo exponencial. A comparaÃÃo entre as tensÃes medidas e estimadas, pela equaÃÃo de ajuste, alcanÃou desempenho forte e/ou Ãtimo em todos os itens analisados. A validaÃÃo em campo, das equaÃÃes de ajuste, deu-se atravÃs de uma anÃlise comparativa entre as tensÃes obtidas pelos sensores FDR e pelos tensiÃmetros, alÃm das umidades atuais, estimadas por ambos os equipamentos, no primeiro ano de cultivo. Para o segundo ciclo produtivo fez-se uso da tÃcnica do papel filtro que retornou as seguintes equaÃÃes de ajuste para as curvas de retenÃÃo da Ãgua no solo: &# 952;= 0, 3843 *T^(- 0, 381) (1 Â camada), &# 952;= 0, 4381 *T^(- 0, 372) (2 Â camada) e &# 952;= 0, 4103 *T^(- 0, 34) (3 Â camada), e a tÃcnica do perfil instantÃneo para avaliaÃÃo da condutividade hidrÃulica. Aplicaram-se variaÃÃes de umidade do solo, com tratamento, a fim de verificar algumas respostas fisiolÃgicas da cultura. Os tratamentos apresentaram diferenÃa estatÃstica para transpiraÃÃo e condutÃncia estomÃtica, sendo o T 4 (&# 1012;= 1, 3 da capacidade de campo) superior aos demais ao nÃvel de confianÃa de 0, 05. Os valores de kc variaram entre os tratamentos de 0, 74 a 1, 06 (18 Â DAP), 0, 98 a 1, 52 (45 Â DAP) e 0, 67 a 0, 85 (59 Â DAP). A produÃÃo variou de 13, 019 a 25, 867 Mg entre os tratamentos. O uso eficiente de Ãgua variou de 4, 17 a 6, 95 kg m- 3. O uso do sensor permite medir o potencial da Ãgua no solo e a umidade em tempo real, possibilitando o monitoramento e a tomada de decisÃes de forma mais segura. In recent years, {{with the}} explosive development of information technology and electronics, the scientific community worldwide has intensified research {{to develop and implement}} research-based improvement in precision application. Advances in information technology, especially in the developing of interfaces with electronic sensors, allowed for the development and application of various transducers in Agricultural Engineering. With respect to irrigated farms there is a major concern with the large volume of water used. According to FAO by 2030 it will be required an increase of 14 % of drinking water used by irrigation, {{in order to meet the}} demand caused by population growth worldwide. In order to improve water use in irrigation, several studies have been and are being developed, especially focused on evaluating, economically, the conversion of water into food and the actual requirement of crops for their full development. The kc is a factor that relates crop water requirement of a real crop to the water requirement of a hypothetical culture. The soil water balance accounts for all additions and withdrawals of water that actually occur in a certain volume of soil used in agricultural production, allowing to access the water situation in which a culture is. From the above, this study aimed to evaluate the use of a capacitive FDR sensor to replace tensiometer in the process of obtaining the crop coefficient (kc) through the soil water balance. The experiment was conducted at the Low AcaraÃ Irrigation District - CearÃ, in an area of 1. 0 ha, into two cycles with of watermelon, in the years 2009 and 2010. The sensors were calibrated in the laboratory using regression analysis between soil moisture from a soil sample and frequency produced by the sensor, and between it and the tension found in a mercury based tensiometer, from saturation to approximately 8. 0 % volumetric water content. The evaluation of the calibration equation occurred by comparing the sensor data and data from tensiometers for moisture and irrigation timing. The calibration equation for both moisture and for the tension was exponential. The comparison between the estimated and measured tensions using the fitted equation produced a strong performance and/or great on all items analyzed. Field validation of the fitted models was conducted by comparative analysis between the frequencies obtained from the FDR sensors and the tensiometers during the first <b>harvesting</b> <b>year.</b> For the second <b>harvesting</b> <b>year,</b> the technique of filter paper was tested. It resulted in the following equations to fit the water retention curves for the soil: &# 952;= 0, 3843 *T^(- 0, 381) (1 st layer), &# 952;= 0, 4381 *T^(- 0, 372) (2 nd layer) and &# 952;= 0, 4103 *T^(- 0, 34) (3 rd layer). In addition, the instantaneous profile method for evaluating the hydraulic conductivity was applied. Were application depth was applied as a treatment for analyzing some physiological characteristics of the crop. The treatments showed statistical differences for stomatal conductance and transpiration, T 4 (&# 1012;= 1. 3 of field capacity) being superior to the others to a 0. 05 confidence level. kc values ranged between treatments from 0. 74 to 1. 06 (18 DAP), 0. 98 to 1. 52 (45 DAP) and 0. 67 to 0. 85 (59 DAP). Crop yield ranged from 13. 019 to 25. 867 Mg between treatments. The efficiency of water use ranged from 4. 17 to 6. 95 kg m- 3. The use of the sensor allows for real time measurement of soil water potential and soil moisture, enabling a more secure monitoring and decision making...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of fossil fuels on the environment, these remain as the primary contributors to the energy sector. In order to mitigate global warming risks, many countries aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Bioenergy crops are being used as a substitute for fossil fuels and short rotation forestry is a prime example. In order to examine the sustainability of energy crops for fuel, typical European short rotation forestry (SRF) biomass, willow (Salix spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.) are examined and compared to rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in respect to various aspects of soil respiration and combustion heat obtained from the extracted products per hectare. Various approaches are used to look at an As-contaminated site not only in the field but also in a soil-column experiment that examines the fate of trace elements in SRF soils, and in an analysis using MICMAC to describe the driving factors for SRF crop production. Based on the cause-effect chain, the impacts of land-use change and occupation on ecosystem quality are assessed when land-use is changed from degraded land (grassland) to willow and poplar SRF. A manual opaque dynamic closed chamber system (SEMACH-FG) was utilized to measure CO 2 emissions at a willow/poplar short rotation forest in Krummenhennersdorf, Germany during the years 2013 and 2014, and at a rapeseed site in 2014. Short rotation forest soils showed higher CO 2 emission rates during the growing season than the dormant season – with a CO 2 release of 5. 62 ± 1. 81 m- 2 s- 1 for willows and 5. 08 ± 1. 37 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 for poplars in the growing season. However, during the dormant season the soil sites with willow emitted 2. 54 ± 0. 81 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 and with poplar 2. 07 ± 0. 56 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1. The highest emission rates for the studied plantations were observed in July for both years 2013 and 2014, during which the highest air and soil temperatures were recorded. Correlations between soil emission of CO 2 and some meteorological parameters and leaf characteristics were investigated for the years 2013 and 2014. For example, for the willow clone (Jorr) and poplar clone (Max 3), high correlations were found for each between their soil emission of CO 2 and both soil temperature and moisture content. Fitted models can explain about 77 and 75 % of the results for Jorr and Max 3 clones, respectively. Moreover, a model of leaf area (LA) can explain about 68. 6 % of soil CO 2 emission for H 275. Estimated models {{can be used as a}} gap-filling method, when field data is not available. The ratio between soil respiration and the combustion heat calculated from the extracted products per hectare was evaluated and compared for the study’s willow, poplar and rapeseed crops. The results show that poplar and willow SRF has a very low ratio of 183 kg CO 2 GJ 1 compared to rapeseed, 738 kg CO 2 GJ 1. The soil-column experiment showed that by continuing the SRF plantation at the As-contaminated site, remediation would need only about 3 % of the time needed if the site was left as a fallow field. In order to understand the complex willow and poplar short rotation forestry production system, 50 key variables were identified and prioritized to describe the system as a step to enhance the success of such potentially sustainable projects. The MICMAC approach was used in order to find the direct and the indirect relationships between those parameters and to classify them into different clusters depending on their driving force and interdependency. From this, it can be summarized that in order to enhance the success of a SRF system, decision makers should be focussing on: ensuring a developed wood-fuel market, increasing farmers’ experience/training, improving subsidy regulations and recommending a proper <b>harvesting</b> <b>year</b> cycle. Finally, the impacts of land-use change and occupation on the ecosystem quality were assessed. Results show that establishing SRF plantations on degraded lands improved the ecosystem structural quality (ESQ) by about 43 % and ecosystem functional quality (EFQ) by about 12 %. Based on overall results, poplar and willow SRF biomass can be recommended as renewable and sustainable sources for bioenergy...|$|E
