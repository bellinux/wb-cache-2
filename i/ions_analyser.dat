40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} construct Mathieu stability plot for any arbitrary toroidal <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analyser.</b> The proposed method is demonstrated on two toroidal <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analyser</b> geometries. Two additional studies have also been carried out. These include prediction of ion secular frequency and ion trajectories at resonances in these traps. In this numerical study, toroidal multipole coefficients of the respective traps are first evaluated and these are used for computing Mathieu parameters, a and q. These Mathieu parameters are used for constructing the stability plot, predicting secular frequency of ion motion and evaluating nonlinear resonances. The stability regions of both the traps considered in this paper are qualitatively similar to the corresponding plot of the linear <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analyser.</b> There are, however two significant differences. First, the stability plots for toroidal <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analysers</b> have prominent resonances. Second the apices of the stability plots of the toroidal <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analysers</b> {{are different from those}} of the linear <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analyser.</b> The secular frequency obtained using the Mathieu parameters in this paper agrees well with those obtained numerically, except close to the stability boundaries. Finally, the prominent nonlinear resonances have been identified as beta(r) = 2 / 3 and beta(r) = 2 / 3 in both the traps. In one of the two traps there is an additional prominent nonlinear resonance at beta(r) + beta(z) = 1. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Difficulties in {{measuring}} the urea content in sheep's milk often occur with spectral photometry {{due to the}} high protein and fat concentrations of the milk. In this study an enzymatic flow procedure (QuickChem 8000 <b>Ion</b> <b>Analyser,</b> Lachat Instruments, Milwaukee, USA) to determine the urea content in ovine and bovine milk was evaluated.

Detection takes place by means of a reaction between the ammonium ions with hypochlorite and salicylate producing a green colour, which is measured spectrometrically in a flow meter at 660 nm. By using a diffusion cell chemical deproteinisation of milk is not necessary and capacity is high. The assessed procedure exhibited high accuracy and precision and reached a sample capacity of 55 samples an hour. Storage of the milk samples for several days as well as chemical preservation with bronopol had no effect on the measurement procedure.

To compare, in vitro, the {{fluoride}} {{release from}} a conventional glass ionomer cement (Ketac-Cem), a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (3 M-Multicure) and a polyacid modified composite (Ultra Band-Lok) using a banded tooth model and a disc model {{with the same}} mean cement weight. Methods. Forty pairs of caries-free third molars were collected and divided into two groups, each of 20 teeth. One tooth from each pair was banded with Ketac-Cem {{and the other with}} Ultra Band-Lok or 3 M-Multicure; the average band size for each cement group was the same. Two coats of nail varnish were painted on each tooth to within 1 mm of the band margin. Five discs (4. 5 mm diameter and 2 mm depth) were prepared for each cement, these dimensions having been calculated so that the mean cement weight of the banded tooth model matched that of the disc model for each cement.

On 20 January 2015 the Rosetta {{spacecraft}} {{was at a}} heliocentric {{distance of}} 2. 5 [*]AU, accompanying comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on its journey toward the Sun. The <b>Ion</b> Composition <b>Analyser</b> (RPC-ICA), other instruments of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium, and the ROSINA instrument made observations relevant to the generation of plasma waves in the cometary environment. Aims. Observations of plasma waves by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium Langmuir probe (RPC-LAP) {{can be explained by}} dispersion relations calculated based on measurements of ions by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium <b>Ion</b> Composition <b>Analyser</b> (RPC-ICA), and this gives insight into the relationship between plasma phenomena and the neutral coma, which is observed by the Comet Pressure Sensor of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument (ROSINA-COPS). Methods. We use the simple pole expansion technique to compute dispersion relations for waves on ion timescales based on the observed ion distribution functions. These dispersion relations are then compared to the waves that are observed. Data from the instruments RPC-LAP, RPC-ICA and the mutual impedance probe (RPC-MIP) are compared to find the best estimate of the plasma density. Results. We find that ion acoustic waves are present in the plasma at comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, where the major ion species is H 2 O+. The bulk of the ion distribution is cold, kBTi = 0. 01 [*]eV when the ion acoustic waves are observed. At times when the neutral density is high, ions are heated through acceleration by the solar wind electric field and scattered in collisions with the neutrals. This process heats the ions to about 1 [*]eV, which leads to significant damping of the ion acoustic waves. Conclusions. In conclusion, we show that ion acoustic waves appear in the H 2 O+ plasmas at comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and how the interaction between the neutral and ion populations affects the wave properties...|$|R

40|$|Background: Caries {{prevalence}} {{has declined}} significantly since {{the introduction of}} fluoridated toothpastes. There {{have been a number}} of developments with regards to specific active fluoride ingredients but not enough evidence to support one over the other. Aim: To compare the salivary fluoride concentrations of different fluoride formulations in the form of toothpaste: fluoride-free (0 ppmF), sodium fluoride (1, 450 ppmF), sodium monofluorophosphate (1, 450 ppmF), sodium fluoride and monofluorophosphate combined (1, 450 ppmF), stannous fluoride and sodium fluoride combined (1, 450 ppmF) and amine fluoride (1, 400 ppmF) with and without post-brushing water rinsing. Design: Study registered with ClilincalTrials. gov public database (NCT 02740803). In vivo double-blinded randomised controlled trial measuring salivary fluoride concentrations following brushing with six toothpaste formulations. Power calculation was performed using PASS 11. 0 software and the total sample size of 120 was recruited in this study. Participants brushed with 1. 0 g of one of six different formulations of toothpastes either with or without water rinsing post-brushing. Participants were randomly assigned to groups using an online random team generator. Saliva was collected at six different times (baseline and at 1, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minute(s) post-brushing]. Samples were analysed using a fluoride ion-specific sensitive electrode connected to an <b>ion</b> <b>analyser.</b> Codes were broken after data analysis. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 23 software. Results: Demographic characteristics were not significant variables (p> 0. 05). Time, toothpaste formulation and rinsing methods had significant effects (p< 0. 05). In general, amine fluoride toothpaste resulted in significantly higher salivary fluoride concentrations at 90 minutes than control groups, in both rinsing and non-rinsing groups. Sodium monofuorophosphate toothpaste did not result in significant difference compared to control group at any time point, in both rinsing and non-rinsing groups. Conclusion: The results of this study supports the current recommendation of no rinsing post-brushing. It also supports the previous literature in that amine fluoride resulted in significantly higher fluoride concentrations. ...|$|R

However, the accuracy of MS for such quantitative measurements remains to be clarified. As a key step towards this goal, a panel of related tryptic peptides with and without complex, biantennary, disialylated N-glycans was chemically synthesised by solid-phase peptide synthesis.

The MS ionisation/detection strengths of these pure, well-defined and quantified compounds were investigated using various MS ionisation techniques and mass analysers (ESI-IT, ESI-Q-TOF, MALDI-TOF, ESI/MALDI-FT-ICR-MS).

Less ionisation/detection bias was observed when the glycopeptides were analysed by nano-ESI and medium-pressure MALDI. The position of the glycosylation site within the tryptic peptides also influenced the signal response, in particular if detected as singly or doubly charged signals. This is the first study to systematically and quantitatively address and determine MS glycopeptide ionisation/detection strengths to evaluate glycoprotein micro-heterogeneity and macro-heterogeneity by label-free approaches. These data form a much needed knowledge base for accurate quantitative glycoproteomics. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Samples of raw {{red wine}} (Primitivo di Manduria, Apulia, Southern Italy) were {{analysed}} without any pre-treatment (except 1 : 2 dilution with water) using HPLC with detection based on UV absorbance and Electrospray Ionisation SequentialMass Spectrometry (ESI-MSn, with n = 1 – 3) {{in a series}} configuration. In particular, absorbance at 520 nm was monitored for UV detection {{in order to identify}} pigments responsible for wine colour. On the other hand, two subsequent stages of MS detection based on positive ions were adopted. The first consisted of an explorativeMS acquisition, aimed at the individuation of the m/z ratios for positively charged compounds; the second was based on fragmentation of the detected ions within an <b>ion</b> trap <b>analyser,</b> followed by MS/MS and, if required, MS 3 acquisitions. The synergy between UV detection and MSn analysis led to the identification of 41 pigments, which can be classified into five groups: grape anthocyanins, pyranoanthocyanins, vinyl-linked anthocyaninflavanol pigments, ethyl-bridged anthocyanin-flavanol pigments and flavanol-anthocyanin compounds. Many isomeric and oligomeric structures were found within each group. A further class of compounds, not absorbing in the visible spectrum, could be also characterised by ESI-MSn and corresponded to B-type procyanidins, i. e. proanthocyanidins arising from C 4 →C 8 /C 4 →C 6 couplings between catechin or epicatechin units. In particular, oligomeric structures (from dimers to pentamers), often present with several isomers, were identified and their fragmentation patterns clarified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for intercalibrating particle and optical measurements from the Reimei microsatellite using an ionospheric model. Reimei has three auroral cameras (“MAC”), together with electron and <b>ion</b> energy spectrum <b>analysers</b> (“ESA/ISA”). The maximum electron energy measured is 12 keV, {{which means that}} during high-energy events, the particle data are often missing {{an important part of}} the energy flux. Although the total electron energy flux can be estimated from the optical measurements, the MAC data must be accurately calibrated, which is complicated by an unknown and variable background from sources such as the moon and snow reflection. Using unsaturated ESA measurements of the complete electron spectrum as input for an ionospheric model, the coincident camera observations can be calibrated, allowing estimates to be made of the total electron energy flux at other times during the same event, when the maximum energy is well above that measured by ES...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe COmetary Secondary <b>Ion</b> Mass <b>Analyser</b> {{instrument}} {{on board}} ESA's Rosetta mission has collected dust {{particles in the}} coma of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. During the early-orbit phase of the Rosetta mission, particles and particle agglomerates have been imaged and analyzed in the inner coma at distances between 100 km and 10 km off the cometary nucleus and at more than 3 AU from the Sun. We identified 585 particles of more than 14 μm in size. The particles are collected at low impact speeds and constitute {{a sample of the}} dust particles in the inner coma impacting and fragmenting on the targets. The sizes of the particles range from 14 μm up to sub-millimeter sizes and the differential dust flux size distribution is fitted with a power law exponent of - 3. 1. After impact, the larger particles tend to stick together, spread out or consist of single or a group of clumps, and the flocculent morphology of the fragmented particles is revealed. The elemental composition of the dust particles is heterogeneous and the particles could contain typical silicates like olivine and pyroxenes, as well as iron sulfides. The sodium to iron elemental ratio is enriched with regard to abundances in CI carbonaceous chondrites by a factor from ˜ 1. 5 to ˜ 15. No clear evidence for organic matter has been identified. The composition and morphology of the collected dust particles appear to be similar to that of interplanetary dust particles...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with measurements of the anisotropic part of the azimuthal component of the ion velocity distribution function {{by means of a}} singly gridded <b>ion</b> energy <b>analyser.</b> The experiments are performed on a magnetised plasma column to investigate the dependency of the ExB-rotation velocity of the plasma on the radius. The thermal as well as the local rotation velocities of the ions are determined from current voltage characteristics of an ion-energy-analyser, assuming the ions to have a Maxwellian distribution function in a frame moving with the ExB-rotation velocity. The normalised difference of the derivatives of a pair of characteristics, recorded in up- and downstream direction with respect to the local rotation velocity, is calculated to give the anisotropic part of the distribution function. It is evaluated applying a procedure that treats the velocities as free parameters of a (non-linear) model function and fits them to the experimental data in the ion retarding regime of the characteristics. The difference of the derivatives of the characteristics also indicates the position of the plasma potential on both characteristics. Thus the local radial electric field can be determined and indeed is used to calculate a radial profile of the ExB-rotation velocity. The measured and calculated radial profiles of the ExB-rotation velocities agree within the range of experimental uncertainties. (orig.)

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} methods to {{determine}} multipole coefficients for describing the potential in toroidal <b>ion</b> trap mass <b>analysers.</b> Three different {{methods have been}} presented to compute the toroidal multipole coefficients. The first method uses at least square fit (LS) and is useful when we have ability to compute potential at a set of points in the trapping region. In the second method we use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of potentials on a circle in the trapping region. The third method uses surface charge distribution obtained from the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to compute these coefficients. Using these multipole coefficients we have presented (1) equations of ion motion in toroidal ion traps, (2) the Mathieu parameters in terms of multipole coefficients and (3) the secular frequency of ion motion in these traps. It {{has been shown that}} the secular frequency obtained from our method has a good match with that obtained from numerical trajectory simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
