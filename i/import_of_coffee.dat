It is an affiliate of the Vietnam National Coffee Corporation (abbreviated [...] "Vinacafe"), a Hanoi-based, state-owned corporation under the Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Industry, which deals in the production, processing, export, and <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> Established in 1969 at the Coronel Coffee Plant in Biên Hòa, Đồng Nai Province, Republic of Vietnam by French engineer Marcel Coronel, the company was confiscated by the state when Coronel and his family fled Vietnam {{at the close of}} the Vietnam War. The plant successfully processed its first batches of instant coffee in 1977. The Vinacafé brand was established in 1983, and the company became a joint stock company in December 2004.

5000|$|The Coronel Coffee Plant was {{established}} in 1969 by French engineer Marcel Coronel, {{with the aim of}} providing inexpensive coffee for export to France. When Coronel left Vietnam in 1975, the Viet Cong took over management of the plant. Two years later, in 1977, the plant successfully processed its first batches of instant coffee. Vietnam's entry into Comecon in 1978 allowed Vinacafé to begin exporting coffee to the Soviet Union and other Soviet Bloc states. The Vinacafé brand {{was established}} in 1983. After the disbanding of Comecon in 1991, Vinacafé's focus returned to the domestic market, and new export markets were explored. Vinacafé's successful [...] "3-in-1" [...] line of instant coffee was introduced in 1993, and has been registered in 60 countries worldwide. In 1995, the Vietnam National Coffee Corporation was created by government decree, grouping together a large number of smaller corporations—including the Bien Hoa Coffee plant and around 49 other coffee plantations. Based in Hanoi, this state-owned parent corporation operates under the Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Industry, dealing in the production, processing, export, and <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> as well as many other products related to agriculture such as food and industrial crops, seafood, machine parts, and so on. Vinacafé Bien Hoa became a joint stock company in December 2004. As of 2005, Vinacafe's share of the domestic instant coffee market was 50%, edging out Nestlé's share of 33%.|$|E

40|$|Are multinationals {{exploiting}} {{their market}} power in national coffee markets by keeping consumer prices {{too high and}} thereby limiting demand for <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> beans? The {{purpose of this study}} is to address this issue by testing if there is market power in the Swedish market for roasted coffee. The market structure is typical of many consumer markets for coffee, with four very large roasting companies, two of which are multinationals, plus many small ones. To analyze the degree of market power, an oligopoly model is estimated using market time series data. The econometric approach is to first test for long-run relationships between the variables with cointegration analysis and then to estimate a system of equations for demand and pricing behavior. Our key finding is that there is evidence of some market power in the short run but none in the long run...|$|R

30|$|Using the SMART {{model to}} analyze the future impact of a FTA is {{increasingly}} common due to the usefulness of this approach in assessing trade impacts at disaggregated level to provide better implications for governments and enterprises. For example, Othieno and Shinyekwa (2011) used this model to evaluate the future effects of the East African Community Customs Union on Uganda’s trade, tariff revenue and social welfare in sensitive products. With the objectives of assessing the likely economic and welfare impacts of the EU Partnership Agreement with the African countries at product level, Karingi et al. (2005 a) and Karingi et al. (2005 b) both applied the SMART model. Karingi et al. (2005 a) used this model for {{the case of the}} EU-Africa Economic Partnership Agreement and Karingi et al. (2005 b) for the EU-ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) Economic Partnership Agreement. Adopting the SMART model to stimulate the likely trade creation and diversion effects of the India-Sri Lanka FTA in three sectors including textiles, base metal and machinery equipment, Choudhry et al. (2013) saw a significantly higher trade creation than trade diversion and pointed out some products that seem to be benefited most for India from the agreement. Veeramani and Saini (2010) by using the SMART model found out that the ASEAN-India Preferential Trade Agreement led to a significant increase in India’s <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> tea and pepper from the ASEAN countries and the trade creation dominated over trade diversion.|$|R

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} belief that consumer coffee prices are high relative to bean prices and that lower consumer prices would lead to substantial increases in bean exports from Third-World countries. This issue is evaluated by analysing how retail prices, preferences and market power influence coffee demand in Sweden. A demand function is estimated for the period 1968 - 2002 and used, together with information on <b>import</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, to simulate an oligopoly model. This approach gives estimates of the maximum average degree of market power and shows how coffee demand would react to reductions in marginal cost to its minimum level. The maximum level of market power {{is found to be}} low, but it generates large spreads between consumer and bean prices because the price elasticity has low absolute values. Moreover, the impact of a price decrease would be small because long-run coffee demand is dominated by changes in the population structure in combination with different preferences across age groups. Hence, a change to perfect competition would only have a negligible effect on bean imports...|$|R

The analyses of production show enormous differences between developed and developing countries on the supply side. Dissimilarity appeared in the price system. Our results show that developing countries (especially least developed countries) cannot fully benefit from the international trade because they are placed just on the lowest level of the production vertical line.

25|$|Much of the Caribbean {{economic}} development was contingent to Europeans' demand for sugar, which plantation owners traded for European and North American manufactured goods. Saint Domingue also had extensive coffee, cocoa, and indigo plantations, {{but these were}} smaller and less profitable than the wealthy sugar plantations. Starting in the 1730s, French engineers constructed complex irrigation systems to increase sugarcane production. By the 1740s Saint-Domingue, together with Jamaica, had become the main supplier of the world's sugar. Sugar production depended on extensive manual labor provided by enslaved Africans in the harsh Saint-Domingue colonial plantation economy. Saint-Domingue was the most profitable French colony in the entire world, indeed {{one of the most}} profitable of all the European colonies in the 18th century, with an average of 600 ships engaged every year in shipping products from Saint-Domingue to Bordeaux and the value of Saint-Domingue's goods almost equal in value to all of the products shipped from the British 13 colonies to Great Britain. The economic importance of St. Domingue to France {{can be seen in the}} livelihood of 1 million out of the 25 million or so people who lived in the Kingdom of France in 1789 depended directly upon the <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> indigo and sugar from St. Domingue, and several million indirectly depended upon trade from France's richest colony to maintain their standard of living. To sustain the sugar production amid the unhealthy climate of the Caribbean with malaria and yellow fever running rampant was slavery. In one year alone, namely 1787, the French imported about 20, 000 slaves from Africa into Saint-Domingue while the British imported about 38, 000 slaves to all of their Caribbean colonies. The death rate from yellow fever was such that at least 50% <b>of</b> the slaves <b>imported</b> from Africa died within a year of arriving, and as such the masters preferred to work their slaves as hard as possible while providing with them with the barest minimum of food and shelter, calculating that it was better to get the most work out of their slaves with lowest possible expense possible since they were probably going to die of yellow fever anyway. The death rate was so high that polyandry - one woman being married to several men at the same time - came to be a common form of marriage among the slaves. As slaves had no legal rights, rape by the masters was a common occurrence on the plantations.|$|R

40|$|Trade with Latin American {{countries}} is {{an increasingly important}} issue, as negotiations progress for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The objectives {{of this study are}} to analyze U.

S. agricultural trade. This study analyzes U. S. exports of wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, soybean meal, beef, pork, and poultry meat to 16 Latin American countries; U. S. <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> bananas, <b>coffee,</b> grapes, fruit and vegetable juice, sugar, pineapples, avocados, mangos, prepared or preserved meat, crustaceans, and fish fillets or meat from these countries are also analyzed. An econometric model is developed and estimated to determine factors influencing U. S. agricultural trade with these countries. Results from the model show that there is a negative relationship between U. S. exports and foreign tariffs, price, exchange rates, and foreign production, while there is a positive relationship between U. S. exports and foreign real GDP. U. S. imports have a negative relationship with U. S. tariffs and price and a positive relationship with the exchange rate. U. S. tariffs on <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> agricultural products from Latin American countries, though, are small or nonexistent in many cases. This would suggest that trade liberalization could have a larger effect on U. S. exports than on imports. Trade creation and trade diversion effects of tariff removal under the FTAA are calculated. Trade creation effects, overall, are higher for U. S. exports to these countries than they are for U. S. imports. The trade diversion effects, especially for exports, are small because most agricultural imports in the hemisphere are from other countries within the hemisphere, indicating that the FTAA will not significantly affect trade of the agricultural commodities under analysis with third-party, non-member countries.
