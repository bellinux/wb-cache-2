5000|$|The word epoch {{was often}} used in a {{different}} way in older astronomical literature, e.g. during the 18th century, in connection with astronomical tables. At that time, it was customary to denote as [...] "epochs", not the standard <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time of origin for time-varying astronomical quantities, but rather the values at that <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time of those time-varying quantities themselves. [...] In accordance with that alternative historical usage, an expression such as 'correcting the epochs' would refer to the adjustment, usually by a small amount, of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities applicable to a fixed standard <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time of reference (and not, as might be expected from current usage, to a change from one <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time of reference to a different <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time).|$|R
