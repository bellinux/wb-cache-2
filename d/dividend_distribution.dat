25|$|The largest {{minority}} shareholder, the Petersen Group, held a 25% stake at {{the time}} of the renationalization, and had financed their initial purchase of 15% of the stock in 2007 with a vendor’s loan from Repsol for €1.5 billion. The chairman and majority owner of the Petersen Group, Enrique Eskenazi, was close to President Néstor Kirchner, who supported Eskenazi's bid to become YPF's principal Argentine stockholder. Eskenazi benefited from a <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution</b> rate at YPF of 90%, which allowed the Group to repay its vendor's loan in installments. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebastián Eskenazi, the son of the Petersen Group chairman and CEO of YPF until April 16, indicated however that the group would forego this option. The Group defaulted in May on a Credit Suisse loan taken in 2011 to raise its stake in YPF from 15% to 25%. Officials at Credit Suisse and at other creditors involved, including Banco Itaú, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs, announced on May 11 that the Group's shares would be repossessed as collateral. Repsol, as another of the Group's creditors affected by their default, also repossessed a block of shares, thus increasing their stake in YPF to 12%; following a steep rally in YPF shares, Repsol sold its stake a year later.|$|E
2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution,</b> {{generally}} as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E

40|$|Share buy-backs {{evolved into}} a {{significant}} instrument of companies’ financial cash management. Compared to <b>dividend</b> <b>distributions</b> the taxation of domestic share buy-backs {{is considered to be}} favourable. The taxation of a cross-border share buy-back is subject to the regulations as applied by the tax regimes of the shareholder {{as well as of the}} repurchasing company. The ambiguous character of own shares leading to inconsistent legal treatment, the prevailing corporate tax system, the distinction of various types of income and withholding tax aspects affect the tax position of the parties participating in the share buy-back. In the course of a dynamic model this analysis focuses on the impact of international taxation on cross-border share buy-backs and their tax benefit compared to <b>dividend</b> <b>distributions.</b> It is not possible to create a generally accepted rule regarding the tax benefit of a share buy-back being treated as a partial liquidation or as a capital gain. The tax burden depends on miscellaneous factors, respectively the interdependency of such factors. Under domestic law it is proven that taxation of a share buy-back compared to a cash dividend cannot be disadvantageous. In contrast this tax benefit cannot be shown generally in a cross-border situation. The OECD Model does not stipulate which provisions are applicable to the shareholders’ proceeds deriving from the participation in a share buy-back (Art. 10 or Art. 13 OECD Model). Hence, qualification conflicts might occur. Under some circumstances the selling shareholder might suffer from an excess tax burden due to a qualification conflict. A consistent international tax treatment of share buy-backs can partially achieve tax neutrality also in respect to <b>dividend</b> <b>distributions.</b> But even if the tax treatment of a share buy-back is covered consistently, distinct tax differences might result from various factors, e. g. the absence of a harmonised tax framework regarding direct taxes or the domestic unequal treatment of capital gains versus <b>dividend</b> <b>distributions...</b>|$|R

50|$|In India, earlier {{dividends}} were taxed in {{the hands}} of the recipient as any other income. However, since 1 June 1997, all domestic companies were liable to pay a <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution</b> tax on the profits distributed as dividends resulting in a smaller net dividend to the recipients. The rate of taxation alternated between 10% and 20% until the tax was abolished with effect from 31 March 2002. The <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution</b> tax was also extended to dividends distributed since 1 June 1999 by domestic mutual funds, with the rate alternating between 10% and 20% in line with the rate for companies, up to 31 March 2002. However, dividends from open-ended equity oriented funds distributed between 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002 were not taxed. Hence the dividends received from domestic companies since 1 June 1997, and domestic mutual funds since 1 June 1999, were made non-taxable {{in the hands}} of the recipients to avoid double-taxation, until 31 March 2002.|$|E
