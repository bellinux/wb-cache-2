40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{compendium}} of research which brings together ideas from the fields of Complex Networks and Computational Neuroscience to address two questions regarding neural systems: 1) How the activity of neurons, via synaptic changes, can shape the topology of the network they form part of, and 2) How the resulting network structure, <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>might</b> condition aspects of brain behaviour. Although {{the emphasis is on}} neural networks, several theoretical findings which are relevant for complex networks in general are presented [...] such as a method for studying network evolution as a stochastic process, or a theory that allows for ensembles of correlated networks, and sets of dynamical elements thereon, to be treated mathematically and computationally in a model-independent manner. Some of the results are used to explain experimental data [...] certain properties of brain tissue, the spontaneous emergence of correlations in all kinds of networks [...] . [...] and predictions regarding statistical aspects of the central nervous system are made. The mechanism of Cluster Reverberation is proposed to account for the near-instant storage of novel information the brain is capable of.

40|$|Madurella mycetomatis is {{the main}} causative {{organism}} of eumycetoma, a persistent, progressive granulomatous infection. After subcutaneous inoculation M. mycetomatis organizes itself in grains inside a granuloma with excessive collagen accumulation surrounding it. This could be contributing to treatment failure towards currently used antifungal agents. Due to their pivotal role in tissue remodelling, matrix metalloproteinases- 2 (MMP- 2) and 9 (MMP- 9) or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) might {{be involved in this}} process. Local MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry while absolute serum levels of these enzymes were determined in mycetoma patients and healthy controls by performing ELISAs. The presence of active MMP was determined by gelatin zymography. We found that both MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 are expressed in the mycetoma lesion, but the absolute MMP- 2, - 9, and TIMP- 1 serum levels did not significantly differ between patients and controls. However, active MMP- 9 was found in sera of 36 % of M. mycetomatis infected subjects, whereas this active form was absent in sera of controls (P< 0. 0001). MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and TIMP- 1 polymorphisms in mycetoma patients and healthy controls were determined through PCR-RFLP or sequencing. A higher T allele frequency in TIMP- 1 (+ 372) SNP was observed in male M. mycetomatis mycetoma patients compared to controls. The presence of active MMP- 9 in mycetoma patients suggest that MMP- 9 is activated or synthesized by inflammatory cells upon M. mycetomatis infection. Inhibiting MMP- 9 activity with doxycycline could prevent collagen accumulation in mycetoma, which <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>turn</b> <b>might</b> make the fungus more accessible to antifungal agents...|$|E
40|$|Rationale : Emotions {{have been}} {{associated}} with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL- 6; more precisely, negative emotions with greater cytokines level whereas positive emotions with lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may have significant repercussions on individuals&#x 2019; health specifically for those who are subjected to chronic inflammation {{as in the case of}} HIV positive persons. In fact, HIV virus itself produces greater TNF-alpha production, which <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>turns</b> <b>might</b> promote greater IL- 6 levels. Thus, this work was conducted in order to verify whether along with HIV association with pro-inflammatory cytokines production, negative and positive emotions, as well as their &#x 201 C;balance&#x 201 D;, might be associated with cytokines level. Methods : Participants to this cross-sectional study were 90 individuals with HIV diagnosis. Emotions were assessed through the Italian version of Derogatis Affects Balance Scale edited by the first two authors of this work. The biomarkers included were viral load, TNF-alpha, and IL- 6. Individuals also self-reported whether they were under antiretroviral therapy. Results : A Structural Equation Model was performed in order to test if negative and positive emotions and their balance (that consisted in the ratio of positive/negative emotions) along with viral load were associated with cytokines level. Results indicated that viral load (&#x 03 B 2;&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 538, p&# 60; 0. 001), negative emotions (&#x 03 B 2;&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 366, p&# 60; 0. 05) and positive/negative emotions (&#x 03 B 2;&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A;&#x 2212;&#x 200 A; 0. 420, p&# 60; 0. 05) ratio were significantly associated with greater TNF-alpha production. No significant associations were observed with IL- 6. Conclusion : Taken together, these results may indicate that together with virus effect in producing greater inflammation, emotions may also contribute to it. Negative emotions could then promote greater inflammation whereas, when individuals experience more positive emotions than negative, inflammation might be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Background Ambulance {{professionals}} often address {{conflicts between}} ethical values. As individuals’ values represent basic convictions {{of what is}} right or good and motivate behaviour, {{research is needed to}} understand their value profiles. Objectives To translate and adapt the Managerial Values Profile to Spanish and Swedish, and measure the presence of utilitarianism, moral rights and/or social justice in ambulance professionals’ value profiles in Spain and Sweden. Methods The instrument was translated and culturally adapted. A content validity index was calculated. Pilot tests were carried out with 46 participants. Ethical considerations This study conforms to the ethical principles for research involving human subjects and adheres to national laws and regulations concerning informed consent and confidentiality. Findings Spanish professionals favoured justice and Swedish professionals’ rights in their ambulance organizations. Both countries favoured utilitarianism least. Gender differences across countries showed that males favoured rights. Spanish female professionals favoured justice most strongly of all. Discussion Swedes favour rights while Spaniards favour justice. Both contexts scored low on utilitarianism focusing on total population effect, preferring the opposite, individualized approach of the rights and justice perspectives. Organizational investment in a utilitarian perspective might jeopardize ambulance professionals’ moral right to make individual assessments based on the needs of the patient at hand. Utilitarianism and a caring ethos appear as stark opposites. However, a caring ethos <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>turn</b> <b>might</b> well involve unreasonable demands on the individual carer’s professional role. Since both the justice and rights perspectives portrayed in the survey mainly concern relationship to the organization and peers within the organization, this relationship might at worst be given priority over the equal treatment and moral rights of the patient. Conclusion A balanced view on ethical perspectives is needed to make professionals observant and ready to act optimally – especially if these perspectives are used in patient care. Research is needed to clarify how justice and rights are prioritized by ambulance services and whether or not these organization-related values are also implemented in patient care...|$|E
3000|$|The {{link between}} {{interests}} and social-emotional skills is that interest patterns {{play a key}} role in individuals’ educational or vocational decisions, which <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>turn</b> <b>might</b> stimulate the development of specific social-emotional skills associated with that field. It is worth noting that interests are also an expression of environments where people can perform their preferred activities. Thus, in the same environment chosen to perform one’s interest, other people with similar patterns of social-emotional skills probably will provide role models for stimulate their development. An example of how profound interest differences between genders might lead to different educational decisions is the larger percentage of males enrolled in the so-called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) majors. The meta-analysis of Su, Rounds, and Armstrong (2009) shows interest d-effect size differences of [...]. 36 for science, [...]. 34 for mathematics, and 1.11 for engineering between men and women, which are likely to lead to gender differences in social-emotional skill levels particularly associated with these interests. Alternatively, interests might also be directly relevant. Taxonomies of twenty-first century skills explicitly mention various content domains, such as ICT (informatics, computers and technology) literacy, green and sustainable behaviors, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship, just to name a few, as domains in which particular skills have to be learned and developed. These particular fields are probably better represented by models describing vocational interests than by personality-based social-emotional skill taxonomies. Furthermore, learning and working in a content domain that ‘fits’ with what one prefers is assumed to be motivating, and there is abundant evidence that Person-Environment fit for interests is associated with increased learning and job satisfaction (Holland, 1997). In their meta-analyses, Nye et al. (2012) showed a baseline estimate between interest congruence and academic performance of [...]. 32 and a correlation of [...]. 36 for work performance. Interests are thus also directly relevant for the learning and educational context by substantially explaining educational achievement. Therefore, in addition to describing or measuring students’ social-emotional skill levels, policy-makers also need to pay attention to interest differences among students, in order to make an adequate evaluation of the employability of a student population and its connectivity to the labor market (Brunello and Rocco, 2017; Wang and Wanberg, 2017).|$|E
