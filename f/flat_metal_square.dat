40|$|The DSI 3 D-RCS code is {{designed}} to numerically evaluate radar cross sections on complex objects by solving Maxwell`s curl equations in the time-domain and in three space dimensions. The code {{has been designed to}} run on the new parallel processing computers as well as on conventional serial computers. The DSI 3 D-RCS code has been used to solve the following problems: (1) wedge cylinder [...] thin <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> plate; (2) wedge cylinder with plate extension [...] thin <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> plate; (3) plate with half cylinder extension [...] thin <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> plate; (4) rectangular plate (business card) [...] thin <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> plate; (5) wedge cylinder with gap [...] thin <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> plate; (6) NASA Almond; (7) wavelength circular cavity. In order to generate each of the angle sweeps, it was necessary to run DSI 3 D once for each data point on the graphs. This is because these are backscatter calculations, and the incident pulse comes from a different direction as the angle {phi} is changed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{mechanism}} for the chemical contribution to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The theory considers the modulation of the polarizability of a metal nanocluster or a <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> surface by the vibrational motion of an adsorbed molecule. The modulated polarization of the substrate coupled with the incident light {{will contribute to the}} Raman scattering enhancement. We show that for a metal cluster and for a <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> surface this new chemical contribution may enhance the Raman scattering intensity by a factor of similar to 10 (2) and similar to 10 (4), respectively. The new SERS process is determined by the electric field parallel {{to the surface of the}} metal substrate at the molecular binding site...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{growing interest in}} the development of small-footprint lasers for potential applications in small-volume sensing and on-chip optical communications. Surface-plasmons, electromagnetic modes evanescently confined to metal-dielectric interfaces, offer an effective route to achieving lasing at nanometer-scale dimensions when resonantly amplified in contact with a gain-medium. Here, we achieve visible frequency ultra-narrow linewidth lasing at room-temperature by leveraging surface plasmons propagating in an open Fabry-Perot cavity formed by a <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> surface coated with a subwavelength-thick layer of optically-pumped gain medium and orthogonally bound by a pair of <b>flat</b> <b>metal</b> sidewalls. Low perturbation transmission-configuration sampling of the lasing plasmon mode is achieved via an evanescently coupled recessed nanoslit, opening the way to high-figure-of-merit refractive-index sensing of analytes interacting with the open cavity...|$|R
