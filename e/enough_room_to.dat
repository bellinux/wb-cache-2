5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium. Since there was not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, the Vanderbilt administrators {{purchased}} land adjacent to the present 25th Avenue South for the new facility. The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E
25|$|Beothuk canoes {{were made}} of caribou or seal skin, and {{the bow of the}} canoe was {{stiffened}} with spruce bark. Canoes resembled kayaks and were said to be fifteen feet in length and two and a half feet in width with <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> carry children, dogs and property.|$|E

Tony suggests he and Don share one room, while Anita and Lola take the other. During his stay, Tony tries unsuccessfully to persuade Anita {{to take him}} back.

25|$|By 1817, an {{increasing}} number of female convicts were arriving in Hobart town, and there was not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> keep them in the first Hobart Town gaol. Permission was granted in 1821 by NSW Governor Lachlan Macquarie {{for the construction of a}} separate gaol for female convicts. Despite this, construction took nearly eight years, and it wasn't until December 1828 that the first female convicts began to be transferred to the Cascades Female Factory, in the foothills of Mount Wellington.|$|E
25|$|It {{was smaller}} than Bunce Court, so a group of the {{youngest}} children were sent temporarily to a school in Surrey. Even so, there was terrible overcrowding and after a year, the chicken coop and the stables were converted into dormitories, creating <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> allow the younger children to return. Even so, some bedrooms doubled as classrooms {{and had to be}} rearranged for use every morning. More time consuming, however, was having to cover every window in the evening to comply with the orders for a complete blackout, a task which had to be carried out for years.|$|E
25|$|Psychologically, the {{earthquake}} {{had a profound}} impact on its victims and not just in the immediate aftermath. As a result of the quake, two hospitals in Bam collapsed, leaving the remaining hospitals filled. Emergency centers were set up to care for the injured, though many centers did not have <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> do so. Of all of Bam's health workers, half were killed in the rupture. The World Health Organisation (WHO) appealed for $4 million in medical relief. One of the priorities in this operation was to help mental health patients, many of whom were traumatized over the experience. A situation report released by the U.N. Disaster Assessment Coordination Team noted a rise in post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Californians {{voted on}} Proposition 2, which {{requires}} California farmers to provide egg-laying hens, veal calves, and pregnant pigs with housing {{that gives them}} <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> move around beginning January 1, 2015. The law would mostly impact the state's 18 million egg-laying hens. The current industry standards call for caged hens {{to get at least}} 67 square inches of space each, a little less than a regular-size sheet of paper, (a sheet of paper is 93.5 square inches) and hens are typically caged in groups of two to eight. Proposition 2 grew into the most expensive animal welfare ballot measure ever, with both sides raising nearly $8 million each. The measure passed with 63.2 percent of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Work {{was begun}} on the Great Incline with such steep grades that no mule could be flogged enough into {{negotiating}} it. Instead, materials were carried {{up on the}} back of laborers. Grading became a particular problem. While funiculars were usually considered to require four rails, two for the ascending car, and two for the descending car, there was not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> widen the grade to accommodate four rails. Over night the inventive Thaddeus Lowe {{came up with a plan}} to only use four rails where the cars pass each other and three rails on the upper and lower ends of the run, whereby the cars shared the center rail. The ingenious three-railed funicular not only fit, but it also reduced the amount of required materials. This three-railed design has been applied on other places as well (e.g. Angels Flight).|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles was by {{now well}} aware of Napoleon's {{intentions}} but remained committed to his plan not to fight the battle on the flat Marchfeld plain, where the superior French cavalry would have given Napoleon a clear edge. Thus, Charles did nothing to support his two forward units and watched as Nordmann gradually withdrew north, towards the Russbach line and Klenau withdrew northwest, towards Breintlee. Meanwhile, Napoleon was free to advance north, into the Marchfeld plain, where he would have <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> deploy his forces. The French advanced in battalion columns, with their front line formed by the Corps of Masséna on the left, Oudinot in the centre and Davout on the right, and the respective Corps cavalry screening the flanks. By noon, the French had advanced into the Marchfeld, a move which so far suited both commanders.|$|E
50|$|The {{garden of}} the Désert de Retz, {{completed}} in 1785, contained twenty-one fabriques, or architectural constructions, representing different periods of history {{and parts of the}} world; they included an artificial rock entrance, a temple of rest, an outdoor theatre, a Chinese house, a ruined Gothic church, a ruined altar, a classical tomb, an obelisque, a temple to the god Pan, a Tatar tent, and an ice-house {{in the form of a}} pyramid. The best-known feature was the ruined classical column, large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> contain <b>enough</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> be a working residence, although, as it happened, Monville apparently preferred to reside in the much smaller Chinese House while at the Desert.|$|R

25|$|In 1814, {{the ground}} {{floors of the}} Rham Barracks, the Maria Theresa Barracks, and the riding barracks were renovated for use as stables. Out of the five storage {{buildings}} for grain and flour which had been built by 1795, {{the one in the}} upper town was used as a stable. Together, these had a capacity of 386 horses. By late 1819, the artillery required a new riding arena to train a large number of new horses that were being delivered. For this, they wanted to use the garden of an old monastery on the Saint-Esprit Plateau. By 1835, an indoor riding arena in the lower yard of the plateau had been completed. This had <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> train a squadron, and in war time {{could be used as a}} livestock shed or as a fodder store.|$|E
25|$|The {{homestead}} of William McIlroy, a local {{farmer and}} merchant, {{had been selected}} {{as a location for}} the university and purchased at cost of $12,000 by the Fayetteville lobbying committee prior to the final decision of the board. At the time, the grounds consisted of a total of , just over a third of it cultivated, a six-room residence, several outbuildings, and an orchard spread over four acres. By January 1, 1872, the committee had arranged for the completion of a two story frame building, no more than twenty-four by forty feet and with <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> hold around 120 students. The total expense of the building was only $975, a fraction of the planned cost a permanent main building limited to $120,000. Six months later, a second similar building was erected for twice as much as the first to satisfy expected demands of the first matriculating class.|$|E
25|$|All Batavian {{activity}} during the main {{phase of the}} battle was therefore on the British right flank, by the Batavian left wing. Here Daendels deployed his forces in three lines, as the front was too narrow to deploy more than two battalions in line at a time. He first had Col. Crass attack with the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 5th Demi-brigade, supported by cavalry and two pieces of horse artillery under Capt. d'Anguerand. He was opposed by the British 3rd Brigade (now under command of Gen. Coote, as Gen. Pulteney had received a wound in the arm and been forced to leave the field). The British had only <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> deploy one battalion in line {{and there was a}} threat that they would be outflanked near Groote Keeten, where the main action was fought. However, the Batavians were severely hampered by the terrain. The horses sometimes sank to their bellies into the dune sand and the artillery was constantly immobilized by the loose sand. Besides, the British gunboats were able to get very close to the beach and supported the British infantry vigorously, whenever they got sight of the enemy though gaps in the dunes. This British naval gunfire wrought havoc on the Batavian troops.|$|E
