In {{order to}} meet the demand of heat {{rejection}} requirement of heavy-duty engine, a novel nanofluid heavy-duty coolant was developed in this paper by taking advantage of nanofluid heat transfer technique and organic acid technique. Comparing with conventional heavy-duty coolant, the heat transfer capacity increased more than 10 %, which solved the problems of limited thermal conductivity and convective heat transfer performance.

40|$|Nowadays {{most of the}} {{automobiles}} use magnesium alloys in {{the components}} of the <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> systems. These <b>engine</b> <b>coolants</b> used are mainly composed of aqueous ethylene glycol along with some inhibitors. Generally the <b>engine</b> <b>coolants</b> are contaminated by environmental anions like chlorides, which would enhance the rate of corrosion of the alloys used in the coolant system. In the present study, the corrosion behavior of Mg–Al–Zn–Mn alloy in 30 % (v/v) aqueous ethylene glycol containing chloride anions at neutral pH was investigated. Electrochemical techniques, such as potentiodynamic polarization method, cyclic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the corrosion behavior of Mg–Al–Zn–Mn alloy. The surface morphology, microstructure and surface composition of the alloy were studied by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) analysis, respectively. Electrochemical investigations show that the rate of corrosion increases with the increase in chloride ion concentration and also with the increase in medium temperature...|$|R

2500|$|The center hub {{rotating}} assembly (CHRA) houses the shaft {{that connects the}} compressor impeller and turbine. It also must contain a bearing system to suspend the shaft, allowing it to rotate at very high speed with minimal friction. For instance, in automotive applications the CHRA typically uses a thrust bearing or ball bearing lubricated by a constant supply of pressurized engine oil. The CHRA may also be considered [...] "water-cooled" [...] by having an entry and exit point for <b>engine</b> <b>coolant.</b> Water-cooled models use <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> to keep lubricating oil cooler, avoiding possible oil coking (destructive distillation of engine oil) from the extreme heat in the turbine.

40|$|Cooling system plays {{important}} roles {{to control the}} temperature of car‟s engine. One of the important elements in the car cooling system is cooling fluid. The usage of wrong cooling fluid can give negatives impact to the car‟s engine and shorten engine life. An efficient cooling system can prevent engine from overheating and assists the vehicle running at its optimal performance. With {{the development of new}} technology in the fields of „nano-materials‟ and „nano-fluids‟, it seems very promising to use this technology as a coolant in the internal combustion engines. In this study, a nano-fluid (Al 2 O 3 -Water/Ethylene Glycol (EG)) is used as an <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> along with an optimized heat exchanger to reduce the warm-up timing. The effect of nano-fluid concentration is considered here by using their corresponding governing equations, such as momentum and energy. The <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> thermal behaviour calculation is carried out based on the lumped method. The obtained results indicated that using different percentage of nano-fluid mixtures (by volume), such as Al 2 O 3 -Water/EG as <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> enhances the heat transfer coefficient and reduces the warm-up timing which, in turn, results in reduced emissions and fuel consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{conducted a study}} specially to systematically analyze combined recovery of exhaust gas and <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> and related influence mechanism, including a detailed theoretical study and an assistant experimental study. In this research, CO 2 -based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) was used for fully combining the wastes heats. The main objective of theoretical research was to search an ‘ideal point’ of the recovery system and related influence mechanism, which was defined as operating condition of complete recovery of two waste heats. The theoretical methodology of this study could also provide a design reference for effective combined recovery of two or multiple waste heats in other fields. Based on a kW-class preheated CTRC prototype that was designed by the ‘ideal point’ method, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} verify combined utilization degree of two engine waste heats by the CTRC system. The operating results showed that the prototype can gain 44. 4 – 49. 8 kW and 22. 7 – 26. 7 kW heat absorption from exhaust gas and <b>engine</b> <b>coolant,</b> respectively. To direct practical operation, an experimental optimization work on the operating process was conducted for complete recovery of <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> exactly, which avoided deficient or excessive recovery...|$|R
