40|$|The {{empirical}} {{research in this}} paper uses non-parametric techniques to avoid arbitrary parametric restrictions on the underlying <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> process. The relevant hypotheses include: mean reverting <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> in the bulk shipping industry due to continuous capacity adjustments (lay-up, scrapping, newbuilding), and increasing rate of change (volatility) in the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> level. The <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> data are monthly averages from January 1989 to December 1998 in the Very Large Crude oil Carrier (VLCC) market. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} drift is non-linear with strong mean reversion only for high <b>freight</b> <b>rates,</b> and that the volatility is increasing progressively in the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> level. Moreover, the market price of <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> risk is close to zero for low and medium <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> and increasing in the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> level.

40|$|Practical {{considerations}} often necessitate using approximated, {{rather than}} actual, <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> in logistics models. This research analyzed {{the accuracy of}} five continuous <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> functions used to model freight rates: (1) a constant, (2) a proportional, (3) an adjusted inverse, (4) an exponential, and (5) a logarithmic. ^ Two types of problems were considered in this randomized experiment: (1) <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> function and (2) inventory-theoretic. First, the best-fit parameters for each <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> function were determined in the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> function problems. Best-fit parameters minimized the mean square difference between actual and approximated <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> for a given combination of route, class, and discount. Second, the mean of each parameter was used in its respective function to approximate <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> Third, a regression equation was developed to predict the parameter value for each function. Each predicted parameter value was used in its respective function to approximate <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> Actual less-than-truckload and truckload <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> were obtained for 2, 228 routes spanning the United States; for discounts of 20, 30, 40, and 50 %; and for class 60, 65, 70, and 77. 5. ^ In the inventory-theoretic problems, optimal order quantities and annual logistics costs were determined when using actual and approximated <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> Annual logistics cost included carrying, ordering, and transportation costs. Randomly generated variables in each inventory-theoretic problem included: route, class, discount, unit weight, annual requirements, carrying cost rate, unit value, and order cost. ^ This research found that the proportional function was the most accurate in the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> function problems, followed by the exponential, adjusted inverse, constant, and logarithmic functions, respectively. In the inventory-theoretic problems, {{the means of the}} annual logistics costs of the proportional and adjusted inverse functions never differed significantly from the mean optimal annual logistics cost determined with actual <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> In addition, a mean value of the parameter for the proportional function was determined.

40|$|The {{global economy}} is {{increasingly}} defined by access to international markets, with reduced {{barriers to trade}} between many countries. Continued reduction in the costs of moving products both within a {{country and around the}} world is crucial for modern business to remain competitive. International trade in grain is no different, and presents its own unique challenges for study in a Canadian context. Ocean <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> for grain have recently been very unstable. After a long period of low <b>freight</b> <b>rates,</b> capacity became limited in 2003 and 2004 more than tripling <b>freights</b> <b>rates.</b> Although <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> have subsequently declined, the increasing dominance of containerized ocean traffic may perpetuate the recent instability in bulk <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> The impact of ocean <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> on Canada’s competitiveness in the grain markets is poorly understood. The theory for the flow of commodities over space has been well studied in the context of trade and while there have been a number of studies concerning the spatial nature of grain handling and transportation in Canada. However, to date there has been minimal effort to analyze ocean freight transportation prices and their impact on wheat flows from Canada. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of ocean <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> on international competitiveness of Canadian wheat. To analyze the impact of ocean <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> on Canada’s competitiveness a spatial, product-differentiated, equilibrium model of international wheat market is developed in this research that allows for two way trade and explains the linkages among the various locations of production and consumption. The model incorporates changes in ocean <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> and the geographical distances with non-homogeneous wheat originated from different wheat exporters. The model is used to examine the potential impact of changes in <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> on Canada and other main players in world wheat market. The model is a tool to compare the price and quantity changes and compare the comparative advantages and disadvantages that are created by changes in wedges due to <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuation. The result implies that shorter geographical distances and lower <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> do not necessarily result in increasing export to the regions with lower per unit <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> This is why before any decision making, it is reasonable to adopt such a tool that is capable of measuring the reactions to price changes that are associated with <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> considering different demand and supply parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is “How did the oil price {{influence}} the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> for VLCC crude oil tankers between 2005 and 2015 ?” The oil price {{is important for the}} development of world economic activity, as oil is a primary energy source. Given that oil is mainly transported in tankers, the oil price has substantial influence on crude tanker <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> The period 2005 - 15 was eventful with large movements in both the oil price and <b>freight</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis in this thesis is based on a basic supply and demand model, as well as a more specific model of the shipping market developed by the shipping economist, Martin Stopford. The correlation between the oil price and <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> varies across time, and the oil market affects <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> both directly and indirectly. The freight market is influenced by predictable factors such as economic activity and fleet growth, which develop gradually over time. However, “random shocks” is the most important variable in Stopford’s model. One such shock was the global financial crisis, when oil prices and <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> dropped significantly. While oil prices recovered quickly, <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> remained low for years. Another random shock was the American shale oil revolution, which led to substantial increases in oil production. Subsequently, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sacrificed their objective to maintain stable and high oil prices and instead chose to protect their market share. Consequently, the oil prices dropped, while the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> started to increase following the growing demand for cheap oil.

The most important development of the shipping business was the unitization of goods leading to containerization of the liner shipping industry. The early liner freight market was mainly protected by pricing conferences. However the changes of containerization and industry consolidation and regulations have pushed the system towards exploring other competitive means such as abolishing the conferencing system and enhancing their services. This thesis first examined the dynamics of the liner <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> market and the operations of the liner shipping business. Liner carriers operate a regular service between ports for various types of cargos are very different from bulk shipping and are management intensive in a growing competitive market. The economic mechanism consisting of demand and supply factors which drives the liner freight market are identified for analysis. Demand factors such as world trade volumes and favourable currency exchange rates may increase the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> in a particular trade lane but unexpected political or social events are also found to cause the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> to dip. On the supply side, advances in ship technology have greatly increase the ship capacity up to 14, 000 TEU and constant pressure by the EU on the shipping industry's competitiveness. Using the demand and supply factors, a simplified shipping model is developed to help forecast the <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> for liners. The quantitative analysis yielded results that showed that the liner <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> is largely related to the import volumes.

The paper compares the surcharges to the base rates and discusses some of the implications for shippers who face increasing uncertainty in planning supply chains. Some of the issues for academic research on <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> is also examined {{and points to the}} need to clearly identify what is included in the <b>freight</b> <b>rate</b> data employed. In addition, questions are raised concerning the suitability of many of the variables traditionally used to explain or predict <b>freight</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
3000|$|Second, {{road freight}} {{transport}} operations {{take place in a}} logistical context, which is an issue because the microeconomic drivers of logistical decisions are at present only partially understood [5]. In particular, shippers’ choices about shipment sizes and transport modes are highly dependent on <b>freight</b> <b>rates,</b> and particularly on the relationship between shipment size and <b>freight</b> <b>rates,</b> which is not linear. Conversely, <b>freight</b> <b>rates</b> are influenced by the choices of shipment sizes made by shippers. For a discussion on the microeconomics and econometrics of the shipment size choice, and more generally on the introduction of logistical principles in freight transport modelling, see e.g. [6, 7] [...]...|$|R
