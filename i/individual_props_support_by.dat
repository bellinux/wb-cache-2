It is a covered approach or saungdan as in most Burmese pagodas with frescoes under the roof. Between the rows of stone-inscription stupas grow mature star flower trees (Mimusops elengi) that emanate a jasmine-like fragrance to the entire complex. Burmese families may be seen having a picnic in the cool shade under these trees, picking the flowers to make star flower chains for the Buddha or to wear in their hair, or the children playing hide and seek among the rows of stupas.

40|$|Background The {{microbial}} community in anaerobic digestion is mainly monitored {{by means of}} DNA-based methods. This may lead to incorrect interpretation of the community parameters, because microbial abundance does not necessarily reflect activity. In this research, the difference between {{microbial community}} response on DNA (total community) and RNA (active community) based on the 16 S rRNA (gene) with respect to salt concentration and response time was evaluated. Results The application of higher NaCl concentrations resulted in a decrease in methane production. A stronger and faster response to salt concentration was observed on RNA level. This was reflected in terms of microbial community composition and organization, as richness, evenness, and overall diversity were differentially impacted. A higher divergence of community structure was observed on RNA level as well, indicating that total community composition depends on deterministic processes, while the active community is determined by stochastic processes. Methanosaeta was identified as the most abundant methanogen on DNA level, but its relative abundance decreased on RNA level, related to salt perturbation. Conclusions This research demonstrated the need for RNA-based community screening to obtain reliable information on actual community parameters and to identify key species that determine process stabilityThis research was <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and COMPLETE BELGIUM through REWATER project (EU ERANET NEWINDIGO—DST.

40|$|Full-scale {{tests are}} {{conducted}} on mine roof supports using protocols {{developed by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) using the unique capabilities of the Mine Roof Simulator (MRS). These protocols simulate the loading conditions that the support will be exposed to in an underground mine to determine the performance capabilities and limitations of the support. Some tests are conducted with rigid boundary conditions, creating uniform contact and near ideal axial loading conditions. These tests are {{used to determine the}} ultimate performance potential of a support, including the strength, stiffness, and stability. For <b>prop</b> <b>supports</b> where stability is a critical design issue, tests are implemented to induce buckling by a modified end condition, eccentric contact, or biaxial loading. It is important to determine the cpacity of the support design when the support is subjected to unpredictable loading conditions. This paper examines the effect of end conditions and load profiles on <b>prop</b> <b>support</b> performance and applies a new analysis methodology based on eccentric loading to determine a factor of safety for load capacity.
