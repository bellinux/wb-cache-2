25|$|Eager to {{take back}} control of Lake Champlain {{following}} the end of the Revolutionary War, Americans flocked to settle the Champlain Valley. Many individuals emigrated from Massachusetts and other New England colonies, such as Salmon Dutton, a settler of Cavendish, Vermont. Dutton emigrated in 1782 and worked as a surveyor, town official, and toll road owner. His home had a <b>dooryard</b> garden, typical of mid-19th century New England village homes, and his experience settling in the Champlain Valley depicts the industries and lifestyles surrounding Lake Champlain following the Revolutionary War.|$|E

500|$|... "When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd" [...] {{was written}} {{ten years after}} {{publishing}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass (1855) and it reflects a maturing of Whitman's poetic vision from a drama of identity and romantic exuberance that has been tempered by his emotional experience of the American Civil War. Whitman included the poem as part of a quickly-written sequel to a collection of poems addressing the war that was being printed at the time of Lincoln's death. [...] These poems, collected under the title Drum-Taps and Sequel to Drum-Taps, range in emotional context from [...] "excitement to woe, from distant observation to engagement, from belief to resignation" [...] and [...] "more concerned with history than the self, more aware of the precariousness of America's present and future than of its expansive promise." [...] First published in autumn 1865, [...] "When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd"—along with 42 other poems from Drum-Taps and Sequel to Drum-Taps—was absorbed into Leaves of Grass beginning with the fourth edition, published in 1867.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Washington, Whitman contracted with Gibson Brothers {{to publish a}} pamphlet of eighteen poems that included two works directly addressing the assassination—"When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd" [...] and [...] "O Captain!

The 24-page collection was titled Sequel to Drum-Taps and bore the subtitle When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloom'd and other poems. The title poem filled the first nine pages. In October, after the pamphlet was printed, he returned to Brooklyn to have them integrated with Drum-Taps.|$|E

500|$|... "When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd" [...] is a first-person {{monologue}} {{written in}} free verse. It {{is a long}} poem, 206 lines in length (207 according to some sources), that is cited as a prominent example of the elegy form and of narrative poetry. In its final form, published in 1881 and republished to the present, the poem is divided into sixteen sections referred to as cantos or strophes that range in length from 5 or 6 lines {{to as many as}} 53 lines. The poem does not possess a consistent metrical pattern, and the length of each line varies from seven syllables to as many as twenty syllables.

500|$|Whitman {{added the}} poems from Drum-Taps and Sequel to Drum-Taps as a {{supplement}} to the fourth edition of Leaves of Grass printed in 1867 by William E. Chapin. Whitman revised his collection Leaves of Grass throughout his life, and each additional edition included newer works, his previously published poems often with revisions or minor emendations, and reordering of the sequence of the poems. [...] The first edition (1855) was a small pamphlet of twelve poems. At his death four decades later, the collection included over 400 poems. For the fourth edition (1867)—in which [...] "When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd" [...] had first been included—Leaves of Grass had been expanded to a collection of 236 poems. However, University of Nebraska literature professor Kenneth Price and University of Iowa English professor Ed Folsom describe the 1867 edition as [...] "the most carelessly printed and most chaotic of all the editions" [...] citing errata and conflicts with typsetters. Price and Folsom note that book had five different formats—some including the Drum-Taps poems; some without.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd" [...] that {{appeared}} in 1865 was arranged into 21 strophes. It was included with this structure in the fourth edition of Leaves of Grass that was published in 1867. By 1871, Whitman had combined the strophes numbered 19 and 20 into one, and the poem had 20 in total. However, for the seventh edition (1881) of Leaves of Grass, Whitman rearranged the poem's final seven strophes of his original text were combined into the final three strophes of the 16-strophe poem that is familiar to readers today. For the 1881 edition, the original strophes numbered 14, 15, and 16 were combined into the revised 14th strophe; strophes numbered 17 and 18 were combined into the revised 15th strophe. The material from the former strophes numbered 19, 20 and 21 in 1865 were combined for the revised 16th and final strophe in 1881. According to literary critic and Harvard University professor Helen Vendler, the poem [...] "builds up to its longest and most lyrical moment in canto 14, achieves its moral climax in canto 15, and ends with a coda of 'retrievements out of the night' in canto 16." ...|$|E

Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the <b>Dooryard</b> Bloom'd to eulogize Lincoln, one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president. Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news.

In a larger sense, the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.|$|E
