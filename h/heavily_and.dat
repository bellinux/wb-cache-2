5|$|It {{was early}} {{afternoon}} {{by the time}} Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still {{on the ground in}} some places. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E
5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, {{but it is}} likely that he became an itinerant worker.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{and smoking}} {{have shown a}} strong {{association}} in studies worldwide. Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to smoke <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content. Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.|$|E
5|$|Valencia {{finished}} second in their UEFA Cup group, although Villa was not featured <b>heavily</b> <b>and</b> was often an unused or late-match substitute.

5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> rarely exercising. His heavy {{drinking}} had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem. In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home. There, he suffered a heart attack, {{but he had to}} be persuaded to see a doctor and he refused to be admitted to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very <b>heavily</b> <b>and</b> is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed <b>heavily</b> <b>and</b> plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the number}} of <b>heavily</b> snowy <b>and</b> rainy areas were 106 and 131 respectively. Tables 2 and 3 show number of extracted tweets by using the Naive Bayes classifier, number of <b>heavily</b> snowy <b>and</b> rainy areas (A), and number of detected <b>heavily</b> snowy <b>and</b> rainy areas (B), sorted by date. The value of (B/A× 100) indicates the detection rates of the identification. The detection rates are less than 50 % for 8 out of 12 days and 8 out of 16 days respectively, {{because there are many}} country areas that had heavily where no geotagged tweets were posted.|$|R

5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling <b>heavily</b> <b>and</b> ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did {{the quality of his}} work. He chain-smoked, drank <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
5|$|Emden {{departed}} Pillau on 1 February, {{bound for}} Kiel. She arrived on 7 February 1945 {{and was taken}} into the Deutsche Werke dockyard to complete the necessary repairs. British bombers attacked the ship twice and damaged her badly. The ship was listing <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> so on 14 April, she was towed out into Heikendorfer Bay and run aground. The Germans then blew her up on 3 May to prevent the Allies from capturing the ship. The wreck was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1949. Her bow ornament is currently {{on display in the}} Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E

Veronica visits Josh in jail, who suspects Mason. Dick returns, getting a divorce from the older sister, and Logan and Heather remain friends. In Veronica's criminology class, she is arrested for aiding Josh to escape from prison.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs missed more cricket with {{injuries}} and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed {{more than a}} third of Surrey's matches. However, he scored <b>heavily</b> <b>and</b> compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded <b>heavily,</b> <b>and</b> she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
