40|$|Abstract – Solar shading devices can {{significantly}} reduce cooling loads, improve thermal comfort and reduce potential glare problems in commercial buildings. However, measured data or tools {{to facilitate a}} comparison among various shading devices have previously not been available to designers. The Solar Shading Project at Lund University was initiated in 1997 to increase the knowledge on shading devices. This paper describes results from an extensive measurement program and recent developments of the software tool ParaSol v 2. 0. The total solar energy transmittance (g-value) of various shading devices has been estimated by means of measurements in a real climate using a double hot-box arrangement. Monitored results are shown for <b>external</b> <b>products</b> (awnings, Italian awnings, venetian blinds, horizontal slatted baffle, fabric screens, solar control films), interpane (between panes) and internal products (pleated curtains, roller blinds, venetian blinds, solar control films).

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} a new operation among {{representations of the}} symmetric group that interpolates between the classical internal and <b>external</b> <b>products,</b> which are {{defined in terms of}} tensor product and induction of representations. Following Malvenuto and Reutenauer, we pass from symmetric functions to non-commutative symmetric functions and from there to the algebra of permutations in order to relate the internal and <b>external</b> <b>products</b> to the composition and convolution of linear endomorphisms of the tensor algebra. The new product we construct corresponds to the smash product of endomorphisms of the tensor algebra. For symmetric functions, the smash product is given by a construction which combines induction and restriction of representations. For non-commutative symmetric functions, the structure constants of the smash product are given by an explicit combinatorial rule which extends a well-known result of Garsia, Remmel, Reutenauer, and Solomon for the descent algebra. We describe the dual operation among quasi-symmetric functions in terms of alphabets. Résumé. Nous construisons une nouvelle opération parmi les représentations d...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{rely on a}} {{range of}} {{extracellular}} metabolites to suppress competitors, gain access to resources, and exploit plant or animal hosts. The GacS/GacA two-component regulatory system positively controls the expression of many of these beneficial <b>external</b> <b>products</b> in pseudomonad bacteria. Natural populations often contain variants with defective Gac systems that do not produce most <b>external</b> <b>products.</b> These mutants benefit from a decreased metabolic load but do not appear to displace the wild type in nature. How could natural selection maintain the wild type {{in the presence of a}} mutant with enhanced growth? One hypothesis is that Gac mutants are “cheaters” that do not contribute to the public good, favored within groups but selected against between groups, as groups containing more mutants lose access to ecologically important <b>external</b> <b>products.</b> An alternative hypothesis is that Gac mutants have a mutualistic interaction with the wild type, so that each variant benefits by the presence of the other. In the biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 30 - 84, Gac mutants do not produce phenazines, which suppress competitor growth and are critical for biofilm formation. Here, we test the predictions of these alternative hypotheses by quantifying interactions between the wild type and the phenazine- and biofilm-deficient Gac mutant within growing biofilms. We find evidence that the wild type and Gac mutants interact mutualistically in the biofilm context, whereas a phenazine-defective structural mutant does not. Our results suggest that the persistence of alternative Gac phenotypes may be due to the stabilizing role of local mutualistic interactions...|$|R
