5|$|At {{least six}} of the U.S. ships—including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, SanFrancisco, Portland, and Helena—fired at Akatsuki, which drew {{attention}} to herself with her illuminated searchlight. The Japanese destroyer was hit repeatedly and blew up and sank within a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

Purdue scored their first points {{late in the first}} quarter with a 20-yard field goal by Carson Wiggs, and then added more points in the second quarter when Ricardo Allen intercepted a Denard Robinson pass and ran it back 94 yards for a touchdown. They then came within a point of a tie a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later by kicking a 46-yard field goal, but would not come any closer.

5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C for a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3.
