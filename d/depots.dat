5|$|Following the Richmond Depot, other <b>depots</b> {{started up}} {{throughout}} the South to supply their respective regional forces. Major <b>depots</b> were in Columbus, Athens and Atlanta, Georgia for the Army of Tennessee and Houston, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana for the Trans-Mississippi forces. The {{use of the}} depot system meant that army-wide uniformity was impossible, as different <b>depots</b> had unique uniforms (Columbus Depot Jackets for instance, had breast pockets, whilst Richmond Depot Jackets did not). This resulted in a varied set of uniforms worn by different Confederate units.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major ice {{consuming}} cities to hold the imported ice before final sale and consumption, where they were often termed <b>depots.</b> In London, the early ice <b>depots</b> were often circular and called wells or shades; the New Cattle Market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of ice. Later ice <b>depots</b> at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian ice. The city of New York was unusual and did not build ice <b>depots</b> near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the ice as floating warehouses until the ice was needed.|$|E

5|$|With {{the move}} of the {{majority}} of the AIF to France, the base organisation was transferred to the United Kingdom. Most of the training units moved to the Salisbury Plain, establishing <b>depots</b> at Perham Down, Rollestone, Larkhill and Tidworth. When it arrived, the 3rd Division also moved into camps in this area. Command <b>Depots,</b> where men returning from hospitals were sent before being returned to their units, were established at Perham Down, Weymouth, Wool, Dorset and Worgret. <b>Depots</b> for men moving from the United Kingdom to France were established at Étaples. In June 1917, these were swapped with the Canadians for <b>depots</b> around Le Havre, thereby reducing travelling time from the Salisbury Plain. AIF Headquarters was established at Horseferry Road in London and Colonel R. M. McC. Anderson, a businessman, was appointed as its commandant. Anderson negotiated a new method of payment for services provided by the British Army as a per capita per diem payment.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} <b>depots</b> {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks.

In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from <b>depots</b> captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E

5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at <b>depots,</b> the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the <b>depots</b> and cut costs.|$|E
