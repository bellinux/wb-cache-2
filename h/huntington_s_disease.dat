40|$|We {{describe}} a protocol for the rapid and sensitive quantification of disease severity in mouse models of cerebella ataxia. It {{is derived from}} previously published phenotype assessments in several disease models, including spinocerebellar ataxias, <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Measures include hind limb clasping, ledge test, gait and kyphosis. Each measure is recorded {{on a scale of}} 0 - 3, with a combined total of 0 - 12 for all four measures. The results effectively discriminate between affected and non-affected individuals, while also quantifying the temporal progression of neurodegenerative disease phenotypes. Measures may be analyzed individually or combined into a composite phenotype score for greater statistical power. The ideal combination of the four described measures will depend upon the disorder in question.

40|$|Background Recent {{quantitative}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} been successful in capturing phenotype and genotype-speci fi c changes in dementia syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson ? s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, the majority of imaging studies are cross-sectional, despite the obvious superiority of longitudinal study designs in characterising disease trajectories, response to therapy, progression rates and evaluating the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative conditions. Objectives The aim of this work is to perform a systematic review of longitudinal imaging initiatives in neurodegeneration focusing on methodology, optimal statistical models, follow-up intervals, attrition rates, primary study outcomes and presymptomatic studies. Methods Longitudinal imaging studies were identi fi ed from ? PubMed ? and reviewed from 1990 to 2014. The search terms ? longitudinal ?, ? MRI ?, ? presymptomatic ? and ? imaging ? were utilised in combination with one of the following degenerative conditions; Alzheimer ? s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, frontotemporal dementia, <b>Huntington</b> ? <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> multiple sclerosis, Parkinson ? s disease, ataxia, HIV, alcohol abuse/ dependence. Results A total of 423 longitudinal imaging papers and 103 genotype-based presymptomatic studies were identi fi ed and systematically reviewed. Imaging techniques, follow-up intervals and attrition rates showed signi fi cant variation depending on the primary diagnosis. Commonly used statistical models included analysis of annualised percentage change, mixed and random effect models, and non-linear cumulative models with acceleration ? deceleration components. Discussion and conclusions Although longitudinal imaging studies have the potential to provide crucial insights into the presymptomatic phase and natural trajectory of neurodegenerative processes a standardised design is required to enable meaningful data interpretatio...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en la European C. elegans Meeting, celebrada en Berlín del 14 al 17 de mayo de 2014. Protein {{aggregation}} {{is a major}} {{hallmark of}} many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington Diseases. However, the signaling events and molecular pathways governing this aggregation process are not completely understood. Huntington Disease and other polyQ diseases are characterized by an abnormal CAG codon expansion (that encodes the amino acid glutamine) inspecific genes. When these CAG expansions increase above a threshold of 35 to 40 glutamine residues, the resulting protein shows toxic gain-of-function features, associated to protein misfolding and aggregation. Using Caenorhabditis elegans models of polyQ diseases we have identified a novel protective role of glutathione reductase (GSR- 1) against polyQ aggregation and toxicity. First, we found that gsr- 1 RNAi downregulation inworms expressing the fusion protein Q 40 ::YFP caused a strong developmental arrest while Q 35 ::YFP animals developed normally. This phenotype was phenocopied by treatment with buthionine sulphoximine (an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis) and diethyl maleate (a glutathione depletory), confirming that 40 glutamine residues set the pathological threshold of polyQ proteins alsoinworms. Consistently, Q 40 ::YFP animals carrying a gsr- 1 loss of function mutation showed a remarkable increase of polyQ aggregation in muscle cells. Interestingly, embryos from Q 40 ::YFP worms lacking gsr- 1 display a striking phenotype consisting incell membrane blebbing and explosion, a phenotype that is much milder inQ 35 ::YFP; gsr- 1 embryos. Finally, our results demonstrate that, inC. elegans, the gsr- 1 gene encodes two isoforms that localize to cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively. Importantly, the cytoplasmic variant is shown to be essential for C. elegans viability while animals devoid of the mitochondrial isoform have no phenotype. Our future plans will focus on validating the results obtained with C. elegans in mammalian cell culture and mice models of <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> and other polyQ Diseases. In addition, we will explore the role of glutaredoxins and other glutathione-dependent enzymes in worm models of polyQ and other aggregation-dependent neurodegenerative diseases. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|<b>Huntington</b> 3 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (HD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{characterized by a}} complex neuropsychiatric phenotype. In a recent meta-analysis we identified core regions of consistent neurodegeneration in premanifest HD in the striatum and middle occipital gyrus (MOG). For early manifest HD convergent evidence of atrophy was most prominent in the striatum, motor cortex (M 1) and inferior frontal junction (IFJ). The aim {{of the present study}} was to functionally characterize this topography of brain atrophy and to investigate differential connectivity patterns formed by consistent cortico-striatal atrophy regions in HD. Using areas of striatal and cortical atrophy at different disease stages as seeds, we performed task-free resting-state and task-based meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM). MACM utilizes the large data source of the BrainMap database and identifies significant areas of above-chance co-activation with the seed-region via the activationlikelihood- estimation approach. In order to delineate functional networks formed by cortical as well as striatal atrophy regions we computed the conjunction between the co-activation profiles of striatal and cortical seeds in the premanifest andmanifest stages of HD, respectively. Functional characterization of the seedswas obtained using the behavioral meta-data of BrainMap. Cortico-striatal atrophy seeds of the premanifest stage of HD showed common co-activation with a rather cognitive network including the striatum, anterior insula, lateral prefrontal, premotor, supplementary motor and parietal regions. A similar but more pronounced co-activation pattern, additionally including the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamic nuclei was found with striatal and IFJ seeds at the manifest HD stage. The striatum and M 1 were functionally connected mainly to premotor and sensorimotor areas, posterior insula, putamen and thalamus. Behavioral characterization of the seeds confirmed that experiments activating theMOG or IFJ in conjunctionwith the striatumwere associated with cognitive functions, while the network formed by M 1 and the striatum was driven by motor-related tasks. Thus, based on morphological changes in HD, we identified functionally distinct cortico-striatal networks resembling a cognitive and motor loop, which may be prone to early disruptions in different stages of the disease and underlie HD-related cognitive and motor symptom profiles. Our findings provide an important link between morphometrically defined seed-regions and corresponding functional circuits highlighting the functional and ensuing clinical relevance of structural damage in HD...|$|R
40|$|<b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (HD) is {{a devastating}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{caused by a}} genetic mutation that produces an expansion of C-A-G repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. This expansion results in a selective neuronal degeneration in striatal and cortical brain regions. Although HD {{is best known for}} chorea, the disease is actually a triad of progressive cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms and patients usually die within 15 to 20 years of onset. Cognitive impairments seem to occur decades prior to the onset of motor symptoms. This potentially offers a long time window for treatments to delay or halt disease progression. Development of such treatments requires the generation of transgenic animal models for HD. Such models are now available and have already greatly enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of HD. But unsolved questions such as: 2 ̆ 2 Do cognitive manifestations precede motor deficits in transgenic mouse and rat models for HD? 2 ̆ 2 µremain. We address this question in 3 studies that examine the development of motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in BACHD mice and rats, two recently generated models for HD. Unlike other genetic models, BACHD mice and rats express the full length of the human mutant HTT (97 polyglutamine repeats) and present neuropathology similarities to that of patients. We found progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric deficits in transgenics BACHD mice and rats compared to their wild type littermate controls, on different tasks such as catwalk, rotarod, open field, zero-maze, cross-maze, prepulse inhibition and fear conditioning. The findings indicate that progressive cognitive deficits can be reliably detected with methodologically rigorous protocols. However some phenotypic variability (body weight and emotional-like behavior, for example) was found and might involve species differences and ectopic expression of the human mutant HTT gene. Finally, the time course for the emergence of the various symptoms indicates that motor abnormalities might be the first to occur in transgenic BACHD mice and rats. In conclusion: we have identified robust cognitive and motor phenotypes for BACHD mice and rats {{that can be used to}} test novel compounds from HD drug discovery programs. Certain tests like fear conditioning, lend themselves for translational approaches and characterization of HD patients in such tests would be a logical next step. Confirmation of a fear conditioning phenotype in HD patients would offer an additional functional read-out for drug testing and decrease program risk by bridging the gap between rodent and human testing...|$|E
40|$|Objective: There is {{emerging}} evidence that exercise may modify disease progression and improve {{function in a}} number of neurodegenerative diseases, but this has not been systematically studied in <b>Huntington.</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (HD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and benefits of an exercise programme in people with HD. Methods: Using a randomised controlled trial design, 25 participants with manifest HD were allocated to either intervention (home-based exercise; n= 13) or control (usual care;n= 12) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline and eight weeks later. Eleven participants from the exercise and 10 from the control group completed the intervention study. The primary outcome was gait variability (stride time coefficient of variation (CV)). Secondary outcomes included other measures of gait, disease-specific motor scale and measures of balance, muscle strength, mobility and community walking, functional performance in ADL and quality of life. These measures were included to reflect a range of physical impairments and activity limitations seen in people with HD. Analysis of covariance was used to compare follow-up scores across groups after adjustment for differences at baseline. Effect sizes were calculated for outcome measures based on differences in change scores between groups. Process interviews were conducted at the end of the study to determine acceptability of the intervention to participants. Cross sectional investigation of outcome measures was undertaken initially to investigate discriminant and concurrent validity as well as test re-test reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC 95) along the broad spectrum of the disease. Baseline data from 25 participants with manifest HD (who went on to participate in the intervention), in addition to data from 17 individuals with pre-manifest HD and 25 healthy controls were analysed. This data was of use in interpreting the results from the interventional study. In particular, the MDC 95 data helped in determining of whether any statistical significant changes due to the intervention are clinically meaningful. Results: Measures of gait variability, some measures of balance, community walking and measures of functional performance in ADL were able to distinguish between people with manifest HD and pre-manifest HD as well as between people with pre-manifest HD and healthy controls suggesting good discriminant validity. All these outcomes had also good concurrent validity with a disease specific motor score. The test re-tests reliability scores for the majority of the outcomes were high and the MDC 95 scores were low, suggesting that the individual variability on these outcomes were low.

40|$|Pas de résumé françaisIn this thesis, we {{investigated}} troubles of sentence processing in <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (HD) at earlystage, which represents {{a model of}} damage mainly confined to the striatum. The role of striatalstructures in sentence processing is agreed upon, but its nature is still controversial. Most studieshave reported a role of the striatum for complex sentences or more controlled processes withinsentence processing, but the interpretation of this pattern differs according to two main views. Some authors have proposed that striatal structures have a linguistic function restricted to somesub-processes of sentence processing, while others claim that the deficits detected depend on themodulation that executive function exerts on language and sentence processing. Here, we aimed atfilling the gap between these approaches by using a psycholinguistic perspective to investigate onthe one hand the role of executive functions, in particular, working memory, in sentenceprocessing, {{and on the other}} hand the nature of the linguistic discrepancies reported in associationto striatal lesions. We thus built experimental paradigms that allow dissociating fine-grainedlinguistic variations in healthy subjects, and transferred them to HD patients. The profile ofimpairment detected in our experiments showed that working memory and other sources ofcomplexity can interfere with sentence processing by decreasing accuracy, but an impairment ofspecific syntactic processes occurs when working memory is controlled for. The pattern of the finegrainedsyntactic impairment detected is consistent with a dissociation between more frequent/lesscontrolled (default) and less frequent/more controlled (non-default) procedures in sentenceprocessing. Additionally, we detected that this deficit occurs despite the fact that HD patients arestill able to process syntactic information, suggesting that striatal structures spare syntacticrepresentations while they are involved in correctly applying syntactic procedures in non-defaultcontexts. We propose that this pattern is explained by a role of striatal structures in selectingbetween competing alternatives during sentence processing, which results in an inability to adapt tothe sentence context for non-default procedures. This parallels the role of striatal structures for selecting between competing alternatives in order to adapt to the changing environment, as reportedin motor control and in other domains of cognition. Although the domain specificity of striatalinvolvement in language cannot be demonstrated, it is highly compatible with the results obtainedin this thesis. Hence, linguistic functions might be modulated by distinct cortico-striatal circuits: onthe one hand by selecting linguistic representations as a function of the context, and on the otherhand, by modulating performance in language through executive functions. The frameworkemerging from this work thus helps conciliating apparently incongruent findings reported in theliterature. Yet, future research should better characterize anatomo-functional correlates of thisproposalPARIS-EST-Université (770839901) / SudocPARIS 12 -Bib. électronique (940280011) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

The striatum has a well-established role supporting learning from the outcomes of decisions, but it remains unclear whether this structure is also necessary for computing expected value (i. e., advantageousness of potential decisions) when all information is explicitly given. We addressed this question presenting simple monetary gambles, where all decisional parameters were given and outcome feedback was absent, to patients with early <b>Huntington</b> 19 <b>s</b> and Parkinson 19 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> taken as complementary models of striatal dysfunction.

40|$|The {{striatum}} is {{the major}} nucleus of the basal ganglia. It plays {{an essential role in}} motion and a variety of cognitive functions. It is well established that striatal neurons are affected in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson. s and <b>Huntington.</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> The striatum receives input from the cerebral cortex, the thalamus as well as the substantia nigra pars compacta. In the present study we evaluated the pattern of apoptotic cell death in the striatum of the rat during development and in two models of lesion-induced cell death. These models involved a) unilateral ablations of the cerebral cortex and b) lesions of the catecholaminergic afferent systems by intraperitoneal administration of the neurotoxin 6 -OHDA. We used the TUNEL method for the in situ labelling of DNA fragmentation in dying cells. Examination with the electron microscope revealed morphological features of TUNEL+ cells typical of apoptosis. Moreover, we showed that developmental or lesion-induced cell death was mediated through the activation of caspase- 3 and the expression of fractin, which are considered as reliable apoptotic markers. The {{results of the present study}} showed that apoptosis in the striatum occurs early in postnatal life. Apoptotic cells were mainly detected during the first postnatal week and their frequency peaked at P 5. Thereafter, their frequency decreased significantly and reached minimal levels by the end of the fourth postnatal week. The effects of the different lesions on the survival and phenotype of the striatal neurons were evaluated and compared. The cerebral cortex and the substantia nigra pars compacta are major sources of anterogradely transported neurotrophic factors for striatal neurons. The results of the present study showed that following cortical lesions at P 0 the frequency of apoptotic cells in the striatum increased significantly and peaked at P 7. In contrast, cortical lesions performed at P 7 or at P 14 did not have any effects on the survival of striatal neurons. 6 -OHDA lesions caused a significant increase in the frequency of apoptotic cells that was of the same magnitude and peaked during the same developmental stage as the increase induced by cortical lesions at P 0. The effects of these lesions on the survival and phenotype of the GABAergic and the cholinergic neurons of the striatum were investigated with the use of immunohistochemistry. It was shown that cortical lesions at P 0 and 6 -OHDA lesions resulted not only in a decrease in the frequency but also in alterations in the phenotype of these two neuronal populations. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio), {{a tropical}} {{fresh water fish}} originally found in the rivers of India and Bangladesh has become a popular vertebrate model system over the last decade. The rapid sequencing of the zebrafish genome together with the latest advances in forward and reverse genetics has made this model organism more fascinating {{as it can be}} used to decipher the genetic mechanisms involved in the vertebrate development. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress. Alteration in the production of CRH can lead to Cushing s syndrome, anxiety-related disorders and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers s disease, Parkinson s dementia and <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In mammals it was reported that a POU class III gene by name Brn- 2 is essential for the development of specific neuroendocrine cell types. Brn- 2 can also regulate the transcription of corticotropinreleasing hormone by binding to its promoter. Corroborating the above fact, knockout studies in mice have shown that deletion of Brn- 2 affects the development of corticotropinreleasing hormone producing neurons in addition to oxytocin and vasopressin synthesizing neurons. In order to understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of zebrafish neuroendocrine hypothalamus, we attempted to characterize the developmental expression profile of brn 1. 2 and crh in zebrafish. Zebrafish crh gene has not been characterized before and only a partial sequence of brn 1. 2 was reported earlier. We screened the zebrafish EST database for brn 1. 2 and crh through a blast search and identified EST s for crh and brn 1. 2 that contained their full ORF. We used non-quantitative RT-PCR to analyze embryonic and post-embryonic expression pattern of crh. Expression of crh mRNA was detected from 1 dpf and it remained stable through 5 dpf. RT-PCR analysis of the tissues revealed strong expression of crh mRNA in the brain, eye, gills and weak expression in the testis. Spatial expression pattern of both the genes were analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization. Expression of crh was detected in different parts of the embryonic brain including telencephalon, hypothalamus, posterior tuberculum, thalamus, preoptic area, epiphysis, midbrain tegmentum, hindbrain and in the retina. Localization of CRH transcripts in the preoptic area is consistent with its role as a hypophysiotropin in zebrafish. Zebrafish POU class III genes include brn 1. 2, zp 47, zp 12, zp 23 and zp 50. zp 47 and brn 1. 2 are found to be the direct homologs of the mammalian Brn- 2 gene. Expression of brn 1. 2 begins at tailbud stage. From 5 -somite stage on, brn 1. 2 is detected in the midbrain, hindbrain and weakly in the spinal cord. At 24 hpf brn 1. 2 is widely expressed in the diencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain but not detected in the telencephalon. At later stages of development brn 1. 2 transcripts were found in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, ventral thalamus, dorsal thalamus, pretectum, tectum, cerebellum and hindbrain. Additionally, brn 1. 2 was also detected in the otic vesicle at 48 hpf. In this study we have described the developmental expression pattern of brn 1. 2 and crh. Future studies will include a complete analysis of the function of brn 1. 2 in the specification of the hypothalamic neurons and also identification of other candidate genes that are required for the development these neurons...|$|E

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state. Taken together our findings emphasize the central role of dopamine in integrated striatal function and the pathological consequences of striatal dopamine denervation in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

Methods We retrospectively identified five cases of Whipple 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosed between 2003 and 2009 in patients treated with TNFα antagonists in five French hospitals. Results Five patients (four male; mean age: 50. 4  years; range: 38 – 67) underwent biological therapy according to prior diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis (n =  2), ankylosing spondylitis (n =  2), or spondyloarthropathy (n =  1).

40|$|The {{ability of}} Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> {{patients}} to co-ordinate their two hands {{with and without}} external cueing was investigated. Twelve Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and sex- and age-matched controls performed a bimanual cranking task at two speeds (0. 5 Hz, 1. 5 Hz) and phase relationships (in-phase, anti-phase), with and without an external metronome cue. Data were sampled at 200 Hz, and raw displacement data for each hand, {{mean and standard deviation}} measures of the relative positions of the two hands and their velocities were then calculated. All participants could perform the in-phase movement, at both speeds; however, the Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients were more variable and less accurate than the control participants, particularly at the fast speed. While controls could perform the anti-phase movement, in which rotation of the cranks differed by 180 degrees at both speeds, Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients were unable to do so at either speed, reverting to the in-phase movement at the slow speed. An external metronome cue did not improve the performance of the Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients, which differentiated this group from patients suffering from Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> The <b>Huntington</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients 2 ̆ 7 inability to perform the anti-phase movement may be due to damage to the basal ganglia and its output regions...|$|R
