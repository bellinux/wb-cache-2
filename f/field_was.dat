5|$|Many of New Zealand’s geysers {{have been}} {{destroyed}} by humans in the last century. Several New Zealand geysers have also become dormant or extinct by natural means. The main remaining field is Whakarewarewa at Rotorua. Two thirds of the geysers at Orakei Korako were flooded by the Ohakuri hydroelectric dam in 1961. The Wairakei <b>field</b> <b>was</b> lost to a geothermal power plant in 1958. The Taupo Spa <b>field</b> <b>was</b> lost when the Waikato River level was deliberately altered in the 1950s. The Rotomahana <b>field</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886.|$|E

5|$|The early teams ran at Kincaid Field, {{constructed}} in 1902 as an athletic field. In 1919, Hayward <b>Field</b> <b>was</b> constructed for football events {{and two years}} later, a track was installed around the field as the track and field team moved in. Kincaid <b>field</b> <b>was</b> torn down in 1922.|$|E
50|$|Volatile <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> linearizable. Reading a {{volatile}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> like acquiring a lock: the working memory is invalidated and the volatile <b>field's</b> current value <b>is</b> reread from memory. Writing {{a volatile}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> like releasing a lock: the volatile <b>field</b> <b>is</b> immediately written back to memory.|$|R

5|$|About 130 {{volcanic}} vents {{belong to}} {{the field and the}} earliest eruptions occurred 1.5 million years ago. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous explosive and effusive components, and volcanic rocks in the field vary from basalt over andesite and dacite to rhyolite. The <b>field</b> <b>was</b> a source of obsidian with regional importance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no serious}} {{injuries}} arose from any short-pitched deliveries while a leg theory <b>field</b> <b>was</b> actually set, the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling {{between the two}} teams, particularly when Australian batsmen suffered actual injuries in separate incidents, which inflamed the watching crowds. The controversy eventually spilled into the diplomatic arena.|$|E
50|$|Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>is</b> a {{neighborhood}} of St. Matthews, Kentucky. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> a Sixth Class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> incorporated on May 24, 1957. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> dissolved on July 1, 2000 and annexed by St. Matthews on January 8, 2001.

40|$|When an {{electric}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> applied on a topological insulator, {{not only the}} electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, but also the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, vice versa. I designed topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer magnetic cloak, derived the electric field and magnetic field {{inside and outside the}} topological insulator and superconductor sphere. Simulation and calculation results show that the applied magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> screened by the topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer, and the electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated in the cloaked region...|$|R
50|$|The NFL-caliber Cliff Moore Practice Facility {{is located}} between Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium and Clark-LeClair Stadium on Charles Boulevard. The {{facility}} is {{a hallmark of}} the ECU athletic complex and consists of three fields, two natural and one FieldTurf. The natural <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> based on Dowdy-Ficklen <b>field.</b> The <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> Bermuda Tift grass with gravel and sand-based drainage. The <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> parallel to one another and run north to south. The FieldTurf <b>field</b> <b>is</b> perpendicular to the natural grass <b>fields.</b> The <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 78120 sq ft.|$|R
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic <b>field</b> <b>was</b> weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E

5|$|Germanium is a semiconductor. Zone {{refining}} {{techniques have}} led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 1010, {{making it one of the}} purest materials ever obtained. The first metallic material discovered (in 2005) to become a superconductor in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic <b>field</b> <b>was</b> an alloy of germanium, uranium, and rhodium.|$|E
50|$|The Halibut <b>Field,</b> <b>is</b> an oil <b>field,</b> {{within the}} Gippsland Basin. The oil <b>field</b> <b>is</b> located {{approximately}} 64 km offshore of southeastern Australia. The total area of this <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 26.9 km2 and {{is composed of}} 10 mappable units.|$|R

50|$|Classical {{fields as}} above, {{such as the}} {{electromagnetic}} <b>field,</b> <b>are</b> usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. In contrast, generalized functions are not continuous. When dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> used, because thermally fluctuating classical <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> nowhere differentiable. Random <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> indexed sets of random variables; a continuous random <b>field</b> <b>is</b> a random <b>field</b> that has a set of functions as its index set. In particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a Schwartz space of functions as its index set, {{in which case the}} continuous random <b>field</b> <b>is</b> a tempered distribution.|$|R
5|$|Heading Auburn's offense on the <b>field</b> <b>was</b> quarterback Jason Campbell. Campbell {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with 2,511yards and 19touchdowns, one short of tying the Auburn record for most touchdowns in a single season. Campbell was second in the Southeastern Conference in passing yards per game (209.2), and was a first-team All-SEC selection.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, hoteliers and Dolphins Stadium had {{to quickly}} {{prepare for the}} arrival of Oklahoma and Florida, the two teams that played in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game one week after the Orange Bowl. Signs were changed, the playing <b>field</b> <b>was</b> repainted, and {{accommodations}} were prepared for the thousands of expected spectators. In total, South Florida's economy received an estimated $220million boost from visitors who arrived to watch the two games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football <b>field</b> <b>was</b> completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey <b>field</b> <b>was</b> to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball <b>field</b> <b>was</b> finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Second World War, Southcote hosted a number of community events on Denton's Field. Many of these fêtes included grasstrack motorcycle racing events, which were held in 1947, 1948 and 1949. Speedway stars Bill Kitchen and George Wilks raced at Southcote in 1949 for a Conservative Party fête. The <b>field</b> <b>was</b> also used in 1949 for a gymkhana and a church fundraising fête.|$|E
5|$|Initially the Augusta National Invitational <b>field</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} of Bobby Jones' close associates.

5|$|Portions of Fairleigh Dickinson University's Metropolitan Campus {{are located}} in Teaneck, {{with most of the}} school's {{athletic}} facilities located across the river in Hackensack. The school's University Stadium, home for its men's and women's soccer teams, lies on the Hackensack River, just north of Route 4. The 1,100-seat stadium has hosted NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament games in recent years. The natural grass <b>field</b> <b>was</b> resurfaced with FieldTurf in 2004.|$|E
25|$|From {{a general}} point of view, the various fields in (3-dimensional) vector {{calculus}} are uniformly {{seen as being}} k-vector fields: scalar <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 0-vector <b>fields,</b> vector <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 1-vector <b>fields,</b> pseudovector <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 2-vector <b>fields,</b> and pseudoscalar <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> 3-vector <b>fields.</b> In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields (scalar/vector/pseudovector/pseudoscalar corresponding to 0/1/n1/n dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a pseudo-finite <b>field</b> F <b>is</b> an {{infinite}} {{model of the}} first-order theory of finite <b>fields.</b> This <b>is</b> equivalent to the condition that F is quasi-finite (perfect with a unique extension of every positive degree) and pseudo algebraically closed (every absolutely irreducible variety over F has a point defined over F). Every hyperfinite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> pseudo-finite and every pseudo-finite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> quasifinite. Every non-principal ultraproduct of finite <b>fields</b> <b>is</b> pseudo-finite.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rational}} number <b>field</b> Q <b>is</b> Hilbertian, because Hilbert's irreducibility theorem has as a corollary that the projective line over Q is Hilbertian: indeed, any algebraic number <b>field</b> <b>is</b> Hilbertian, {{again by the}} Hilbert irreducibility theorem.
