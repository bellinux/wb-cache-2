5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and {{improves}} weld quality {{by using a}} nozzle to focus the electric arc, but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily a manual, hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist. Among the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, <b>dabber,</b> and increased penetration GTAW methods.|$|E

500|$|The <b>dabber</b> {{variation}} {{is used to}} precisely place weld metal on thin edges. [...] The automatic process replicates the motions of manual welding by feeding a cold or hot filler wire into the weld area and dabbing (or oscillating) it into the welding arc. [...] It {{can be used in}} conjunction with pulsed current, and is used to weld a variety of alloys, including titanium, nickel, and tool steels. [...] Common applications include rebuilding seals in jet engines and building up saw blades, milling cutters, drill bits, and mower blades.|$|E
50|$|Success, though, {{came in the}} Cheshire Senior Cup in 1933 {{when the}} <b>Dabbers</b> lifted the trophy after beating ICI (Alkali) at the Drill Field, Northwich in front of 8,000 fans. After the Second World War, the <b>Dabbers</b> joined the newly founded Mid Cheshire League and in 1952, the club entered the inaugural FA Youth Cup competition. Drawn against Manchester United in the second round, the young <b>Dabbers</b> crashed 23-0 on a November evening at the Cliff {{training}} ground to a United youth line up including names such as Duncan Edwards, David Pegg, Albert Scanlon and Ron Cope (who joined Nantwich in the twilight of his career).|$|R
50|$|The season saw disappointing {{results for}} the <b>Dabbers,</b> with the team languishing towards {{the bottom of the}} table with plenty of goals conceded. The defence has been a {{weakness}} with heavy defeats to United of Manchester (1-6 at home, 0-4 away) and Boston United (0-4 at home, 0-5 away) being particular low points. The cups saw a 1-0 defeat to lower division Warrington Town in the FA Cup, a 3-0 home defeat to Stalybridge Celtic in the FA Trophy, and the <b>Dabbers</b> were defeated 4-3 by Cammell Laird in the Cheshire Senior Cup. The poor form resulted in Head Coach Peter Hall losing his job in late March. After Hall's departure, Kevin Street and Darren Tinson took over on a caretaker basis; there was an immediate improvement in results, with their 6 games in charge having 5 wins and 1 draw. The <b>Dabbers</b> finished in 10th position.|$|R

2500|$|Further {{evidence}} for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see {{the style of}} No Natural Religion as more confident than that of All Religions. They especially cite the use of upright roman lettering in All Religions contrasted with the italic, cursive writing on several plates of No Natural Religion; [...] "this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking <b>dabber,</b> italic permitted a shallower etch." [...] Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of No Natural Religion, a script which he would use throughout the 1790s. Other {{evidence for}} an earlier dating of All Religions {{is that many of}} the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in No Natural Religion. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in All Religions but not No Natural Religion suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.|$|E
60|$|Having {{dispatched}} the ceremony, {{with its}} attendant festivities, to the perfect satisfaction {{of her own}} mind, the sanguine mother pictured to her imagination a long train of honours and distinctions which could not fail to accompany Kate in her new and brilliant sphere. She would be presented at court, of course. On the anniversary of her birthday, which was upon the nineteenth of July ('at ten minutes past {{three o'clock in the}} morning,' thought Mrs Nickleby in a parenthesis, 'for I recollect asking what o'clock it was'), Sir Mulberry would give a great feast to all his tenants, and would return them three and a half per cent on the amount of their last half-year's rent, as would be fully described and recorded in the fashionable intelligence, to the immeasurable delight and admiration of all the readers thereof. Kate's picture, too, would be in at least half-a-dozen of the annuals, and on the opposite page would appear, in delicate type, 'Lines on contemplating the Portrait of Lady Mulberry Hawk. By Sir Dingleby Dabber.' Perhaps some one annual, of more comprehensive design than its fellows, might even contain a portrait of the mother of Lady Mulberry Hawk, with lines by the father of Sir Dingleby <b>Dabber.</b> More unlikely things had come to pass. Less interesting portraits had appeared. As this thought occurred to the good lady, her countenance unconsciously assumed that compound expression of simpering and sleepiness which, being common to all such portraits, is perhaps one reason why they are always so charming and agreeable.|$|E

During the excavation, the Black and Red Wares were discovered here below the PGW layer. Significant archaeological findings from this site during this excavation include a hoard of silver punch-marked coins in a NBPW vase with a lustrous polish, a baked terracotta <b>dabber</b> bearing Brahmi inscription of c. 3rd-2nd century BCE and structures made of mud and baked bricks of Mauryan and pre-Mauryan period. The symbols of sun, crescent, tree within a vedika and hill are found in these coins. The inscription on the terracotta <b>dabber</b> in Brahmi is in two lines. The first line has been deciphered as bha di ke (Bhadrike) and a single letter, ma in dots is inscribed below it. Radiocarbon dates found by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany for the charcoal samples collected from this deposit during this excavation, cultural material and stratigraphy suggest that this part of the mound was settled from c. 1300 - 1200 BCE.|$|E

30|$|In this study, the {{determinants}} of adoption of IMVs in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region of Ghana were investigated. The results show that farm labour, maize experience, availability of variety, information availability, low yield, early maturity, fertilizer requirement and cost of variety were the major discriminating variables in classifying farmers in the study areas. The study revealed that maize experience, low yield, information availability and cost of variety were the most influential discriminating variables between adopters and non-adopters of IMVs. It is therefore recommended that soil scientists and crop breeders should consider an improvement in the specific varietal characteristics identified as influencing adoption of IMVs. Priority can be given to development of maize varieties whose fertilizer requirement is low and which are early maturing and high yield. Also agricultural extension division of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) should consider organizing on-farm trials with the farmers in order to accelerate their adoption of the IMVs. The ministry of Agriculture through the public information department should intensify public educations through radio, community <b>dabbers</b> and any available platform to increase farmerâ€™s knowledge on new agricultural technologies.|$|R
