5|$|Carney {{arrived as}} U.S. Ambassador to Haiti on January 14, 1998. At {{the time of}} his appointment, Haiti was in {{political}} turmoil: former president, Jean-Bertrande Aristide, was locked in a battle to retake power in the election of 2000. Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of <b>economic</b> <b>sustainability</b> programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of call by the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.|$|E
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the <b>economic</b> <b>sustainability</b> of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E

25|$|The {{cities and}} {{nations that have}} {{invested}} most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita fossil fuel use. The social and <b>economic</b> <b>sustainability</b> of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to The Economist, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like Zoom in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries {{in an effort to}} reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand {{the number of people who}} have access to cars.|$|E
