40|$|ABSTRACT We {{addressed}} {{a major challenge}} in the in vitro clonal propagation of Corymbia <b>citriodora,</b> <b>Eucalyptus</b> urophylla and E. benthamii by using an ex vitro adventitious rooting strategy in a mini-incubator. Mini-incubators were placed in four environments for rooting. A shade house with no fogging system and a greenhouse with no ventilation but with a fogging environment had the best performance in terms of rooting, root growth and survival of microcuttings. Daily recording of the temperature within each mini-incubator in each environment allowed the verification of negative correlations between the maximum average temperature and the survival, adventitious rooting and root growth. The ideal maximum air temperature for the efficient production of clonal plants was 28. 4 °C (± 5. 5 °C), and the minimum was 20. 3 °C (± 6. 2 °C). E. benthamii was more sensitive to higher temperatures than C. citriodora and E. urophylla. Nevertheless, placing mini-incubators in the shade house with no fogging system resulted in a stable and uniform performance among the three species, with 100. 0 % survival and 81. 4 % rooting.

Were also calculated the germination speed index. Water stress causes a greater reduction in the rate of germination and accumulated germination of E. camaldulensis and E. citriodora seeds than salt stress, and the seeds of E. robusta are more adapted to germinate under salt stress moderate, between - 0. 2 and - 0. 4 MPa.
