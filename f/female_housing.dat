50|$|Although {{enrollment}} {{was slow}} during the 1870s, the fledgling college built momentum {{under the leadership}} of President Henry Hill Goodell. In the 1880s, Goodell implemented an expansion plan, adding the College Drill Hall in 1883 (the first gymnasium), the Old Chapel Library in 1885 (one of the oldest extant buildings on campus and an important symbol of the University), and the East and West Experiment Stations in 1886 and 1890. The Campus Pond, now the central focus of the University Campus, was created in 1893 by damming a small brook. The early 20th century saw great expansion in terms of enrollment and the scope of the curriculum. The first female student was admitted in 1875 on a part-time basis and the first full-time female student was admitted in 1892. In 1903, Draper Hall was constructed for the dual purpose of a dining hall and <b>female</b> <b>housing.</b> The first female students graduated with the class of 1905.

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{definitions of}} Islamic feminism while analyzing the living arrangements of Muslim women {{on campus and}} how that relates to their Islamic and female identity. The author seeks {{to answer the following}} questions: What is the definition of Islamic feminism? What are people’s perceptions of Islamic feminism? What role, if any, does Islamic feminism play on the UIUC Campus? How do Muslim women define Islamic feminism? Why do Muslim women choose to live in all <b>female</b> <b>housing?</b> What are the motivations and assumptions behind all <b>female</b> <b>housing</b> on campus? This research is based on independent research of the historical context of Islamic feminism and interviews of Muslim women on campus. From these findings, this study concludes that assumptions about women who live in all <b>female</b> <b>housing</b> is often misconstrued as Muslim women were often randomly placed there and their decision was mainly based {{on the quality of the}} living environment as opposed to their religion. unpublishe...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} investigate pregnancy termination, urinary chemosignals, and litter sex ratio variation in <b>female</b> <b>house</b> mice. Experiments tested the effects of urine from adult and prepubertal <b>females,</b> <b>housed</b> individually or in groups, on successful insemination and litter production by females treated at different times and for different periods during the 3 weeks before mating and during gestation. Treatment of females with urine from adult <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> eight per cage or with urine pooled from eight adult <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> individually for 2 or 3 weeks before mating resulted in fewer successful pregnancies and significantly more female-biased litters. Treatment with urine from adult or prepubertal <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> eight per cage or with urine pooled from eight mice housed individually for the first 6 days of gestation or throughout pregnancy resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the rate of pregnancy termination. These treatments resulted in lower body weights at birth and slower growth rates in all males and in some females. Puberty was delayed in female progeny from urine-treated dams in five of seven experiments, and these young females attained first oestrus at greater mean body weights than mice in other treatments. These findings indicate that, in mice, at high population density, communication via a urinary chemosignal can alter reproduction in recipient females. Availability of, and competition for, resources such as food would be greater at higher densities, possibly lowering the probability of reproductive success. Pregnancy termination and delays in reproduction and attainment of sexual maturity might lead to greater successful reproduction at a later time...|$|R

40|$|Land {{defines the}} social, {{economic}} and political relations in the society and is the most crucial factor of production. Access to land promotes the economic power of individuals and their contribution to {{the economy of the}} nation at large. It is both a resource and a focal point of social identity and solidarity. This paper is aimed at revealing the sources of gaining access to residential land in Akure by both male and female home owners with a view to engendering appropriate policy response towards <b>female</b> <b>housing</b> ownership. The sample size was determined from the 2006 population census figure of the Akure South Local Government Area. A total of three hundred and eighty one (381) questionnaires were administered to home-owners using systematic and stratified random sampling techniques and were found useful for analysis. The means of gaining access to residential land in the selected towns in the study area include purchase, inheritance, government allocation and gift. Discriminant Function Analysis was used to determine which socio-economic variables were the best predictors of how access to land can be gained. Occupation, income and education emerged as the best predictors out of all the socio-economic variables used. The paper recommends the provision of enabling environment to boost informal employment which is predominant in the study area as this will increase the income level of the citizens. There is also the need for public enlightenment on how to access land through government allocation which was very low in the study area...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of women in jail come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, have limited education, and have experienced inadequate and inconsistent health care prior to incarceration. Lack of awareness of breast health information and services due to issues with health care delivery programs and funding within correctional facilities may tend to put women serving time at higher cancer mortality and morbidity rates. Therefore, programs tailored to this underserved population have a critical public health significance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh Taking Charge: Steps to Breast Health promotion program at the Allegheny County Jail (ACJ) in Pittsburgh, PA. Pre- and posttest data were collected during three sessions at the ACJ and included 204 participants between 19 - 64 years of age. Data were collected via a pen-and-paper assessment tool distributed prior to and after programming at one session in four <b>female</b> <b>housing</b> pods at the ACJ on July 31 st, October 30 th, and January 29 th. The pre- and posttest established participants’ knowledge of breast health information, likelihood of receiving the recommended screening within the next year, confidence in detecting and recognizing changes in their breast via self-breast exams, and confidence in ability to reducing risk of breast cancer through lifestyle choices. Assessments for women under 40 included questions relating to clinical breast exams, while the assessments for women over 40 included questions relating to mammography. Participants under 40 (28. 2 %, n= 35) indicated that they have never received a clinical breast exam. Similarly, 30. 0 % (n= 24) of women over 40 reported that they have never received a mammogram. All findings were statistically significant and supported the hypothesis that after programming, participants would report better knowledge, self-efficacy and confidence in their abilities to know when to receive the age-appropriate breast health screening, to detect any changes in their breasts via self-breast examination, and to alter their lifestyle choices to reduce their risk of breast cancer, also improved likelihood of receiving a clinical breast exam or mammogram. Furthermore, this evaluation shows the feasibility and effectiveness of tailoring an existing community program for breast health promotion to a population of jailed women...|$|E
40|$|In all vertebrates, {{at least}} two forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are present: GnRH-I and GnRH-II. GnRH-I {{directly}} influences the reproductive axis whereas the function of GnRH-II is less clear. The present experimental objectives were to determine the effect(s) of male social cues on the peripheral and neural responses of <b>female</b> <b>house</b> sparrows (Passer domesticus). We hypothesized that male breeding status would significantly influence the amount of immunoreactive GnRH-II in <b>female</b> <b>house</b> sparrow brains. In order to test this hypothesis, females were caged with a breeding male, a non-breeding male, or caged alone. The presence of breeding males did not significantly influence ovary development, luteinizing hormone, or estradiol levels, but male presence increased female body mass, and male presence and condition interacted to influence ovarian follicle size. Using immunocytochemistry, GnRH-I and GnRH-II immunoreactivity was measured in order to evaluate the neuroendocrine response to breeding status in males. When <b>females</b> were <b>housed</b> with breeding males, there were stable numbers of immunoreactive GnRH-I and -II cells but significantly lower amounts of immunoreactive GnRH-I fibre staining within the preoptic area compared to <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> with non-breeding males. Moreover, immunoreactive GnRH-II fibres in the preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus, and medial septum were significantly greater in <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> alone in chamber with non-breeding males. The data demonstrate that the GnRH system in songbirds is modulated by social context. These finding provide novel insight into the mechanisms involved with regulating avian reproductive physiology.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} determine whether social cues could enhance the rate of resynchronization in body temperature and general activity rhythms in male or female Octodon degus following a 6 h phase advance. The first experiment examined average resynchronization rates for animals in each condition. The second experiment examined resynchronization rates for a smaller group of animals, each treated as its own control. Female phase-shifters resynchronized temperature and activity rhythms significantly faster when housed with an entrained (donor) female than those <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> with another phase-shifting <b>female</b> or <b>housed</b> alone. <b>Females</b> <b>housed</b> with entrained males resynchronized their temperature rhythms significantly slower than <b>females</b> <b>housed</b> with entrained <b>females.</b> No differences in resynchronization rate for phase-shifting males existed between test conditions. However, activity rhythms of male controls (housed alone) reentrained significantly faster than those of female controls. These experiments demonstrate a sex difference in (i) reentrainment rate by photic cues alone; (ii) donors' effect on female phase-shifters' resynchronization; and (iii) phase-shifters' resynchronization response to donor cues. In these studies, resynchronization {{in the presence of}} another animal could either have been achieved by entrainment of the pacemaker or by masking of the circadian rhythms...|$|R
