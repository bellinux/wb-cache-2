5|$|Pichilemu {{has several}} {{expansive}} dark sand beaches. The water <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> all year-round, and many tourists choose to swim {{at the shore}} break during the summer months. Common activities include bodyboarding, surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Chris Marrs Piliero and was released February 25, 2011. The video co-stars actor James Van Der Beek, who plays Kesha's nemesis. Piliero and Kesha {{came up with the}} video's concept and is intended to be simplistic, a video that <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> and random. Reception of the video by critics were positive, with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E

50|$|Porphyritic {{rocks are}} formed when {{a column of}} rising magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> in two stages. In the first stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> slowly deep in the crust, {{creating}} the large crystal grains, with a diameter of 2 mm or more. In the final stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a volcano, creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.|$|R
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely if the weather <b>is</b> <b>cool.</b> G.clavatus {{has been used for}} cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is located}} in the {{relatively}} rare warm-summer Mediterranean climate zone (Köppen Csb) that is a characteristic of California's coast, with moist mild winters and dry summers. It is largely influenced by the cold California Current, which penetrates the natural mountainous barrier along the coast by traveling through various gaps. In terms of precipitation, this means that the Bay Area has pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season, which roughly runs between November and March, is the source of about 82% of annual precipitation in the area. In the South Bay and further inland, while the wet season <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> and mild, the summer dry season is characterized by warm sunny days, while in San Francisco and areas closer to the Golden Gate strait, the dry season is periodically affected by fog.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when the air <b>is</b> <b>cool.</b> Later in the day, when the air temperature may reach over 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
50|$|MERLIN <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> using Thermoelectric {{elements}}, and can <b>be</b> <b>cooled</b> to -20 °C {{while using}} ISS water supply or -10 °C while only being air cooled. Resistive heating elements {{are used to}} provide an incubation capacity up to 48.5 °C.|$|R

5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E

25|$|Numerous waterfalls and caves are {{scattered}} across the island, including MagAso Falls in Antequera. MagAso means smoke in the native tongue. The water <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> and often creates a mist in humid mornings which can hide the falls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} can {{be adapted}} to provide longitudinal as well as transverse cooling by using a dipole magnet as a dispersive prism to divide the particles by energy, and then passing the resultant [...] "rainbow" [...] beam though a tapered wedge of cooling material. Thus, faster particles <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> more and slower particles <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> less. A simple way is to fill the dipole itself with cooling material, so that more energetic particles following a larger orbit pass <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> more.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Being</b> <b>cool</b> <b>was</b> {{not just}} about being bad, but it was to take {{ownership}} in oneself. To <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> <b>was</b> to be stoic in regards to emotion. It was to be confident and have a clear vision of oneself. It was being true to oneself and one's culture; finding oneself and [...] "keeping it real". This is the culture that transformed the Harlem Renaissance—living differently and in style.|$|R

25|$|The typical {{habitat of}} N. jacquelineae is dense mossy forest, {{which is almost}} {{constantly}} shrouded in fog and experiences daily rainfall. As a result, humidity levels are always high and the climate <b>is</b> <b>cool.</b> Plants are exposed to relatively low light levels, as sunlight is diffused by fog and vegetation.|$|E

25|$|Beech forests (Fagus sylvatica) {{are found}} in the {{mountain}} layer of the Iberian Eurosiberian region from 800 to 1500 metres up. The soil <b>is</b> <b>cool,</b> as often chalky as siliceous (rich in silica), and nearly always acidified by rain. The layer is characterised by the beech tree. The beech tree projects a deep shadow, and so its dense foliage usually excludes other woodland species. It therefore has little undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{straddles}} the higher mid-latitudes between 49° and 61°N. It {{is on the}} western seaboard of Afro-Eurasia, the world's largest land mass. Since the UK is always in or close to {{the path of the}} polar front jet stream, frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> and often cloudy, and hot temperatures are infrequent.|$|E

25|$|In a fire, PVC-coated wires {{can form}} {{hydrogen}} chloride fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge free radicals {{and is the}} source of the material's fire retardance. While hydrogen chloride fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, it dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air <b>is</b> <b>cool</b> enough to breathe, and is not available for inhalation. Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels and communal areas), PVC-free cable insulation is preferred, such as low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) insulation.|$|E
