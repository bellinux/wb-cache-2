2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, at {{a banquet}} {{hosted by the}} US Olympic Committee, a {{reporter}} was interviewing Hal Haig Prieste who had won a bronze medal in platform diving {{as a member of}} the 1920 US Olympic team. The reporter mentioned that the IOC had not been able to find out what had happened to the original Olympic flag. [...] "I can <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> that," [...] Prieste said, [...] "It's in my suitcase." [...] At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by teammate Duke Kahanamoku, he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The original Antwerp Flag is now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a plaque thanking him for donating it.|$|E

Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E

40|$|There are two goals: (1) learn {{computational}} methods {{which are}} extensively used to answer many interesting questions in macroeconomics, and (2) learn how the methods are applied in different interesting issues. Corresponding {{to these two}} goals, there are two parts in the course. In The {{first part of the}} course, you will learn how to solve, computationally, standard models which are widely used in macroeconomics. There will be some problem sets, which give you a chance of learning-by-doing. In {{the second part of the}} course, a series of recent papers which use the tools we cover in the first part of the course are presented and discussed. Some of the papers are presented by students. You will learn how the computational methods are used to answer variety of interesting questions in macroeconomics. In order to answer a quantitative question, you need to (i) (of course) come up with a question, (ii) construct a relevant model, (iii) calibrate the model so that the model captures relevant features of the real world, (iv) solve the model, (v) use the model to answer the question. I hope that the first part of the course <b>helps</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> steps (iii), (iv), and (v), and the second part <b>helps</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> step (i) (the core courses (Macro I and II) should have <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> step (ii)). ...|$|R
