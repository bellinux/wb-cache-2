40|$|The {{spectral}} analysis method {{is an important}} tool in time series analysis and the <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> {{plays a crucial role}} on the {{spectral analysis}}. However, one of limitations of the <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> is that the <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> reflects only the covariance structure among several dependence measures in the time series data. To overcome this restriction, we define two <b>spectral</b> <b>densities,</b> the quantile <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> and the association <b>spectral</b> <b>density.</b> The quantile <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> can model the pairwise dependence structure and provide identification of nonlinear time series and the association <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> allows detecting periodicities on different parts of the domain of the time series. We propose the estimators for the quantile <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> and the association <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> and derive their sampling properties including asymptotic normality. Furthermore, we use the quantile <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> to develop a goodness-of-fit tests for time series and explain how this test can be used for comparing the sequential dependence structure of two time series. The asymptotic sampling properties of the test statistic are derived under the null and alternative hypothesis, and a bootstrap procedure is suggested to obtain finite sample approximation. The method is illustrated with simulations and some real data examples. Besides the exploration of the new <b>spectral</b> <b>densities,</b> we consider general quadratic forms of alpha-mixing time series and derive asymptotic normality of these forms under the relatively weak assumptions...|$|R
