5|$|The {{biography}} of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable, {{and after a}} partial reversion to reliability in the Life of Elagabalus, the Alexander Severus, {{one of the longest}} biographies in the entire work, develops <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.|$|E
5|$|Book Seven, The Age of Great Progress, is set {{during the}} 19th century and begins during {{a war between}} the Ottoman Empire and the Indian state of Travancore. The Indians have {{previously}} defeated the Mughals and the Safavids and have developed more modern forms of warfare, emphasising surprise and mobility, they have also invented Steam engines and Ironclad warships which they sail straight {{to the city of}} Konstantiniyye and capture it with the aid of military balloons. The Ottomans are defeated easily. A Muslim Armenian doctor named Ismail ibn Mani al-Dir, who had served the Ottoman Sultan, is captured and sent to Travancore where he learns of the amazing advancements that have been made on the sub-continent such as railways and factories. He happily joins the hospital of Travancore and begins work in anatomy and physiology. Ismail eventually meets their ruler, the Kerala of Travancore, who pursues scientific and philosophical advancement (a kind of Enlightened Despot). The Kerala's aim is to drive the Muslim invaders away and peacefully unify India <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of democratic confederation. Later, during the Xianfeng Emperor's reign, in the Chinese colony known as Gold Mountain, major flooding in the Central Valley of California forces the evacuation of Chinese colonial towns and Japanese settlers alike. The Japanese had originally fled to the new world to escape Chinese oppression in their homeland, but find themselves once again under the Chinese yoke. A displaced Japanese slave, Kiyoaki, and a pregnant Chinese refugee, Peng-ti, manage to flee to the great coastal city of Fangzhang. There Kiyoaki joins a secret Japanese freedom movement which is being aided by Travancore, with Ismail acting as a go-between agent.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{creation}} of these paintings was turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of performance art—an event in 1960, for example, had an audience dressed in formal evening wear watching the models go about their task while an instrumental ensemble played Klein's 1949 The Monotone Symphony (a single 20-minute sustained chord followed by a 20-minute silence).|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{designers}} {{did not take}} care to unlink the delicate gondola structure from the tension of the suspending cables. Unlike Piccard's design with 32 cables, Osoaviakhim-1 had only nine (eight peripheral and one central cable). These cables were woven <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of basket holding the gondola. It could easily rotate inside the basket; any tension from the cables was immediately passed onto its thin shell.|$|E
25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources and appreciate {{the results of the}} revision. Marino challenges the reader to pick up on the quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E

25|$|The {{intersection}} of a four (or higher) dimensional regular polytope with a three-dimensional hyperplane {{will be a}} polytope (not necessarily regular). If the hyperplane is moved through the shape, the three-dimensional slices can be combined, animated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of four dimensional object, where the fourth dimension is taken to be time. In this way, we can see (if not fully grasp) the full four-dimensional structure of the four-dimensional regular polytopes, via such cutaway cross sections. This {{is analogous to the}} way a CAT scan reassembles two-dimensional images to form a 3-dimensional representation of the organs being scanned. The ideal would be an animated hologram of some sort, however, even a simple animation such as the one shown can already give some limited insight into the structure of the polytope.|$|E
25|$|Peirce's {{theory of}} signs {{is known to}} be one of the most complex {{semiotic}} theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The sign relation is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its object, and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of effect called its interpretant (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible triadic relation, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.|$|E
25|$|After the Klaipėda Revolt in 1923, Klaipėda Region (including Rambynas) {{became part}} of Lithuania. The hill became a {{frequently}} visited location and developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of resort. The nearby village of Bitėnai had three restaurants. Celebrations of the Saint Jonas' Festivals became grand affairs attended by many dignitaries. For example, in 1929, the celebrations were attended by a delegation from the League of Nations; its head even swore an improvised oath {{in the name of}} pagan thunder god Perkūnas. In 1928, Martynas Jankus built an altar and started keeping a guestbook, which is known as the Eternal Book of Rambynas. After World War II, authorities of the Lithuanian SSR allowed to resume the celebration of the Saint Jonas' Festivals in 1957. They even built a cement stage for events (it was demolished in 2010). German writer Johannes Bobrowski described old time celebrations on Rambynas in his 1966 novel Litauische Claviere.|$|E

25|$|Entertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, {{and sailors}} {{would be a}} huge {{business}} and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment. Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments. They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and deadfalls which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical reed organs which played music, however they quickly transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of cabaret which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor. The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured can-can dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} thirty-one he {{was already}} Minister of Finance {{at the end of}} 1873. He started his career as a protégé of the leader of the {{subsequent}} Liberal Party, Jovan Ristić, but soon joined the club of so-called young conservatives who turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of the personal party of the Serbian ruler, Prince Milan Obrenović (Prince from 1868, and King from 1882 till 1889). In the Government of Jovan Marinović, from November 1873 till December 1874 he was Minister of Finance for the second time and in that capacity he was instrumental in bringing important reforms. He introduced the metric system to Serbia. Serbia joined the Latin Monetary Union and he baptised the new domestic currency, the dinar, after mediaeval Serbian silver coins. He always considered his most important achievement in this government the law stipulating the amount of property that had to be left to peasants, and could not be confiscated to cover their debts. This minimal amount included peasant's house, a yoke of oxen, the plough, and five acres of land. He was elected for the third time as Minister of Finance in the Government of Danilo Stefanović (Stefanović) in 1875.|$|E
500|$|Dracula's Daughter was Gloria Holden's first {{starring}} role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it. Like many actors, Holden {{looked down on}} horror films. She had also seen Bela Lugosi struggle over the years since Dracula was made to free himself from typecasting and feared that the role {{would lead to the}} same fate for her. Critic Mark Clark believes that ironically it may have been Holden's disgust for the role that led to the quality of her performance.

500|$|The {{challenges}} to the speculation about the break-up or salvage of the eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that the break-up or salvage of eurozone {{is not only an}} economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that [...] "If Berlin pays the bills and tells the rest of Europe how to behave, it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against Germany and... it would strengthen the camp in Britain arguing for an exit—a problem not just for Britons but for all economically liberal Europeans. Solutions which involve greater integration of European banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by European umbrella institutions can be criticised as Germanic domination of European political and economic life. According to US author Ross Douthat [...] "This would effectively turn the European Union <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of postmodern version of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations".|$|E
500|$|The {{skin of the}} {{characters}} gained {{a new level of}} realism from a technology to produce known as [...] "subsurface scattering." [...] The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film's end, baby Jack-Jack would undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film's producer, John Walker, for help. Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded. Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.|$|E

The journalist Gritz noted that Goldhagen [...] "does not cushion his criticisms of the Church in diplomatic language", that [...] "even philosophy professor John K.

[...] "The Noble Cos," [...] a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, [...] "So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars...

500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of religion."

500|$|Michael Atkinson, {{writing for}} Sight & Sound, {{reviewed}} Aronofsky's endeavor, [...] "It's difficult to recall another American film that, in pursuing a passionate and personal vision, goes so maddeningly, uproariously wrong." [...] Atkinson {{said of the}} narrative, [...] "The erratic and pointless leapfrogging between its storylines is torporific... all three stories are assembled piecemeal, many of which repeat over and over as flashback and flashforwards." [...] He complained of the numerous motifs, [...] "It's difficult to swallow the amalgamation of Mayan, Biblical, Buddhist, Taoist and New Age iconography, all of it tossed as if into a stew." [...] In contrast, Glenn Kenny of Premiere wrote of the film, [...] "The Fountain is probably the deftest stories-within-stories narrative film I've seen... By The Fountains end, the multilayered meta-narrative... resolves (or does it?) <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of diegetic Möbius strip, to stunning effect." [...] Kenny called the film [...] "as demanding as it is dazzling" [...] and compared Aronofsky's direction to Stanley Kubrick's [...] "in terms of conceptual audacity and meticulousness of execution." [...] He concluded, [...] "It's a movie that's as deeply felt as it is imagined." ...|$|E
