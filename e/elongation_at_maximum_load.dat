Hybrid penetrative reinforcement (HYPER) uses small pins, {{protruding from the}} metallic part, to form an integrated assembly with high toughness.

The geotextiles were damaged in laboratory using a standardised procedure and an artificial aggregate (corundum) and eight other soils. The damage induced was characterized using wide-width tensile tests. Results showed reductions of the tensile strength of both geotextiles, which depended on the grain size distribution and uniformity of the soils and on the mass per unit area of the geotextiles.

In the development of future highperformance hybrid rockets still exist a lot of challenges one of which is the continuation in the development of energetic fuels and oxidizers while acquiring more in-depth understanding of their ignition and combustion behavior. Paraffin waxes represent an important class of solid fuels because of high regression rate which is possible to obtain compared with traditional fuels. A rheological, thermal, mechanical and ballistic investigation on different compositions of paraffin-based solid fuels for hybrid propulsion is presented. Formulations containing different mass fraction of a styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer (Polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene) -block-polystyrene grafted with maleic anhydride, named SEBS-MA) used for the strengthening of paraffin waxes have been investigated. Two different waxes named SASOL and GW and its formulations with polymer were characterized. A deep knowledge of the thermal, rheological and mechanical behavior of these blends is important {{in order to get a}} good solution between mechanical and ballistic properties. For better understanding an important parameter of en-trainment phenomena it is needed to obtain a visco-elastic properties. The parameters such as viscosity, surface tension, elastic modulus were obtained and compared for investigated formulations. Rheological properties were investigated using a parallel plate rheometer. Thermal properties were studied using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) setup in order to obtain data about the transitions: solid/solid and solid/liquid transition. From mechanical characterization of blends the correlation between the most important parameters (Young's modulus, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break, <b>maximum</b> <b>load)</b> and different waxes, mass fraction of polymer and elongation speeds was obtained.

An extensive parametric analysis aimed to determine the influence of several geometrical parameters on the permissible moment redistribution was carried out on propped cantilevers.

40|$|Here we {{investigate}} the mechanical properties and structural {{design of the}} pericarp of the green coconut (Cocos nucifera L.). The pericarp showed excellent impact characteristics, and mechanical tests of its individual components revealed gradients in stiffness, strength and elongation at break from the outer to the inner layer of the pericarp. In order to understand more about the potential effect of such gradients on 'bulk' material properties, we designed simple, graded, cellulose fibre-reinforced polylactide (PLA) composites by stacking layers reinforced with fibres of different mechanical properties. Tensile properties of the graded composites were largely determined by the 'weakest' fibre, irrespective of the fibre distribution. However, a graded design led to pronounced asymmetric bending and impact properties. Bio-inspired, asymmetrically graded composites showed a flexural strength and modulus {{comparable to that of}} the strongest reference samples, but the <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> was dependent on the specimen orientation. The impact strength of the graded composites showed a similar orientation-dependence, and peak values exceeded the impact strength of a non-graded reference composite containing identical fibre fractions by up to a factor of three. In combination, our results show that an asymmetric, systematic variation of fibre properties can successfully combine desirable properties of different fibre types, suggesting new routes for the development of high-performance composites, and improving our understanding of the structure-function relationship of the coconut pericarp...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aspects that}} have to be {{considered}} in the analysis of composite structures are presented and discussed. Most of composite structures concern floors of buildings and bridges, so that in this lecture the attention is mainly devoted to composite beams. To correctly evaluate stresses in the concrete slab an effective width is considered to account for shear lag and moreover, to account for local buckling phenomena, the sections are divided in four classes according to the slenderness of the parts in compression. The moment of resistance of sections is calculated through plastic analysis in sections belonging to class 1 or 2, whereas the elastic analysis is used for sections in class 3 or 4. In case of plastic analysis a partial shear connection may be provided in sagging moment regions; in this case the section moment of resistance is governed by the resistance of the shear connection. In the elastic analysis of sections the effects of creep and shrinkage have to be considered because they cause significant redistribution of section stresses. At serviceability limit states, besides the check on the values of stresses, the deflection and the crack width need to be limited. The tension stiffening of concrete in tension among two consecutive cracks needs to be considered to evaluate correctly the deflection in continuous composite beams. The global analysis may be carried out using elastic analysis. At ultimate limit state some moment redistribution to account for the inelastic behavior of materials and for cracking has to be applied to optimize the sections. The limits of moment redistribution are related to the maximum rotation capacity of the sections subjected to maximum hogging moments. A broad numerical study was carried out by the author to determine the permissible moment redistribution domain that satisfies at the same time both the rotation compatibility and the crack width in service. Propped cantilevers and fixed-end beams with different types of class 1 sections were considered in the study.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of particulate filled polymers are influenced significantly by interfacial interactions. The adhesion between the polymer and the filler {{depends on the}} area of the interface and the strength of the interaction. The former is related to specific area of the filler while the strength of the interaction can be modified by surface treatment. This study is focused on comparing the reinforcing ability of muscovite and phlogopite with and without surface treatment. Muscovite and phlogopite are two common forms of mica. Mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, tensile strength, elongation and impact strength were used to compare the reinforcing ability of muscovite and phlogopite in EVA composites. The Young's modulus of the surface treated and non-surface treated composites increased with an increase in filler loading. Composites reinforced with muscovite had similar moduli compared to composites reinforced with phlogopite. The tensile strength of phlogopite reinforced composites increased with an increase in filler content while that of muscovite reinforced composites remained constant. Surface modification by both silane and stearic acid reduced the tensile strength of phlogopite reinforced composites. The tensile strength of stearic acid treated muscovite reinforced composites improved but not to the same extent as the silane treated composites. Both muscovite and phlogopite lead to a lowering of the impact strength at high filler loadings while the tensile impact strength of both muscovite and phlogopite reinforced composites improved when using silane and stearic acid. In non-surface treated systems, muscovite reinforced composites showed an initial increase in elongation while the elongation of phlogopite reinforced composites decreased with an increase in filler loading. <b>Elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> values, however, increased at low filler loadings, when using stearic acid.
