[...] (A petiolate abdomen is one whose basal segment is stalk-like, that is, long and slender.) Nearly all D. coccinellae are female offspring of unfertilized eggs, although males are also occasionally found. The male, when observed, has no ovipositor and is slimmer and darker than females.|$|E

50|$|Crate late models use Chevrolet small-block engine {{engines that}} have been sealed with a special tag. Typical motors include the GM 602 and GM 604 engines. Recently the GM CT525 crate has been a popular choice of racers and some {{after-market}} Ford motors have surfaced in competition. Crate engines are sealed at the intake manifold, cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>front</b> cover, and oil pan with special twist off bolts. Crate engines must not be altered, modified, of changed in any way from factory specifications.|$|E

50|$|Full-Contact is kickboxing {{where the}} {{intention}} is to defeat the opponent using legal techniques applying full force. Legal strikes include punches and kicks to the <b>head</b> (<b>front,</b> side and forehead), the torso (front and side) and foot/feet (sweeps). Attacks that are illegal include strikes {{to the top of}} the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and anywhere below the belt (except for foot sweeps). As with most forms of amateur competition, all fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves.|$|E
50|$|The four cars couldn't be {{separated}} in normal operation. Because {{there was no}} traction voltage cable running through the train, both power <b>heads</b> (<b>front</b> and back cars) were equipped with a pantograph. Both power heads had a driver's cab and automatic +GF+-couplers. The trainsets featured multiple unit train control, whereby technically all four units could have been run together (but platforms usually were too short). The couplers mechanically fit onto those of the RABDe 12/12.|$|R

50|$|Ambush drakes are dragons {{that are}} lupine in form rather than feline like true dragons. They are short, squat and compact {{compared}} to normal dragons, but still grow {{to be at}} least as large as an adult human. They have muscular limbs, and short spines on their necks and ugly heads. Their wings are disproportionate. Ambush drakes have grey bodies and back legs, with dark orangey-red <b>heads,</b> <b>front</b> legs and wings. They are far less intelligent than regular dragons.|$|R
50|$|Low-Kick {{is similar}} to Full-Contact kickboxing only {{that as well as}} {{allowing}} kicks and punches to the head and body, it also allows clean kicks to be made to opponents legs. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the <b>head</b> (<b>front,</b> side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (thigh) and foot/feet (sweeps only). Strikes that are illegal include attacks {{to the top of the}} head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and the groin. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10 oz gloves.|$|E
5000|$|The only C. curiosa fossil is of a {{wingless}} gyne {{preserved in}} profile view {{with a body}} about 7.5 mm long. The head is slightly rectangular and 1.8 times shorter than the mesosoma. The sides are mostly straight, while the back corners are rounded the back edge is convex and the eyes are placed just behind the middle point of the head. The antennae have a scape which reaches just past the back edge of the head. The frons stretches across {{a quarter of the}} <b>head</b> <b>front.</b> The mesosoma is massive, and 3.2 times longer than the scutum. The species name [...] "curiosa" [...] is derived from the Latin curiosus which means funny.|$|E

50|$|The adult {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 70 mm. The body is ochreous brown in color. Antennae, <b>head</b> <b>front</b> and sides of thorax are paler. Fore wing with a black speck at end of cell. There are two oblique indistinct lines from near the apex to near base of inner margin. Three similar lines running from the apex nearly {{parallel}} to outer margin. Hind wing is smoky black with paler towards anal angle. Ventral side is with a slight rosy tinge.The subspecies tenebrosa is darker on both upper and under sides than lucasii, which again is darker than rhesus. Larva is brown in color with darker specks. A pale lateral line runs on thoracic somites. Ocellus on 4th somite is whitish, centered with a black ring on an ochreous ground.|$|E
50|$|In {{this form}} of kickboxing fighters are scored {{on their ability to}} land {{controlled}} and clean strikes with an emphasis put on style over power. Fighters that fight too aggressively may be cautioned by the referee and, if the offence is repeated, may be disqualified, although strikes that are too light (such as a push or brush) will not be scored either. Attacks are allowed to the <b>head</b> (<b>front,</b> side and forehead), the torso (front and side) and leg (foot sweeps). As mentioned before excessive force is illegal as well as strikes {{to the top of the}} head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and below the belt. Light-Contact is seen as the intermediate stage between Semi and Full-Contact kickboxing involving more physicality than Semi but less so than Full. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves.|$|E
5000|$|W.A.K.O.'s K-1 {{category}} {{uses the}} same rules set by the K-1 organization and combine a mixture of techniques from Muay Thai, Karate, western boxing {{and other forms of}} stand up fighting. [...] The main difference between K-1 rules and other forms of kickboxing is the use of the clinch and knees - which have recently been limited to one knee per clinch. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the <b>head</b> (<b>front,</b> side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (any part) and foot/feet (sweeps only). As mentioned before fighters are also allowed to knees (only one hand to clinch and one knee strike per clinch) and can use the back fist/spinning back fist technique. Strikes that are illegal include attacks {{to the top of the}} head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and shots to the groin. Techniques involving elbows are also illegal. Due to the amateur nature of W.A.K.O. championships all fighters must wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10 oz gloves.|$|E
50|$|In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy {{role-playing}} game, the Ambush drake {{is a type}} of Dragon. Unlike traditional D&D Dragons, {{which are}} somewhat feline, Ambush drakes are lupine (wolf-like). Ambush drakes are short, squat and compact compared to normal Dragons, but still grow to be at least as large as an adult human. They have muscular limbs, and short spines on their necks and ugly heads. Their wings are disproportionate. Ambush drakes have grey bodies and back legs, with dark orangey-red <b>heads,</b> <b>front</b> legs and wings. They are far less intelligent than regular Dragons.|$|R

5000|$|Much of the {{criticism}} of the album was directed at the album's dense sound. Pitchfork Media's Stuart Berman, while giving the album a positive review, criticized the songs for being too cluttered compared to those on previous albums, writing: [...] "Centipede Hz, by comparison, feels like someone throwing a burrito on your windshield: The songs hit with a jolt, instantly splaying all their ingredients before you." [...] Commenting on the return of Deakin, Tom Ewing of The Guardian wrote: [...] "It explains some of the record's bluntness - every track is full of incident, and most incidents are mixed to a similar level, so at first the songs hit you as unresolved slabs of babble." [...] Ewing continued: [...] "This makes Centipede Hz a tough listening experience to begin with, but not a particularly weird one. Once you adjust to the new method and peer through the layers of detail and clustered production, these are often quite conventional - if meandering - indie-rock songs." [...] The A.V. Club's Marc Hirsh, while praising the songs [...] "Pulleys" [...] and [...] "Wide Eyed," [...] wrote [...] ".. Other songs are so densely packed with sonic information that they become nearly impenetrable [...]." [...] Hirsh concluded: [...] "Animal Collective runs riot on the <b>head</b> <b>front</b> so thoroughly that it overlooks its own eagerness to please. Instead, Centipede Hz insists that listeners think their way to liking it." ...|$|E
5000|$|This form of kickboxing {{is defined}} by the {{competitors}} trying to outscore one another with the use of light and well-controlled contact, with the emphasis being placed on delivery, technique and speed, using both legal hand and foot techniques. It is similar to Light-Contact kickboxing only that less force is used in Semi-Contact, with almost all fights won on points, although matches have been stopped by the referee due to a KO/TKO on rare occasions. Attacks are allowed to the <b>head</b> (<b>front,</b> side, back and forehead), torso (front and side) leg (foot sweeps only) and must be of reasonable force (not a push or a brush). Excessive force is prohibited as are attacks {{to the top of the}} head, back, top of shoulders, neck and below the belt (aside from foot sweeps) or any kicks using the heel (the sole of foot must be used instead). It is also illegal to grab an opponent or throw them to the ground. Semi-Contact is seen as a good starting position for fighters who want fight experience without the additional physicality of Full or (to a lesser extent) Light-Contact kickboxing. Despite the less physical nature all fighters are still required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves. [...] Fighters score the following points for landing a controlled strike on their opponent; punch, kick to body, foot sweep (1 point), kick to head, jumping kick to body (2 points), jumping kick to head (3 points). Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges. In the event of a draw the match will be scored electronically. Victory can be achieved by points decision, knockout or technical knockout (both rare), abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (the other fighter is unable to participate). More detail on Semi-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.|$|E
