Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, who had crowned Bruce, was suspended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> outside of Berwick Castle for four years.

40|$|The {{structures}} of hydrogen hydrates with structure I (S I) and structure H (SH), are studied systematically with molecular dynamics simulation, and the stable {{structures of}} hydrogen hydrates are obtained. The structures shows {{the occupation of}} hydrogen: there are two H, molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>cage</b> and three H- 2 molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big <b>cage</b> <b>in</b> S I hydrate; there are two H- 2 molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>cage,</b> two H- 2 molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> middle <b>cage,</b> eleven H, molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big <b>cage</b> <b>in</b> SH hydrate. The radial distribution function (RDF) for hydrogen-hydrogen in each cage of hydrogen hydrate is also investigated. Furthermore, the stable positions of hydrogen in each cage are determined. With these stable positions, the hydrogen storage capability of the hydrate is 5. 085 % (mass fraction) for S I and 6. 467 % (mass fraction) for SH. Compared to experiment, {{it is found that}} the hydrogen storage capacity of the SH hydrate with the stable structure is most excellent...|$|R

5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) kills Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} sporadically, {{and is the}} only natural predator of the adult cockatoo. Carnaby's black cockatoo is occasionally parasitised by the bird louse species Franciscoloa funerei. In captivity, it is also susceptible to nematodes of the genus Ascaris if it is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> with open dirt flooring.|$|E

It was Parr's first time fighting inside <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> using 5oz MMA gloves and {{he has said he}} enjoyed it more than traditional Muay Thai and would come out of retirement if Buakaw Por.

Cricket is the name of a US children's literary magazine founded in 1973; it uses a cast of insect characters. The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an awkward joke, in a similar manner to tumbleweed.|$|E
5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cage</b> (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E

Two bouts were featured on the undercard. In respective singles matches, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels to retain his title and Gene Snitsky defeated Kane in a Weapon of Choice match, a match in which the use of foreign objects, which is usually illegal under the standard rules of professional wrestling, is allowed.|$|E

5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage.</b> It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{was taken}} to a local police {{headquarters}} and kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> overnight. North Korean troops were initially not aware of his identity. Dean {{was taken to}} a prison camp in Suwon where he was given food and medical treatment, but he began suffering from diarrhea and dysentery. Dean was then transported to the main North Korean prisoner of war camp in Seoul with other American prisoners. He attempted to keep his identity a secret but he was quickly recognized by a South Korean administrator who had worked under him before the war. Dean was moved to P'yongyang and given a larger living quarters in an underground North Korean facility. He remained sick owing to poorly prepared food.|$|E

5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them.

5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E
5|$|Dagen awakens <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cage</b> in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
