40|$|Ikareng is a low-resource {{community}} {{on the outskirts of}} Potchefstroom in the North West Province of South Africa. South Africa experiences a burden of disease that includes both diseases of lifestyle due to obesity and sedentary behaviour, and diseases of poverty due to poor sanitation and insufficient public health measures. Exercise interventions are powerful tools to modify diseases of lifestyle, and the effects of these interventions can be readily measured using structured fitness tests, clinical examination procedures, and pencil and paper tests of health and wellbeing. In Ikareng we explored the possible translation of exercise intervention and testing into a low-resource community. We undertook a series of linked studies, commending with the translation of the SF- 8 into Tswana, and the test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and face validity testing of this questionnaire in the community. We benchmarked the Tswana SF- 8 against the South African English version of the same. We then compared several variations of a <b>graduated</b> <b>step</b> test for the prediction of VO 2 peak, comparing the individual test when completed stepping in time to a metronome against a test completed using music to hold time, and the preferred of these individual tests against the step test completed in pairs. Once we had identified the most acceptable forms of these field tests, we conducted pilot testing of these tools during a community based exercise intervention (dancing). We have been able to demonstrate that the Tswana version of the SF- 8, and modified step tests, are similarly robust, valid, and as practically useful as their traditional English and laboratory based forms respectively...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} an extended, optically trapped probe that is capable of imaging surface topography with nanometre precision, whilst applying ultra-low, femto-Newton sized forces. This degree of precision and sensitivity is acquired through three distinct strategies. First, the probe itself is shaped {{in such a way as}} to soften the trap along the sensing axis and stiffen it in transverse directions. Next, these characteristics are enhanced by selectively position clamping independent motions of the probe. Finally, force clamping is used to refine the surface contact response. Detailed analyses are presented for each of these mechanisms. To test our sensor, we scan it laterally over a calibration sample consisting of a series of <b>graduated</b> <b>steps,</b> and demonstrate a height resolution of ∼ 11 nm.

40|$|One rather {{discouraging}} {{feature of}} our conventional approaches to fusion energy {{is that they}} do not appear to lend themselves to a small reactor for developmental purposes. This is in contrast with the normal evolution of a new technology which typically proceeds to a full scale commercial plant via a set of <b>graduated</b> <b>steps.</b> Accordingly` several concepts concerned with dense plasma fusion systems are being studied theoretically and experimentally. A common aspect is that they employ: (a) high to very high plasma densities ({approximately} 10 {sup 16 }cm{sup - 3 } to {approximately} 10 {sup 26 }cm{sup - 3 }) and (b) magnetic fields. If they could be shown to be viable at high fusion Q, they could conceivably lead to compact and inexpensive commercial reactors. At least, their compactness suggests that both proof of principle experiments and development costs will be relatively inexpensive compared with the present conventional approaches. In this paper, the following concepts are considered: (1) The staged Z-pinch, (2) Liner implosion of closed-field-line configurations, (3) Magnetic ``fast`` ignition of inertial fusion targets, (4) The continuous flow Z-pinch...|$|R
60|$|We {{should be}} {{extremely}} cautious in concluding that an organ {{could not have}} been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases could be given among the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the alimentary canal respires, digests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. In such cases natural selection might specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, the whole or part of an organ, which had previously performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus by insensible steps greatly change its nature. Many plants are known which regularly produce at the same time differently constructed flowers; and if such plants were to produce one kind alone, a great change would be effected with comparative suddenness in the character of the species. It is, however, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same plant were originally differentiated by finely <b>graduated</b> <b>steps,</b> which may still be followed in some few cases.|$|R
60|$|Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, {{they offer}} no greater {{difficulty}} than do corporeal structures {{on the theory}} of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can thus understand why nature moves by <b>graduated</b> <b>steps</b> in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt often comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life, yet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of tropical and temperate South America, for instance, line their nests with mud like our British species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts being not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer.|$|R
60|$|Why the {{descendants}} of plants which were originally dioecious, and which therefore profited by always intercrossing with another individual, should have been converted into hermaphrodites, may perhaps {{be explained by the}} risk which they ran, especially {{as long as they were}} anemophilous, of not being always fertilised, and consequently of not leaving offspring. This latter evil, the greatest of all to any organism, would have been much lessened by their becoming hermaphrodites, though with the contingent disadvantage of frequent self-fertilisation. By what <b>graduated</b> <b>steps</b> an hermaphrodite condition was acquired we do not know. But we can see that if a lowly organised form, in which the two sexes were represented by somewhat different individuals, were to increase by budding either before or after conjugation, the two incipient sexes would be capable of appearing by buds on the same stock, as occasionally occurs with various characters at the present day. The organism would then be in a monoecious condition, and this is probably the first step towards hermaphroditism; for if very simple male and female flowers on the same stock, each consisting of a single stamen or pistil, were brought close together and surrounded by a common envelope, in nearly the same manner as with the florets of the Compositae, we should have an hermaphrodite flower.|$|R

60|$|Nevertheless I {{know of no}} fact {{in natural}} history more {{wonderful}} than that the female Argus pheasant {{should be able to}} appreciate the exquisite shading of the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the wing-feathers of the male. He who thinks that the male was created as he now exists must admit that the great plumes, which prevent the wings from being used for flight, and which, as well as the primary feathers, are displayed in a manner quite peculiar to this one species during the act of courtship, and at no other time, were given to him as an ornament. If so, he must likewise admit that the female was created and endowed with the capacity of appreciating such ornaments. I differ only in the conviction that the male Argus pheasant acquired his beauty gradually, through the females having preferred during many generations the more highly ornamented males; the æsthetic capacity of the females having been advanced through exercise or habit {{in the same manner as}} our own taste is gradually improved. In the male, through the fortunate chance of a few feathers not having been modified, we can distinctly see how simple spots with a little fulvous shading on one side might have been developed by small and <b>graduated</b> <b>steps</b> into the wonderful ball-and-socket ornaments; and it is probable that they were actually thus developed.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing {{natural and}} {{engineered}} viruses is an accepted approach to studying plant-virus interactions {{as it relates}} to symptomology. The majority of the research topics were generated by deciphering where short-comings in the literature existed. Specifically, how Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) helper component protease (HC-Pro) small RNA (sRNA) binding affinity affects expression of genes correlated with disease phenotypes and studying debilitated viruses in a variety of RNA silencing deficient Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Taken as a whole, the research presented addressed the susceptibility of A. thaliana to TuMV. The first study was conducted to monitor genes implicated in symptomology in various RNA silencing pathway mutant backgrounds. I hypothesized that an in vitro approach, in conjunction with an in silico study would reveal the mechanism TuMV utilizes to regulate sRNA expression, post-infection. The second study focused on severe, moderate, and weak TuMV strains, versus A. thaliana response to pathogen challenge. I hypothesized that TuMV HC-Pro FRNK box mutants that differed in their ability to infect plants affected the function of host sRNA in <b>graduated</b> <b>steps.</b> I also postulated that these mutants might allow me to uncouple developmental abnormalities associated with disease progression and accumulation of the virus itself.

60|$|In {{considering}} {{the probability of}} natural selection having come into action in rendering species mutually sterile, {{one of the greatest}} difficulties will be found to lie in the existence of many <b>graduated</b> <b>steps</b> from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted, on the principle above explained, that it would profit an incipient species if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent-form or with some other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation. But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection to that higher degree which is common to so many species, and which is universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex. After mature reflection {{it seems to me that}} this could not have been effected through natural selection. Take the case of any two species which, when crossed, produce few and sterile offspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory of natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over other communities of the same species; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their preservation.|$|R
