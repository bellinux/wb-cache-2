25|$|The DOJ {{response}} to Inslaw was {{to emphasize that}} the <b>implementation</b> <b>contract</b> called for a version of PROMIS in which the government had unlimited rights and to ask for information about the enhancements Inslaw claimed as proprietary. Inslaw agreed to provide this information, but noted that {{it would be difficult to}} remove the enhancements from the time-sharing version of Promis and offered to provide the Vax version of Promis if the DOJ would agree to limit their distribution. In March 1983, the DOJ again informed Inslaw that the <b>implementation</b> <b>contract</b> required Inslaw to produce software in which the government had unlimited rights, and that delivery of software with restrictions would not satisfy the contract.|$|R

In addition, the contract data rights clause [...] "gave the government unlimited rights in any technical data and computer software delivered under the contract." [...] This presented a potential conflict with Inslaw's plans to market a commercial version of Promis which it called [...] "Promis 82" [...] or [...] "Enhanced Promis." [...] The issue came up early in the <b>implementation</b> <b>contract,</b> but was resolved by an exchange of letters in which DOJ signed off on the issue after Inslaw assured the DOJ that Promis 82 contained [...] "enhancements undertaken by Inslaw at private expense after the cessation of LEAA funding." ...|$|R

25|$|Under this arrangement, however, Inslaw had {{substantial}} difficulty {{demonstrating the}} extent of the enhancements and the use of private funding in their development. It proposed several methods for doing this, but these were rejected by DOJ as inadequate. Inslaw's attempts to identify the proprietary enhancements and their funding ended when it began installing Promis on the USAO Prime computers in August 1983. By the end of the contract in March 1983, it had completed installing Promis in all 20 of the offices specified in the <b>implementation</b> <b>contract.</b> Since none of the available versions of Promis was compatible with the Department's new Prime computers, Inslaw ported the Vax version, which contained Inslaw's claimed enhancements, to the Prime computers.|$|R

When Inslaw learned of the installations, it notified EOUSA that this was in violation of Modification 12 and filed a claim for $2.9m, which Inslaw said was the license fees for the software DOJ self-installed.

40|$|MM - P&DMSouth Africa {{has since}} the end of {{apartheid}} struggled with the issue of poor public sector performance. Performance contracting for public servants, introduced to improve the public sector’s performance, has not borne much fruit. In this study, performance contracting refers to a framework that uses a form of ‘relational’ contract referred to as a performance agreement for performance management. This study sought to establish challenges in the <b>implementation</b> of performance <b>contracting</b> in the public sector. In addition, it sought to recommend interventions to improve <b>implementation</b> of performance <b>contracting</b> in the public sector. A qualitative research approach was used with Gauteng department of housing as a case study. The study focused on performance contracting for senior managers who are members of the senior management service The study established that although performance contracting has an important role to play in performance management, its implementation is hindered by several challenges. The complexity of performance agreements format templates; inadequate resources and managerial authority; political interference; inadequate leadership; inadequate personal training and development; systems and processes challenges; organization culture and a weak implementation strategy were identified as the main challenges in the <b>implementation</b> of performance <b>contracting.</b> The study recommends interventions to improve the <b>implementation</b> of performance <b>contracting.</b> These include: the development of a comprehensive implementation strategy that takes cognizance of the identified challenges and provision of adequate political and administrative leadership...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn component-based development, {{software}} components are taken as units of composition. Nevertheless, {{to achieve the}} widely disseminated status of components being plugged together as simple ‘Lego Pieces’, the integration of components must be carefully designed, systematised and verified; only this can ensure reliable architectures. In this work, we propose some conformance notions to predict the precise nature of some forms of composition, considering coordination patterns used in the integration. These notions are formalised {{in terms of the}} denotational semantics of the process algebra CSP, and assist the designer in common activities during integration, such as the substitution of component specifications by <b>implementations,</b> <b>contract</b> adaptations, and system extensions. To support mechanical verifications using FDR (a model-checker for CSP), we derive test characterisations from the denotational definitions of conformance. We illustrate the application of these notions through a systematic composition strategy of software frameworks, and we mechanically verify the preservation of behavioural component properties in these compositions. Moreover, we characterise the well-formedness of a coordination pattern used in this strategy at the design stage, before components are assembled...|$|R

On the field, {{it is not}} easy to perform the obligation to renegotiate the Contract of Work as stated in Article 169 of Law No. 4 of 2009. The process of Contract of Work renegotiation tends to be tough and has exceeded the completion deadlines stated in Article 169 letter b Law No. 4 of 2009 which is not more than one (1) year after the legislation of the law itself.
