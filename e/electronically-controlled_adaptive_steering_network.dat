Conventional model-based PID controller {{is difficult to}} solve this problem because of too many disturbances and unknown factors. The authors have developed an <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> controller consisting of an adaptive Kalman filter and an adaptive nonlinearity compensator for attenuating the effects of those disturbances and unknown factors. Both simulation and test results indicated that the method of using an adaptive Kalman filter and an adaptive gain compensator is an effective steering controller design approach for solve the programs generated by the noisy and drifting control signals such as tractor automated steering control...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{opportunities}} to build a structural policy network model that is rooted in social network theories. By making a distinction between a process of <b>steering</b> in <b>networks,</b> and a process of <b>steering</b> by <b>networks,</b> it addresses the effects of network structures on network dynamics {{as well as on}} the production of policy outputs. <b>Steering</b> in policy <b>networks</b> refers to the process of horizontal bargaining over policy positions in which resources are exchanged between individual <b>network</b> actors. <b>Steering</b> by policy <b>networks</b> refers to the policy making processes in which policy networks are utilized as policy instruments. The details of network configuration profoundly influence individual actors’ capacities to influence such bargaining processes and the social structures of policy networks change due to the process of <b>steering</b> in <b>networks.</b> The individual, sequential actions that characterize bargaining over various resources nevertheless do not explain how policy networks produce policy outputs. The study investigates how actor-based models of network dynamics provide a theoretical point of departure for explaining firstly the structural outcomes of <b>steering</b> in <b>networks,</b> and secondly the utility of any potential policy outputs for both government and individual actors. Because of the interdependency between actors in heterogeneous policy networks, outputs require subgroup-level coordination. There is therefore a mismatch between individual and group utility – whilst some individuals will benefit from a sparse network structure in negotiation processes, the optimum system outcome is produced by dense and cohesive social structures. The study elaborates on this paradox and shows the utility of different characteristics of network structures for both individual actors and government, and presents hypotheses on the relations between policy goals, policy positions, network structures, and the utility of policy outputs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a method to enhance noisy depth maps using <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> kernel {{regression}} based on distance transform. Dataadaptive kernel regression filters are widely used for image denoising by considering spatial and photometric properties of pixel data. In order to reduce noise in depth maps more efficiently, we adaptively refine the steering kernel regression function according to local region structures, flat and textured areas. In this work, we first generate two distance transform maps from the depth map and its corresponding color image. Then, the steering kernel is modified by a newlydesigned weighing function directly related to joint distance transform. The weighting function expands the steering kernel in flat areas and shrinks it in textured areas toward local edges in the depth map. Finally, we filter the noise in the depth map with the refined steering kernel regression function. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the competing methods in objective and subjective comparisons for depth map enhancement. ...|$|R

Cell sizes are trained in voting spaces to estimate the tolerance of object appearance at each pixel location. After that, two detection steps are adopted to locate instances of object class in a given target image. At the first step, patches of objects are recognized by densely voting in voting spaces. Then, the refined hypotheses step is carried out to accurately locate multiple instances of object class. The new approach is training the voting spaces based on a few samples of the object.

40|$|Abstract — Percutaneous needle insertions are {{commonly}} performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Accurate {{placement of the}} needle tip {{is important to the}} success of many needle procedures. The current needle steering systems depend on needle-tissue-specific data, such as maximum curvature, that is unavailable prior to an interventional procedure. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> method for flexible bevel-tipped needles that is capable of performing accurate tip placement without previous knowledge about needle curvature. The method steers the needle by integrating duty-cycled needle steering, online curvature estimation, ultrasound-based needle tracking, and samplingbased motion planning. The needle curvature estimation is performed online and used to adapt the path and duty cycling. We evaluated the method using experiments in a homogenous gelatin phantom, a two-layer gelatin phantom, and a biological tissue phantom composed of a gelatin layer and in vitro chicken tissue. In all experiments, virtual obstacles and targets move in order to represent the disturbances that might occur due to tissue deformation and physiological processes. The average targeting error using our new adaptive method is 40 % lower than using the conventional non-adaptive duty-cycled needle steering method. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Driver {{steering}} control performance varies with {{time during the}} vehicle driving course. A serial vehicle steering assist controller {{is designed to provide}} steering correction that can compensate the difference between the current driver and an “idealized ” driver model. Using variable structure model reference adaptive control, a robust adaptive controller for lane keeping assist is developed. To reduce the complexity in control computations, a simplified version of the robust <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> assist controller is also developed. Due to the significant variations in human driver behaviour, the stability of the compensated system is not guaranteed and conflict between the driver and the steering assist controller exist. A model predictive control based driver model and a dual-loop structure driver model are employed to represent the variations in driver intention, and the conflict between the controller and the driver is observed from computer simulations. A simple decision making algorithm is implemented and the conflict situations are successfully avoided for different driver behaviour modes and driving scenarios. Future work of this research will focus on implementing the designed controller on a driving simulator and experiments with human drivers on the driving simulator.

40|$|The {{recent years}} have seen the {{increasing}} popularity {{of a wide range}} of applications in Computer Vision. Object Recognition is critical in determining the success of these applications. In general, object recognition consists of three major components: imagery acquisition, feature extraction and classification. Imagery acquisition is the process by which hardware is used to obtain information from a scene. Feature extraction is the process by which an object within the image is described either explicitly or implicitly. Finally, classification attempts to use the extracted features as an input to generate classifiers, thereby distinguishing different objects. Therefore, feature extraction and its derived representations play a vital role in improving the accuracy of object recognition. In traditional hand-crafted feature representation methods, such as Histogram of Gradient, the representative and discriminative capabilities of these methods are highly vulnerable to various factors, such as image noise. Therefore, in this study, novel feature descriptors are proposed to tackle the issues arising from feature representation in object recognition. Two kernel-based feature descriptors are developed: Steering Kernel Regression Weight Matrix and Long-Axis of Local <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Steering</b> Kernel; both of which are derived from Steering Kernel Regression. The proposed feature descriptors facilitate the ability of Steering Kernel Regression to capture the local structure around an object and tolerate the noise that occurs in the images. Subsequently covariance techniques are employed to form a robust feature representation for an object. To alleviate the complexity arising from covariance, Long-Axis of Local <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Steering</b> Kernel feature is proposed to simplify the computation required. Additionally, to further reduce computation complexity, a sparse representation based feature descriptor is developed for object detection. Sparse representation has proven its superior capabilities in image classification, but not in object detection, i. e. isolating objects within a complicated environment. Therefore, in this study, the reconstruction error from sparse representation is utilised as a feature, and a Bayesian model is applied to use learned atoms to reinforce the discriminative power of reconstruction error that may have been 'polluted' by noise. Computer Vision applications not only work with static images, but also with videos. A motion-based approach is developed to tackle the problem caused by appearance-based features in video-based Person Re-identification. Fine-grained displacement along dense trajectories is applied to describe a specific human motion. Such motion information encodes numerous distinctive biometric cues to discriminate between the walking styles of different people. Utilising Dissimilarity based Sparse Subset Learning, the proposed approach demonstrates increased robustness in long term Person Re-identification applications...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{hyperthermia}} is {{a treatment}} used in concurrence with radiation therapy or chemotherapy {{in the treatment}} of deep seated tumors. In hyperthermia, tumor temperatures are elevated 3 to 7 oC above normal body temperature, up to a temperature of 44 oC. In a randomized trial, the 3 year overall survival of cervical cancer patients was almost doubled by adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy. There is a clear dose-effect relation in hyperthermia, and therefore increasing the temperature in the tumor is an important factor to further increase survival rates in cervical cancer. Until recently, hyperthermia treatments in Rotterdam were performed by aiming a focus point that was calculated using a cylindrical representation of the patient. Because of the inhomogeneous nature of a patient, this representation is far from accurate. For the 4 antenna Sigma 60, the calculated focus point may still be close to the optimum, but for applicators with more antennas, and a high number of degrees of freedom, this approach will certainly be inadequate. Originating in the 1970 ’s, electromagnetic numerical and thermal modeling of 3 D structures is currently possible with a precision and speed that is sufficient for routine use. When the electromagnetic and thermal properties of a patient are known, the energy and thermal distributions can be calculated for each antenna of the applicator. With this information, the interference pattern can be determined, dependent on phase and amplitude of the emitted signals by the antennas, and thus can be optimized. When performing these patient specific calculations, i. e. treatment planning, and optimizations, the resulting settings can be applied on-line in the clinic. This thesis covers the clinical introduction of hyperthermia treatment planning, the assessment of the various uncertainties that should be taken into account, and the results of clinical implementation. Optimization The successful application of hyperthermia treatment planning requires optimization routines that optimize the SAR distribution in such manner that the eventual dose in the tumor is maximized. In chapter 2, various SAR based goal functions were assessed. This assessment showed that a goal function taking into account hotspot minimization as well as maximization of the SAR in the tumor has the highest probability to lead to high tumor temperatures. Eventually, two goal functions were chosen for clinical assessment: average tumor SAR normalized on whole body average SAR (Opt 1), and hotspot tumor quotient (HTQ), the ratio between SAR in the 0. 1 th percentile and the tumor SAR (Opt 2). Further, the concept of complaint <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> is tested, i. e. local reduction of SAR in case of patient discomfort by adapting the goal function. The phantom test and a sensitivity study in 10 patient models, show that complaint <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> is most effective in peripheral complaint regions. Clinical evaluation in two groups of five patients shows that time between complaints is longer using Opt 2 (p= 0. 007), i. e. a higher comfort of the patient during treatment. It does, however, not yet lead to significantly different temperatures [T 50 ’s of 40. 3 (Opt 1) vs. 40. 1 oC (Opt 2) (p= 0. 898) ]. From this study we concluded that complaint <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering</b> is feasible in terms of SAR-reduction in complaint regions and in time consumption. Moreover, complaint <b>adaptive</b> HTP guided <b>steering</b> has the potential for further improvement and thus higher temperatures, when the degrees of freedom are increased, i. e. in more advanced applicators. Opt 2 (i. e. HTQ) is used in further clinical application, because of better complaint reduction and control. Uncertainties The clinical use of hypethermia treatment planning can be influenced considerably by various uncertainties. These uncertainties are either related to the reproduction of the model setup in the clinic (e. g. positioning, water bolus shape, antenna signals), or deviations of patient tissue properties from literature values, and cause differences in heating between model predictions and the actual patient. In chapter 4, we investigated the influence of positioning uncertainties on power deposition in the Sigma 60 applicator. Position inaccuracies of less than 1 cm appear not to affect SAR patterns relevantly. Current positioning precision is sufficient in the X (right-left) -direction but precision measurements are needed to reach the desired accuracy in the Y (anterior posterior) -direction. In chapter 5, a closer look was taken at the influence of tissue parameter uncertainties on the tumor SAR and temperature levels for 20 patient models. A Monte Carlo analysis, simulating many uncertainty scenarios, shows a variation of HTQ of approximately 25 % (interquartile range) and a variation of 0. 7 to 1 oC (interquartile range) for temperatures, due to the uncertainties in tissue parameters. Difference between the Sigma 60 and Sigma Eye applicators however, still remain significant (p< 0. 001 for SAR and temperature distributions). The additional benefit that could be expected from temperature modeling is canceled out by the uncertainties. This means that SAR modeling is sufficient, as long as uncertainties persist. Moreover, these results show that with uncertainty reduction, the potential of HTP guided steering can be increased considerably...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{how different}} types of automation affect tactical driving behavior, depending on trust in the system. Previous research indicates that drivers wait for automation to act, delegating the monitoring of traffic situations. This would be especially true {{for those who have}} more trust in automation. Behavioral and gaze data from 30 participants driving an advanced simulator were recorded in four driving conditions, namely, manual driving, intentional car following, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and ACC with <b>adaptive</b> <b>steering.</b> Measures of trust in the systems were recorded with a questionnaire. Three fairly common traffic events requiring a driver response were analyzed. Trust in automation was high among the participants, and no associations between trust levels and behavior could be found. Drivers seem to make informed choices on when to let the automation handle a situation and when to switch it off manually or via the vehicle controls. If drivers did not expect the system {{to be able to handle}} the situation, they usually resumed control before the automation reached its limits. If the automation was expected to be able to deal with the situation, control was usually not resumed. In addition, situations were dealt with in a tactically different manner with automation than without. Controlling the car with automation systems is thus accepted by drivers as being a different undertaking than driving in manual mode...|$|R
