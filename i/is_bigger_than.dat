5|$|On {{the west}} side of the main hall is another {{attached}} shrine, though in much more ruined state. The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved to museums and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.|$|E
5|$|Meena then realises {{that she}} has {{fallen in love with}} Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{convergent}} validity analysis, the following measurement standard {{is used to}} measure convergent validity [3]. (1) The standardized factor loadings of the observed variables shall <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> 0.7 [28]. (2) Squared multiple correlations (SMC) are {{used to measure the}} intensity of the individual variable over the potential dimension. The SMC value shall <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> 0.5, meaning that the measurement variable has high credibility. (3) Composite reliability (CR) refers to the consistency of the variables within the potential dimensions. The standard value shall <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> 0.6. The higher the CR value, the higher the consistency of the variables, meaning the better predictability. (4) Average variance extracted (AVE) refers to the average explanatory ability of the measurement variables within the potential dimensions. The standard value shall <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> 0.5.|$|R
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|Though both {{manufacturers}} {{have a broad}} product range in various segments from single-aisle to wide-body, their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head. Instead they respond with models slightly smaller or bigger than the other in order to plug any holes in demand and achieve a better edge. The A380, for example, {{is designed to be}} larger than the 747. The A350XWB competes with {{the high end of the}} 787 and the low end of the 777. The A320 <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the 737-700 but smaller than the 737–800. The A321 <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the 737–900 but smaller than the previous 757-200. Airlines see this as a benefit since they get a more complete product range, from 100 seats to 500 seats, than if both companies offered identical aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The canal {{connects to}} an un-navigable {{part of the}} River Severn, {{separated}} from the main channel by weirs at Maisemore and Llanthony, {{both of which have}} derelict locks associated with them. Maisemore was sold by British Waterways some years ago, and they decided to dispose of Llanthony in 2007. The Canal Trust used a legacy to purchase the site, which includes two cottages, some land, and a small section of the River Severn as well as Llanthony lock. The lock <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> that at Maisemore, and access to the entrance lock at Over is easier because boats are travelling against the flow of the river as they approach it.|$|E

Scotland performed better than the UK average in securing new Foreign Direct Investment in 2012–13 (measured by the number of projects), although not as well as Wales or Northern Ireland. GDP growth during 2013 was lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, although this was partly due to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Refinery.|$|E

25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not {{need to know how to}} read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E
