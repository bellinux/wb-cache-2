5000|$|The term {{drafting}} water {{refers to}} the use of suction to move a liquid such as water from a vessel or body of water below the intake of a suction pump. A rural fire department or farmer might draft water from a pond as the first step in moving the water elsewhere.

5000|$|Engine - The engine {{company is}} the {{backbone}} of the fire suppression operation. Every BCFD engine is manufactured by Pierce, and has a 500-gallon water tank. Engine companies carry a basic assortment of hose lines, appliances and adapters, forced entry tools, basic and advanced life support medical equipment, five-gas air monitoring, and a hand-held thermal imager. Most first line engine companies have a 1250GPM single stage pump. Basic hose line compliment is 1,200' of 4" [...] 'Stortz' supply hose, 250' of 2.5" [...] attack line, 300' of 3" [...] setback/standpipe hose, 500' of 1.75" [...] attack line, and 20' of <b>hard</b> <b>suction</b> hose.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{of this one}} but the premise is the same in all. The Crew (4-6 team members) simulates receiving an alarm, responding to and handling the alarm. The firefighters start out in street clothes and dress in full turnout gear (Helmet, Coat, and boots) board their fire engine and respond approximately 200 feet up the course to a portable water tank, the engine crew simultaneously stretches 100-150 feet of 2 1/2 inch hose toward a target area as other crew members place <b>hard</b> <b>suction</b> hose to the intake on the engine and another member connects the 2 1/2" [...] line to the discharge. The pump operator must then draft water from the portable tank and discharge it through the 2 1/2 inch hose to knock down a target (usually a beer keg or traffic cone with a ball on top) This contest checks crew integrity, skill of the equipment operator, skill of the nozzle crew, and operation of the equipment. When done by a well versed team {{it can be done}} in under a minute as was accomplished many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s at Greenfield Village SPAAMFAA musters in Michigan.Some variations include stadium response where apparatus does not drive, another variation is the crew is lying on cots on an elevated platform and must slide down a pole. One variation exempts the equipment operator from wearing gear however it must be on the truck.|$|E
