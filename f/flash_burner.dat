He roused himself at the <b>flash</b> of the <b>burner</b> which the man turned up. [...] "What's all this?" [...] he demanded, haughtily. [...] "Where's the carriage? What's the matter?" ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of <b>flash</b> furnace <b>burners</b> can be evaluated {{quickly and efficiently}} using CFD modelling. Gas flows are modelled using the conventional Eulerian approach, while Lagrangian particle tracking is used to model the flow of solid feed through the burner and into the reaction shaft. A composite particle model has been developed that considers the solid feed to {{be made up of}} single particles containing appropriate quantities of concentrate, flux and dust. Solid fuels (such as coal) can also be included in the composite particle. Reactions between the solids and gas are then modelled using standard heat and mass transfer relationships. Results from the modelling process are shown for BHP-Billiton’s Olympic Dam copper flash smelter with the burner that was used from 1998 – 2003. Flow patterns, temperature and gas composition distributions, particle dispersion and residence time, and overall extent of sulphur removal are predicted and used to evaluate furnace performance. However, results are sensitive to the assumed size of the composite particles, and plant measurements are required to determine the appropriate composite particle size to predict quantitative data...|$|R
