5|$|I've {{always been}} <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> story. More than anything, <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{commitment}} {{to what she}} believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Melanie was {{primarily}} negative; critics expressed disapproval of {{her decision to}} support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as her inability to properly care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two NAACP Image Awards and a Teen Choice Award for the role.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{rising to}} fame in 2004 as a finalist {{on the third}} season of American Idol, Leah LaBelle {{released}} covers of songs through her YouTube account, and found minor success. American record producer Pharrell Williams, discovered LaBelle through her videos, and called So So Def Recording's founder and CEO Jermaine Dupri for his opinion of her. In 2011, LaBelle was signed to a joint record deal with L.A. Reid's company Epic Records, Dupri's So So Def Recordings, and Williams' label I Am Other. She said that Williams and Dupri were <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> style of performing.|$|E

5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E

Visual artists {{especially}} seem <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> image, and both wealthier Africans and tourists buy paintings and wooden sculptures of the spirit. She also figures prominently in the folk art of Africa, with her image adorning walls of bars and living rooms, album covers, and other items.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{entered the}} University of Oxford {{at the age}} of 17. She studied at St. Anne's College, and {{graduated}} with a BA in English Literature. As an undergraduate, she wrote for Isis, the university's literary magazine, to which she contributed interviews with the journalist Auberon Waugh and the actor Dudley Moore. Brown's sharp, witty prose led to her being published by the New Statesman while she was still an undergraduate at Oxford. Her friendship with Waugh served as a boost to her writing career, as he used his influence to get attention <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ability. Later, she went on to date the writer Martin Amis. While still at Oxford, she won The Sunday Times National Student Drama Award for her one-act play Under the Bamboo Tree. A subsequent play, Happy Yellow, in 1977 was mounted at the London fringe Bush Theatre and was later performed at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|E

50|$|Her {{works are}} known for being {{psychological}} dramas focusing on death and romance between androgynous characters. Her minimalist aesthetics, darker themes, and preference for abstraction are all a big <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> manga. Her characters are described as willowy and long-limbed with unclear gender characteristics. Each character tends to struggle with their inner demons in the harsh reality of everyday life.|$|R
25|$|Silversides {{became a}} part of the Combined Great Lakes Navy Association in Chicago, Illinois, behind Chicago's Naval Armory on 24 May 1973. For years, the {{submarine}} was tended by a small crew of dedicated volunteers, <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> illustrious history and technical marvels. They donated tens of thousands of man-hours to restore her, maintained her at their own expense, and served as docents and chaperones. When association volunteers first stepped on board, they faced a musty, mildewed sub with paint peeling off in sheets inside and out, and junk scattered everywhere. After many years, the refrigeration compartment had produced a growth so thick, they could be measured in multiple inches instead of millimeters. Evidence of water damage prevailed in the forward compartments but the aft end was in reasonably good condition. Topside, the decking was weathered and worn in spots and some areas of the superstructure were rusted and in need of replacement.|$|E

500|$|Although {{films like}} Style and Jhankar Beats succeeded commercially, {{most of her}} later films have {{generated}} less revenue. A number of them remained unfinished. While many of her appearances have been item numbers and cameos, few of her leading roles have been in low-budget films. Though she had small roles in Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002), [...] (2003) and Plan (2004), attention was <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> item numbers in all three, especially the one in Qayamat that featured her in a bubble-bath. Besides this, she performed another item number in James (2005) on director-producer Ram Gopal Varma's behest, who {{has a history of}} casting aspirant actress-models like Sameera Reddy, Isha Koppikar and Koena Mitra in similar roles. Furthermore, she took part in a dance number for Sajid Khan's Heyy Babyy (2007) that featured several mainstream Bollywood actresses.|$|E
500|$|Chastain's biggest {{success of}} the year came with the drama The Help, co-starring Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone, {{which was based on}} Kathryn Stockett's novel of the same name. Chastain played Celia Foote, an {{aspiring}} socialite in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi, who develops a friendship with her black maid (played by Spencer). Chastain was <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character's anti-racist stand and connected with her energy and enthusiasm; in preparation, she watched the films of Marilyn Monroe and researched the history of Sugar Ditch, Tennessee, where her character was raised. The Help earned $216 million at the box office to become Chastain's most widely seen film to that point. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised the chemistry between Chastain and Spencer and Roger Ebert commended her for being [...] "unaffected and infectious". The ensemble of The Help won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast and Chastain received her first Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category, in addition to BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG nominations in the same category, all of which she lost to Spencer.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University {{described}} Lara Croft as {{a psychological}} tabula rasa. Richard Rouse of Midway Games attributed the character's {{appeal to a}} loosely defined personality, which permits players to imprint their own onto her. Jeremy Smith stated that the minimal personality allows players to form {{a relationship with the}} character. Burton added that Croft is perceived differently around the world. French demographics focus on her sex appeal, while German and British audiences are <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> aggressiveness and aloofness, respectively. Fansites dedicated to Lara Croft appeared on the internet in several languages after the release of Tomb Raider, and contained official and fan-created images of Croft, model photographs, and fan fiction starring the character. More than 100 such sites were present by the end of 1998. By 2000, search engine HotBot yielded around 4,700pages for a search of the character's name. Admirers discussed rumours related to Lara Croft via usenet newsgroups and ICQ chats. Enthusiasts also collected merchandise and paraphernalia, submitted fan art to video game magazines, participated in Croft cosplay, and obtained tattoos depicting the character. One admirer rode a bike over [...] from Amsterdam to Derby wearing Lara Croft brand clothing to meet the developers, who welcomed him after learning of the trip.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani. Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, {{the film}} {{tells the story}} of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, [...] "Vidya Balan, a fine actress with {{thousand}} emotions fleeting across her lovely face, has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took {{on the part of a}} police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a [...] "no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect" [...] and was particularly <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character's [...] "silent aggression". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya [...] "is reliably solid each time sheâ€™s on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2012, Lawrence {{played a}} young {{depressed}} widow named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell's romance movie Silver Linings Playbook. The film was {{an adaptation of}} the Matthew Quick's novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder. The actress was <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character's complex personality: [...] "She didn't really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't". Russell considered Lawrence to be too young for the part; she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition. She found herself challenged by Russell's spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the [...] "best experience of my life". Richard Corliss of Time wrote: [...] "Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who is, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role." [...] Peter Travers believed that Lawrence [...] "is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes {{all in the same}} scene, even in the same breath." [...] She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film, becomingâ€”at age 22â€”the second youngest Best Actress Oscar winner. Her final release of the year was alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai's critically panned thriller House at the End of the Street.|$|E

Hari's critics have <b>drawn</b> attention <b>to</b> <b>her</b> affiliated marketing partnerships with organic and non-GMO brands from which she profits by recommending them over mainstream brands.|$|R

2500|$|On February 20, 1974, while {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the beauty of the dark-haired girl and was especially <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. [...] "This is a sign used by the early Christians," [...] she said, and then left. Dick called the symbol the [...] "vesicle pisces". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile) which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.|$|E
2500|$|Alexis Bledel {{was cast}} in the key role of Rory despite having no {{previous}} acting experience. Sherman-Palladino was <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> shyness and innocence, which she said was essential for the character, and felt she photographed well. Lauren Graham was pursued by the casting directors {{from the start of}} the process, but she was committed to another show on NBC. A week before shooting, they had still failed to cast Lorelai so they asked Graham to audition anyway. Sherman-Palladino cast her that day, on the hope that Graham's other show (M.Y.O.B.) would be cancelled, which it soon was. She later explained how Graham met all the criteria she had been looking for: [...] "Lorelaiâ€™s a hard fucking part. Youâ€™ve got to be funny, youâ€™ve got to talk really fucking fast, youâ€™ve got to be able to act, youâ€™ve got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. Youâ€™ve got to be strong, but not like â€˜I hate men,'". Graham and Bledel only met the night before they started filming the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour was}} among the first concerts {{attended}} by Britney Spears, who commented [...] "I remember the first time I went to her show, I was just like 'Oh my God,' I wanted to be her." [...] Spears added, [...] "she just has this presence that you're so <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> you can't keep your eyes off her." [...] Spears' rendition of [...] "Stronger" [...] on the Dream Within a Dream Tour referenced Jackson's performance of [...] "You", performing in a similar vein among masked dancers wearing one-piece attire. Several performances and themes of Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour drew comparisons for its choreography and sensuality, as well as a reworked lounge version of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] sonically reminiscent of Jackson's [...] "Rope Burn." [...] Spears' following tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears used a circus theme, observed to be partially inspired by segments of the tour. During [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] on the Femme Fatale Tour, Spears performed a lap dance for a selected fan while wearing a boa after a pole dance, considered a direct reference to Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn." [...] An analysis of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour observed there was [...] "definitely a Janet vibe", particularly comparing Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn", [...] "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Skin." [...] The critique added, [...] "Fast forward 13 years later, and there was Rihanna, writhing around on a lucky audience member at the conclusion of Skin off her current Loud album." [...] New Zealand's Stuff.co.nz praised Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball as the best [...] "pop-star show" [...] since Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour.|$|E
