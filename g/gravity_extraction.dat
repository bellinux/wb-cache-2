40|$|A {{solvent free}} {{microwave}} hydrodiffusion and <b>gravity</b> <b>extraction</b> (MHG) of flavonol content from onion (Allium cepa L.) was studied. Effectiveness of this innovative method in extraction of onion total phenolic content, total quercetin (TQ), quercetin aglycon (QA), quercetin- 3, 4 ′-diglucoside (QDG), quercetin- 4 ′-monoglucoside (Q 4 G), quercetin- 3 -monoglucoside (Q 3 G), kaempferol (KMF) and myricetin (MRT) {{have been evaluated}} and compared with conventional solvent extraction. Microwave extraction offers important advantages like shorter extraction time (23 min), cleaner feature (no solvent or water used) and extraction of valuable onion crude juice retaining fresh organoleptic properties with higher phenolic content (58. 29 mg GAE/g DW) at optimized power (500 W). Microwave extraction resulted significant yield (81. 5 %) with 41. 9 % of flavonol contents, with better retain of remaining flavonoids (55. 9 %) in residues of onions. QDG (239. 7 mg/ 100 g DW) and Q 4 G (82. 55 mg/ 100 g DW) have been reported the main flavonol in this study. Minor quantities of QA (traces), Q 3 G (4. 22 mg/ 100 g DW) and KMF (3. 99 mg/ 100 g DW) were also detected in microwave onion extracts...|$|E

40|$|We reinvestigate {{surfaces}} {{with constant}} {{values of the}} trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor, K. These surfaces may provide a useful foliation for the numerical calculation of black hole systems, {{in support of the}} modeling of sources for gravity wave interferometers. To this end, we begin by characterizing the K-constant surfaces for a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we identify surfaces of three kinds, and we provide an analytic expression for the closest approach one class of these surfaces makes to the singularity. We then derive a non-zero shift that yields families of K-constant surfaces which (1) naturally avoid singularities and may avoid the need to excise the apparent horizons, (2) are asymptotically null, aiding in <b>gravity</b> wave <b>extraction,</b> (3) cover the spacetime so as to maximize the future development of the initial data, and (4) are static under evolution, and therefore have no ``grid stretching/sucking'' pathologies. Contrary to common lore, a non-zero shift vector can be found that produces K-constant surfaces that are regular and static throughout their evolution...|$|R

40|$|We reinvestigate {{the utility}} of time-independent {{constant}} mean curvature foliations for the numerical simulation of a single spherically-symmetric black hole. Each spacelike hypersurface of such a foliation is endowed with the same constant value of the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor, $K$. Of the three families of $K$-constant surfaces possible (classified according to their asymptotic behaviors), we single out a sub-family of singularity-avoiding surfaces that may be particularly useful, and provide an analytic expression for the closest approach such surfaces make to the singularity. We then utilize a non-zero shift to yield families of $K$-constant surfaces which (1) avoid the black hole singularity, and thus the need to excise the singularity, (2) are asymptotically null, aiding in <b>gravity</b> wave <b>extraction,</b> (3) cover the physically relevant part of the spacetime, (4) are well behaved (regular) across the horizon, and (5) are static under evolution, and therefore have no ``grid stretching/sucking'' pathologies. Preliminary numerical runs demonstrate that we can stably evolve a single spherically-symmetric static black hole using this foliation. We wish to emphasize that this coordinatization produces $K$-constant surfaces for a single black hole spacetime that are regular, static and stable throughout their evolution.

40|$|The {{surge in}} crude {{oil and natural}} gas liquids {{production}} from the USA and Canada, totalling over 6 million barrels/ day (mb/d) since 2006 â 7 (see graph on right), is a remarkable achievement of technological innovation and risk taking. This liquids growth arrived on the heels of large-scale and low-cost development of natural gas supplies from so-called tight or unconventional formations. US production growth has been driven by long-term improvements in the application of both the art and science of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In the years just prior to the emergence of the US petroleum renaissance, Canada achieved substantial improvements in both mining and steam-assisted <b>gravity</b> drainage (SAGD) <b>extraction</b> techniques from the McMurray Formation in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. These North American (sans Mexico) unconventional petroleum developments are altering flows in world crude oil trade, shifting long-term price expectations, and challenging long-held conventional wisdom on US energy policy promulgated in an era of scarcity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The decade-old {{formulation}} of the isolated horizon classically and within loop quantum <b>gravity,</b> and the <b>extraction</b> of the microcanonical entropy of such a horizon from this formulation, is reviewed, in view of recent renewed interest. There are two main approaches to this problem: one employs an SU(2) Chern-Simons theory describing the isolated horizon degrees of freedom, while the other uses a reduced U(1) Chern-Simons theory obtained from the SU(2) theory, with appropriate constraints imposed on the spectrum of boundary states `living' on the horizon. It is shown that both these ways lead to the same infinite series asymptotic in horizon area for the microcanonical entropy of an isolated horizon. The leading area term is followed by an unambiguous correction term logarithmic in area with a coefficient $-\frac 32 $, with subleading corrections dropping off as inverse powers of the area.

40|$|From the {{analysis}} of 11 years of INPE lidar profiles and some data from the WIPM lidar, {{we find that the}} technique proposed by Gardner and Voelz (1987) for <b>gravity</b> wave parameter <b>extraction</b> does not work well at these sites. At São José dos Campos (23 ° S) and Wuhan (31 °N), Nas occurrence is very high, and the background layer is often far from a single symmetrical Gaussian, with the result that most spatial power spectra (&# 8764; 80 %) will be distorted as the given examples show. The power spectrum is used to extract wave parameters in the Gardner and Voelz (1987) technique, but this only works well for an undistorted spectrum. To solve this problem, a new method is developed. First, a connection layer is constructed, allowing the determination of approximate wave parameters and an improved background layer. The background layer parameters and the wave parameters are then used as the initial input parameters for a Levenberg-Marquardt fit, leading to a much better fitted background layer and better wave parameters. This new method achieves good agreement between simulated sodium variations and observations, as well as artificial numerically simulated observations, as shown in the examples presented in this paper.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{synthesis}} of a gama-keto ester derived from thiophene heterocycle, using simple experimental techniques and cheap and commercially available reagents. The synthesis of this compound involve several synthetic transformations, namely {{the preparation of the}} acylating reagent followed by the synthesis of a 1, 4 -dicarbonyl compound by Friedel-Crafts acylation of the thiophene. The students will have contact with several classical reactions in organic chemistry: preparation of an ester using an anhydride as precursor (alcoholysis), nucleophilic substitution (conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride) and electrophilic aromatic substitution of a heterocycle (Friedel-Crafts acylation). Several experimental techniques will be considered such as heating at reflux in anhydrous conditions, thin layer chromatograpy (TLC), <b>gravity</b> filtration, liquid-liquid <b>extraction.</b> The determination of the structure of all compounds synthesized will be also performed through 1 H NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{synthesis}} of a 5 -N,N-dialkylamino- 2, 2 ´-bithiophene {{as well as its}} 4 - and 5 ´-formyl derivatives through several synthetic transformations, namely: i) thionation of carbonyl groups of a tertiary gama-ketoamide derived from thiophene using Lawesson´s reagent followed by cyclization of the corresponding thioxoamide through intramolecular nucleophilic attack yielding the 5 -N,N-dialkylamino- 2 - 2 ´-bithiophene derivative; formylation of the bithiophene derivative using two different synthetic methodologies: ii) Vilsmeier-Haack reaction or iii) lithiation followed by electrophilic aromatic substitution. The formylation of 5 - piperidino - 2, 2 '- bithiophene via two different methods of synthesis selectively yields two different products (4 - or 5 ´-formyl derivatives), leading to a discussion concerning the selectivity of each reaction having in mind the reagents used in each method as well as the mechanism of these transformations.
