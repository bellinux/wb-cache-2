40|$|Abstract-The Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) based <b>electrical</b> <b>drive</b> {{systems are}} ideal for {{critical}} applications (aerospace, automotive, defense, medical, etc.) where the fault tolerance is a basic requirement. The phase independence characteristics of the SRM enable it to operate also under partial phase failure conditions also in its classical construction.

Then a proportional plus derivative feedback control system with disturbance observer(DOB) are employed to compensate joint coupling,unmodeled uncertainties, as well as external disturbances herein both manipulator dynamics and motor dynamics. In addition, a feed-forward control of a simple predictor was added to improve performance further.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the optimal <b>electrical</b> <b>drive</b> {{development}} system is presented. It consists of both <b>electrical</b> <b>drive</b> types: DC and AC. In order {{to implement the}} optimal control for AC drive system an Altivar 71 inverter, a Frato magnetic particle brake (as load), three-phase induction machine, and dSpace 1104 controller have been used. The on-line solution of the matrix Riccati differential equation (MRDE) is computed by dSpace 1104 controller, based on the corresponding feedback signals, generating the optimal speed reference for the AC drive system. The optimal speed reference is tracked by Altivar 71 inverter, conducting to energy reduction in AC drive. The classical control (consisting of rotor field oriented control with PI controllers) and the optimal one have been implemented by designing an adequate ControlDesk interface. The three-phase induction machine (IM) is controlled at constant flux. Therefore, the linear dynamic mathematical model of the IM has been obtained. The optimal control law provides transient regimes with minimal energy consumption. The obtained solution by integration of the MRDE is orientated towards the numerical implementation-by using a zero order hold. The development system is very useful for researchers, doctoral students or experts training in <b>electrical</b> <b>drive.</b> The experimental results are shown...|$|R
