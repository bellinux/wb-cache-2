500|$|In 352BC, Athenian troops {{successfully}} opposed Philip at Thermopylae,* E. M. Burke, [...] "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 184 (note 92). but the Macedonian {{victory over}} the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field shook Demosthenes. In 351BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist {{and member of the}} Académie française, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the First Philippic he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> him, you will soon raise up a second Philip [...] ".* G. Kennedy, [...] "Oratory", 519–520.|$|E
500|$|The game's battle system, the BliTZ system, {{is carried}} over {{directly}} from Valkyira Chronicles. During missions, players select each unit using a top-down {{perspective of the}} battlefield map: once a character is selected, the player moves the character around the battlefield in third-person. A character can only act once per-turn, but characters can be granted multiple turns {{at the expense of}} other characters' turns. Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. During gameplay, characters will call out <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> them, such as their health points (HP) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. Each character has specific [...] "Potentials", skills unique to each character. They are divided into [...] "Personal Potential", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and [...] "Battle Potentials", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique [...] "Masters Table", a grid-based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield: Kurt can activate [...] "Direct Command" [...] and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge, the character Reila can shift into her [...] "Valkyria Form" [...] and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.|$|E

Dahmer received superficial wounds and was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to Dahmer's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he may endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother retaining regular contact, Dahmer's mother, Joyce, retained regular contact with her son (although prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983). Joyce Dahmer related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, Dahmer would respond with comments to the effect of: [...] "It doesn't matter, Mom.
