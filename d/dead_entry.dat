40|$|This work {{represents}} the first detailed study using field data and flume experiments oevaluate {{the magnitude and}} pattern of meiobenthic drift in a stream, the evidence that both active and passive processes operate during entry and transport, and how meiofaunal transport instreams compares with what is currently known about the transport oflotic macrofauna nd of the meio-fauna nd larval macrofauna of marine systems. Abundances of drifting meiofauna in Goose Creek, Virginia, were extremely high (up to 250, 000 per 100 m 3) and represented {{a significant amount of}} biomass when compared to literature biomass estimates for macrobenthic drift in other warm-water streams. Drift of the dominant taxa in this tudy (rotifers, early instar chironomids, oligo-chaetes, copepods) was flow-dependent. Flume experiments examining live and <b>dead</b> <b>entry</b> pro-cesses provided evidence that a critical threshold velocity existed (- 9 -l 2 cm s-l), above which the number of animals entering the water increased dramatically. This threshold was less than the critical threshold velocity ofthe streambed substrate (- 14 - 17 cm s-l), suggesting that whenever the streambed is scoured, potentially arge numbers of meiofauna may enter the water. Despite the evidence that animals may enter the water passively due to entrainment byflow, active control over drift entry also perated since all four of the dominant axa exhibited significant increases in drift at night. These diel drift patterns were reflected in reduced streambed abundances at night for chironomids and oligochaetes butnot for copepods and rotifers. Additionally, in flume exper-iments which examined the return of live vs. dead drifting fauna to the bottom, copepods were able to influence their eturn to the bottom once in transport, a finding consistent with field observations. The downstream transport ordrift of ben-thic stream invertebrates ha been studied extensively (reviewed by Brittain a d Eike-land 1988).

40|$|Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) were {{originated}} from {{the design of}} structured peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems. A DHT provides a key-based lookup service similar to a hash table. In this paper, we present the detailed design of a new DHT protocol, Tambour. The novelty of the protocol is that it uses parallel lookup to reduce retrive latency and bounds communication overhead to a dynamically adjusted routing table. Tambour estimates the probabilities of routing entries' liveness based on statistics of node lifetime history and evicts <b>dead</b> <b>entries</b> after lookup failures. When the network is unstable, more routing entries will be evicted in a given period of time, and the routing tables will be getting smaller which minimize the number of timeouts for later lookup requests.

Results show that Tambour outperforms the compared systems in terms of bandwith cost, lookup latency and the overall efficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} the syntax and semantics for a systematic {{approach to the}} problem of analysing control-flow paths in computer programs. We give an abstract syntax and a partial correctness semantics for program control-flow paths as a generic model for path analysis and constraint derivation. This approach is formally based on a predicate transformer semantics over a boolean-valued predicate space and an abstract command language. The notions of a command, <b>dead</b> commands, the <b>entry</b> and exit conditions of a command and the inverse of a command are formally defined and investigated on the base of the semantics. A notion of command refinement is introduced capturing the abstraction process in program development from specification to implementation with partial correctness. Furthermore, command-reduction theorems and characterisations for command refinement are derived using the underlying semantics. Finally we verify the equivalence of weakest liberal precondition and strongest postcondition semantics for program commands in terms of the ordering relation they define on the command language. The approach is generic in that it is applicable to any program language that can be supplied with a predicate transformer semantics...|$|R

500|$|On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg {{conducted}} a private church {{service for the}} family and reported that Tatiana and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the <b>dead.</b> The final <b>entry</b> in Tatiana's final notebook at Yekaterinburg was a saying she had copied from {{the words of a}} well-known Russian Orthodox holy man, Father Ioann of Kronstadt: [...] "Your grief is indescribable, the Savior's grief in the Gardens of Gethsemane for the world's sins is immeasurable, join your grief to his, in it you will find consolation." [...] The following day, on 15 July, Tatiana and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was [...] "tumbled and disorderly." [...] They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Tatiana sat with her mother and read from the Biblical Books of Amos and Obadiah, Alexandra noted in her diary. Later, mother and daughter sat and just talked. As the family was having dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him {{along with the rest of}} the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated her by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|R
40|$|Prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems (also {{known as}} {{addiction}} modules), are ubiquitous genetic modules first discovered {{due to their}} role in stabilising vertical transmission of plasmids. Generally they are two-gene systems encoding a stable toxin (Tx) and an unstable antitoxin (ATx). Loss of the TA module leads to rapid ATx degradation and depletion, leaving the Tx free to interact with cellular targets and inhibit growth. For plasmid encoded TA systems, {{this leads to the}} death of plasmid free daughter cells, ensuring plasmid maintenance in a population, and gives rise to the term "addiction module". More recently, the expansion in microbial genome data has highlighted the prevalence and diversity of TA systems, and demonstrated that they are common features of many bacterial chromosomes. In addition, metagenomic surveys have pointed to the enrichment of some TA families in particular microbial ecosystems; a prime example from surveys of the human gut microbiome and RelBE TA family. Collectively, these observations indicate a wider role for TA modules in bacterial function, with numerous roles for TA systems now hypothesised. These include: i) Stabilisation of TA associated chromosomal DNA during vertical transmission; ii) Formation of "persister" cells resistant to environmental stresses, and; iii) Population level resistance to bacteriophage attack. Additionally, some Tx components have shown activity in eukaryotic cells, raising the potential for a role in prokaryote-eukaryote interaction. Here we undertook a systematic study of Type II TA systems, to provide a comprehensive assessment of their distribution and relative abundance, to confirm activity of prevalent TA systems, and to understand putative roles these may play in gut associated bacteria and the gut microbiome. A comparative genomic and metagenomic analysis of 3919 bacterial chromosomes, 4580 plasmids, 711 bacteriophage genomes, and 781 metagenomes encompassing 16 distinct habitats was conducted using all known Type II TA systems present in the Toxin Antitoxin Database (10, 100 TA genes 1 : 1 Tx:ATx). Of the 817 Type II TA system homologues found in human gut datasets, 686 were observed to have significantly higher relative abundance in the human gut microbiome over other microbial ecosystems. In parallel to these in silico findings, PCR and qPCR surveys of microbiomes from 65 stool samples obtained from healthy volunteers, as well as those with polyps or colorectal cancer, were undertaken. This demonstrated a higher ATx presence than Tx or complete module, however no differences in Tx copy number between health groups was seen. To confirm the activity of the most abundant TA system homologues identified in sequence surveys, ORFs were amplified from gut metagenomic DNA, and individual Tx or ATx cloned under the control of inducible promoters. Induction of Tx expression under normal growth conditions resulted in bacterial growth inhibition, while live <b>dead</b> staining showed <b>entry</b> into a viable but non-cultivatable state, commensurate with TA function. Experiments simulating environmental stresses encountered during colonisation of the GI tract (starvation, low pH, bile), indicated that expression of these TA systems could increase cell survival when carbon or nitrogen availability was limited (starvation). Since antibiotics are also commonly encountered by gut associated-bacteria (both as residents of the GI tract and during colonisation of other body sties) a role for gut associated TA systems in facilitating survival during antibiotic exposure was also explored. This revealed an increased number of cells surviving two hours post-treatment with β-lactams when Tx genes were expressed, and in keeping with an impact on cell growth. To test the hypothesis that TA systems may stabilize associated regions of DNA, the composition of gene neighbourhoods surrounding TA systems were also explored. ORFs surrounding TA system homologues identified in metagenomic and genomic datasets were identified using the Metagene annotator, and ORF functions predicted based on searches of the Clusters of Orthlogous Groups (COG) database. This revealed significant increases in ORFs with functions related to replication/recombination/repair and those with unknown functions. It also identified a decrease in the proportion of ORFs encoding functions such as carbohydrate and lipid transport and metabolism in regions surrounding TA systems, suggesting involvement with stabilization of mobile elements. Finally, we explored the potential for gut associated TA systems to modulate phage-microbe, and host-microbe interactions. In the case of phage-host interactions, TA systems have previously been shown to function as mediators of phage resistance at the population level, by directing cells towards a dormant state which prevents phage replication, and permits a sub-set of cells to survive phage attack. Our findings indicated the potential for gut associated TA systems to provide some degree of protection during particular host-phage interactions, but specific modules did not provide universal protection against phage. In the case of host-microbe interaction, some Type II TA system Tx components {{have been shown to be}} functional in cultured eukaryotic cells, promoting apoptosis when introduced and expressed in these cell types. However, no studies to date have examined the potential for bacterially expressed TA systems to influence eukaryotic cell health in co-culture models. To investigate this, we assessed the impact of bacterial TA system expression on the health of the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco- 2 in co-culture systems specifically focusing on cell apoptosis and necrosis whilst in the presence of Escherichia coli expressing p 22 -RelBE...|$|R
