5|$|James E. Boyd was {{promoted}} to Assistant <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station in 1954, and succeeded Calaway as director on July 1, 1957. While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article {{about the role of}} research centers at institutes of technology, which argued that research should be integrated with education, and Boyd correspondingly involved undergraduates in his research. Boyd was known for recruiting faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research; one such example is his recruitment of noted physicist and nuclear scientist Earl W. McDaniel.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cavendish Laboratory {{for over a}} decade {{at a time when it}} was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the book's initial print {{publication}} date, its editor Andrew Altman worked as Professor of Philosophy at Georgia State University and concurrently as <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics. Claire Finkelstein was the Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and concurrently as co-director of the University of Pennsylvania Institute of Law and Philosophy. Jens David Ohlin was employed as an Associate Professor of Law at Cornell Law School. Ohlin's work had been published in academic journals, including the American Journal of International Law, the Columbia Law Review, and the Harvard International Law Journal. He wrote the 2008 book Defending Humanity: When Force is Justified and Why with George Fletcher, which was also published by Oxford University Press.|$|E

5|$|Boyd was {{promoted}} to Assistant <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Engineering Experiment Station in 1954. He served {{as director of the}} station from July 1, 1957, until 1961. While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of research centers at institutes of technology, which argued that research should be integrated with education; Boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day-to-day research. Boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research. He was influential {{enough to be able to}} override the wishes of Joseph Howey, director of the School of Physics, on occasion: for example, Boyd successfully hired physicist Earl W. McDaniel in 1954 over Howey's determined opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Wigner {{accepted}} {{a position as}} the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which then had a staff of about 800. He took with him his protégés Gale Young, Katherine Way and Weinberg. Weinberg, {{who was the first}} to arrive at Oak Ridge in May 1945, became head of the Physics Division in 1946. But after the Atomic Energy Commission took over responsibility for the laboratory's operations from the Manhattan Project at the start of 1947, Wigner, feeling unsuited to a managerial role in the new environment, left Oak Ridge at the end of summer in 1947 and returned to Princeton University.|$|E

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1970, and the same year was awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship by Cornell University, where he spent one year. In 1972 he became a reader in physics at Cambridge and in 1974 a full professor, a position he held until he retired in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E

500|$|George was rumoured to have fathered several illegitimate children. James Ord (born 1786)—who {{moved to}} the United States and became a Jesuit priest—was {{reportedly}} his son by Fitzherbert. The King, late in life, told a friend {{that he had a}} son who was a naval officer in the West Indies, whose identity has been tentatively established as Captain Henry A. F. Hervey (1786–1824), reportedly George's child by the songwriter Lady Anne Lindsay (later Barnard), a daughter of the 5th Earl of Balcarres. Other reported offspring include Major George Seymour Crole, the son of theatre manager's daughter Eliza Crole or Fox; William Hampshire, the son of publican's daughter Sarah Brown; and Charles [...] "Beau" [...] Candy, the son of a Frenchwoman with that surname. Anthony Camp, <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Society of Genealogists, has dismissed the claims that George IV was the father of Ord, Hervey, Hampshire and Candy as fictitious.|$|E

Under Boyd's purview, the EES gained many electronics-related contracts, to the extent that an Electronics Division was created in 1959; it would focus on radar and communications. The establishment of research facilities was also championed by Boyd. In 1955, Van Leer had appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech's Nuclear Science Committee, which recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and a large research reactor. The $4.5 million ($ million in [...] ) Frank H. Neely Research Reactor would be completed in 1963 and would operate until 1996.|$|E
