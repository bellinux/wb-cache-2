5|$|The {{cultural}} programme of Connect UK {{consisted of}} piano recitals by Peter Donohoe, mime events by a British artist, science exhibitions {{designed by the}} British Council and international film festivals. Ganguli directed three annual international film festivals {{in different parts of}} the country. Ganguli directed the first Britain-South Pacific Museum management project. The two UK <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> visited the region to conduct the courses were from the Victoria and Albert Museum and City University.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} testifying {{on behalf}} of the state whose testimony attracted the most attention were Éric Fombonne, a psychiatrist at McGill University, Jeffrey Brent, a medical toxicologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, and Stephen Bustin of Queen Mary University of London. Other <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> testified {{on behalf of}} the state included Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist, Diane Griffin, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, Stephen Hanauer, a gastroenterologist, Christine McCusker, a pediatric immunologist, Brian Ward, a virologist who, along with Fombonne, published some research which failed to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, and Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist.|$|E
5|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, {{there were}} three stages {{in the production of}} the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified basic education needs for {{children under the age of}} six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test children on the show's effects and for review by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other <b>experts,</b> <b>who</b> were invited to a seminar. Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic groups of children, between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during a seminar, Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.|$|E

5|$|Although Italian Renaissance had {{a modest}} impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was {{influential}} in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through {{the influence of}} wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.|$|E
5|$|Dominic Fontana, a {{geographer}} at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced {{support for}} du Bellay's {{version of the}} sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern GIS analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the Mary Rose, Fontana reached {{the conclusion that the}} ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at Spitbank only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> has worked with the Mary Rose, though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse <b>experts,</b> <b>who</b> unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

5|$|In a Chess Notes feature article, Edward Winter {{showed that}} the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated. The first known game with the Budapest Gambit is Adler–Maróczy (played in Budapest in 1896). This game already {{featured}} some key aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> had witnessed the game. The Hungarians István Abonyi, Zsigmond Barász and Gyula Breyer further developed the opening. Abonyi played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser in a small tournament in Budapest. The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer in Vienna in 1917. Carl Schlechter published an optimistic analysis of the gambit in the Deutsche Schachzeitung.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel laureates are {{selected}} by the Nobel Committee for Physics, a Nobel Committee that consists of five members elected by The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In the first stage that begins in September, around 3,000 people – selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, etc. – are sent confidential forms to nominate candidates. The completed nomination forms arrive at the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the following year. These nominees are scrutinized and discussed by <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> narrow it to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates into the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics through a majority vote.|$|E
5|$|Yagan's head {{spent some}} time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to {{forensics}} <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> reconstructed a model from it. After that it was held in storage at Western Australia's state mortuary. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups. In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan's head would be reburied in November, and a Yagan Memorial Park created as a projected cost of A$996,000; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems. In March 2009, it was announced that the Department of Indigenous Affairs had given the City of Swan more than A$500,000 to develop the park.|$|E

5|$|Fort Glanville Conservation Park {{is one of}} South Australia's most {{important}} heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register and the National Trust's classified list. It is considered significant, in national historical military terms, for its association with Jervois and Scratchley; both leading British defence <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> influenced Australian defence thinking in the late 19th century. The fort was very well constructed with high quality materials; facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation. The fort is largely intact and in original condition and is, along with Bluff Battery in Hobart, the best preserved Jervois-Scratchley designed fort in Australia. It is the only Australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament, and the only to have a regular living history program. Its companion Fort Largs does survive but in greatly modified condition, converted for use as the South Australia Police academy. The fort retains its original armament; armament that is both rare in Australia and worldwide.|$|E
