During <b>equipment</b> testing, only <b>equipment</b> performance is measured and <b>equipment</b> performance is unrelated to <b>equipment</b> reliability making testing alone inadequate to produce <b>equipment</b> with 100 % reliability. A prognostic analysis converts performance measurements into an invasive usable life measurement by sharing test data used to measure <b>equipment</b> performance.
