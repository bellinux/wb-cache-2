5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found {{that the majority of}} videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

That <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible,</b> using only a compass, to find the intersection of two lines given two points on each, and to find the tangent points to circles. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not, however, <b>possible</b> to do all constructions using only a straightedge. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to do them with straightedge alone given one circle and its center.|$|R

5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations {{to the mouth of}} the river, the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In interviews, Colbert has {{described}} his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> {{to question the}} church and still be Catholic. The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent {{while he was still}} quite young.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to {{increase}} the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E

The PIAT was often also used in combat to knock out enemy positions located in houses and bunkers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to use the PIAT as a crude mortar by placing the shoulder pad of the weapon on the ground and supporting it.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} falafel is unknown and controversial. A common {{theory is that}} the dish {{originated}} in Egypt, possibly eaten by Copts as a replacement for meat during Lent. As Alexandria is a port city, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East. The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans. It has been speculated that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt.|$|E

5|$|The results {{obtained}} by the Morea scientific expedition underscored the {{need to create a}} permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to “systematically and permanently continue the work so gloriously and so happily begun by the Morea scientific expedition” due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, of a French scientific institution, {{in the form of the}} French School at Athens.|$|E

Most villages have pubs and village halls which provide the majority of the social activity.|$|E

5|$|With the {{construction}} of the extensions and connecting turnpikes, the highway was envisioned {{to be a part of}} a system of toll roads stretching from Maine to Chicago. When the Delaware River Bridge was completed in 1956, a motorist could drive from New York City to Indiana on limited-access toll roads.

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
50|$|Somewhat surprisingly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> {{to prove}} that even in rings without identity, a modular right ideal is {{contained}} in a maximal right ideal. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> for a ring without identity to lack modular right ideals entirely.|$|R
