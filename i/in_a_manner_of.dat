5|$|The {{regiment}} {{arrived in}} Washington, D.C., {{on the evening}} of May 2. There, they completed additional training and performed picket duty throughout the district. While quartered {{on the floor of the}} United States House of Representatives, the enlisted men took it upon themselves to set up a mock session, passing a law first abolishing the House of Representatives, then the Union and reconstituting both <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> their liking. The more embarrassing and lawbreaking actions by the regiment included the burning of fences, which resulted in a letter of reprimand from Brigadier General Joseph K. Mansfield along with six enlisted men being removed and sent back to New York. On May 7, the 11th New York was officially sworn into Federal service by Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell on the East Front of the unfinished Capitol in the presence of Lincoln, his son Tad and personal secretary John Hay.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} no {{standardized}} processing for the darkening of hēichá until the postwar years in the 1950s {{where there was a}} sudden surge in demand in Hong Kong, perhaps because of the concentration of refugees from the mainland. In the 1970s the improved process was taken back to Yunnan for further development, which has resulted in the various production styles variously referred to as wòduī today. This new process produced a finished product <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> months that many thought tasted similar to teas aged naturally for 10–15 years and so this period saw a demand-driven boom in the production of hēichá by the artificial ripening method.|$|E

25|$|The university, the City of Mankato and the Mankato Transit System {{coordinate}} transit {{service for}} students, staff and visitors along 8 bus lines, {{as well as}} intercity transit between Mankato and the Twin Cities on private service via Land to Air Express and Jefferson Bus Lines. The Minnesota State Student Association, the undergraduate student association at Mankato, approved in 2012 a $0.75 cent Green Transportation fee that would allow all students to pay no cost to use the bus system throughout the year. In addition to this, the student association also organizes the Maverick Shuttle a paratransit option and Stomper Express which runs exclusively at night. With the changes to the fee structure for fares, bus ridership doubled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> two years.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} his toleration of other Christian groups within his empire and in Ravenna in particular, Theodoric {{had a long}} history of {{tolerance}} {{when it came to the}} Jews of his empire and in his capital. There are numerous accounts of Jewish persecution throughout the Kingdom, all of which was dealt with <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> fairness by Theodoric. Cassiodorus tells us of these events in the letters he wrote for the King. He both allowed for the Jews of Genoa to rebuild and remodel their synagogue as well as assured them that the privileges awarded then since antiquity would remain in place. Rome and Ravenna had similar occurrences with their Jewish populations and Theodoric dealt with them accordingly. They both saw a major attack on much of their Jewish synagogues and population and in both cases Theodoric dealt with the Christians as the aggressors and requested that the attacks cease and placed blame for the attacks on them. In Ravenna, the pretense for the attack was that the Jews of the city had ridiculed Christians and even thrown holy water into the river. Theodoric responded by levying a fine on all Roman citizens of Ravenna to pay for the damages to the Jewish synagogues.|$|E
25|$|The game {{contains}} a central hub level, the Royal Train Station, and four additional levels that the player travels to through the Train Station. Each level was designed {{with a number}} of puzzles that allowed the player to approach in any order, while keeping the level size small and uncomplicated to prevent the player from becoming lost. Most of the puzzles have been designed with multiple solutions; Petty stated they wanted to cater to both the casual player, who may only want to find one of the solutions to progress in the game, and the more dedicated player, who would likely spend time to discover all of the intended solutions. This was furthered by allowing the player to freely roam through previously-completed areas to complete all the puzzles, including after completing the main story. The puzzles and challenges were designed {{to be able to be}} completed in short segments, giving the player more freedom to play it at their own pace. Petty wanted to make sure the player had time to contemplate the puzzles or explore the environment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> older adventure games, though still assured that his environments felt alive and animated. The levels themselves are designed using a mix of the Great Depression and Victorian era designs, using virtual household items such as marbles and safety pins, an inspiration that came from interest in dioramas and miniature stages. The game itself presents cutscenes with dialog in the fashion of early silent films, where a text plaque is shown to show the dialog after it is acted out and scene takes place on a theater stage.|$|E

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of procedural content tools {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind.

[...] In his review for Slant Magazine, Preston Jones characterized the song as [...] "curiously inert", adding that it sounded better as a sample on Girl Talk's 2006 mashup album Night Ripper.|$|E

500|$|In {{the body}} of the Autobiography, Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is {{seemingly}} absent: [...] "Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium". Wideman argues that Haley wrote {{the body of}} the Autobiography <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> MalcolmX's choosing and the epilogue {{as an extension of the}} biography itself, his subject having given him carte blanche for the chapter. Haley's voice in {{the body of the}} book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by MalcolmX but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of MalcolmX is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: [...] "Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told." ...|$|E

2500|$|The next hunting {{method is}} the “contour flight with short glide attack”, which is {{considered}} the most commonly utilized hunting method for golden eagles. This consists of a low-level quartering flight often at only [...] above the ground so they do not break the sky-line when observed {{from the ground and}} they can hug the contours of the earth below. This method is useful for hunting colonial (often burrowing) prey such as ground squirrels, densely populated leporids or birds found in concentrations, such as breeding grouse or even seabirds. The individual prey item is apparently selected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> seconds before the strike. If the first attempt fails, the eagle may fly around and attempt to ambush the prey again.|$|E
2500|$|Theophrastus did {{not allow}} a {{happiness}} resting merely upon virtue, or, consequently, to hold fast by the unconditional value of morality. He subordinated moral requirements to the advantage at least of a friend, and had allowed in prosperity {{the existence of an}} influence injurious to them. In later times, fault was found with his expression in the Callisthenes, [...] "life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom" [...] (...) [...] That in the definition of pleasure, likewise, he did not coincide with Aristotle, seems to be indicated by the titles of two of his writings, one of which dealt with pleasure generally, the other with pleasure as Aristotle had defined it.
