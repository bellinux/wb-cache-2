5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.|$|E

5000|$|Joint {{implementation}} (JI) is one {{of three}} flexibility mechanisms set out in the Kyoto Protocol to help countries with binding greenhouse gas emissions targets (the <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries) meet their obligations. JI is described in Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol. Under Article 6, any <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country can invest in an emission reduction project (referred to as a [...] "Joint Implementation Project") <b>in</b> any other <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically. In this way countries can lower the costs of complying with their Kyoto targets by investing in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions <b>in</b> an <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> country where reducing emissions may be cheaper, and then using the resulting Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) towards their commitment goal.|$|R

2500|$|The CDM and JI {{are called}} [...] "project-based mechanisms," [...] {{in that they}} {{generate}} emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET {{is based on the}} setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of [...] "production" [...] of emission reductions. [...] The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> Parties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} {{basis for}} providing this flexibility {{is that the}} marginal cost of reducing (or abating) emissions differs among countries. [...] "Marginal cost" [...] {{is the cost of}} abating the last tonne of -eq for an Annex I/non-Annex I Party. At the time of the original Kyoto targets, studies suggested that [...] the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall (aggregate) cost of meeting the targets. [...] Studies also showed that national losses <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> gross domestic product (GDP) could be reduced by use of the flexibility mechanisms.|$|E

[...] In the first election of the Chief Executive, the Committee consisted of only 400 members. [...] It was expanded to 800 for the second term.

[...] This is a well and carefully drafted Article; for the President could read it as statement of admission on Germany's part of moral responsibility for bringing about the war, while the Prime Minister could explain it as an admission of financial liability for the general costs of the war. Article 232 continues: [...] "The Allied and Associated Governments recognize that the resources of Germany are not adequate, after taking into account permanent diminutions of such resources which will result from other provisions of the present Treaty, to make complete reparation for all such loss and damage." [...] The President could comfort himself that this was no more than a statement of undoubted fact, and that to recognize that Germany cannot pay a certain claim does not imply that she is liable to pay the claim; but the Prime Minister could point out that in the context it emphasizes to the reader the assumption of Germany's theoretic liability asserted in the preceding Article. Article 232 proceeds: [...] "The Allied and Associated Governments, however, require, and Germany undertakes, that she will make compensation for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to their property during the period of the belligerency of each as an Allied or Associated Power against Germany by such aggression by land, by sea, and from the air, and in general all damage as defined <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I.</b> hereto."[104] The words italicized being practically a quotation from the pre-Armistice conditions, satisfied the scruples of the President, while the addition of the words [...] "and in general all damage as defined <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I.</b> hereto" [...] gave the Prime Minister a chance <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{demonstrate that}} trees in deserts are efficient carbon sinks. It remains however unknown whether the Clean Development Mechanism will accelerate the planting of trees <b>in</b> Non <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> dryland countries. We estimated {{the price of}} carbon at which a farmer would be indifferent between his customary activity and the planting of trees to trade carbon credits, along an aridity gradient. Carbon yields were simulated {{by means of the}} CO 2 FIX v 3. 1 model for Pinus halepensis with its respective yield classes along the gradient (Arid – 100 mm to Dry Sub Humid conditions – 900 mm). Wheat and pasture yields were predicted on somewhat similar nitrogen-based quadratic models, using 30 years of weather data to simulate moisture stress. Stochastic production, input and output prices were afterwards simulated on a Monte Carlo matrix. Results show that, despite the high levels of carbon uptake, carbon trading by afforesting is unprofitable anywhere along the gradient. Indeed, the price of carbon would have to raise unrealistically high, and the certification costs would have to drop significantly, to make the Clean Development Mechanism worthwhile for non <b>annex</b> <b>I</b> dryland countries farmers. From a government agency's point of view the Clean Development Mechanism is attractive. However, such agencies will find it difficult to demonstrate “additionality”, even if the rule may be somewhat flexible.
