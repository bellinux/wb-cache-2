5|$|By 1943, Japanese expansionary {{moves in}} the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) had ceased. Their advance <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea had been halted the {{previous}} year by the blocking action that Australian forces had fought along the Kokoda Track. Subsequent defeats at Milne Bay, Buna–Gona, Wau and on Guadalcanal had forced the Japanese on to the back foot. As {{a result of these}} victories, the Allies were able to seize the initiative in the region in mid-1943 and began making plans to continue to push the Japanese back in New Guinea.|$|E

These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea; throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul.|$|E

5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war, the {{decision}} was made to transfer a large number of Australian troops from the Middle East to the Pacific region. In early 1942, as the Japanese advanced through the Netherlands East Indies, the majority of the battalion was captured during the Battle of Java. A small number of the battalion's personnel returned to Australia and it was subsequently re-raised in mid-1942. It was later attached to the 6th Division as a corps unit and served <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea during the Aitape–Wewak campaign in 1944–1945. The battalion was disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E
