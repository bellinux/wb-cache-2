25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and <b>hexamethylmelamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Suppression of {{tumorigenicity}} 8 (ovarian) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the ST8 gene.This gene is located to a 300-kb segment of chromosome 6q25-27, which facilitate further efforts {{to identify a}} gene associted with ovarian cancer.The official Symbol (ST8) and the Official name Suppression of tumorigenicity 8 are maintained by the HGNC. Also known as Oncogene OVC(ovarian adenocarcinoma oncogene).The inactivation of tumor suppressor gene in ST8 gene may be crucial {{for the development of}} cancer. We examine the homologous regions in humans- the short arm of chromosome 6 for deletions in sporadic ovarian adenocarcinomas.In 91 informative sporadic tumors,34 losses their heterozygosity including some benign, low-malignant-potential and early stage tumors,suggesting that it is an early event in the development of ovarian adenocarcinoma. In different portions of chromosome 6q there were deletions and translocations which were subsequently reported by cytogenic analyses of primary ovarian carcinomas and ovarian cancer cell lines. Patients with advanced disease who achieved a complete remission documented by peritoneoscopy or laparotomy (or both) have a median survival that will exceed three years.People with ovarian adenocarcinoma were treated with four drug combination- <b>hexamethylmelamine,</b> cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil â€” with the oral alkylating agent, melphalan. Four drug combination helped in the increased overall rate in the treatment but was more toxigenic than melphalan.The four-drug regimen is more effective than melphalan in the management of advanced ovarian adenocarcinoma.|$|E

40|$|In {{two studies}} {{initiated}} in 1979 and 1981, 377 patients were treated for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. In {{the first study}} patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive Hexa-CAF (<b>hexamethylmelamine,</b> cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5 -fluorouracil) or CHAP- 5 (cyclophosphamide, <b>hexamethylmelamine,</b> doxorubicin, cisplatin for 5 days) and in the second study to receive CHAP- 5 or CP (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin on 1 day). Patients who did not respond to Hexa-CAF were offered subsequent treatment that included cisplatin. Median follow-up of patients in the first study was 9. 5 years and in the second study 7. 7 years. At 10 years 9 % of the patients initially treated with Hexa-CAF and 21 % of patients assigned to CHAP- 5 were alive. Among the 10 -year survivors treated with Hexa-CAF, 50 % had experienced progressive disease but were alive as a result of retreatment with a cisplatin regimen. The survival curves of both studies revealed that approximately 60 % of the patients who reached a complete remission were alive at 5 years and 40 % at 10 years. Patients with microscopic disease at second-look had a less favourable outlook: 35 % survived 5 years. Not recognised at first publication of both studies was the influence of tumour grade on survival. Before 5 years of follow-up, the good prognosis of grade 1 tumours (well differentiated) could not be detected. About 50 % of patients with grade 1 tumours were alive at 5 and 30 % at 10 years while these survival rates were halved for the other grades.

40|$|After a {{remarkable}} {{improvement of the}} very poor prognosis of small cell lung cancer with very simple therapy such as iv and oral cyclophosphamide the role of oral therapy has become minimal. However, since {{more than a decade}} results of combination chemotherapy are at a plateau and it is necessary to reconsider the role of simple therapy in patients without the prospect of cure. Oral therapy might be worthwhile because it is probably less effecting {{the quality of life of}} the patient and makes it unnecessary to visit the hospital frequently. All drugs available for oral use with known activity against small cell lung cancer are reviewed. The best example of the success of oral therapy is etoposide, other candidates that need to be tested in a modern way are oral cyclophosphamide and <b>hexamethylmelamine.</b> New concepts of prolonged chemotherapy and dose-intensity are easier evaluated by using oral drugs.

40|$|Summary PMM is a {{water-soluble}} {{alternative to}} HMM. PMM has been administered as an intravenous infusion to 17 {{patients in a}} Phase I clinical trial. The dose-limiting toxicities were nausea and vomiting which were observed in all patients at 500 mgm- 2 and above. The dose was not escalated above 1300 mg m 2 where nausea and vomiting were severe, prolonged (> 24 h) and poorly controlled by anti-emetics. Haematological, hepatic and renal toxicities were not observed. Neurological toxicity was not observed at low doses (< 500 mg/M 2) but could not be determined at higher doses due to intensive anti-emetic therapy. Pharmacokinetic studies (100 - 500 mgm- 2) indicated that PMM plasma levels are dose-dependent and that the PMM disposition-phase half-life is prolonged in patients with abnormal liver function. It is concluded that the severe toxicity of PMM will limit the clinical utility of this compound and hence Phase II trials are not recommended. Pentamethylmelamine (PMM) (Figure la) is the monodemethylated analogue of <b>hexamethylmelamine</b> (HMM) (Figure lb). HMM is an s-triazine derivative {{which has been in}} clinical use for 15 years.

40|$|Two {{different}} techniques [reduction of a tetrazolium derivative (MTT) and 3 HTdR uptake assays] {{were compared}} {{in order to}} evaluate the cytotoxic effects of different chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. The cytotoxicities of Melphalan, <b>hexamethylmelamine</b> and seven derivatives, and daunorubicin were measured on P 388 D 1 mouse macrophage-like cell line, RC mouse renal carcinoma cell line, and B 16 mouse melanoma cell lines. Growth inhibition was determined after one hour as well as after continuous (48 hours) exposure to drugs. The IC 50 was calculated using an appropriate algorithm (FADHA) which allowed within and between run variabilities {{to be taken into}} account. Optimal conditions had to be elucidated for culture conditions before assay: number of cells/well and assay duration for each line. The MTT and 3 HTdR uptake assays were found to be similar in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility, both for adherent and floating cell lines. However, the MTT assay has the advantages of low cost and time saving. It also avoids problems related to radioactivity manipulation and counting. Both techniques rank the same chemicals as active or inactive. The algorithm Fadha was found to be a very powerful mathematical tool for comparing the IC 50 values obtained by both assays.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficacy}} of consolidation therapy with <b>hexamethylmelamine</b> (HMM) in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Patients treated at our hospital between January 1997 and November 2006 and in documented clinical complete response from advanced ovarian cancer following front-line platinum-based therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The patients treated with HMM were compared to the patients of matched counterpart without consolidation therapy. Of 102 patients enrolled, 49 were treated with HMM and 53 received no consolidation treatment. For patients with HMM and observed patients, the mean age were 54. 6 and 55. 6 yr; the distribution of stage was similar (P= 0. 977); the optimal surgery was performed in 36 (73. 5 %) and 44 (83 %) (P= 0. 336); the recurrence rate were 27 (55. 1 %) and 33 (62. 3 %) (P= 0. 463); and the median progression-free survival were 38 months and 21 months for patients with HMM and observed patients (P= 0. 235). No treatment-related adverse events were reported during the followup period. Although this study failed to show the significant survival benefit of consolidation therapy with HMM in patients with advanced EOC, we consider that our study can contribute data to investigate the effectiveness of consolidation therapy in epithelial ovarian cancer...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{concept of}} using either {{alternating}} or sequential combination chemotherapy with non-cross-resistant com-binations was {{tested in a}} randomized trial including 301 previously untreated patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The sequential schedule consisted of CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5 -fluorouracil) followed by PH (cisplatin, <b>hexamethylmelamine)</b> in nonresponders, CAF-> PH (n = 157), and the alternating regimen consisted of CAF/PH (n = 144). With a median observation time of 54 months, {{no statistically significant differences}} were found be-tween the pathologically complete response (PCR) rates of 17 % and 16 %, respectively, nor were there any statistical dif-ferences in median disease-free survival for PCR patients (CAF-> PH 34 + months and CAF/PH 26 + months), in overall survival (28 and 24 months, respectively), or in time to treatment failure (10 and 11 months). The overall estimated cure rate was 13 %. An equal degree of myelosuppression was seen with the two regimens, whereas neuro- and nephrotoxicity were more pronounced when PH was given sequentially to CAF than with the alternating schedule. We conclude that the sequential and the alternated use of doxorubicin- and platinum-based regimens yield equivalent results and that other ap-proaches should be investigated to improve treatment effects.

40|$|Between April 1981 and June 1985, 195 {{patients}} with ovarian cancer, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stages IIB, IIC, III, and IV, entered a trial {{that consisted of}} surgery and chemotherapy with cisplatin (P) and melphalan (PAM) with or without <b>hexamethylmelamine</b> (HexaPAMP or PAMP regimens) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. Because the intent was to study the outcome by treatment after evaluation of first-line chemotherapy, patients were evaluable only if the response was assessed by a second-look operation or if measurable disease progression was documented. One hundred fifty-eight patients (81 %) were evaluable for response. Forty-five (28 %) achieved pathologically confirmed complete remissions (pCR), and 24 of these patients received whole-abdominal radiation (WAR) for consolidation of response. Five {{patients with}} complete remission after WAR relapsed, as did nine of the 21 with complete remission who had not undergone WAR. The 3 -year time to progression percentage (TTP +/- SE) from second-look operation was 70 % +/- 7 % for all patients who achieved pCR, 83 % +/- 8 % for those who received WAR, and 49 % +/- 15 % {{for those who did}} not receive WAR (this was not a randomized comparison). The 3 -year TTP percentage for the 49 partial responders was 21 % +/- 6 %, identical for the 19 who had WAR and the 30 who had no radiation therapy.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{potential}} interest of replacing the murine cell lines by human cell lines for in vitro cytotoxic assays, the sensitivity and the selectivity of the murine B 16 and the human HBL melanomas to five chemotherapeutic drugs were investigated in vitro. The cytotoxicities of Melphalan, Daunorubicin (DNR), <b>Hexamethylmelamine</b> (HMM), Hydroxymethylpentamethylmelamine (HMPMM), and Dihydroxymethyltetramethylmelamine (DHTMM), 2 HMM derivatives, were measured in the two cell lines using two different techniques: reduction of a tetrazolium derivative (MTT) and tritiated thymidine uptake into DNA. The cytotoxicity at inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50) was determined after one hour as well as after 2 days exposure of cell after one hour as well as after 2 days exposure of cells to each drug. The {{results indicate that the}} HBL human melanoma was generally more sensitive to Melphalan and DHTMM than the B 16 murine melanoma cells as far as the IC 50 was concerned. In contrast, no difference of sensitivity was found to DNR and DHTMM. HMM was found to be inactive in both cell lines. The analysis of variance on IC 50 values showed that the sensitivity of murine and human melanoma cell lines to drugs was statistically different. Despite the identical selectivity of the two cell lines, two promising observations can be made as far as the comparison of the two cell lines is concerned: 1) the higher sensitivity of HBL human cell line to Melphalan in the in vitro assays and 2) the slightly lower sensitivity of HBL to DNR, a drug without clinical activity against human melanoma.
