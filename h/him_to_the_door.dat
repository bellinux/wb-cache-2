2500|$|Returning to {{his home}} at Head of Coosa late at night, Ross saw a man he did not {{recognize}} at his house. He told the man to feed his horse and put him away for the night. Instead, the stranger followed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> [...] identified himself as Stephen Carter and told Ross that he now owned the property and had papers to prove it. Ross then learned agents of Georgia had given Carter possession of the house earlier in the week, after evicting his family. Dispossessed by Georgia (and Carter), Ross was now homeless. The next day, Ross found that family members had given his wife Quatie refuge.|$|E
2500|$|He later {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to an event: on 2 July 1505, he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home. During a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck near him. Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment, he cried out, [...] "Help! Saint Anna, I will become a monk!" [...] He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break. He left law school, sold his books, and entered St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the Black Cloister. [...] "This day you see me, and then, not ever again," [...] he said. His father was furious over {{what he saw as}} a waste of Luther's education.|$|E
2500|$|At 17:00, Mussolini, {{dressed in}} a blue suit and a soft grey hat, and escorted by several cars bearing agents of the [...] "presidenziale" [...] (which halted outside the villa), arrived at the Villa Savoia. He brought with him {{the law of the}} Grand Council, the OdG Grandi and the letter of Cianetti. The King awaited him {{at the foot of the}} patio stair of the villa. The Duce started to speak, trying to {{convince}} Victor Emmanuel that the OdG had no legal value, and that many of its supporters had changed their minds in the night. The King interrupted him, and told him softly that the country was broken and that the situation required him to quit his post: the new President of the Council of Ministers would be Marshal Badoglio. Mussolini, visibly shaken, answered: [...] "Then is it over? It is over, it is over. But what will happen to me, to my family?". The King assured him that he would personally take care of his security and that of his family. Victor Emmanuel accompanied <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> where he met Captain Vigneri. The Duce went to his car, but the captain told him to go to a nearby ambulance, for his security. Mussolini answered that there was no need for that, but followed the captain. When the rear door opened, he saw three Carabinieri and three policemen sitting on the side banks, and said: [...] "The policemen too? No!" [...] but the captain took his left elbow and led him into the ambulance, which then left the villa's park and rushed through the streets of Rome until reaching the [...] "Podgora" [...] army barracks in Trastevere. After one hour, he was moved to the [...] "Legnano" [...] Carabinieri barracks, in Prati.|$|E
50|$|As most of {{his youth}} days were spend playing {{different}} musical instruments and singing different types of traditional and pop-songs, this took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> Institute of Arts in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. However, he graduated as an actor of drama rather than singer or musician. Nevertheless, he has maintained his commitment to and love of singing.|$|R
60|$|Clayton said {{he would}} in a minute, and asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> shut <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{walked with}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open <b>door,</b> outside which <b>the</b> servant was waiting <b>to</b> show <b>him</b> downstairs.|$|R
60|$|But Hogan never answered. He strode past <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and flung}} it wide.|$|E
60|$|Wingrave rose {{to go in}} a few minutes. Juliet {{walked with}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> 'What an uncivil {{thing to}} say!' she murmured in surprise.|$|E
60|$|Poor Kookooskoos! {{they shot}} him next night {{on his watch}} tower, and nailed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp <b>door</b> as a warning.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} house not far distant, {{and getting the}} sleigh, Mr. Sumner placed Hal's form into it, and drove <b>him</b> around <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Excitement {{seems to}} have turned your brain, M. de Marmont," [...] was all that Crystal said, and she walked {{straight}} past <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carriage <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|And, {{by making}} Dawes edge {{away from his}} own close proximity, he worked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Take {{him to the}} {{forecastle}} [he flings <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with {{a strength}} beyond his years].|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chatterton {{smiled a}} little, and, {{reminding}} {{her husband that}} the book was in his pocket, followed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|George {{followed}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>door</b> {{and then}} did a thing that nobody had seen him do before; he burst out into a loud laugh.|$|R
60|$|So {{they saw}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bailey <b>door,</b> beyond which he {{declined}} further assistance, saying he could tumble into bed alone, and leaving {{them to their}} pleasant task of making propriety.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, sir, I cannot. Pray, your Honour, come here, I have {{something}} to say;" [...] and she drew <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open <b>door</b> of his justice- room, called the gun-room.|$|R
60|$|She saw <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The carman was {{stamping}} up {{and down}} the footpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself.|$|E
60|$|Foster {{thanked him}} and took his leave, but as the man went before <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> the girl made a sign.|$|E
6000|$|... [MALMESBURY accompanies <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and PITT {{walks away}} [...] disquietedly towards Whitehall, {{the other two}} {{regarding}} him [...] as he goes.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hear him," [...] replied Jimmy calmly. [...] "I'm {{waiting for}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for me <b>to</b> go out. It {{will be much}} easier than {{squeezing}} through that hole." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jim Leonard was {{too scared}} to speak, and Pony's father hauled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house <b>door,</b> and holloed in to Pony's mother: [...] "I've got Jim Leonard here, Lucy"; and she holloed back: ...|$|R
60|$|She colored {{slightly}} and, {{without looking}} at <b>him,</b> moved slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and disappeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} at once arose and left. Hardwick saw <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and then}} sat down near a desk in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He drew me with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{while they}} brought his horse--a lean roan, taller than my Swallow here, {{but not so}} well girthed.|$|E
60|$|Sophy {{walked with}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and waited while {{he took his}} hat and gloves from the hat-stand. Suddenly she laid her hand upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had risen}} and pushed by <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>door,</b> though {{he tried to}} keep her. [...] "Don't be rash," [...] he urged. [...] "I advise you to take time to think of this--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he's a wise man," [...] said Ferris with bitterness, [...] "and {{knows when}} to time his visits." [...] Mrs. Vervain {{did not notice}} his bitterness, but {{something}} made Florida follow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{held his}} hand out, but Ailly Blake shrank away from <b>him</b> and pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{pleasure}} was abruptly quenched. Billy Windsor, {{placing a}} firm {{hand on his}} collar, led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and pushed him out, {{closing the door behind}} him.|$|E
6000|$|The general {{turned on}} his heel directly, and beckoned contemptuously to Danville to follow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> When they were well out of ear-shot, he spoke these words: ...|$|E
60|$|A loud shriek {{prevented}} a response. Phyllis, {{who had taken}} her brother by the ear to lead <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> let him go to clasp her injured self.|$|E
60|$|A muffled cry and a crash caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> again slam <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and withdraw.|$|R
60|$|A {{glance over}} a rising ground sufficed <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> boy turn sharp round and take to his heels. He was remarkably swift of foot. A few minutes brought <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cottage <b>door,</b> which he burst open.|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> A man {{was seated}} {{at the wheel of}} the motor car, and turned his head quickly as they approached. Mr. Fielding nodded pleasantly, though his face was white with excruciating pain.|$|R
