40|$|It {{is thought}} that the Moon accreted from the protolunar disk that was {{assembled}} after the last giant impact on Earth. Due to its high temperature, the protolunar disk may act as a thermochemical reactor in which the material is processed before being incorporated into the Moon. Outstanding issues like devolatilisation and istotopic evolution {{are tied to the}} disk evolution, however its lifetime, dynamics and thermodynamics are unknown. Here, we numerically explore the long term viscous evolution of the protolunar disk using a one dimensional model where the different phases (vapor and condensed) are vertically stratified. Viscous heating, radiative cooling, phase transitions and gravitational instability are accounted for whereas Moon s accretion is not considered for the moment. The viscosity of the gas, liquid and solid phases dictates the disk evolution. We find that (1) the vapor condenses into liquid in about 10 years, (2) a large fraction of the disk mass flows inward forming a hot and compact liquid disk between 1 and 1. 7 <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>radii,</b> a region where the liquid is gravitationally stable and can accumulate, (3) the disk finally solidifies in 1000 to 100, 000 years. Viscous heating is never balanced by radiative cooling. If the vapor phase is abnormally viscous, due to magneto-rotational instability for instance, most of the disk volatile components are transported to Earth leaving a disk enriched in refractory elements. This opens a way to form a volatile-depleted Moon and would suggest that the missing Moon s volatiles are buried today into the Earth. The disk cooling timescale may be long enough to allow for planet-disk isotopic equilibration. However large uncertainties on the disk physics remain because of the complexity of its multi-phased structure. Comment: Accepted for publication in ICARU...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{is present}} in various forms in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> upper mantle (carbonate- or diamond-bearing mantle xenoliths, {{carbonatite}} magmas, CO 2 emissions from volcanoes [...] .). Moreover, there is enough carbon in chondritic material to stabilize carbonates into the mantles of Mars or Venus {{as well as in}} the Earth. However, the interactions with iron have to be constrained, because Fe is commonly thought to buffer oxygen fugacity into planetary mantles. [1] and [2] show evidences of the stability of clinopyroxene Ca(Mg,Fe) Si 2 O 6 + magnesite (Mg,Fe) CO 3 in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle around 6 GPa (about 180 km). The stability of oxidized forms of carbon (like magnesite) depends on the oxygen fugacity of the system. In the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle, the maximum carbon content is 10000 ppm [3]. The fO 2 parameter varies vertically as a function of pressure, but also laterally because of geodynamic processes like subduction. Thus, carbonates, graphite, diamond, C-rich gases and melts are all stable forms of carbon in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle. [4] show that the fO 2 variations observed in SNC meteorites can be explained by polybaric graphite-CO-CO 2 equilibria in the Martian mantle. [5] inferred from thermodynamic calculations that the stable form of carbon in the source regions of the Martian basalts should be graphite (and/or diamond). After [6], a metasomatizing agent like a CO 2 -rich melt may infiltrate the mantle source of nakhlites. However, according to [7] and [8], the FeO wt% value in the Martian bulk mantle is more than twice that of the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle (KLB- 1 composition by [9]).

40|$|There are {{currently}} several hypotheses {{on the origin}} of volatile siderophile elements in the Earth. One hypothesis is that they were added during <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> accretion and core formation and mobilized into the metallic core [1], others claim multiple stage origin [2], while some hypothesize that volatiles were added after the core already formed [3]. Several volatile siderophile elements are depleted in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle relative to the chondrites, something which continues to puzzle many scientists. This depletion is likely due to a combination of volatility and core formation. The <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> core is composed of Fe and some lighter constituents, although the abundances of these lighter elements are unknown [4]. Si is one of these potential light elements [5] although few studies have analyzed the effect of Si on metal-silicate partitioning, in particular the volatile elements.

The metal-silicate partition coefficients of these elements will be measured to determine the effect of Si. Partition coefficients depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and metal and silicate composition and can constrain the concentrations of volatile, siderophile elements found in the mantle.

40|$|A {{stunning}} red sunset or purple sunrise is {{an aesthetic}} treat with a scientific explanation: The colors are {{a direct result}} of the absorption or reflectance of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols, minute particles (either solid or liquid) in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere that occur both naturally and because of human activity. At the beginning or end of the day, the Sun s rays travel farther through the atmosphere to reach an observer s eyes and more green and yellow light is scattered, making the Sun appear red. Sunset and sunrise are especially colorful when the concentration of atmospheric particles is high. This ability of aerosols to absorb and reflect sunlight is not just pretty; it also determines the amount of radiation and heat that reaches the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface, and can profoundly affect climate. In the atmosphere, aerosols are also important as nuclei for the condensation of water droplets and ice crystals. Clouds with fewer aerosols cannot form as many water droplets (called cloud particles), and consequently, do not scatter light well. In this case, more sunlight reaches the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface. When aerosol levels in clouds are high, however, more nucleation points can form small liquid water droplets. These smaller cloud particles can reflect up to 90 percent of visible radiation to space, keeping the heat from ever reaching <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface. The tendency for these particles to absorb or reflect the Sun s energy - called extinction by astronomers - depends on a number of factors, including chemical composition and the humidity and temperature in the surrounding air; because cloud particles are so small, they are affected quickly by minute changes in the atmosphere. Because of this sensitivity, atmospheric scientists study cloud particles to anticipate patterns and shifts in climate. Until recently, NASA s study of atmospheric aerosols and cloud particles has been focused primarily on satellite images, which, while granting large-scale atmospheric analysis, limited scientists ability to acquire detailed information about individual particles. Now, experiments with specialized equipment can be flown on standard jets, making it possible for researchers to monitor and more accurately anticipate changes in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere and weather patterns...|$|R

And the field strength needed to fend off battering by solar coronal mass ejections is decreasing, just when the delicate complexity of modem, vulnerable, electro-technological systems is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Recently, a working group of distinguished scientist from across the nation has asked NASA's Solid Earth and Natural Hazards program a key question: What are the dynamics of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> {{magnetic field}} and its interactions with the Earth system? Paleomagnetic studies of crustal rocks magnetized in the geologic past reveal that polarity reversals have occurred many times during <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> history. Networked super-computer simulations of core field and flow, including effects of gravitational, pressure, rotational Coriolis, magnetic and viscous forces, suggest how this might happen in detail. And space-based measurements of the real, time-varying magnetic field help constrain estimates of the speed and direction of fluid iron flowing {{near the top of}} the core and enable tests of some hypotheses about such flow. Now scientists at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center have developed and applied methods to test the hypotheses of narrow scale flow and of a dynamically weak magnetic field near the top of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> core. Using two completely different methods, C. V. Voorhies has shown these hypotheses lead to specific theoretical forms for the "spectrum" of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> main magnetic field and the spectrum of its rate of change.
