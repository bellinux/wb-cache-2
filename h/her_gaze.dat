5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
25|$|The ghost floats, footless {{and with}} arms bent {{up at the}} elbows as is {{customary}} for ghost images of the period, in flames above a grassy field. Her head is framed by pine boughs. She stares off to the right, <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> following her outstretched right arm. Covering {{the palm of her}} right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel. Peaking out over her right shoulder is the brown feathered fletching of a single arrow.|$|E
25|$|Osome {{appears in}} a moment of tension. It is night and she is leaving the grounds of her home. In {{contrast}} with the complete darkness of the house behind her, she carries a lit lantern and wears a dark but colourful patterned kimono. Beyond the figure of Osome herself, there is very little detail. The ground is made up of yellow horizontal lines on a brown background, and the sky is coloured with the bokashi technique of colour gradation, darkening from light grey to black as it reaches the top edge of the print. Osome looks up to her left with an uneasy facial expression, <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> resting somewhere beyond the right border of the print.|$|E

25|$|Mona Lisa has no {{clearly visible}} eyebrows or eyelashes. Some {{researchers}} {{claim that it}} was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered unsightly. In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps {{as a result of}} overcleaning. Cotte discovered the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made {{to the size of the}} Mona Lisa's face and the direction of <b>her</b> <b>gaze.</b> He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.|$|E
25|$|In Greek mythology snakes {{are often}} {{associated}} with deadly and dangerous antagonists, {{but this is not}} to say that snakes are symbolic of evil; in fact, snakes are a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as 'earthbound'. The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with <b>her</b> <b>gaze.</b> After killing her, Perseus gave her head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are also depicted in art with snakes instead of legs and feet for the same reason—they are children of Gaia and Uranus, so they are bound to the earth.|$|E
25|$|Rome was now {{the undisputed}} {{mistress}} of the Western Mediterranean, and turned <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> from defeated Carthage to the Hellenistic world. Small Roman forces had already been engaged in the First Macedonian War, when, in 214 BC, a fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus had successfully thwarted Philip V from invading Illyria with his newly built fleet. The rest {{of the war was}} carried out mostly by Rome's allies, the Aetolian League and later the Kingdom of Pergamon, but a combined Roman-Pergamene fleet of ca. 60 ships patrolled the Aegean until the war's end in 205 BC. In this conflict, Rome, still embroiled in the Punic War, was not interested in expanding her possessions, but rather in thwarting the growth of Philip's power in Greece. The war ended in an effective stalemate, and was renewed in 201 BC, when Philip V invaded Asia Minor. A naval battle off Chios ended in a costly victory for the Pergamene-Rhodian alliance, but the Macedonian fleet lost many warships, including its flagship, a deceres. Soon after, Pergamon and Rhodes appealed to Rome for help, and the Republic was drawn into the Second Macedonian War. In view of the massive Roman naval superiority, the war was fought on land, with the Macedonian fleet, already weakened at Chios, not daring to venture out of its anchorage at Demetrias. After the crushing Roman victory at Cynoscephalae, the terms imposed on Macedon were harsh, and included the complete disbandment of her navy.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone {{described}} the video {{as the second}} most NSFW from the whole album. An editor from the website Consequence of Sound described Beyoncé's dancing as an R-rated version of Bo Derek's role in the film 10 (1978). In her review, Toronto Stars Malene Arpe called the video [...] "porny". HitFix reviewer Whitney Phaneuf felt that Beyoncé was looking in the camera with pure lust concluding that when Jay-Z appears later, [...] "it's clear that <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> has been fixed on him". Claire Lobenfeld from Complex felt that the pair [...] "get wet and wild" [...] in the video further elaborating, [...] "For an album that is rooted in love, marriage, and sex, unleashing a video featuring {{her and her husband}} frolicking euphorically on the beach is the best first taste." [...] Slates Forrest Wickman called the clip one of the simplest on the album and noted, [...] "It's not the album's peak, musically or visually, but unconstrained by heavy choreography... it legitimately looks like they're having fun." [...] Maura Johnston of Spin placed the video at number 5 on the magazine's list of the best music videos in 2013 saying that it was a [...] "worthy addition" [...] to the collaborations between Beyoncé and Jay-Z.|$|E
2500|$|The woman sits {{markedly}} {{upright in}} a [...] "pozzetto" [...] armchair {{with her arms}} folded, a sign of her reserved posture. <b>Her</b> <b>gaze</b> is fixed on the observer.

2500|$|The {{left-hand}} wing shows Mary {{dressed in}} a violet-white robe, looking at the infant Christ as he returns <b>her</b> <b>gaze.</b> Beside them a seated Saint Joseph is dressed in red with a long head-dress, dozing as he leans on a staff. The hem of Mary's robe is inscribed in golden script containing text from the [...] "Canticle of Mary" [...] of Luke 1:46–48.; My soul doth magnify the Lord.... This panel was long {{assumed to be a}} Nativity until described by art historian Erwin Panofsky as a simple representation of the Holy Family. The accompanying reliefs show moments of the Life of Christ; key events from his infancy to the Presentation at the Temple.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1994 {{an image}} became visible {{on a wall}} behind the altar of a 137-year-old Anglican stone church in Yankalilla, South Australia. The image was {{interpreted}} as Mary's face, shoulders, and abdomen. The image supposedly depicts her holding the crucified Christ {{in the manner of}} a pietà. <b>Her</b> <b>gaze</b> is directed toward the tabernacle below, which contains the consecrated eucharistic bread. It is also claimed that an image of a rose appeared at the bottom of the larger image. In December 1996, the Bishop of The Murray blessed the church as [...] "The Shrine of Our Lady of Yankalilla" [...] and it has become a popular pilgrimage site for Australian Anglicans.|$|E
2500|$|Olympia's body {{as well as}} <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly {{looks out}} as her servant offers flowers {{from one of her}} male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the {{reference}} to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's [...] "shamelessly flexed" [...] left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus. Likewise, the alert black cat {{at the foot of the}} bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} shows a half-length figure, {{the body}} of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but her face turned toward her left. <b>Her</b> <b>gaze</b> is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound {{on either side of her}} face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not looking down at the floor as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E
2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking {{out of the corner of}} her eye, as if watching David; in the present version <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> is softened, in the general direction of her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E

2500|$|Art is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a young female figure wearing a floor-length tunic underneath an intricately tied outer garment, which is pinned at her proper left shoulder with a fibula. The outer garment is belted at the sculpture's upper and lower waist and is approximately two inches shorter than the tunic. The skirts of both the tunic and outer garment fall towards {{the floor in a}} multitude of folds. It is crossed diagonally over her shoulder blades and loosely gathered on her proper right chest, exposing her neck and breastbone. The statue's hair is parted in the middle and pulled back from her face into a twisted bun, and a crown of laurel leaves is nestled atop her head. <b>Her</b> <b>gaze</b> is directed forwards and her features are idealized, like the other female figures of the sculpture group with the exception of Justice. In her proper left hand, she carries a round palette held down at her side, and in her proper right hand, a paintbrush held in front of her at waist height. She stands with her weight on both feet, with her proper right foot extended slightly forward of her proper left. There are several dots of an unknown black substance on the marble base underneath her feet, in front of her proper left foot. There is no discernible foundry mark or signature, but the statue is identified by the black label attached to the cement pedestal underneath her feet, which reads [...] "ART" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E
2500|$|After {{wrapping}} Paul's {{body in a}} rug {{and cleaning}} up evidence of the murder and of his own presence in the apartment, Edward hears Connie leaving a message on Paul's answering machine, saying she must end the affair. Edward erases all the messages and leaves, putting Paul's body {{in the trunk of}} his car. Edward joins his wife at Charlie's school play, and late that night while Connie is sleeping, drives to a landfill and dumps Paul's body. In the ensuing days, Paul's murder plagues Edward, who is unable to stop thinking about what he has done. When two NYPD detectives arrive at the Sumner home while Edward is at work, they explain to Connie that Paul's estranged wife had reported him missing, and that they found Connie's name and phone number on his desk. Connie claims she barely knows him and that she was interested in buying books from him. A week later, the detectives return and tell Connie and Edward that Paul's body has been discovered. When police ask Connie how she met Paul, she replies that they met at a Juilliard fundraiser. To Connie's surprise, Edward corroborates her story. The detectives ask if Connie has ever been to Paul's apartment, and Connie denies even being in the Soho neighborhood any time recently. However, the police tell her that she had in fact received a parking ticket in front of Paul's apartment just a month earlier. Connie replies that she forgot about a day that she met friends for coffee at a Soho café. Several days later, Connie finds the investigator's photos of her and Paul when she takes Edward's clothes to the drycleaner, and realizes that Edward knows about the affair. That night, during a party at their home, Connie notices that the snow globe has been returned to their collection. Connie looks over at Edward, he meets <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> knowingly, and she realizes that Edward murdered Paul.|$|E
2500|$|The snake or serpent {{has played}} a {{powerful}} symbolic role in different cultures. In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra adorned the crown of the pharaoh. It was worshipped {{as one of the}} gods and was also used for sinister purposes: murder of an adversary and ritual suicide (Cleopatra). In Greek mythology snakes are associated with deadly antagonists, as a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as earthbound. The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with <b>her</b> <b>gaze.</b> After killing her, Perseus gave her head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are depicted in art with their legs replaced by bodies of snakes for the same reason: They are children of Gaia, so they are bound to the earth. In Hinduism, snakes are worshipped as gods, with many women pouring milk on snake pits. The cobra is seen on the neck of Shiva, while Vishnu is depicted often as sleeping on a seven-headed snake or within the coils of a serpent. There are temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called Nagraj (King of Snakes), and it is believed that snakes are symbols of fertility. In the annual Hindu festival of Nag Panchami, snakes are venerated and prayed to. In religious terms, the snake and jaguar are arguably the most important animals in ancient Mesoamerica. [...] "In states of ecstasy, lords dance a serpent dance; great descending snakes adorn and support buildings from Chichen Itza to Tenochtitlan, and the Nahuatl word coatl meaning serpent or twin, forms part of primary deities such as Mixcoatl, Quetzalcoatl, and Coatlicue." [...] In Christianity and Judaism, a serpent appears in Genesis to tempt Adam and Eve with the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.|$|E
