5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its <b>industrial</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Firms within {{industrial}} clusters {{are subject}} to challenges such as globalization, limited resources, volatility of international markets and financial instabilities. 4 th party logistics (4 PL) service providers are supporting individual firms to overcome such challenges by using collaborative operational capabilities from within an industrial cluster to their enhance competitiveness. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to focus on China and proposes a collaborative operational capabilities framework to illustrate the role of 4 PL in <b>industrial</b> cluster <b>competitiveness.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows an extensive literature review and structured interviews in two types of clusters, drawing on resource-based view and importance-performance matrix analysis. Findings – The paper proposes six elements (that is, synergy of logistics, expansion of industrial chain, financial ability, creativity and innovation ability, cooperation of companies and flexibility of supply chain) that comprise collaborative operational capabilities, and highlights the role of “creativity and innovation ability” and “supply chain flexibility” in the use of 4 PL for <b>industrial</b> cluster <b>competitiveness</b> in Chinese context. Research limitations/implications – The paper focusses on China and hence it could also be tested in the developed countries’ context with the support of large-scale empirical data to investigate further its usefulness and to identify other constraints. Originality/value – The study contributes to the 4 PL literature in that it proposes a framework that extrapolates the importance of 4 PL in <b>industrial</b> cluster <b>competitiveness</b> in China...|$|R
