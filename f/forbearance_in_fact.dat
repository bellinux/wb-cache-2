40|$|Forbearance is a {{practice}} of granting concessions to troubled borrowers, typically {{in the form of}} prolongation of maturity of refinancing of the loan.

This paper provides the first empirical analysis of <b>forbearance</b> <b>in</b> Europe, using the adjustment of nonperforming exposures due to the asset quality review (AQR) and the associated increase in required provisions as measures of forbearance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 examine the ex-ante motivation and the ex-post impact of securitization. Departing from the traditional literature of bank-specific drivers for securitization, I investigate the tax incentive for securitization in a cross country setting. In addition, unlike the prior micro studies of the impacts of securitization, for instance, the adverse selection in the securitization market and so forth, I study the macro impact of securitization on real economy. Another strand of my research focuses on banking regulation, especially macroprudential regulation. I am particularly interested <b>in</b> the <b>fact</b> that banks may ex-ante take risk in anticipation of regulatory <b>forbearance</b> <b>in</b> a systemic banking crisis and its implication for macroprudential regulation. Consequently, chapter 4 analyzes systemic risk-taking at banks {{in the presence of}} “too-manyto-fail” bailout guarantee. In sum, shedding light on securitization and systemic risk-taking in the banking sector, this dissertation contributes to the policy debate on bank regulation...|$|R
40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the risks of}} contagion from problems arising in the banking sector, many countries operate some form of banking sector safety net. Such safety nets generally involve a judicious mixture of transparency and ambiguity. This ambiguity may be important to counter moral hazard effects but may lead to excessive <b>forbearance</b> <b>in</b> the face of banking problems. While the scope for ambiguity has been declining, some ambiguity in the handling of individual institutions remains. In any case, ex post transparency is essential for reviewing the propriety of any assistance and preserving the authorities’ future reputation and policy credibility. ...|$|R
40|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{aimed to}} “provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory {{national}} policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies {{and services to}} all Americans…. ” Key to the Federal Communication Commission’s ability to satisfy this deregulatory mandate is Section 10 of the 1996 Act which provides the agency with express legal authority to forbear from enforcing certain portions of the Communications Act. In this paper, we use the agency’s Phoenix Forbearance Order as a template for outlining how the Commission can improve its forbearance analysis. Our analysis focuses on forbearance from the unbundling provisions in the 1996 Act, but we also show how the Phoenix Forbearance Order is relevant to the net neutrality debate. In particular, the Phoenix Forbearance Order rejects the validity of <b>forbearance</b> <b>in</b> the presence of either monopoly or duopolistic competition. Given the Commission’s finding that Broadband Service Providers are “terminating monopolists,” forbearance cannot {{be used to create}} what is colloquially referred to as “Title II Lite. ” <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> if the retail broadband service is classified as a Title II service, then the Commission’s stance on broadband competition and the Phoenix Forbearance Order’s conclusions on duopolistic competition likely requires, for the first time, the price regulation of all retail broadband connections...|$|R

This paper {{analyzes}} {{inspection and}} closure policies of a bank, and the strategic reaction of its managers/shareholders {{when they can}} (costly) manipulate the information available to the regulator. We derive optimal intervention policy, and analyze its effect on managerial strategies. Regulatory intervention may induce shareholders to manipulate the information available to the regulator {{in order to avoid}} intervention and closure, and we find that these incentives to manipulate information may increase with tighter capital requirements. Finally we show that, in order to avoid manipulation by the banker, some degree of <b>forbearance</b> <b>in</b> closure may be ex ante optimal.

40|$|Mandatory Sub-Debt Policy as an {{alternative}} to the Third Pillar of Basel II : Is it feasible ?, by Adrian PopThe recent proposals of reform put forward by the Bank for International Settlements and the Federal Reserve System include specific elements of market discipline that are naturally added to the traditional tools of banking regulation and supervision. More precisely, a mandatory Sub-Debt Policy by which certain large and sophisticated banking organizations are forced to issue some minimum amount of subordinated debt on a regular basis, can prove itself effective in mitigating moral hazard and regulatory <b>forbearance</b> <b>in</b> banking industry. In this article, we provide some interesting and useful insights into the incentives structure of sub-debt holders by using a standard framework for option pricing applied to the banking firm. In particular, under `normal' conditions of bank solvability the subordinated creditors act indeed as natural `allies' of regulators, mitigating the risk taking incentives of bank shareholders. On the contrary, as the bank approaches its default point, they may exacerbate the moral hazard problems and complicate the tasks of supervisory authorities. In this second case, the sub-debt holders behave <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> as `enemies' of the government supervisor. Finally, we derive some major policy implications in terms of market discipline and optimal bank regulation design.
