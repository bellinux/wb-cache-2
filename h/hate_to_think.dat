500|$|Roddenberry {{realized}} {{early on}} that a series with the original crew from Star Trek was unlikely to be practical, nor {{did he want to}} recast the roles or have a [...] "retread" [...] crew– a series of different characters in very similar roles to the original series. He explained, [...] "I would <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> our imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be a}} greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} his Test {{career he}} spent many years playing in the English Lancashire League. He was {{successful}} there, reaching 100 wickets each season until 1979, but there were continued stories of his violent temper. In 1967, Gilchrist was sentenced to three months' probation after attacking his wife Novlyn during an argument. The judge in the case said: [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> English sport has sunk so far that brutes will be tolerated because they are good at games." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to quit the role after six years playing Natalie. She {{comments}} “'I'd been back {{for five years and}} had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy and I could see the scriptwriters were struggling with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the door was shut behind me. Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never. Maybe I'll track Janine down.” ...|$|E
60|$|Surely it will; but {{meantime}} one <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of these}} splendid people using second-class words to express first-class emotions.|$|R
60|$|The dealer frowned. He <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a {{customer}} going to somebody else. In fact, this was, for a debtor, an unpardonable offense.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much. She <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of my uncle. She {{was very}} much {{attached}} to him, and to have him disappear like that makes her shudder and feel very bad." ...|$|R
2500|$|He apologised for his {{interview}} performance {{the following day}} saying, [...] "It wasn't my best performance and I would like to apologise for that. I would <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{the reputation of the}} country or the office of taoiseach would in any way be affected by what I had to say." [...] He claimed that there was a hoarseness in his voice and denied that he had been hungover. His version of this event was substantiated in 2017 by {{his interview}}er who stated that Cowen was weary and not drunk or hungover.|$|E
2500|$|On December 4, 1968, Womack {{was traded}} to the Houston Astros for outfielder Dick Simpson. He {{appeared}} in 30 games for the Astros that season, going 2–1 with a 3.51 ERA. On August 24, 1969 he {{was traded to}} the Seattle Pilots with pitcher Roric Harrison for pitcher Jim Bouton [...] and in nine games with the Seattle squad, he went 2–1 with a 2.59 ERA. Of the transaction, Bouton said, [...] "Maybe it's me for a hundred thousand and Dooley Womack is just a throw-in. I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that at this stage of my career I was being traded even-up for Dooley Womack." [...] In total, Womack went 4–2 with a 3.29 ERA in 39 relief appearances that year. In 65 2/3 innings, he allowed 64 hits and 23 walks, while striking out 40 batters.|$|E
2500|$|McManaman {{had also}} been noted for his {{versatility}} in his free role, switching {{from right to left}} wings, and his ability to play in central midfield, behind the front pair, or as a forward, with many notable managers including then Ajax coach Louis van Gaal, describing it as a role few could pull off the way McManaman had. McManaman was credited for making the role manager Evans gave him work, with the result being that Liverpool were playing some of the most aesthetically pleasing attacking football at the time in England. McManaman was also said to have been {{one of only a handful}} of so-called [...] "talismanic" [...] players along with Eric Cantona and Gianfranco Zola in the league at the time believed to have the charisma to lift supporters from their seats each time they got the ball. Managers would deploy a man-marker specifically to follow him for an entire game, with Gianfranco Zola noting that McManaman was the player the Italian national players monitored the most. Howard Wilkinson said McManaman was [...] "virtually unstoppable" [...] at times, while then Middlesbrough manager, Bryan Robson, was quoted as saying that [...] "everyone in the Premiership knows that if you stop McManaman, you stop Liverpool". Roy Evans, attempting to diminish the attention on marking McManaman, stated, [...] "I would <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we are no more than a one-man team." [...] German coach Berti Vogts named McManaman as one of only three Premiership players in his select European XI Team.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{if you can}} get a sleigh, I'll pay my share, if you'll take me along," [...] put in Nat Poole, eagerly. He <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of being}} left behind.|$|R
60|$|Miss Salome looked troubled. Perhaps {{there was}} {{something}} in Clemantiny's argument. And she <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of seeing Chester go. He looked more like Johnny than ever, as he stood there with his flushed face and wistful eyes.|$|R
60|$|Joan <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of gold. She {{had wanted}} to leave the gold back in Cabin Gulch, {{and she would have}} done so had Jim {{permitted}} it. And <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that all that gold which was not Jim Cleve's belonged to her uncle! She could not believe it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of marrying}} for a home, and I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of marrying as a profession. Writers accuse us of {{thinking}} of nothing else, and I get {{sick and tired}} of the whole thing. I wish I was just a plain animal or had no sex at all. Sometimes I think it is a curse to be a woman." [...] She ended fierce and sullen.|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. I know. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about {{anything}} I've killed, really. At least, I should--but it's {{better not to}} think.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> any cadet was guilty," [...] {{came from}} Emerald. [...] "'Twould blacken the {{character}} of the whole school, so it would!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was very}} glad, for I <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of parting with Nancy even {{to go with}} Cecil. As for the blank book, I haven't told my husband about it yet, but I mean to some day. And I've subscribed for the Weekly Advocate again.|$|R
60|$|At length {{came the}} time for the boys to take their departure. Jack <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of running away from Ruth, and Fred was equally sorry to leave May Powell behind, yet the thought of what was ahead brightened all of the lads considerably.|$|R
6000|$|The boys {{remained}} {{in and out}} of the water the best part of two hours. It was so inviting all <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of dressing again. They had a game of tag and kept poor Hans [...] "it" [...] for a long while, until, in fact, the German youth was out of breath and had to give it up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not worried}} about Baxter so much," [...] went on Dick. [...] "But I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Crabtree being around to molest the Stanhopes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope he's at home," [...] she replied, quite seriously. [...] "I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him {{camped in}} the high country without bedding or tent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know there}} would be a great risk. But I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of going to a Siberian prison, or aboard a Russian prison ship." ...|$|E
60|$|I suppose I {{happened}} {{along in}} time to marry Buck and Miss Malloy at about twenty farm-houses. I <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we'd discounted 'em, and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they'd signed, running from $300 to $500.|$|R
60|$|Had {{he found}} his team, he might have given Bob supper and sent him off before Margaret arrived, {{but he had not}} found the team and Bob's {{creeping}} about the house annoyed him. In the Old Country Jardine was a poacher, but he sprang from good Scottish stock and he <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> Bob bothered Margaret. Moving out of the shadow, he went up the path.|$|R
60|$|The gray {{roadster}} swerved {{toward the}} embankment as the hind wheels skidded {{on the loose}} surface gravel. They were at the turn. The horse was just abreast the bumper. There was one chance in a thousand of making the turn were the running beast out of the way. There was still a chance if he turned ahead of them. If he did not turn--Barney <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what must follow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no, {{not in the}} least. I {{like you}} to be frank. I should <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that there was {{anything}} you did not dare to tell me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he put {{his wife}} in your cathedral, don't you?" [...] she mocked, with a tinkle of profane laughter. And she laughed with {{malicious}} triumph.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought so}} at first," [...] said Sammy; [...] "but I'm glad he didn't; I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of our glorious pole with that thing floppin' on it." ...|$|E
60|$|Walter shuddered--not so {{much from}} fear of the threat as from {{repulsion}} over the ugliness and vulgarity of it. But he held his head high and marched into school. Faith followed in a conflict of emotions. She <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Walter fighting that little sneak, but oh, he had been splendid! And {{he was going to}} fight for HER--Faith Meredith--to punish her insulter! Of course he would win--such eyes spelled victory.|$|R
60|$|When {{the harvest}} season {{drew to a}} close, dismay crept into the soul of our hero. Where would he go now? He <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of leaving Mount Hope Farm and Miss Salome. He would have been content to stay there and {{work as hard as}} he had ever worked at Upton, merely for the roof over his head and the food he ate. The making of a fortune seemed a small thing {{compared}} to the privilege of being near Miss Salome.|$|R
6000|$|She {{spent more}} time in Mr. Britling's house than in any other. There was a legend that she had [...] "drawn out" [...] his mind, {{and that she had}} [...] "stood up" [...] for him against his father. She had {{certainly}} contradicted quite a number of those unfavourable comments that fathers are wont to make about their sons. Though certainly she contradicted everything. And Mr. Britling <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of her knocking about alone in boarding-houses and hydropathic establishments with only the most casual chances for contradiction.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Charley Gamp {{was related}} to such a fellow," [...] said Phil. [...] "Snogger isn't a nice sort to have {{anything}} to do with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not angry; {{the things}} I {{want to say}} I can't seem to say. It isn't your fault or mine. It's just fate. I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of 'marrying well'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be {{the work}} of some of the hired help," [...] mused Colonel Colby. [...] "But I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that. Every one who is here came highly recommended." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{vacation}} came {{he wondered}} {{what he should do}} with them during the summer, but the problem was solved by the boys, who <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of remaining on the farm, and who proposed a trip up and down the Hudson River and through Long Island Sound, providing their guardian would furnish the boat and bear the expense of the outing. The outcome was the chartering of the yacht Spray, and all of the boys took lessons in sailing from an old tar who knew exactly how such a craft should be handled.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Britling {{was still}} flushed and ruffled {{as he and}} his guest {{returned}} towards the Dower House. He criticised England himself unmercifully, but he <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that in any respect she fell short of perfection; even her defects he liked to imagine were just a subtler kind of power and wisdom. And Lady Frensham had stuck her voice and her gestures through all these amiable illusions. He was like a lover who calls his lady a foolish rogue, and is startled to find that facts and strangers do literally agree with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a frightful nuisance," [...] the boy said. [...] "It is the kit I am {{thinking}} of, otherwise I should not mind. I didn't {{care for the}} skipper. He seemed all right and decent enough before we started, but I soon heard from fellows who had sailed with him before {{that he was a}} tartar; and what was worse, they said he was in the habit of being drunk two nights out of three. However, {{that has nothing to do}} with it. I am really awfully sorry, Harry. You have been a thundering good elder brother. I <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that you had to shell out last time, and I have quite made up my mind that you sha'n't do it again." ...|$|R
