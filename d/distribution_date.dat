5|$|The October 17 {{press release}} set November 21, 2006 as the North American <b>distribution</b> <b>date</b> for the Xbox 360 and PC {{versions}} of Knights of the Nine. The European release for the Xbox 360 and PC was set two days later, on November 23. The European release was co-published by Bethesda and Ubisoft. On November 9, 2006, Bethesda clarified earlier statements regarding PC releases, declaring that, although the boxed retail PC edition of Knights of the Nine {{was set for}} release on November 21, the PC release downloadable from the company website wouldn't be available until December 4. This caused some consumer complaints, for although the Xbox 360 release was available on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points (the equivalent of US$10.00, or GB£6.80), for the time being, PC owners had only the US$19.99 boxed retail edition of the game. The increased price of the PC's boxed retail release (The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of Nine Oblivion Downloadable Content Collection) resulted from its inclusion of Oblivions other previously released downloadable content. Such content {{was not included in}} either the downloadable PC release, the Xbox Marketplace download, or the PlayStation 3 edition of Oblivion. The downloadable release was ultimately issued on December 6 at the price of US$9.99. According to IGN Entertainment's GamerMetrics, a service based on compiled visitor activity information on IGN's website, the pack was the fourth most anticipated release of its release week, following , Superman Returns and College Hoops 2K7.|$|E

40|$|Capital gain {{distributions}} {{by mutual}} funds generate tax liability for taxable shareholders, thereby reducing their after-tax returns. Taxable investors who are considering purchasing fund shares around <b>distribution</b> <b>dates</b> {{have an incentive}} to delay their purchase until after the distribution, since this will reduce the present value of their tax liability. Non-taxable shareholders, such as those who invest through IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts, face no such incentive for delaying purchase. This paper compares daily shareholder transactions by taxable and non-taxable investors in the mutual funds of a single no-load fund complex around <b>distribution</b> <b>dates.</b> Gross inflows to taxable accounts are significantly lower in the weeks preceding <b>distribution</b> <b>dates</b> than in the weeks following them, but gross inflows to tax-deferred accounts do not change around these dates. This finding suggests that some taxable shareholders time their purchase of mutual fund shares to avoid the tax acceleration associated with distributions. Taxable shareholders who purchase shares just before <b>distribution</b> <b>dates</b> also have shorter holding periods, on average, than those who buy after a distribution. The cost of the distribution-related tax acceleration for pre-distribution buyers is therefore somewhat less than that for those who buy after the distribution. ...|$|R

They occur mostly in fresh-water environments but {{can also be found}} in brackish waters. Due to their requirement for clear water they are considered sensitive to eutrophication and therefore often used as an indicator for good water quality.

40|$|This paper studies {{venture capital}} {{distributions}} and stock returns. We seek good predictors {{of the distribution}} event timing. We collect the data on 2, 486 distributions of firms between 1999 and 2002 and find {{significant increase in the}} cumulative abnormal return before the <b>distribution</b> <b>date</b> (16 % on average), followed by sharp decline in performance (around 6 % on average). Hazard functions for distribution events are estimated with semi-parametric [Cox (1972) ] and parametric models, using maximum likelihood estimation method. The Cox model fits the data quite well, but parametric models offer a better fit. Generalized gamma distribution has the highest Akaike Information Criterion. Stock return after the IPO, selected Fama-French factors (HML, SMB, market excess return) as well as the lockout period have highly significant influence on the occurrence of the distribution event. These findings are robust to different analysis periods, ranging from one to five years. * Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley.

40|$|This paper aims at {{comparing}} inedited maps of macrophytes and phytoplankton {{distribution in}} the lagoon of Venice in 1980 and 2003. The macrophyte distribution is displayed with reference to different biomass intervals which allow the calculation of the occupied surface, standing crop (SC), net (NPP) and gross (GPP) production. In 1980 the total macroalgal SC was ca. 841 ktonnes whereas the annual NPP and GPP were estimated to be ca. 2912 and 18498 ktonnes, respectively. In 2003 macroalgae displayed a marked regression and the SC, NPP and GPP decreased to ca. 89, 471 and 2336 ktonnes. Maps of the seagrass <b>distribution</b> <b>date</b> back to 1990 but their biomass and production have been quantified only in 2003. On the whole, in 2003, on a surface of ca. 56 km 2 the three species living in the lagoon accounted for a SC and a NPP of ca. 209 and 821 ktonnes, whereas the GPP estimated according to literature was about {{twice as high as}} the NPP. Cymodocea nodosa was the most abundant phanerogam in the lagoon. Its SC was higher than the total of the macroalgae, although the latter were more productive. Zostera marina covered the highest surface in the lagoon but its biomass and production were a little lower than that of C. nodosa. Nanozostera noltii, which was common and widespread in the past, displayed an evident regression trend which was mainly due to the increase of the water turbidity and the disruptions of its habitat. Similarly, phytoplankton, underwent a descending trend, although data quoted in the present paper display its distribution only in the summer period...|$|E

The pTAS family generalizes the well-known gamma distribution and allows for heavier tails depending on the parameter α. Because of this property, pTAS distributions appear to be useful in the context of risk management. Against this background, the contribution of his work is three-fold: Firstly, we summarize the properties of the pTAS family. Secondly, we describe its numerical implementation and illustrate the functions by means of R examples in the Appendix. Thirdly, we empirically demonstrate that this family can be successfully applied in risk management. Concretely, applications to credit and operational risk are given.|$|R

We find that purchases of a variety of goods are meaningfully higher on receipt days, suggesting that recipients are very impatient. Additionally, and importantly, estimates indicate that when food stamp receipt days fall on weekends, total monthly consumption within the same households is affected. In particular, monthly purchases of beer are higher when food stamps are distributed on a weekend rather than in months where benefits are distributed on weekdays. For these households, total beer purchases are between 4 and 5 percent higher in those months. Among households ineligible for food stamps, no effect is identified...|$|R
