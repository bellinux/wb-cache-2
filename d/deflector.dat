5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of <b>deflector</b> plates.|$|E
5|$|Z39s sensor suite {{included}} a FuMO 21 radar, which {{was placed on}} the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the foremast searchlights. She also had several other radars, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on her masthead, and a FuMO 63 Hohentwei. She also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray <b>deflector.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Jet blast <b>deflectors</b> {{began to}} appear at {{airports}} in the 1950s. Airports in the 1960s used jet blast <b>deflectors</b> with a height of , but airports in the 1990s needed <b>deflectors</b> that were twice as high, and even up to [...] high for jet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11, which have engines mounted in the tail above the fuselage. Airports often place their <b>deflectors</b> at the beginnings of runways, especially when roadways or structures are adjacent. Airports that are in dense urban areas often have <b>deflectors</b> between taxiways and airport borders. Jet blast <b>deflectors</b> usually direct exhaust gases upward. However, a low-pressure zone can form behind the blast fence, causing ambient air and debris to be drawn upward with the jet exhaust, and hot, toxic gases to circulate behind the blast fence. Jet blast <b>deflectors</b> {{have been designed to}} counteract this problem by using multiple panels and various angles, and by using slotted panel surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Although <b>deflectors</b> are {{commonly}} used in fish habitat rehabilitation projects to create and/or maintain pools, {{there is a lack}} of understanding of the complex flow field and scour patterns around these structures. The objective of this research is to quantify the 3 D flow dynamics and the bed morphology around various designs of flow <b>deflectors</b> in a laboratory flume over a plain and mobile bed. 3 D velocity measurements were taken with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. After comparing different methods of bed shear stress estimates, it was determined that the turbulent kinetic energy approach was best at capturing the shear stress amplification near the <b>deflectors.</b> <b>Deflectors</b> oriented perpendicular to the flow create the most important disturbance of the flow field, the greatest increase in turbulence intensity and the largest scour hole, followed by upstreamoriented <b>deflectors</b> (135 °) and downstream-oriented ones (45 °). 90 ° <b>deflectors</b> would therefore potentially provide the greatest benefit for fish habitat rehabilitation...|$|R
5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the <b>deflector</b> dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of element43 was finally confirmed in a December 1936 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè. In mid-1936, Segrè visited the United States, first Columbia University in New York {{and then the}} Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive. Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that {{had been part of}} the <b>deflector</b> in the cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant {{professor of physics at}} the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron <b>deflector</b> in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|E
50|$|From late 1931, {{after several}} bizarre forms of smoke <b>deflectors</b> were tried on various {{locomotives}} to stop drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision, the straight sided smoke <b>deflectors</b> were added. These were later replaced by <b>deflectors</b> with angled top. From 1933 the class were {{taken off the}} top-link expresses, being superseded by the LMS Princess Royal Class and later the LMS Princess Coronation Class pacifics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Whether the gas jet is {{deflected}} smoothly or {{not directly}} affects {{the success or}} failure of launch, during the progress of the land-based missile with the vehicle-mounted vertically thermal launch. This paper uses 3 -D dynamical simulation of gas jet to analyse basic deflecting features of triple-faced <b>deflectors</b> and double-faced ones with different moulded surfaces. The result shows that, triple-faced <b>deflectors</b> deflect quite smoothly and requite large area of the firing position. With some differences, double-faces <b>deflectors</b> protect the vehicle and wheels much better and requite more of the firing position of the <b>deflector’s</b> bilateral...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrostatic}} storage ring with a circumference of 8 m {{was designed for}} studying molecular science. A race-track ring consists of two 160 ° <b>deflectors,</b> four 10 ° <b>deflectors</b> and four quadrupole doublets. For the main <b>deflectors,</b> we have adopted a cylindrical shape, {{which is one of}} the main differences from the lattice at ELISA [1], where spherical <b>deflectors</b> are used. As a result, there is no vertical node at the center of the <b>deflectors,</b> which may eliminate one of the origins of the intensity-related beam losses observed at ELISA. Ion beams with an energy of 20 keV from an ECR ion source are injected into the ring after being momentum-analyzed. The entire system has been completed and installed. The design and performance of the {{electrostatic storage}} ring are presented. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1932, the Southern Railway {{ordered a}} final batch of 15 {{locomotives}} (Nos.14001414) to expand class availability on the Southern Railway's network. These were built at Ashford works and {{differed from the}} previous 65 {{in a number of}} ways. The cabs of the final eight locomotives (Nos.14071414) were fitted for left-hand driving, which was adopted as standard by the Southern Railway. The original Nclass chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1class, which increased route availability by allowing the locomotives to pass under lower bridges and tunnels. Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927, which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke <b>deflector</b> design for the Southern Railway. A smaller version was fitted to Nos.14001414 during building.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air <b>deflector</b> used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|The Orions {{are placed}} under {{guard in the}} {{decontamination}} chamber. Harrad-Sar returns in his vessel and attacks the now disabled Enterprise, and then begins to tow it away. He reveals that, in fact, the Syndicate seeks Archer's head, and in this matter he is the slave and the Orion women are his masters. The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his phaser, and T'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise <b>deflector</b> dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Western Region based {{examples}} had hand/foot holds {{cut into}} the smoke <b>deflectors</b> replacing the original handrails after a major derailment, to improve forward visibility. Some of these <b>deflectors</b> subsequently migrated to {{other members of the}} class.|$|R
50|$|Electro-optic <b>deflectors</b> utilize prisms of {{electro-optic}} crystals. The {{index of}} refraction is changed by the Pockels effect, thus changing the direction of propagation of the beam inside the prism. Electro-optic <b>deflectors</b> have {{only a small number}} of resolvable spots, but possess a fast response time. There are few commercial models available at this time. This is because of competing acousto-optic <b>deflectors,</b> the small number of resolvable spots and the relatively high price of electro-optic crystals.|$|R
25|$|Jet blast <b>deflectors</b> {{range in}} {{complexity}} from stationary concrete, metal or fiberglass fences to heavy panels that are raised and lowered by hydraulic arms and actively cooled. Blast <b>deflectors</b> {{can be used}} as protection from helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft propwash. At airports and jet engine service centers, jet blast <b>deflectors</b> can be combined with sound-deadening walls to form a ground run-up enclosure within which a jet aircraft engine can safely and more quietly be tested at full thrust.|$|R
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke <b>deflector</b> plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|E
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and <b>deflector</b> dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E

50|$|Some special laser {{scanners}} use, {{instead of}} moving mirrors, acousto-optic <b>deflectors</b> or electro-optic <b>deflectors.</b> These mechanisms allow the highest scanning frequencies possible so far. They are used, for example, in laser TV systems. On the other hand, these systems are also {{much more expensive}} than mirror scanning systems.|$|R
25|$|A {{jet blast}} <b>deflector</b> (JBD) or blast fence is a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine to prevent damage and injury. The {{structure}} must {{be strong enough}} to withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the turbulent air. Without a <b>deflector,</b> jet blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Bullet <b>deflector</b> {{plates were}} {{installed}} over the rear fenders. The idea behind these plates {{was that the}} tank could drive over a trench, and the rear sponson machine guns could then fire onto the plates; the bullets would deflect into the trench or the area directly behind the tank. Like the sponson machine guns themselves, the <b>deflector</b> plates {{turned out to be}} useless. However, the idea was used again on M5 light tanks in the Normandy campaign.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet blast <b>deflector</b> lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the <b>deflector,</b> the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the <b>deflector</b> is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|E
40|$|Electron {{beam energy}} is absorbed by <b>deflectors</b> which allow beam {{distribution}} over an absorber located between the <b>deflectors</b> and workpiece.

Enterprise is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but the starship becomes trapped in the ribbon. Kirk goes to <b>deflector</b> control to alter the <b>deflector</b> dish, allowing Enterprise to escape, but the trailing end of the ribbon rakes across Enterprises hull, exposing the section Kirk is in to space; he is presumed dead.|$|E
25|$|Filming {{commenced}} Monday, March 28, 1994. Production on Generations began while The Next Generation {{was still}} filming, so scenes {{that did not}} feature The Next Generation regulars were filmed first. After {{the end of the}} show, there was only six months before the film was scheduled to be released in theaters. The first scenes filmed were those in the Enterprise-B <b>deflector</b> room; the beginning of filming was concurrent with The Next Generations production, and the film and show were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on Paramount Studio's lot. Scenes of Harriman, Chekov, and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the <b>deflector</b> room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.|$|E
