25|$|HTML forms sent via email. Support {{for server}} side {{scripting}} was rare on shared servers during this period. To provide a feedback mechanism for web site visitors, mailto forms were used. A user would fill in a form, and upon clicking the form's submit button, their <b>email</b> <b>client</b> would launch {{and attempt to}} send an email containing the form's details. The popularity and complications of the mailto protocol led browser developers to incorporate email clients into their browsers.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Mozilla {{aimed to}} be a {{technology}} provider for companies, such as Netscape, who would commercialize their open-source code. When AOL (Netscape's parent company) greatly reduced its involvement with Mozilla in July 2003, the Mozilla Foundation was designated the legal steward of the project. Soon after, Mozilla deprecated the Mozilla Suite {{in favor of}} creating independent applications for each function, primarily the Firefox web browser and the Thunderbird <b>email</b> <b>client,</b> and moved to supply them directly to the public.|$|E

25|$|Many Internet service providers, {{and many}} other Internet sites, operate news servers for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers {{directly}} will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and newsreader were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate newsreader client software, a program that resembles an <b>email</b> <b>client</b> but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Outlook Express provide both abilities.|$|E

Outlook Express and other <b>email</b> <b>clients</b> are unable to read this format. This can be confusing to Outlook Express users (as {{well as those who}} use other <b>email</b> <b>clients)</b> who receive attachments sent from Outlook.|$|R

It incorporates a Phishing Filter {{like the one}} found in IE7 as well as Bayesian junk mail filtering which is updated monthly via Windows Update. Also, e-mail messages are now stored as individual files {{rather than in a}} binary database to reduce frequent corruption and make messages searchable in real-time. Backing up and restoring account setup information, configuration and mail store is now made easier. It does however omit some features of Outlook Express, such as identities and a [...] "Block sender" [...] for Usenet access. Windows Mail is replaced with Windows Live Mail.|$|E
2500|$|On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, {{an update}} to the Start menu {{known as the}} [...] "Start screen" [...] was introduced. It covers the entire screen and no longer {{features}} the right column. It shows much larger tiles for programs and, whenever possible, displays dynamic content supplied by the program directly on the tile itself (known as a [...] "live tile"), behaving similarly to a widget. For instance, the live tile for an <b>email</b> <b>client</b> may display the number of unread emails. The Start screen allows users to uninstall their programs by right-clicking on them and selecting [...] "Uninstall". Pinned apps can be placed in groups. The search box is initially hidden but can be viewed by clicking the search button on the charms bar and can also be brought up as it receives a keyboard input. True to its name, the Start screen is the first screen that a user sees upon login.|$|E

Examples include the Gmail, Yahoo!, and SpamCop/Horde webmail clients; Mozilla Thunderbird, Opera, Pegasus Mail, IncrediMail, Apple Mail, later versions of Microsoft Outlook, and KMail mail readers. Other HTML techniques (such as IFrames) can still be used to track email viewing.|$|R

5000|$|Email Migration is {{a process}} in which an email or {{multiple}} email messages are migrated from one <b>email</b> <b>client</b> to another <b>email</b> <b>client.</b> An equivalent term is Mailbox Migration, in which case records such as e-mails, appointments, contacts or tasks may also be migrated. In general, email migration is required when a user is switching from its current <b>email</b> <b>client</b> to a new one. Usually email clients don't support similar file formats for saving mailbox data.|$|E

50|$|An email {{agent is}} a program {{that is part of}} the email infrastructure, from {{composition}} by sender, to transfer across the network, to viewing by recipient.

50|$|Text-based mail readers (such as Pine or Mutt) and {{graphical}} <b>email</b> <b>clients</b> with purely text-based HTML capabilities (such as Mulberry) do not interpret HTML or display images, {{so their}} users {{are not subject}} to tracking by email web beacons. Plain-text email messages cannot contain web beacons because their contents are interpreted as display characters instead of embedded HTML code, so opening messages does not initiate communication. Some <b>email</b> <b>clients</b> offer the option to disable all HTML in every message (thus rendering all messages as plain text), which prevents any web beacons from loading.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>email</b> <b>clients</b> use a User-Agent {{header field}} to {{identify}} the software used to send the message. According to RFC 2076, {{this is a common}} but non-standard header field.|$|R
