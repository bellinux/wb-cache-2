25|$|Would {{you ask me}} how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare them and I do compare them, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be called a 'nigger' and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Schwarz {{was born}} Heinz Schwarz to Fritz (1897–1969) and Alma Schwarz (1901–1999) in Cologne, Germany. His family {{belonged to the}} Glockengasse Synagogue. He arrived in South Africa as a Jewish refugee from Germany in 1934 {{with his mother and}} younger brother Kurt. His father Fritz, a Social Democratic Party activist, left for South Africa the night the Nazis came to power. They boarded the SS Giulio Cesare in Genoa, Italy which took them to South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town they stayed in one room in a house in Kloof Street. Schwarz {{described}} how he was [...] "lucky" [...] as eventually he was able to sleep in a bathroom in a rusty bath. He spoke no Afrikaans or English at first and had strong memories of being taunted on the schoolyard for being different. Schwarz stated in an interview in 1991 that [...] "I know what the word discrimination means, not because I've read it in a book, but because I've been the subject of it. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be hungry." [...] The discrimination and financial difficulties of his family left a strong impression on Schwarz and helped shape his political philosophy with its emphasis on social justice and the rule of law.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I {{know what it}} feels like to be suicidal, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> feels like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Basquiat was {{the first}} {{commercial}} feature film about a painter made by a painter. Schnabel said:"I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be attacked as an artist. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be judged as an artist. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to arrive {{as an artist and}} have fame and notoriety. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be accused of things that you never said or did. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be described as a piece of hype. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be appreciated as well as degraded." ...|$|R
60|$|FRUST. Well, I {{liked that}} little pocket piece fine. But I'm blamed if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> all about.|$|R
6000|$|... "I went to bed, {{and waited}} for the next thing to happen. I found my {{thunderbolt}} waiting for me when I woke up. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was going to be, but when I felt a ring through the envelope of that note <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. <b>I</b> mind-read that note before I opened it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
60|$|COLONEL. That's the dancing. [He taps his forehead.] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is when you're {{not used}} to it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! 'tis too late, Pa,' {{said his}} daughter, calmly 'to {{talk to me}} like this. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means, and what its value is.' ...|$|E
60|$|After {{what had}} passed between the Sergeant and me, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{was that he}} had left unspoken as well as he knew it himself.|$|R
6000|$|By some {{flash of}} intuition <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was he intended. [...] "You don't give drink to that beast!" [...] I said, rising and facing him.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{was that}} <b>I</b> saw. It {{was a message}} from Bertha. Mary Phillips had devised the means of sending it. Bertha had sent it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cover {{your mouth}}," [...] Labiskwee cried suddenly. [...] "And do not talk. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. Cover your mouth with your sleeve, thus, {{and do not}} talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was writing}} {{to me and}} she put this under cover. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> contains. She wants {{you to go to}} her at Cheltenham for a month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Readily. It's not {{a celebrated}} name. It's not Barnacle.' 'No, no,' said Daniel, laughing. 'And now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. It's Clennam. How do you do, Mr Clennam?' ...|$|E
6000|$|At Yokohama, however, while I dawdled in curiosity shops, a {{telegram}} from Harold startled me into seriousness. My chance at last! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant; that villain Higginson! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That may be, or it mayn’t,” said I. “It’s the {{practice}} where I was before. You can bet <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it’s</b> like; and <b>I</b> tell it {{you for a}} fact, I’m tabooed.” ...|$|R
60|$|Just below this a cat owl flew heavily {{over the}} stream, and he, asking if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, imitated very well the common hoo, hoo, hoo, hoorer, hoo, of our woods.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] said [...] .007, as he flew, [...] "is a hot-box. Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means. I shall go to pieces, I guess. My first road-run, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, it is. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means," [...] she repeated, [...] "and {{it makes}} no difference," [...] {{and this time it}} was she who took his hand.|$|E
6000|$|The girl shuddered. [...] "Even {{now that}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is {{it makes me}} creep," [...] she whispered, as the faint clanking of a distant chain came to their ears.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{what has}} he been making you think, my poor child?' said Albinia. 'I know it is very distressing, {{but it would be}} more right and safe if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> amounts to.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be, or it mayn't," [...] said I. [...] "It's the {{practice}} where I was before. You can bet <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like; and <b>I</b> tell it {{you for a}} fact, I'm tabooed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'After a long interval, he said, [...] "They {{told their}} story." [...] And again {{there was that}} oppressive silence. [...] "Then only <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was <b>I</b> had {{made up my mind}} to," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means!" [...] exclaimed Dick, leaping for the door. [...] "Come on, if {{you want}} to save the Dartaway!" [...] he went on, to his brothers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd go this minute," [...] said Mr. Hatchard, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> 'ud be: {{in three}} or four days you'd be coming and begging me to take you back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t think so," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{accepting}} with alacrity {{an offer to}} go ashore in the launch and change into some decent clothes. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was." ...|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{hard and}} harder <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant - [...] The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene; It meant the west {{mirrored}} by the coffin {{of my friend}} there, [...] Turning to the road from his green, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't," [...] said Mary positively. [...] "No {{matter how}} bad I was I wouldn't want to be burned and burned. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like. <b>I</b> picked up a red hot poker once by accident. What must you do to be good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{all things}} {{vanished}} suddenly from my sight, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant. The next moment {{we were walking}} along in our village; and down toward the river I saw the twinkling lights of the Golden Stag. Then in the dark I heard a joyful cry: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, and it {{has driven}} men into asylums who never found their way on to the medical staff. I was a very shy fellow myself as a student, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never;--not to you, nor {{to all the}} world. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> has been. I {{know you}} are not now as you were then. You have been his wife, and are now his widow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jane: [...] "Go where, ma'am? I don't {{know what}} you want me to do. I'm willing enough to do {{anything}} if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, but it's pretty hard to do things if you don't." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was sorry}} for poor old Freddie. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> felt like. <b>I</b> was once in love myself with a girl called Elizabeth Shoolbred, {{and the fact that}} she couldn't stand me at any price will be {{recorded}} in my autobiography. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the thing for Freddie.|$|R
6000|$|Faint, sickening sensations crept along all {{the fibers}} of my body, and <b>I</b> seemed to <b>know</b> {{how a person}} feels who hears his death {{sentence}} pronounced from the bench.
