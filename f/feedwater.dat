However, on the Pacifics the increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed. In 1935, number 2544 Lemberg received Trofimoff piston valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, Decoy {{was assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet and assigned to contraband control duties. In December the ship began an extensive refit to repair corrosion problems, fix her boiler <b>feedwater</b> pumps, and replace her funnels. After completing her repairs in January 1940, she was transferred to Freetown, joining the 20th Destroyer Flotilla, to escort convoys off the West African coast. Decoy returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in May and was assigned to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla. Together with her sister , she escorted Convoy US-2 carrying Australian and New Zealand troops to the Middle East through the Red Sea from 12 to 17 May.|$|E
25|$|Early boilers used {{seawater}} directly, {{but this}} gave {{problems with the}} build-up of brine and scale. For efficiency, as well as conserving <b>feedwater,</b> marine engines have usually been condensing engines. By 1865, {{the use of an}} improved surface condenser permitted the use of fresh water feed, as the additional <b>feedwater</b> now required was only the small amount required to make up for losses, rather than the total passed through the boiler. Despite this, a large warship could still require up to 100tons of fresh water makeup to the <b>feedwater</b> system per day, when under full power. Attention was also paid to de-aereating <b>feedwater,</b> to further reduce boiler corrosion.|$|E
50|$|A site north west of {{the parish}} church was the place where a Ducking stool was kept on the beck. This was for the {{punishment}} of scolding and unruly women. On the eventual opening of the Bradford Arm of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the stool was removed and used on the canal instead. Water from Bradford Beck was used to supplement the low <b>feedwaters</b> going into the canal, however the canal was only supposed to take water from Bowling Beck, but as this proved insufficient, the polluted waters from Bradford Beck were used also. This turned the Bradford Canal into an open sewer.|$|R

40|$|Membrane Distillation (MD) is an {{emerging}} technology that has inherent technical advantages over both RO and thermal desalination processes. To be commercially viable though, a niche application {{has to be}} identified wherein MD has sufficient other cost advantages to overcome the membrane cost penalty. One such niche application is the desalination of high salinity brines (reject) from existing RO or thermal desalination facilities. This paper summarizes the results of both bench and pilot-scale MD tests when treating a variety of <b>feedwaters</b> including thermal desalination system brines, seawater, tap water and prepared sodium chloride solutions. In addition to measuring flux & effluent quality {{as a function of}} process conditions (temperature, flows, salinity), detailed enthalpy flows and energy balances were prepared. A comparison of the flux and Performance Ratio for “Air Gap ” MD and “Vacuum Multi-Effect ” MD system designs is also presented. The primary conclusions of this study are: • The pretreatment chemicals added to prevent scaling during thermal desalination also prevent MD membrane scaling. • Salinity of the feed does not affect effluent quality and only marginally affects flux. • Compared with an air gap MD design operating under similar temperatures, the vacuum multi-effect MD design produces 3 x more distilled water per unit of energy input...|$|R
25|$|The {{water level}} in the steam {{generator}} and nuclear reactor is controlled using the <b>feedwater</b> system. The <b>feedwater</b> pump has the task of taking {{the water from the}} condensate system, increasing the pressure and forcing it into either the steam generators (in the case of a pressurized water reactor) or directly into the reactor (for boiling water reactors).|$|E

25|$|The {{level of}} water in the steam separators, the {{percentage}} of steam in the reactor pressure tubes, the level at which the water begins to boil in the reactor core, the neutron flux and power distribution in the reactor, and the <b>feedwater</b> flow through the core have to be carefully controlled. The level {{of water in}} the steam separator is mainly controlled by the <b>feedwater</b> supply, with the deaerator tanks serving as a water reservoir.|$|E
40|$|Forward osmosis (FO) is an {{emerging}} membrane process with potential {{applications in the}} treatment of highly fouling <b>feedwaters.</b> However, biofouling, the adhesion of microorganisms to the membrane and the subsequent formation of biofilms, remains a major limitation since antifouling membrane modifications offer limited protection against biofouling. In this study, we evaluated the use of graphene oxide (GO) for biofouling mitigation in FO. GO functionalization of thin-film composite membranes (GO-TFC) increased the surface hydrophilicity and imparted antimicrobial activity to the membrane without altering its transport properties. After 1 h of contact time, deposition and viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells on GO-TFC were reduced by 36 % and 30 %, respectively, compared to pristine membranes. When GO-TFC membranes were tested for treatment of an artificial secondary wastewater supplemented with P. aeruginosa, membrane biofouling was reduced by 50 % after 24 h of operation. This biofouling resistance is attributed to the reduced accumulation of microbial biomass on GO-TFC compared to pristine membranes. In addition, confocal microscopy demonstrated that cells deposited on the membrane surface are inactivated, resulting in a layer of dead cells on GO-TFC that limit biofilm formation. These findings highlight the potential of GO to be used for biofouling mitigation in FO...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} use of {{electrodialysis}} to desalinate produced waters from shale formations {{in order to facilitate}} water reuse in subsequent hydraulic fracturing processes. We focus on establishing the energy and equipment size required for the desalination of feed waters containing total dissolved solids of up to 192, 000 ppm, and we do this by experimentally replicating the performance of a 10 -stage electrodialysis system. We find that energy requirements are similar to current vapour compression desalination processes for <b>feedwaters</b> ranging between roughly 40, 000 - 90, 000 ppm TDS, but we project water costs to potentially be lower. We also find that the cost per unit salt removed is significantly lower when removed from a high salinity stream as opposed to a low salinity stream, pointing towards the potential of ED to operate as a partial desalination process for high salinity waters. We then develop a numerical model for the system, validate it against experimental results and use this model to minimise salt removal costs by optimising the stack voltage. We find that the higher the salinity of the water from which salt is removed the smaller should be the ratio of the electrical current to its limiting value. We conclude, on the basis of energy and equipment costs, that electrodialysis processes are potentially feasible for the desalination of high salinity waters but require further investigation of robustness to fouling under field conditions.

40|$|Intensive energy {{consumption}} and concentrate management are major issues for desalination at inland areas. This work addresses these issues by examining a systems approach for desalination. The systems approach, called zero discharge desalination, combines multiple desalination processes and brine concentration with salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) technology. In the zero discharge system, the concentrate from desalination processes is reused by solar ponds thereby negating brine disposal, and the solar ponds provide renewable {{energy to the}} desalination and brine concentration processes. ^ A multi-effect multi stage (MEMS) desalination unit, a membrane distillation (MD) unit, and a brine concentration and recovery system (BCRS) were tested with the heat generated from the El Paso Solar Pond. The MEMS unit with three-effects and four stages was effectively operated at a first stage vapor temperature range of 60 ∼ 75 °C, and at high concentration ratio. This unit produced high quality distillate with a total dissolved solids level of less than 5 mg/liter. Its distillate production rate ranged from 1. 6 to 5. 0 liter/min, and was significantly affected by flash range, concentration of reject brine, and first effect circulation rate. No significant scaling and fouling were found during the tests. ^ An air gap MD unit with a membrane area of 2. 94 m 2 was tested with <b>feedwaters</b> in which salinity ranged from 0 to 19 %, and operated with variable warm side temperature, transmembrane temperature drop, and circulation flow rate. The distillate flux ranged from 1 to 6 kg/m 2 -hr, and was strongly affected by the transmembrane temperature drop, instead of the warm side temperature. This observation suggests that heat transfer is the limiting factor for the flux rather than vapor diffusion. The MD unit can produce high quality distillate, however, membrane wetting has {{a major impact on}} the quality of product water. ^ The BCRS uses moderate temperature heat to drive evaporative concentration of saline water, and recovers some fresh water. Slurry salt was produced by the BCRS unit, and recharged into the solar pond along with saturated brine. ^ The operational experience and technical advancements of salinity gradient solar pond technology are also presented in this work. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{distillation}} {{system for}} boiler <b>feedwater</b> {{at this time}} was usually termed an evaporator, partly to distinguish it from a separate system or distiller used for drinking water. Separate systems were often used, especially in early systems, owing {{to the problem of}} contamination from oily lubricants in the <b>feedwater</b> system and because of the greatly different capacities required in larger ships. In time, the two functions became combined and the two terms were applied to the separate components of the system.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the <b>feedwater</b> pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the <b>feedwater</b> was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold <b>feedwater</b> was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} {{core cooling}} (ECCS) is performed by a redundant high-pressure safety injection system {{with a total of}} three strands (one in the NANO). The two steam generators are provided with water by two main feeding pumps. If they fail, feeding is taken over by one of the security systems: a double-stranded auxiliary <b>feedwater</b> system or one of the two emergency <b>feedwater</b> systems, one of which part of the bunkerised NANO. Finally, in case of problems with the cooling, two containment spray systems are entrusted with the removal of excessive heat and pressure by condensation of the resulting steam.|$|E
40|$|Membrane fouling {{is always}} a {{limiting}} factor that affects the performance of reverse osmosis (RO) filtration. In addition to other fouling problems such as scaling, biofouling and organic fouling, colloidal fouling is an important fouling type in RO processes. The lack of quality technique to accurately measure the colloids content of the <b>feedwaters</b> prior to the RO units leads to severe RO fouling and may trigger other types of fouling mechanism to occur. The available fouling test is Silt Density Index (SDI) which is empirical and potentially unreliable. The effectiveness of fouling test is greatly relied {{on their ability to}} capture critical factor of feed water component which may contribute significantly to the fouling in reverse osmosis (RO). This thesis developed a fouling index known as the Crossflow Sampler-Modified Fouling Index Ultrafiltration (CFS-MFIUF) measured under constant flux. CFS-MFIUF utilises a crossflow cell to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions in the actual RO units followed by a dead-end MFI assessment device to measure the fouling propensity of these foulants. CFS-MFIUF concept {{is based on the assumption}} that the particles that are able to permeate through the CFS surface represent the particles that will be attached on the RO surface and could not be detached later on. CFS-MFIUF was compared against the conventional fouling index, Modified Fouling Index-Ultrafiltration constant flux (MFI-UFconst. flux). The results indicated that the MFI-UFconst. flux tends to predict a higher fouling propensity by 10 to 40 %. This discrepancy highlighted the hydrodynamic fractionation of the feed by the CFS. Factors affecting the performance of CFS-MFIUF have been thoroughly investigated, ii and it was found sensitive to both crossflow velocity and permeate fluxes. The CFSMFIUF test has been further streamlined by means of reducing the duration of the test to less than 2 hour by scaling performance at high fluxes to typical RO fluxes through a flux correction factor. This flux correction factor was proposed to correlate the CFSMFIUF measured at dead-end flux of 120 LMH to CFS-MFIUF measured at dead-end flux of 20 LMH for RO fouling rate prediction at crossflow velocity of 0. 37 m/s. CFS-MFIUF was then applied to predict fouling in a lab scale RO and was able to accurately predict transmembrane pressure (TMP) rise under no salt conditions. However, data from the CFS-MFIUF for high salinity suspension was found to underestimate the TMP rise in RO possibly due to the occurrence of cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) effect. As a result, the concept of CFS-MFIUF has been extended to include the CEOP effect due to cake formation. The new model combining CFS-MFIUF and CEOP effect provides a good estimation on the RO fouling profile. The results indicated that CFS-MFIUF offers numerous advantages over the existing fouling indices. CFS-MFIUF combining with CEOP may be a more realistic approach to determine fouling propensity of feed water prior to the RO units. Additional studies on the effects of cake thickness and porosity on CEOP have been conducted. The results indicated that the structure of the deposit can significantly influence the CEOP effect, in particularly the cake porosity. For the same amount of foulant, CEOP appears to be more dominant with the cake with lower cake porosity...|$|R
25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better <b>feedwater</b> quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total <b>feedwater</b> supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating <b>feedwater</b> pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of <b>feedwater.</b> Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
25|$|Operation of an {{evaporator}} {{represents a}} costly consumption of main boiler steam, thus fuel. Evaporators for a warship {{must also be}} adequate to supply the boilers at continuous full power when required, {{even though this is}} rarely required. Varying the vacuum under which the evaporator works, and thus the boiling point of the <b>feedwater,</b> may optimise production for either maximum output, or better efficiency, depending on which is needed at the time. Greatest output is achieved when the evaporator operates at near atmospheric pressure and a high temperature (for saturated steam this will be at a limit of 100°C), which may then have an efficiency of 0.87kg of <b>feedwater</b> produced for each kg of steam supplied.|$|E
25|$|The locomotive's two {{cylinders}} {{were inside}} the frame and it was equipped with Stephenson valve gear. Its two <b>feedwater</b> pumps were actuated by the piston crossheads. As built, the engine had an open cab, but a cab roof was installed some years later.|$|E
25|$|The reactor is {{tripped in}} cases of high or low water level in the steam {{separators}} (with two selectable low-level thresholds); high steam pressure; low <b>feedwater</b> flow; loss of two main coolant pumps on either side. These trips can be manually disabled.|$|E
25|$|At each {{stroke the}} warm {{condensate}} was drawn {{off from the}} condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump, which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the power cylinder. The still-warm condensate was recycled as <b>feedwater</b> for the boiler.|$|E
25|$|If {{condenser}} vacuum {{is increased}} to its maximum, evaporator temperature {{may be reduced}} to around 72°C. Efficiency increases until the mass of <b>feedwater</b> produced almost equals that of the supplied steam, although production is now restricted to 86% of the previous maximum.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 an {{experimental}} A.C.F.I. (Accessoires pour les Chemins de Fer et l'Industrie) <b>feedwater</b> heater was fitted to A2 973. However, {{there was not}} sufficient improvement in efficiency for the equipment to be fitted to other locomotives and it was removed twelve years later.|$|E
25|$|As built, {{however, the}} class was lacking {{much in the way}} of modern {{appliances}} due to the PRR's conservatism; features missing included a mechanical stoker, power reverse, and a <b>feedwater</b> heater, although most of the class were later given a stoker and all received power reverse.|$|E
25|$|DM {{were the}} only Yellowstones to have a {{high-capacity}} pedestal or centipede tender, and had roller bearings on all axles. Some of the locomotives had a cylindrical Elesco <b>feedwater</b> heater ahead of the smoke stack, while others had a Worthington unit with its rectangular box in the same location.|$|E
25|$|The same {{reaction}} was used on steamships {{in order to}} determine whether or not boiler <b>feedwater</b> had been contaminated with seawater. It is still used to determine if moisture on formerly dry cargo is a result of condensation from humid air, or from seawater leaking through the hull.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively the 'double flow' boiler {{retained}} full {{gas flow}} through both sides, although {{only one of}} these contained a superheater. A controllable baffle on the non-superheated side could be closed to increase flow through the superheater. These boilers usually incorporated additional <b>feedwater</b> heaters in the updraught above these baffles.|$|E
25|$|The 1925 {{design was}} by Milwaukee Road Chief Mechanical Engineer C. H. Bilty, with detail design by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, who {{actually}} built them. They represented {{the best of}} American locomotive practice at the time, and were given all the latest devices and fittings. A Coffin <b>feedwater</b> heater was fitted, which was the Milwaukee's favorite type; this was installed flush in the extended smokebox, and thus {{was not at all}} obvious. Possibly because of this, the boiler lagging was continued over the smokebox, which was not common; most North American locomotives had bare smokeboxes which were graphited, rather than painted. The associated steam-driven centrifugal water pump was located under the cab at the left rear. The class F6-a was fitted with the tender-mounted Wilson Water Conditioner instead of the Coffin <b>feedwater</b> heater.|$|E
25|$|Water in {{the tank}} is {{slightly}} pre-heated by the boiler, which reduces the loss of pressure found when cold <b>feedwater</b> is injected into the boiler. However, if the water becomes too hot, injectors lose efficiency and can fail. For this reason, the tanks often stopped short of the hotter and uninsulated smokebox.|$|E
25|$|With {{the steam}} {{generators}} no longer receiving <b>feedwater,</b> heat and pressure {{increased in the}} reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer {{being used by the}} turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{secondary}} <b>feedwater</b> pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves {{had been closed}} for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water. The closure of these valves {{was a violation of}} a key Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.|$|E
25|$|In May 1909, Velox {{was passing}} Lands End when her port engines failed and heavy rolling caused {{a loss of}} <b>feedwater</b> supply to her condensers. This almost caused a {{complete}} loss of power off a dangerous lee shore. After this incident, Velox was transferred from normal flotilla duty to be attached to HMS Vernon, the Royal Navy's torpedo establishment as a training vessel. As such, Velox would not need to operate in poor weather which could cause a similar failure.|$|E
25|$|The eleven {{locomotives}} in {{the class}} had condensing apparatus that fed the exhaust steam {{back into the water}} tanks. The tanks themselves were shortened {{to make room for the}} external exhaust pipes and were extended down to the footplate in front of the cab to increase their capacity. As condensing the steam heated the water, a reciprocating pump (Weir pump) was fitted as a boiler <b>feedwater</b> pump because standard injectors will not work with hot water. The pumps led to (unsuccessful) tests with these locomotives acting as fire engines during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a double-layered casing with an air gap and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own <b>feedwater</b> pump, and a <b>feedwater</b> regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E
25|$|The turbine {{consists}} of one high-pressure rotor and four low-pressure ones. Five low-pressure separators-preheaters {{are used to}} heat steam with fresh steam before being fed to {{the next stage of}} the turbine. The uncondensed steam is fed into a condenser, mixed with condensate from the separators, fed by the first-stage condensate pump to a chemical purifier, then by a second-stage condensate pump to four deaerators where dissolved and entrained gases are removed; deaerators also serve as storage tanks for <b>feedwater.</b> From the deaerators, the water is pumped through filters and into the bottom parts of the steam separator drums.|$|E
25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the exhaust steam <b>feedwater</b> heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E
