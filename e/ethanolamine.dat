25|$|British {{scientist}} James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. In 1988, he {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Propranolol was inspired by the early β-adrenergic antagonists dichloroisoprenaline and pronethalol. The key difference, which was carried through to essentially all subsequent beta blockers, was the inclusion of an oxymethylene group (-O-CH2-) between the aryl and <b>ethanolamine</b> moieties of pronethalol, greatly increasing the potency of the compound. This also apparently eliminated the carcinogenicity found with pronethalol in animal models.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, ammonia {{can act as}} a {{nucleophile}} in substitution reactions. Amines can {{be formed}} by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH2 group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in 70% yield. <b>Ethanolamine</b> is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and triethanolamine.|$|E

2500|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{are found}} in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. They surround cells and organelles with a semi-permeable barrier that prevents free flow of substances. The membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer structure and often embedded or otherwise associated proteins, along with cholesterol and glycolipids. The phospholipid bilayer is a two-layer structure mainly composed of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic molecules that have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic region contains the polar head group. This region is exposed to aqueous substances located mainly in the exterior portion of the biomembrane. The hydrophilic region consists of the non-polar acyl chains or fatty acids groups facing {{the interior of the}} biomembrane. Phospholipids consist of two non-polar hydrocarbon chains with ester or ether bonds to the phosphate group which is also linked by ester or ether bonds to the polar hydrophilic region. The phospholipid carries a negative charge due to the presence of the phosphate group. Its overall polarity depends on the charges of the hydroxyl groups or alcohols such as choline, <b>ethanolamine,</b> inositol, serine, etc. attached to the phosphate group.

However, such conventional system has some drawbacks such as large plot area, high capital and operating costs. Hence, in this work the dividing wall column (DWC) technology will be applied to separate the <b>ethanolamines.</b> It has been known that usage of DWCs allows for both capital and operating savings when compared to conventional distillation arrangements. The objective of this project is to investigate and design a separation system for fractionation of the <b>ethanolamines</b> and water by using a DWC in order to save both energy and capital cost. A number of different DWC systems will be modelled to find the best possible solution. To achieve this objective, the first step will be to simulate and to optimise the conventional system in order to understand its operating condition. The second step will be to model DWCs with different divvied wall arrangement. The final task will be to carry on a comparison of all designed distillation systems to evaluate which arrangement is the best solution for fractionation of the <b>ethanolamines.</b> The results show that the DWC design will both save more capital and utility cost than conventional columns arrangement, which means DWC design saves column sizing and heat duty...|$|R

Carbamate formation is more favorable than bicarbonate formation for monoethanolamine (MEA) both kinetically and thermodynamically. Increase of the steric hindrance on the C atoms around the N atom in substituted <b>ethanolamines</b> favors bicarbonate formation over carbamate formation with lower activation barriers and thereby higher reaction rates. In contrast, substitution by an N-methyl or N-ethyl group on MEA leads to a lower activation barrier for both carbamate formation and bicarbonate formation.
