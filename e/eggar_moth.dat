50|$|The townland is also {{a habitat}} for Hemaris tityus, the {{daylight}} flying Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth (which looks quite similar to a bumble bee), Trichiura crataegi, the narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth, Trichiura crataegi, the pale <b>Eggar</b> <b>moth</b> (only Northern Irish recording) and Eulamprotes unicolorella, the twirling moth.|$|E
5000|$|Like most tachinid flies, {{the female}} lays her eggs on other living insect larva, the fly larvae then develop inside the living host, devouring it and {{eventually}} killing it. Its main hosts are the large hairy Lepidopteran caterpillars, particularly the Oak <b>eggar</b> <b>moth</b> Lasiocampa quercus and Macrothylacia rubi.|$|E
50|$|Streblote cristata is {{a species}} of moth in the family Lasiocampidae, the {{so-called}} <b>eggars,</b> snout <b>moths</b> or lappet moths.|$|R
50|$|The Lasiocampidae are {{a family}} of moths also known as <b>eggars,</b> snout <b>moths</b> (although this also refers to the Pyralidae), or lappet moths. Over 2,000 species occur worldwide, and {{probably}} not all have been named or studied.|$|R
50|$|Lasiocampa trifolii, {{the grass}} <b>eggar,</b> is a <b>moth</b> {{of the family}} Lasiocampidae. It is found in Europe.|$|R
50|$|In ectothermic animals, {{moderation}} of temperature, {{along with}} architectural modifications to absorb, trap or dissipate energy, maximises {{the rate of}} development, {{as in the case}} of the communal silk nests of the small <b>eggar</b> <b>moth</b> Eriogaster lanestris. The primary sources of energy for an animal are the sun and its metabolism. The dynamics of heat in animal shelters is influenced by the construction material which may act as a barrier, as a heat sink or to dissipate heat. The cocoons of insect are a case in point.|$|E
40|$|Defensive fluids {{obtained}} from the Garden Tiger, Scarlet Tiger and Burnet Moths and from the Monarch Butterfly and the Seven-Spot Ladybird Beetle, haemolymphs taken from the wasp, the Burying Beetle and the Rat Flea, and fluids from the eggs of the Garden Tiger, Gypsy Moth and Oak <b>Eggar</b> <b>Moth</b> were examined in the electron microscope after negative staining. Except for the ladybird all the defensive fluids, haemolymphs and egg fluids contained particles 100 - 150 A across which frequently had rectangular or square outlines. In some species the particles were occasionally arranged in groups of 2 and 4 and in the egg fluid of the Garden Tiger they were arranged in rows which were aligned side by side to form strands of considerable length. The particles {{are believed to be}} protein. They correspond in size to the 16 s component of the haemocyanin 8 of Limulus and Homarus and the protein particles found in Calliphora by other workers...|$|E
50|$|Lasiocampa quercus, the oak <b>eggar,</b> is a <b>moth</b> of {{the family}} Lasiocampidae found in Europe and the British Isles.|$|R
50|$|Eriogaster lanestris, {{the small}} <b>eggar,</b> is a <b>moth</b> {{of the family}} Lasiocampidae. It is found in most of Europe {{and much of the}} Palearctic ranging to the Amur River.|$|R
