25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty.

Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E

Fertilized fish eggs were placed in 36 hatching cones, each capable of hatching 200,000 American shad eggs, and feed valves regulated the current through the cones to keep the eggs <b>gently</b> <b>in</b> motion so they would not mat or settle to the bottom. Fish Hawk also had 18 hatching cylinders [...] each capable of holding 250,000 eggs [...] with wire gauze bottoms; the cylinders were suspended from beams hanging over the sides of the ship and partially submerged, with nine on each side. Cam machinery caused the cylinders to rise gently and drop more rapidly for about eight inches (20cm), which made the eggs circulate freely without settling on the bottom.|$|E
