5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of the new American policy of Vietnamization and in setting back any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers and placed a 30 June deadline for the withdrawal of American troops to South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The missionary {{position}} {{may involve}} sexual penetration or non-penetrative sex (for example, intercrural sex), and its penile-vaginal aspect {{is an example}} of ventro-ventral (front-to-front) reproductive activity. Variations of the position allow varying degrees of vaginal tightness, clitoral stimulation, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration,</b> participation {{on the part of the}} woman, and the likelihood and speed of orgasm.|$|E
25|$|The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> differs between species, {{with some}} being superficially {{confined}} to the epidermis (such as in Eucalyptus and Alnus), whereas in other cases the hyphae extend to the cortical cells or to the endodermis (as {{is the case in}} most gymnosperms). In many epidermal types, radial elongation of epidermal cells occurs. However, this is largely absent in the cortical type, suggesting different strategies of increasing surface contact among species.|$|E
50|$|Vertical {{resolution}} of MT mainly {{depends on the}} frequency being measured, as lower frequencies have greater <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> Accordingly, vertical resolution decreases as <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> investigation increases.|$|R
30|$|Bursting {{strength}} (Roy and Ray 2009 b) of {{nonwoven fabric}} increases with increase in fabric weight, needle punch density and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>penetration</b> {{and for a}} further increase in the optimum value of needle density and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>penetration,</b> reduction in bursting strength observed. With the increase in fabric weight (Roy and Ray 2009 a), bending modulus of nonwoven fabric increases, {{on the other hand}} bending modulus achieves maximum value with the increase in punch density and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>penetration,</b> but further increase in such density and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>penetration</b> reduces bending modulus. For fabric weight (Madhusoothanan et al. 1998), the study also shows the same trend for jute/viscose blend needle punched nonwoven fabric, but as the proportion of viscose, the fibre proportion increases with blend proportion the decrease in bending modulus observed.|$|R
40|$|A {{pneumatic}} gun for ballistic {{delivery of}} microparticles to soft targets is proposed and demonstrated. The particles are accelerated {{by a high}} speed flow of Helium in a capillary tube. Vacuum suction applied to a concentric, larger diameter tube is used to completely divert the flow of Helium from the gun nozzle and prevent it from hitting the target. <b>Depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> micron-sized gold particles into agarose gels and their speeds of ejection from the gun nozzle are measured...|$|R
25|$|A pillow or sex pillow (especially a firm one) can be used, {{to alter}} the depth and angle of penetration. A wedge- or ramp-shaped pillow can relieve {{pressure}} on the top person's hands and arms. Placing a pillow under the woman's buttocks can lift her pelvis—a Playboy article suggested placing it under her hips to increase pressure on the clitoris. Each of these methods can increase the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> Raising the clitoris generally allows easier access to it in this position. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back and avoid backache.|$|E
25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E
500|$|It was, however, {{difficult}} for the Air Force to do otherwise. Observation of the trail from the air was difficult at best. Human intelligence was provided by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating from {{the western side of}} the system while the eastern side was covered by SOG. [...] The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> by these reconnaissance efforts was hampered by the same man who had the last word in the bombing effort, Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane. The ambassador (with the full backing of the State Department and the CIA) maintained a firm hold over all military operations conducted within the supposedly [...] "neutral" [...] Kingdom of Laos. All targets had to be pre-approved either by Sullivan himself or by the air attaché within Project 404, the understaffed U.S. military operations center within the embassy.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate correlations between the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> water <b>penetration,</b> chloride permeability, and coefficient of chloride diffusion in plain, silica fume, and fly ash cement concretes. A total of 27 concrete mixtures were prepared by varying the water to cementitious materials ratio and cementitious materials content and using Type I, fly ash (20 %), and silica fume (7. 5 %) cements. The test results were statistically analyzed to develop correlations between the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> water <b>penetration,</b> chloride permeability, and coefficient of chloride diffusion.

His limitations on SOG's operations (<b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration,</b> choice of targets, length of operations, etc.) led to immediate and continuous enmity between the embassy in Vientiane and the commander and troops of SOG, who promptly labelled Sullivan the [...] "Field Marshal."

40|$|AbstractThe work {{described}} in this paper uses the Holmquist-Johnson-Cook equation of state and constitutive model for concrete and appropriate material parameters derived from mechanical test data to perform numerical simulations <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> and perforation <b>of</b> adobe building material. Experimental results from the literature are modeled, and two-dimensional numerical simulations are carried out using the CTH Eulerian shock physics code. Two groups of simulations were performed {{in accordance with the}} experimental results. The first group is tungsten rod penetrators, with impact velocities ranging from 340 to 820 m/s, perforating adobe targets with thicknesses ranging from 71 to 497 mm, and comparison of the residual velocities predicted by the numerical simulations with the available experimental results. The second group is steel spheres, with impact velocities ranging from 500 to 3230 m/s, penetrating into adobe targets of semi-infinite thickness, and comparison <b>of</b> the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> predicted by the numerical simulations with the available experimental results.

2500|$|The missionary {{position}} is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact {{and opportunities to}} look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The {{position is}} also {{believed to be a}} good position for reproduction. [...] During sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to take charge of the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs. The position is less suitable for late stages of pregnancy, or when it is desired for the woman to have greater control over rhythm and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "Clark's level" [...] and {{melanoma}} prognosis Clark correlated {{the microscopic}} {{appearance of the}} tumor with careful followup of the progression of the tumor and the patient's outcome. From these studies he developed a five-part scale, based on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> of the lesion from the epidermis into the dermis {{and down to the}} subcutaneous tissue, which can be used to predict the likely progression of the tumor and the prognosis for the patient. While largely superseded by other prognostic attributes, [...] pathologists evaluating a melanoma still classify it according to its Clark's level, and treating physicians consider that information to choose the appropriate treatment. Clark and his colleagues also made seminal observations on the importance of mitotic rate and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in primary melanomas as important prognostic variables.|$|E
2500|$|This {{theory is}} false. [...] RF current does tend to flow {{on the surface}} of conductors, but the depth to which it penetrates, called skin depth, depends on the {{resistivity}} and permittivity of the material as well as the frequency. [...] Although skin effect limits currents of Tesla coil frequencies to the outer fraction of a millimeter in metal conductors, the skin depth of the current in body tissue is much deeper due to its higher resistivity and lower permittivity. [...] The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> of currents of Tesla frequency (0.1 - 1MHz) in human tissues is roughly 24 to 72cm (9 to 28 inches). [...] Thus skin effect has little influence on the path of the current through the body; it takes the path of lowest electrical impedance to ground, and can easily pass through the core of the body. [...] In the medical therapy called longwave diathermy, RF current of Tesla frequencies was used for decades for deep tissue warming, including heating internal organs such as the lungs. [...] Modern shortwave diathermy machines use a higher frequency of 27MHz, which would have a correspondingly smaller skin depth, yet these frequencies are still able to penetrate deep body tissues.|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} to water <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> cement combination concretes containing Portland cement (PC), fly ash (FA), and metakaolin (MK) have been investigated at different water/cement (w/c) ratios, 28 -day strengths, and <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> water <b>penetration</b> using their material costs and embodied carbon-dioxide (eCO 2) contents. Results revealed that, at equal w/c ratio, eCO 2 content reduced with increasing content of FA and MK. MK contributed to the 28 -day strengths more than FA. Compared with PC, FA reduced cost and increased the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> water <b>penetration,</b> MK increased cost and reduced the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> water <b>penetration,</b> and their ternary combinations become beneficial. At equal strengths and levels of {{resistance to}} water <b>penetration,</b> most <b>of</b> the cement combination concretes are more environmentally compatible and costlier than PC concrete.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different irrigating solutions used in final irrigation on <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> sealer <b>penetration</b> into dentinal tubules. Materials and Methods: Thirty recently extracted, human mandibular premolar teeth with single canals were randomly divided into two groups, and one of the two irrigants was used in each group - Group A (Chitosan) and Group B (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). All the teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH 26 ® sealer labeled with fluorescent dye. The teeth were sectioned at distances 2, 5, and 8 mm from the root apex. Maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> sealer <b>penetration</b> was measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis used One-way analysis of variance and t-test. Results: At coronal third depth, the sealer penetration was greater in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) group; however, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> sealer <b>penetration</b> was greater at apical third in chitosan group.

2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie {{on her back}} with her hips {{on the edge of}} a {{platform}} such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.|$|E
