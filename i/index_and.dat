Content Based Image Retrieval {{is one of the most}} powerful research areas nowadays for searching in image database. To achieve speed and to improve accuracy in retrieval of similar images, one approach is to use correlogram feature for <b>indexing</b> <b>and</b> retrieval. This Paper provides a comprehensive survey of the methods of image <b>indexing</b> <b>and</b> retrieval using correlograms described in literature. In particular, image <b>indexing</b> <b>and</b> features used for <b>indexing</b> <b>and</b> retrieval and measures adopted to compute the similarity between features of two images are critically analysed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the soil spectral contribution and influence in {{the accuracy of the}} vegetation <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> spectral variables under different canopy densities. In the orbital image, three sampling units were defined on the soil class with different spectral behavior.

It was applied the spectral mixing linear model (MLME) to estimate vegetation amount from de spectral data and to group the sampling unit pixels according to vegetable covering levels. After, relations between spectral information (<b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> variables) and background albedo variations were determined and the participation of the soil reflectance in the <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> variables was estimated. Up until 50 % of the vegetable covering all vegetation <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> spectral variables, except ND 73, showed soil influence. With high canopy density (above 60 %) the soil effect was eliminated only in the ND 53, ND 73 <b>and</b> NDVI <b>indexes.</b> Pages: 3119 - 312...|$|R
