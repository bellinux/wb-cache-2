25|$|The {{complaint}} {{sets out}} a detailed {{view of the}} {{events leading up to}} the case, the university's response, and the subsequent unraveling of the case; it alleges corruption and collusion between Duke, the hospital, and Nifong. It accuses the university of refusing to enforce its own anti-discrimination policies as to faculty and student harassment of the lacrosse players, and of violating federal law when it issued team <b>key-card</b> access data to the Police without a warrant, and subsequently attempted to cover up the disclosure.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{university}} opened two on-campus housing buildings at the Rosen College of Hospitality Management. The dorms {{are able to}} house 400 residents and 8 resident assistants. The community includes an outdoor pool, community center, outdoor grill area, and <b>key-card</b> only access to the building. The campus is under the law enforcement jurisdiction of the UCF Police Department and provides shuttles to the main campus on class days.

500|$|Alien: Isolation runs on a {{proprietary}} engine {{that was built}} from scratch by the Creative Assembly. The engine allowed the development team to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects {{as well as the}} alien's behavioural design. The engine's deferred rendering allowed artists to both place [...] "hundreds of dynamic lights in the scene" [...] and achieve great geometric detail. The alien itself was designed to look similar to H. R. Giger's original design for the creature from the film, including the skull underneath its semitransparent head. However, the designers did alter its humanoid legs with recurved ones to provide the alien a walk cycle that would hold up to scrutiny during longer encounters with the player. Between 70 and 80 different sets of animation for the alien were created. The alien's artificial intelligence was programmed with a complex set of behavioural designs that slowly unlock as it encounters the player, creating the illusion that the alien learns from each interaction and appropriately adjusts its hunting strategy. As gameplay designer Gary Napper explains, [...] "We needed something that would be different every time you played it. You’re going to die a lot, which means restarting a lot, and if the alien was scripted, you’d see the same behaviour. That makes the alien become predictable, and a lot less scary." [...] The save system was inspired by a scene in the film where Captain Dallas uses a <b>key-card</b> to access Nostromos computer, Mother.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a technique to}} reliably and securely identify individual integrated circuits (ICs) based on the precise measurement of circuit delays and a simple challenge–response protocol. This technique {{could be used to}} produce <b>key-cards</b> that are more difficult to clone than ones involving digital keys on the IC. We consider potential venues of attack against our system, and present candidate implementations. Experiments on Field Programmable Gate Arrays show that the technique is viable, but that our current implementations could require some strengthening before it can be considered as secure.

50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{takes on}} a 3D-esque isometric view, in which the player chooses one of four mercenaries to lead through the levels. The characters act as lives, and if one were killed, the player still has the choice among the remaining mercenaries (rather than having multiple lives for one character). In the levels, the player must find <b>key-cards,</b> destroy guards, aliens, and robots, activate laser bridges, to complete an objective. Objectives include finding the exit to the level, assassination of an officer, escorting a defect or other important official, retrieving an item (usually a memory chip or the like), or obtaining {{a certain percentage of}} kills in the area.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{cryptographic}} protocols {{are based}} on the premise that only authorized participants can obtain secret keys and access to information systems. However, sophisticated tampering methods have been devised to extract secret keys stored in digital integrated circuits (ICs) from conditional access systems such as smartcards and ATMs. Arbiter-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) is proposed to exploit the statistical delay variation of wires and transistors across ICs in a manufacturing process to build unextractable secret keys. We fabricated arbiter-based PUFs in custom silicon and investigated the identification capability, reliability, and security of this scheme. Experimental results and theoretical studies show that a sufficient amount of inter-chip variation exists to enable each IC to be identified reliably and securely over a practical range of environmental variations such as temperature and power supply voltage. We show that arbiter-based PUFs are realizable and well-suited to build, for example, <b>key-cards</b> that need to be resistant to physical tampering attacks. ...|$|R
50|$|The game is {{very similar}} to the Resident Evil series: third-person perspective; fixed camera angle; tank controls; “Vac-Tubes” in the place of item boxes; and colored <b>key-cards.</b> The game focus heavily on puzzle solving and exploration, rather than combat. However the combat system focuses on crowd control or {{dispatching}} small and weak enemies as it is easy to become overwhelmed by enemies such as the non-dead who walk at exactly the same pace as the player. The game is centered on three playable characters that are separated. This separate trio gimmick is similar to Day of the Tentacle. One of the unique features of the game is that if the characters ever meet face-to-face, it will result in a game over. However the player can easily and quickly switch to any character at any moment. A radio is used for easy communication. It is recommended that the player finds a ‘safe area’ before switching characters. The characters have a very limited inventory. Because the characters cannot meet they can trade items using the Vac-Tubes that are scattered throughout the base. The Vac-Tubes can carry up to four items to another hatch connected to the Vac-Tubes anywhere in the base. If the player needs to leave behind items the Vac-Tubes can hold up six items. If the player is unsure where they left an item, it can be checked using any in-game computer to bring up the list of contents of any hatch, including ones that have not been accessed yet.|$|R
40|$|Near field {{communication}} (Nfc), a contact-range and short-lived message exchange technology, has {{in recent years}} become popular in relation to payment-cards, <b>key-cards</b> and ski-passes. With the release of, in particular, the Google Nexus S, which is capable of reading and writing Nfc tags as well as exchanging messages between devices by touch, the roles of consumers have changed from carriers of passive cards to that of active readers. This publicly available hardware technology, embedded into relatively cheap connected smartphones, creates a new field of possibilities in which a complete and complex Nfc-based system can be developed solely by means of software. In this thesis work, the research is {{in relation to the}} field of Nfc, ranging from the physical characteristics of the technology to the design of the Nfc API on the Android platform. Nfc-based apps, library and systems are designed, developed and evaluated in terms of performance. The Android apps which are implemented are WiFi and Bluetooth connectors as well as an Nfc-sensor value visualizer. Additionally, two full systems are developed which consists of an Android app, backend server, database and web or PC-client frontend. These two systems are: a web-based high-performance live statistical visualizer of Nfc sensor values and an Nfc-scan based product endorsement, Like-event, presenting the picture and name of a user endorsing a product on the in-store advertisement displays on top of the ads. The system for scanning, distributing and presenting statistics on sensor-values from a specially crafted NfcV-enabled sensor is evaluated in terms of performance along the chain of events starting at the Nfc tag introduction and being dispatched on the mobile phone and ending with the calculations and plot-generation carried out by the browser connected to the backend via a WebSocket. The evaluations show that in a use-case in which the user holds a tablet in one hand and an Nfc-enabled smartphone in the other, the user would experience a mean-delay of 515 milliseconds between putting the device against an NfcV-sensor and seeing the statistical plot, containing the last 1000 values, updated in the browser on the tablet. Additionally, the user would experience a mean-delay of 74 milliseconds between the values being presented on the mobile device itself until they are presented on the tablet in the case of constant streaming from an NfcV connected sensor. The conclusion is that this delay of 74 milliseconds is sufficiently low for the user to feel that the devices are tightly coupled, making it natural {{to pay attention to the}} tablet when scanning sensors. Possible use-cases for this include a technician walking between built-in passive NfcV sensors on the factory floor or a nurse walking between patients wearing bandages with built-in passive health-sensors. Finally, the work is discussed in terms of ethics and social impact as development in the tele-healthcare field continues, and a set of Nfc-based applications are suggested including Nfc-tags for interactive product customization, company car management and app deployment...|$|R

50|$|After {{the second}} {{dimension}} is saved, Casper {{goes to the}} third dimension, a lab. Casper will meet Professor Neutron who had built a machine that will make monsters for Kibosh, just because Kibosh told him to. The professor needs help to stop it by going around in circles to activate a genreator, go in tubes in the correct order, defeat robot wasp's, and pull a big switch. The professor will give him half of a <b>key-card.</b> Casper will meet a robot named Charlie, who will need help with his big brother robot, George who has been turn off by Kibosh. In order to turn him back on, he needs five keys. One for his head, two for his arms, and two for his legs. In {{order to get the}} keys, Casper will have to take down laser currents of the same color as the keys are. After that, George will give him {{the other half of the}} <b>key-card.</b> Casper will have to defeat Professor Neutron's arch enemy, Doctor Deranged. In order to defeat him, you need ram his robot and shoot its red light.|$|E
50|$|VCA {{can track}} {{people on a}} map by calculating their {{position}} from the images. It is then possible to link many cameras and track a person through an entire building or area. This can allow a person to be followed without having to analyze many hours of film. Currently the cameras have difficulty identifying individuals from video alone, but if connected to a <b>key-card</b> system, identities can be established and displayed as a tag over their heads on the video.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem can}} also {{occur when the}} agreed trump suit is diamonds, {{although}} it is less likely because there is more space available for responses than when the agreed trump suit is clubs. But if the partnership is using Roman <b>Key-Card</b> Blackwood there can be similar problems. Suppose that hearts is agreed, asker has one ace and teller has one ace plus {{the king and queen}} of hearts. Asker bids 4NT and teller bids 5 to show two key cards plus the trump queen, and the partnership is again too high.|$|E
50|$|Often non-experts ask for aces {{when they}} really need other {{information}} from partner, acting act as if the convention is designed to ascertain whether the partnership holds all of the four aces or five key-cards. In fact the fundamental purpose should usually be to distinguish between lacking one and lacking two, because lacking two aces makes slam a bad bet. In other words, ace and <b>key-card</b> asking conventions should normally be used by one member of a partnership who plans at least to contract for 12 tricks if {{no more than one}} ace or key card is lacking.|$|E
