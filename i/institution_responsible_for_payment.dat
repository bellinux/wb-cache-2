30|$|Another problem {{associated}} with Federal Law No. 217 is the uncertainty concerning {{intellectual property rights}} after a small innovative enterprise has been created. As in stands, the universities use the following procedure to protect intellectual property: the organization tries to get patents for as many results of the research as possible by patenting the inventions, utility, models or designs. Under these, the institution is the rights holder and the employee is the author. This means the educational or research <b>institution</b> is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of patent taxes {{as well as of}} royalties to the inventor, if the patent brings commercial profit. Further use of the patent is regulated by license agreements. That is, if the author wants to develop the innovation himself, the patent is transferable to a small innovative enterprise affiliated to the university under the conditions of a share capital subscription. Otherwise, the organization seeks to find a customer interested in using the patent in the production process.|$|R

In the system the social work was professionalised, and that not only in case of the <b>institutions</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> realisation of <b>payment</b> of the social benefits, but also in case of non-profit organizations. Despite the fact the system is capable of and does react to the changes in society, the clients remain in its care on a long-term basis.
