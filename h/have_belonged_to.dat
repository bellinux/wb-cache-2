5|$|Since 1905 Alberta's premiers <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> five {{different}} political parties, {{the most of}} any Canadian province. However, there have been only four changes of government, as no defeated party has yet returned to power.|$|E
5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E

50|$|Until 1780 {{the village}} was Bavarian. Since the Treaty of Teschen, it <b>has</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Austria. In the Napoleonic Wars it was briefly Bavarian again, but since 1814 it <b>has</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Upper Austria.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, the old Bezirksamt (“Regional Amt”) of Neustadt {{became the}} Neustadt district. Since {{administrative}} reform early in 1969, Ellerstadt <b>has</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> the Verbandsgemeinde of Wachenheim, {{and since the}} dissolution of the Neustadt district, it <b>has</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> the Bad Dürkheim district.|$|R
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> an unidentified 169th victim or could <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the {{historian}} Wolfram Pobanz {{declared that the}} copy of the giant globe with a bullet hole in the Berlin museum is not Hitler's, but another one that is thought to <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi foreign minister, and with no clue as to where the Globe that belonged to Hitler is today.|$|E

5|$|The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera Diplodocus and Barosaurus {{had very}} similar limb bones.

5|$|A {{circular}} keep was constructed, {{probably in}} the late-12th century, on the castle's motte, along with two stone gatehouses and towers along the walls. The wooden buildings in the bailey were rebuilt in stone and the construction work spread up onto the inside edges of the ramparts. Some of these houses may <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> {{the members of the}} castle-guard, feudal knights who were granted local estates in return for helping to defend the castle.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E

5|$|The {{memory of}} Ivan Shishman {{remained}} {{during the first}} centuries of the Ottoman rule. During the First Tarnovo Uprising in 1598, {{the one of the}} rebels' leaders, whose name is unknown, claimed to have been a descendent of Ivan Shishman and was proclaimed emperor under the name Shishman III. Almost a century later, in 1686, a second uprising in Tarnovo was headed by Rostislav Stratimirovic, who also claimed to <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> the Shishman dynasty and styled himself as Prince of Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{horses were}} present in Bronze Age Britain from around 2000BC. Bronze Age horse trappings {{including}} snaffle bits have been found which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; Bronze Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815BC, though these may <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> vehicles pulled by oxen. Early Bronze Age evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late Bronze Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E
5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E

5|$|In general, Uyghurs and {{the mostly}} Han {{government}} disagree on which group has greater historical {{claim to the}} Xinjiang region: Uyghurs believe their ancestors were indigenous to the area, whereas government policy considers present-day Xinjiang to <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> China since around 200BC. According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an indigenous group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more indigenous to Xinjiang than the Han, and have no special rights to the land under the law. The People's Republic has presided over the migration into Xinjiang of millions of Han, who dominate the region economically and politically.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the identities of the}} men who served on the Mary Rose, even {{when it comes to the}} names of the officers, who would <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> the gentry. Two admirals and four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, pursers, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic science has been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, and the results were publicized in May 2013. In addition, {{researchers}} have extracted DNA from remains in the hopes of identifying origins of crew, and potentially living descendants.|$|E
5|$|Patricius {{was praised}} {{in the third}} preface of the Justinian Digest (Tanta-Dedoken) as a {{distinguished}} professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut {{at the turn of}} the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to <b>have</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Patricius. The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian Zacharias Rhetor, who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of Praetorian prefect of the East under Emperor Anastasius I between 503 and 504, and became Magister militum in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian. His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's Libri ad Edictum.|$|E
