[...] On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated:"The decision was simple – the church has to move if the airport is to survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go ahead, will be lost. It is not just a case of expansion.

50|$|Boulder City high school's flag {{football}} team is notable for the dominating program and state championship in 2015. Flag football became a CCSD girls {{sport in the}} 2012-2013 school year as a winter sport. Unlike other sports, {{flag football}} was based on location and region, not by student population. This caused a disadvantage to smaller schools having to play larger schools <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bracket</b> for the CCSD title.The first season the lady eagles barely missed a play off spot ending {{with a record of}} 8-10. In the returning season of 2013-2014, the lady eagles returned 9 varisity players and came back with an undefeated regular season of 18-0 to take the Southeast title. The lady eagles continued on to the Sunrise Championship where they fell to Green Valley 13-18. The lady eagles ended the 2013-2014 season with the record of 20-1, tying Green Valley's record from the 2012-2013 season for the most wins in one season. In May 2014, the first All Star Flag football game was held at Foothill High School. Boulder City had 4 girls qualify to represent the Sunrise Team in the All star game: Jeanne Carmel (quarterback/cornerback), Logan Kanaley (running back/outside linebacker), Jane Nevarez (wide receiver/cornerback) and Kinsey Smyth (wide receiver/safety). Boulder City head coach, Chris Morelli was nominated head coach of the Sunrise Team, leading the Sunrise team to the victory over the Sunset All stars.Returning for the 2014-2015 school year, the lady eagles came back for another dominating season. The Lady Eagles went undefeated again in regular season, to take the Southeast Title and end again with an 18-0 season. Post season the lady eagles continued to move forward in the tournament blanking opponents like Del Sol and Green Valley. The Flag Football team {{went on to win the}} Sunrise title against Foothill, beating the Falcons 20-0 and securing their spot in the state game. The state game was located at Del Sol High School where Boulder City played the Sunset Champions, Centennial.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that on heating {{germanium}} crystals in hydrogen or in vacuum at temperatures 570 ~ 176 deterioration of the 111 planes takes place. Temperature gradients and adsorbed impurities are the probable causes of the deterioration. Impurities cause the formation of etch- and growth-structures which in their absence would be unstable. When prepar ing devices from germanium, one often has to heat the crystals to high temperatures. For example, in the epitaxial deposit ion of germa-n ium or gal l ium arsenide on german ium substrates, the latter are exposed to high temperatures dur ing outgassing, when impurit ies, especially oxides, are removed from the surface. This work was under-taken to examine whether the smoothness of the german ium surface can be preserved under such conditions.

40|$|Comparison of the {{frictional}} {{characteristics of}} aesthetic orthodontic brackets measured using a modified in vitro technique Objective: The coefficients of friction (COFs) of aesthetic ceramic and stain-less steel brackets {{used in conjunction}} with stainless steel archwires were investigated using a modified linear tribometer and special computer software, and the effects of the bracket slot size (0. 018 inches [in] or 0. 022 in) and materials (ceramic or metal) on the COF were determined. Methods: Four types of ceramic (one with a stainless steel slot) and one conventional stainless steel bracket were tested with two types of archwire sizes: a 0. 017 × 0. 025 -in wire in the 0. 018 -in slots and a 0. 019 × 0. 025 -in wire in the 0. 022 -in slot brackets. For pairwise comparisons between the 0. 018 -in and 0. 022 -in slot sizes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bracket,</b> an independent sample t-test was used. One-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post-hoc test at the 95 % confidence level (α = 0. 05) were also used for statistical analyses. Results: There were significant differences between the 0. 022 -in and 0. 018 -in slot sizes for the same brand of bracket. ANOVA also showed that both slot size and bracket slot material had significant effects on COF values (p < 0. 001). The ceramic bracket with a 0. 022 -in stainless steel slot showed the lowest mean COF (m = 0. 18), followed by the conventional stainless steel bracket with a 0. 022 -in slot (m = 0. 21). The monocrystalline alumina ceramic bracket with a 0. 018 -in slot had the highest COF (m = 0. 85). Conclusions: Brackets with stainless steel slots exhibit lower COFs than ceramic slot brackets. All brackets show lower COFs as the slot size increases. [Korean J Orthod 2015; 45 (1) : 29 - 37...|$|E
