With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the wild west-oriented role-playing game Boot Hill. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine The Strategic Review with himself as editor. But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired Tim Kask as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical The Dragon, with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981). The Dragon debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: [...] "When I decided that The Strategic Review was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce The Dragon, I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan." ...|$|E
500|$|Although both singers {{worked with}} {{producer}} Benny Blanco in studio on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears recorded her vocals {{for the song}} before Sabi, who actually raps on the track. The latter also revealed she felt lucky and honored because Spears does not do features often, while commenting that [...] "it's just pretty crazy, I mean, I grew up watching Britney Spears. All my friends watched Britney Spears and we even had a routine to [...] that we were gonna perform, like, for a middle-school talent show. So it's a dream come true. Never <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> think that I'd be in the mix with Britney. I'm just lucky." [...] When asked about how she learned about Sabi {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Spears revealed, [...] "friends and people around me are always showing me new artists that they love and that's how I learned about Sabi and ended up working with her on '(Drop Dead) Beautiful'. I have always wanted to feature a new artist on one of my albums and she is really cool." [...] A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on March 7, 2011. Four days later, it leaked in full online, along with another Femme Fatale track, [...] "Inside Out". On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be [...] "Criminal", [...] "Inside Out" [...] or [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." [...] After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that [...] "Criminal" [...] was chosen as the fourth single.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning praised [...] "The Funcooker" [...] {{writing that}} it was fantastic and [...] "never felt like a moment was wasted or that a scene was extraneous." [...] He enjoyed all the storylines in the episode, writing they were interesting and funny enough, and complimented the way they all tied together with such ease. Canning enjoyed Tracy's actions writing that they fit perfectly for the Tracy character, and gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10 rating. [...] "Holy normalsauce, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> love this episode", wrote Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons. Her only complaint about this episode was Scott Adsit's absence. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was grateful that the episode focused on NBC, TGS, {{and the work of}} the staff. Sassone wrote that despite [...] "The Funcooker" [...] not being [...] "the most laugh-out-loud episode" [...] he believed it was still funny. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised Jackie Hoffman's performance, noting that her monologue in court was brilliant. He enjoyed all of the episode's storylines, except for Tracy's, which he opined fell flat. In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode a B+ rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall wrote that an episode like [...] "The Funcooker" [...] is [...] "really instructive about why a lot of other shows... haven't quite worked. Even when they have lots of funny things in them, they never really build to a climax in the way that this one did, as everything went wrong at once." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Tina Fey's Liz in the episode, noting that her craziness worked well, but his concern was that when Liz loses it [...] "there's nobody sane for her to push against." ...|$|E

500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily {{jumps up and}} down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E

[...] Wang Du barely escaped from Wang Chuzhi's grasp. [...] Shortly after, Wang Chuzhi either died in anger or was killed by Wang Du.|$|E
2500|$|When Clancy {{was imprisoned}} in 1920, he participated {{a hunger strike}} with his fellow prisoners. It was here that Todd Andrews first met him. In his memoir, Dublin Made Me, Andrews {{described}} Clancy's personality: [...] "I was overcome by the extraordinary impact which Clancy’s personality had on me. I had never heard or seen Clancy before nor indeed <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> see him again but he left an indelible impression of the superman, a man whose commands I at least would have a compulsion to obey as if I had been hypnotised ... In the presence of Clancy I felt a mere puppet on a string." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{witness who}} testified {{on behalf of}} then-Judge Thomas was Nancy Fitch, a special {{assistant}} historian to Thomas at EEOC, who said [...] "here is no way" [...] Thomas did what Hill alleged. [...] "I know he did no such thing," [...] she declared under oath. Also Diane Holt, Thomas' personal secretary for six years, said that, [...] "At no time did Professor Hill intimate, {{not even in the}} most subtle of ways, that Judge Thomas was asking her out or subjecting her to the crude, abusive conversations that have been described. Nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> discern any discomfort, when Professor Hill was in Judge Thomas' presence." [...] Additionally, Phyllis Berry-Myers, another special assistant to Thomas, said that he [...] "was respectful, demand of excellence in our work, cordial, professional, interested in our lives and our career ambitions". Berry-Myers said that her [...] "impression" [...] was that Professor Hill desired a greater relationship with Judge Thomas than [...] "just a professional one".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> have in the world?".|$|E
