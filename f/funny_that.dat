5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so <b>funny</b> <b>that</b> he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? <b>Funny,</b> <b>that</b> was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

500|$|Bilingualism in a Germanic {{language}} and Latin was {{especially important in}} the military for officers in command of units recruited from Germanic-speaking areas. Tacitus observes that Arminius, the Cheruscan officer who later led a disastrously successful rebellion against the Romans, was bilingual. The emperor Julian employed a bilingual Germanic military tribune as a spy. The officers and secretaries who kept the records preserved in the Vindolanda tablets were Batavian, but their Latin contains no hint; the common soldiers of their units, however, may have retained their Germanic speech. Less commonly, Latin-speaking officers learned a Germanic language through their service and acted as interpreters. Acquiring Germanic might {{be regarded as a}} dubious achievement inducing anxieties of [...] "barbarism": in 5th-century Gaul, Sidonius thinks it <b>funny</b> <b>that</b> his learned friend Syagrius has become fluent in Germanic.|$|E

The line was improvised by Aziz Ansari and, originally, the song was not playing, but Michael Schur said the line was so <b>funny</b> <b>that</b> he successfully sought permission to use the song and added it to the background in post-production. [...] At the Freddy Spaghetti concert, Leslie asks a little girl which song was her favorite, to which she replies [...] "Penne and the Jets", a pasta-inspired version of the Elton John song [...] "Benny and the Jets".

Kotakus Kirk Hamilton described Ellie and Riley's kiss as [...] "video gaming's latest breakthrough moment", declaring it [...] "a big deal".

Parker {{said he did not}} really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but he came up with the concept because he found it <b>funny</b> <b>that</b> such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. Parker said he had always wondered how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with [...] "people leaving tons of food on their plates", which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die {{at the end of the}} episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.|$|E
