40|$|The {{presence}} of cytochrome P- 450 and associated mono-oxygenase activities was examined in brain microsomes from {{male and female}} mice. Although the cytochrome P- 450 level <b>in</b> male <b>mouse</b> brain was very low as compared with mouse liver, the aminopyrine N-demethylase and morphine N-demethylase specific activities <b>in</b> male <b>mouse</b> brain were much higher than those observed <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> liver. Ethoxycoumarin O-de-ethylase and aniline hydroxylase activities were, however, not detected <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> brain. Sex-related differences were observed in both the cytochrome P- 450 levels and aminopyrine N-demethylase activity <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> brain, the levels of both being higher <b>in</b> male <b>mouse</b> brain as compared with female mouse brain. Aminopyrine N-demethylase activity <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> brain microsomes was dependent on the {{presence of}} oxygen and NADPH and could be inhibited by piperonyl butoxide, N-octyl imidazole and carbon monoxide. Antiserum raised to the phenobarbital-inducible form of rat liver cytochrome P- 450 [P- 450 (b+e) ] inhibited mouse brain aminopyrine N-demethylase activity by around 80 + mouse brain microsomal protein exhibited cross-reactivity against this antiserum when examined by Ouchterlony double diffusion and immunoblotting.

40|$|Background/Aims: MicroRNA- 29 b (miR 29 b) {{has been}} {{previously}} identified <b>in</b> early <b>mouse</b> embryos through miRNA microarray analysis. Recent {{research has indicated that}} miR 29 b participates in DNA methylation by regulating DNA methyltransferase 3 a/ 3 b (Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b) expression. However, the expression pattern and biological function of miR 29 b <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> preimplantation embryonic development remain unknown. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression patterns of miR 29 b and Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> early embryos at different developmental stages. Subsequently, expression and localization of DNMT 3 A/ 3 B protein was analyzed <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> early embryos by immunofluorescence staining. The biological function of miR 29 b <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> early embryos was analyzed by microinjection of commercially available miRNA-specific inhibitors and mimics. Results: Our data showed that Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b mRNA expression is negatively regulated by miR 29 b <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> early embryos. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that DNMT 3 A/ 3 B protein expression is predominantly localized within the nucleoplasm of embryos. Alterations to the activity of miR 29 b could change the DNA methylation levels <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> preimplantation embryos and lead to a developmental blockade, from the morula to the blastocyst stage. Conclusion: These results indicated a role for the miR 29 b-Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b-DNA methylation axis <b>in</b> <b>mouse</b> early embryonic development, and we provide evidence that miR 29 b is indispensable for mouse early embryonic development. This study contributes to a preliminary understanding of the role of miR 29 b during mouse embryonic development...|$|R
