5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create significant cost savings, but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were {{in line with the}} conclusions of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E
5|$|They {{continue}} {{toward the}} homestead, intending {{to return to}} the gas station once it has received a <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery.</b> When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole and the couple head off to find it. They stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk calls out for gas, entering through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) appears and kills Kirk with a hammer. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He sees the house and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him.|$|E

25|$|In an Engine Management System (EMS), {{electronics}} control <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> and ignition timing. Primary sensors on {{the system}} are crankshaft angle (crankshaft or Top Dead Center (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark {{at the right moment}} to burn it. Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with the}} changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E
25|$|Aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> and stowage {{systems were}} {{extremely}} vulnerable. The Royal Navy stowed aviation fuel in cylindrical tanks, {{that in turn}} were surrounded by seawater. RN aviation fuel lines were purged with carbon dioxide when not in use. The USN used a similar system, which was further improved after the two navies began exchanging information in 1940. Pre-war USN and IJN carrier designs used a fuel stowage system which was not as secure as that used by the RN, but allowed for much greater stowage capacity. Several USN and IJN carriers were lost due to aviation gas fume explosions.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011, a {{late fall}} storm {{prevented}} the final <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> by a barge to Nome, Alaska. Without this, {{the city of}} 3,600 inhabitants would run out of fuel months before the first shipment could be arranged in late May or June of the following year. As a result, the ice-strengthened oil tanker Renda was chartered to carry a cargo of diesel fuel, heating oil and gasoline to the city. This {{was the first time}} a fuel supply mission was attempted {{in the middle of the}} winter. In January 2012, a Jones Act waiver was arranged with the support of Alaska's congressional delegation so that Renda could load fuel at Dutch Harbor and transport it to Nome, a task normally reserved for US-flagged vessels.|$|E

25|$|The report {{summarised}} {{the extensive}} testing performed {{in an effort}} to replicate the problem suffered by G-YMMM. This included creating a mock-up of G-YMMM's <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> system, to which water was added to study its freezing properties. After a battery of tests, the AAIB had not yet succeeded in reproducing the suspected icing behaviour, and was undertaking further investigation. Nevertheless, the AAIB believed its testing showed that fuel flow was restricted on G-YMMM and that frozen water in the jet fuel could have caused the restriction, ruling out alternative hypotheses such as a failure of the aircraft's FADEC (computerised engine control system). The hypothesis favoured in the report was that ice had accreted somewhere downstream of the boost pumps in the wing fuel tanks and upstream of the engine-mounted fuel pumps. Either enough ice had accumulated to cause a blockage at a single point, or ice throughout the fuel lines had become dislodged as fuel flow increased during the landing approach, and the dislodged ice had then formed a blockage somewhere downstream.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> portion {{is either}} {{remotely}} mounted at the [...] "eye" [...] of the engine's supercharger {{or at the}} base of the carburetor body.

50|$|The {{effect is}} of {{considerable}} industrial importance {{in terms of}} both safety and potential damage to manufactured goods. Static discharge is a particular hazard in grain elevators owing to the danger of a dust explosion. The spark produced is fully able to ignite flammable vapours, for example, petrol, ether fumes as well as methane gas. For bulk <b>fuel</b> <b>deliveries</b> and aircraft <b>fueling</b> a grounding connection is made between the vehicle and the receiving tank prior to opening the tanks. When fueling vehicles at a retail station touching metal on the car before opening the gas tank or touching the nozzle may decrease one's risk of static ignition of fuel vapors.|$|R

2500|$|Methanol and ethanol {{are also}} {{incompatible}} with some polymers.

This includes both fuel system compatibility and lambda compensation of <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> with fuel injection engines featuring closed loop lambda control.

2500|$|The AAIB {{issued a}} further {{bulletin}} on 12 May 2008 which {{confirmed that the}} investigation continued to focus on <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery.</b> It stated that [...] "The reduction in thrust on both engines {{was the result of}} a reduced fuel flow and all engine parameters after the thrust reduction were consistent with this." [...] The report confirmed that the fuel was of good quality and had a freezing point below the coldest temperatures encountered, appearing to rule out fuel freezing as a cause. As in the aforementioned February bulletin, the report noted cavitation damage to the high-pressure fuel pumps of both engines, indicative of abnormally low pressure at the pump inlets. After ruling out fuel freezing or contamination, the investigation then focused on what caused the low pressure at the pump inlets. [...] "Restrictions in the fuel system between the aircraft fuel tanks and each of the engine HP pumps, resulting in reduced fuel flows, is suspected." [...] The <b>fuel</b> <b>delivery</b> system was being investigated at Boeing, and the engines at manufacturer Rolls Royce in Derby.|$|E
