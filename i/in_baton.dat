5|$|Recalled {{to service}} in early 1942, upon American entry into World War II, Middleton became CG of the 45th Infantry Division during the Sicily and Salerno battles in Italy, {{and then in}} March 1944 moved up to command the VIII Corps. His {{leadership}} in Operation Cobra during the Battle of Normandy led to the capture of the important port city of Brest, France, and for his success he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal by General George Patton.

Following this battle, and his corps' relentless push across Germany until reaching Czechoslovakia, he was recognized by both General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, and Patton as being a corps commander of extraordinary abilities. Middleton logged 480 days in combat during World War II, {{more than any other}} American general officer. Retiring from the army again in 1945, Middleton returned to LSU and in 1951 was appointed to the university presidency, a position he held for 11 years, while continuing to serve the army in numerous consultative capacities.

5|$|With {{the timber}} wolf being a species not native to Louisiana, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} {{as to what the}} relocated franchise would be called.

Prior to this announcement, the team was rumored to play games at the Lakefront Arena, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center <b>in</b> <b>Baton</b> Rouge or the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi when the Superdome was unavailable.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area {{made it impossible to}} use. With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter <b>in</b> <b>Baton</b> Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Born <b>in</b> <b>Baton</b> Rouge, Louisiana, on September 30, 1935, James Charles Taylor had two paper {{routes to}} help his widowed mother make ends meet.

5|$|For {{more than}} eight decades, the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole {{property}} of its namesake rowing club. By the 1950s, the team's complex management structure made the arrangement increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett, Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the company, with the balance made up by small investors who had some affinity with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of $400,000 {{to be set up}} that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income. Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He would sell his share to Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett's controlling nature. Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings <b>in</b> <b>Baton</b> Broadcasting.|$|E
