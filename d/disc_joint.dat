40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc {{is a critical}} part of the intersegmental soft tissue of the spinal column, providing flexibility and mobility, while absorbing large complex loads. Spinal disease, including disc herniation and degeneration, may be a significant contributor to low back pain. Clinically, disc herniations are treated with both nonoperative and operative methods. Operative treatment for disc herniation includes removal of the herniated material when neural compression occurs. While this strategy may have short-term advantages over nonoperative methods, the remaining disc material is not addressed and surgery for mild degeneration may have limited long-term advan-tage over nonoperative methods. Furthermore, disc herniation and surgery significantly alter the mechanical function of the <b>disc</b> <b>joint,</b> which may contribute to progression of degeneration in surrounding tissues. We reviewed recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies that may {{have a significant impact on}} disc herniation repair. Our review on tissue engineering strategies focuses on cell-based and inductive methods, each commonly combined with material-based approaches. An ideal clinically relevant biological re-pair strategy will significantly reduce pain and repair and restore flexibility and motion of the spine.

40|$|Measurements of {{component}} geometry {{are routinely}} made for inspection during manufacturing. Typically {{this results in}} ‘clouds’ of points or pixels depending upon the measuring system. Examples include points form laserbased or touch-probe co-ordinate measuring machines (CMMs). The point density may vary as will the cost and time taken to make measurements. There can also be gaps and occlusions in data, and sometimes it is only practical to collect sparse sets or points in a single dimension. This data often provides an untapped source of quantitative uncertainty information pertaining to manufacturing methods. It is proposed that state-of-the-art uncertainty propagation and robust design optimization approaches, often demonstrated using assumed normal input distributions in existing parameters, can be improved by incorporating these data. Inclusion of this information requires, however, that the point cloud be converted to an appropriate parametric form. Although the design intent of a component may be described using simple geometric primitives joined with tangency or at vertices, manufactured geometry may not exhibit the same simple form, and line and surface segment end locations are notoriously difficult to locate where there is tangency or shallow angles. In this paper we present an approach to first characterise point cloud measurements as curves or surfaces using Kriging, allowing for gaps in data by extension to universal Kriging. We then propose a novel method for the reduction of variables to parameterize curves and surfaces again using Kriging models {{in order to facilitate}} practical analysis of performance uncertainty. The techniques are demonstrated by application to a gas turbine engine blade to <b>disc</b> <b>joint</b> where the contact surface shape is measured and the notch stresses are critical to component performance...|$|E

Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 35 symptomatic young adults (16 – 29 years old) with low-grade L 5 –S 1 spondylolytic spondylolisthesis (Meyerding Grade 1 or 2) and 50 symptomatic young referents (20 – 29 years old) with L 5 –S 1 disc herniation without spondylolisthesis were recruited to compare the differences between disc and facet-joint degenerations at the olisthetic and adjacent levels using the Mantel extension test. Results: There were statistically significant degenerative changes of the <b>discs</b> and facet <b>joints</b> at the olisthetic and adjacent levels of patients with spondylolytic spondylolisthesis compared with the reference group. There is a trend that the <b>disc</b> and facet <b>joints</b> degenerate the most at the olisthetic level and become less affected at adjacent levels away from the lesion of pars defect.

40|$|Biomechanical and histologic {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} the close functional relationship between lumbar discs and their associated facet joints, {{and it is}} conceivable that their degenerative changes are interdependent. However, separation of cause from effect remains controversial. Hitherto, no study in humans has correlated the changes histologically. The present study assessed histologic changes in lower lumbar discs and their associated facet joints in patients under the age of 40 years using classification systems developed for this investigation. A specific objective was to correlate changes in <b>discs</b> and facet <b>joints.</b> Data from 15 lower lumbar spine specimens were obtained. Three parasagittal sections per disc and one section per facet joint were graded histologically. The results were correlated with age, within the functional spinal unit (FSU), and with the adjacent level. Histologic changes were found in <b>discs</b> and facet <b>joints</b> from all FSUs. There was no correlation between the age of the subject and the degree of degeneration of the <b>disc</b> or facet <b>joints</b> at either level. The extent of disc degeneration at L 4 / 5 correlated significantly with changes at L 5 /S 1 (P < 0. 01).

40|$|International audienceSTUDY DESIGN: These {{case reports}} {{illustrate}} the neurologic manifestations due to beta 2 microglobulin amyloid deposition at the lumbar spine level in long-term hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: Radiologic investigations suggested the amyloid origin of extradural soft tissue deposition, which {{was confirmed by}} histologic examination after surgical excision. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although cervical myelopathy is a recently recognized complication of long-term dialysis-related beta 2 microglobulin amyloidosis, neurologic manifestations due to amyloid deposition at the lumbar spine level have rarely been reported. METHODS: Three case reports of cauda equina compression in long-term hemodialysis patients are presented. Follow-up radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed and patients underwent surgical decompression of the thecal sac. RESULTS: In two patients, the compression resulted from {{the development of a}} destructive spondylarthropathy, and from the infiltration of extradural spaces and ligaments by an abnormal soft tissue. The third patient had lumbar spinal stenosis due to multiple disc protrusion and to hypertrophy of facet joints and ligamentum flavum. Multilevel laminectomies enabled excision of an abnormal fibrous tissue responsible for the thecal sac compression. Histologic examination of the excised fibrous tissues disclosed amyloid deposits in intervertebral <b>discs,</b> apophysial <b>joints,</b> and ligaments. CONCLUSIONS: In long-term hemodialysis patients, cauda equina compression may develop as the consequence of beta 2 microglobulin amyloid deposition in lumbar intervertebral <b>discs,</b> facet <b>joints,</b> and ligaments. Magnetic resonance imaging is well suited to show the extent of the compression and supports the argument for the amyloid origin of extradural soft tissue...|$|R
40|$|Aim and objectives. The {{morphology}} {{and position}} of the temporo-mandibular disc are key issues in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} arthrogenous temporo-mandibular disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy are used today to identify: flattening of the pars posterior of the disc, perforation and/or adhesions in the pars intermedia of the disc and disc displacements. The present study proposes the investigation of the temporo-mandibular <b>joint</b> <b>disc</b> by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Material and methods. 8 human temporo-mandibular <b>joint</b> <b>discs</b> were harvested from dead subjects, under 40 year of age, and conserved in formalin. They had a normal morphology, with a thicker pars posterior (2, 6 mm on the average) and a thinner pars intermedia (1 mm on the average). We investigated the disc samples using two different OCT systems: an en-face OCT (time domain (TD) -OCT) system, working at 1300 nm (C-scan and B-scan mode) and a spectral OCT system (a Fourier domain (FD) -OCT) system, working at 840 nm (B-scan mode). Results. The OCT investigation of the temporo-mandibular <b>joint</b> <b>discs</b> revealed a homogeneous microstructure. The longer wavelength of the TD-OCT offers a higher penetration depth (2, 5 mm in air), which is important for the analysis of the pars posterior, while the FD-OCT is much faster.

40|$|Abstract Background Minimal interventional {{procedures}} are frequently applied {{in patients with}} mechanical low back pain which is defined as pain presumably resulting from single sources: facet, <b>disc,</b> sacroiliac <b>joint</b> {{or a combination of}} these. Usually, these minimal interventional {{procedures are}} an integral part of a multidisciplinary pain programme. A recent systematic review issued by the Dutch Health Insurance Council showed that the effectiveness of these procedures for the total group of patients with chronic low back pain is yet unclear and cost-effectiveness unknown. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether a multidisciplinary pain programme with minimal interventional procedures is cost-effective compared to the multidisciplinary pain programme alone for patients with chronic mechanical low back pain who did not respond to conservative primary care and were referred to a pain clinic. Methods All patients with chronic low back pain who are referred to one of the 13 participating pain clinics will be asked to participate in an observational study. Patients with a suspected diagnosis of facet, <b>disc</b> or sacroiliac <b>joint</b> problems will receive a diagnostic block to confirm this diagnosis. If confirmed, they will be asked to participate in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). For each single source a separate RCT will be conducted. Patients with a combination of facet, <b>disc</b> or sacroiliac <b>joint</b> problems will be invited for participation in a RCT as well. An economic evaluation from a societal perspective will be performed alongside these four RCTs. Patients will complete questionnaires at baseline, 3 and 6 [*]weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 [*]months after start of the treatment. Costs will be collected using self-completed cost questionnaires.

A total of 131 subjects were included in this study and TMD signs and symptoms were investigated by means of a standardized clinical examination. Two self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate mood (MOODS-SR) and panic-agoraphobic (PAS-SR) spectrum. anova and Bonferroni's post hoc test for multiple comparisons were used to compare mean scores of all TMD groups for MOODS-SR, PAS-SR and all their domains.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative <b>discs</b> or <b>joint</b> disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments.

40|$|Degeneration of {{intervertebral}} <b>discs</b> and facet <b>joints</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently encountered spinal disorders. In order to describe and quantify degeneration and evaluate a possible relationship between degeneration and biomechanical parameters, e. g., the intervertebral range of motion and intradiscal pressure, a scoring system for degeneration is mandatory. However, few scoring systems for the assessment of degeneration of the cervical spine exist. Therefore, two separate objective scoring systems to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the degree of cervical intervertebral <b>disc</b> and facet <b>joint</b> degeneration were developed and validated. The scoring system for cervical disc degeneration consists of three variables which are individually scored on neutral lateral radiographs: "height loss" (0 - 4 points), "anterior osteophytes" (0 - 3 points) and "endplate sclerosis" (0 - 2 points). The scoring system for facet joint degeneration consists of four variables which are individually scored on neutral computed tomography scans: "hypertrophy" (0 - 2 points), "osteophytes" (0 - 1 point), "irregularity" on the articular surface (0 - 1 point) and "joint space narrowing" (0 - 1 point). Each variable contributes with varying importance to the overall degeneration score (max 9 points for the scoring system of cervical disc degeneration and max 5 points for facet joint degeneration). Degeneration of 20 <b>discs</b> and facet <b>joints</b> of 20 patients was blindly assessed by four raters: two neurosurgeons (one senior and one junior) and two radiologists (one senior and one junior), firstly based on first subjective impression and secondly using the scoring systems. Measurement errors and inter- and intra-rater agreement were determined. The measurement error of the scoring system for cervical disc degeneration was 11. 1 versus 17. 9 % of the subjective impression results. This scoring system showed excellent intra-rater agreement (ICC = 0. 86, 0. 75 - 0. 93) and excellent inter-rater agreement (ICC = 0. 78, 0. 64 - 0. 88). Surgeons as well as radiologists and seniors as well as juniors obtained excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement. The measurement error of the scoring system for cervical facet joint degeneration was 20. 1 versus 24. 2 % of the subjective impression results. This scoring system showed good intra-rater agreement (ICC = 0. 71, 0. 42 - 0. 89) and fair inter-rater agreement (ICC = 0. 49, 0. 26 - 0. 74). Both scoring systems fulfilled the criteria for recommendation proposed by Kettler and Wilke.
