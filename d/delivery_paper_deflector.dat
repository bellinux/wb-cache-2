These E-learning software systems have virtually made the whole world as a single campus education hub. However, development of these software’s has been a challenge for industry, as the requirement of various stakeholders–learner, educator, institutional management, accreditation bodies, has to be handled in the software effectively. Software systems developed for E-learning applications should implement all the requirements of its diverse stakeholders and must be delivered well in time. Delays, incomplete software and faulty modules could be a big failure for educational institute. To be able to deliver the software within deadline, software’s are delivered in increments. In order to support incremental <b>delivery,</b> <b>paper</b> proposes a new requirement prioritization method that selects those requirements for implementation that are essentially required by stakeholders and has a lower regression count associated with them, thereby reducing regression testing effort.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Using special {{questions}} {{added to}} the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we measure the response of household spending to the economic stimulus payments (ESPs) disbursed during {{the spring and summer}} of 2008. We also extend the related literature in a number of ways. First, we are able to measure the spending response using only random variation in the timing of ESP receipt. Second, we test whether the method of <b>delivery</b> (<b>paper</b> check versus electronic transfer) matters for spending. Third, we evaluate a complementary approach to identifying the impact of tax cuts, which asks consumers to self-report whether they spent their tax cuts. We find that, on average, households spent about 12 - 30 % of their stimulus payments on nondurable consumption goods during the three-month period in which the payments were received. Further, there was also a significant effect on durables purchases, in particular auto purchases. Based on point estimates, the estimated responses are largest for lower-income households and homeowners. The responses are also largest for self-reported spenders, though self-reported savers also spent a significant fraction of the payments. The responses do not significantly differ across pape...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a {{consumer}} study of twenty-four intellectually and physically disabled persons and eighteen parents of intellectually and physically disabled dependents using a range of nongovernment welfare organizations in South-East Queensland (Brown & Ringma, 1988).
