This paper describes a steganographic technique which makes use of an image <b>file</b> as a <b>carrier</b> to hold the secret message and transfer it over the communication medium. There are two popular schemes used for image steganography: spatial domain embedding and transform domain embedding. Most of the steganographic techniques discussed in literature either use spatial domain or transform domain to embed the secret message. Here we have proposed a novel steganographic technique that combines both the spatial domain as well as the transform domain approach to achieve greater security. We have chosen LSB substitution technique for spatial domain embedding and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for transform domain embedding. The paper also proposes technique to combine cryptography with the proposed image steganography technique. Here we make use of the S-DES also known as the simplified DES algorithm for encryption.

One of these anti-forensics tools is steganography, which introduced higher levels of complexity and security against hackersâ€™ attacks but simultaneously create obstacles to forensic investigations. A new anti-forensics approach for embedding data in the steganography field is proposed in this paper. It is based on hiding secret data in hex symbols <b>carrier</b> <b>files</b> rather than the usually used <b>file</b> multimedia <b>carrier</b> including videos, image and sound files. Furthermore, this approach utilizes hexadecimal codes to embed the secret data on the contrary to the conventional steganography approaches which apply changes to binary codes.

40|$|Steganography is an {{information}} hiding technique in which secret data are secured by covering {{them into a}} computer <b>carrier</b> <b>file</b> without damaging the file or changing its size. The difference between steganography and cryptography is that steganography is a stealthy method of communication that only the communicating parties are aware of; while, cryptography is an overt method of communication that anyone is aware of, despite its payload is scribbled. Typically, an irrecoverable steganography algorithm is the algorithm that {{makes it hard for}} malicious third parties to discover how it works and how to recover the secret data out of the <b>carrier</b> <b>file.</b> One popular way to achieve irrecoverability is to digitally process the <b>carrier</b> <b>file</b> after hiding the secret data into it. However, such process is irreversible as it would destroy the concealed data. This paper proposes a new image steganography method for textual data, as well as for any form of digital data, based on adjusting the brightness of the carrier image after covering the secret data into it. The algorithm used is parameterized as it can be configured using three different parameters defined by the communicating parties. They include the amount of brightness to apply on the carrier image after the completion of the covering process, the color channels whose brightness should be adjusted, and the bytes that should carry in the secret data. The novelty of the proposed method is that it embeds bits of the secret data into the three LSBs of the bytes that compose the carrier image {{in such a way that}} does not destroy the secret data when restoring back the original brightness of the carrier image. The simulation conducted proved that the proposed algorithm is valid and correct.
