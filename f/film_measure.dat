Results: XVMC was in good agreement with <b>film</b> <b>measured</b> results for all selected field sizes except 3 cm × 3 cm. SP under estimated by 5. 7 % {{at the center of}} the lung insert while deviation up to 6 % was found at the cent of wood inhomogeneity in 2 cm × 2 cm. Except CON, increase in dose from proximal to the central surface of the tumor and then dose falloff from central to the distal surface for field size 2 cm × 2 cm to 4 cm × 4 cm was recorded. The change in <b>film</b> <b>measured</b> percentage depth dose from 2 cm × 2 cm to 3 cm × 3 cm field sizes was found – 8 % however for consecutive field size(s) larger than 3 cm × 3 cm this difference was less. CON and FSP produced overestimated results. Conclusion: Out of four algorithms, XVMC found consistent with measured data. The electronic disequilibrium within and at the interface of inhomogeneity make the accurate dose predictions difficult.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{influences}} of annealing temperature on TbFe magnetostrictive film magnetic and magnetostrictive characteristics were discussed. TbFe films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering.

Grain sizes could be controlled through varying annealing temperature. From <b>film</b> hysteresis loops <b>measured</b> by VSM, {{it has been found}} that the annealing treatment can improve TbFe film in-plane magnetization at 1600 kA. m- 1 external field, and decrease in-plane coercivity.
