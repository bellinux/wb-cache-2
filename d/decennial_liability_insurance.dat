40|$|Leaving aside {{difficult}} to interpret doctrinal developments, such as the abrogation of traditional immunities, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> has at least the following six impacts on tort law in action. First, for claims against all but the wealthiest individuals and organizations, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is a de facto element of tort <b>liability.</b> Second, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> limits are a de facto cap on tort damages. Third, tort claims are shaped to match the available <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{with the result that}} <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policy exclusions become de facto limits on tort <b>liability.</b> Fourth, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> makes lawsuits against ordinary individuals and small organizations into repeat player lawsuits on the defense side, making tort law in action less focused on the fault of individual defendants and more focused on managing aggregate costs. Fifth, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> personnel transform complex tort rules into simple rules of thumb, also with the result that tort law in action is less concerned with the fault of individual defendants than tort law on the books. Sixth, negotiations over the boundaries of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage (which appears nowhere in tort law on the books) drive tort law in action...|$|R

40|$|This essay explores how <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> mediates the {{boundary}} between torts and crime. <b>Liability</b> <b>insurance</b> sometimes separates these two legal fields, for example {{through the application of}} standard insurance contract provisions that exclude insurance coverage for some crimes that are also torts. Perhaps less obviously, <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> also can draw parts of the tort and criminal fields together. For example, professional <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> civilizes the criminal law experience for some crimes that are also torts by providing defendants with an insurance-paid criminal defense that provides more than ordinary means to contest the state 2 ̆ 7 s accusations. The crime-tort separation in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> cannot be explained by economic incentives, alone. Morality matters, too. The fact that <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> sometimes provides coverage for criminal defense costs suggests that <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> institutions could cover a broader swath of crime torts than they do, providing further support for the claim that consequentialist reasoning, alone, cannot explain the observed relationship between <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> torts, and crime. The tort-crime separation reflects and reinforces a concept of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> as protection for defendants, rather than as a fund for victims. In turn, this concept of insurance reflects and reinforces an understanding of tort claims as encounters between particular plaintiffs and defendants, rather than as a price setting or loss spreading insurance mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The sale of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> {{presents}} {{us with a}} basic question. On one hand, individuals want {{to purchase}} <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage, suggesting that its ownership is socially good.

And because the purpose of legal sanctions is in significant part to discourage and to punish unwanted behavior, the fundamental issue arises whether <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> might undermine {{the effect of the}} law and thus be socially undesirable. This concern led to early resistance against the sale of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> and reservations about the wisdom of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> are reflected today by certain limitations on the sale of coverage.

This paper {{focuses on the}} underwriting process which {{should be taken into}} consideration by short-term insurers when they are underwriting the main types of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> which include employer’s, householder’s, personal, product, professional and public <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> The improvement of financial decision-making by short-term insurers when underwriting <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> represents the objective of this research. A study of secondary data was done to identify the existing literature, which formed the basis for compiling a questionnaire to obtain primary data. The top 10 short-term insurers which are the market leaders of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> in South Africa and who received more than 85 % of the annual gross written premiums for <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> in South Africa, represented the sample of the empirical study.

40|$|Recent {{dramatic}} {{increases in}} prices for medical <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{directors and officers}} insurance, and other lines of commercial <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> together with the exit of some insurers from those lines of business, has placed <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> on the public agenda. At the same time, asbestos and environmental losses continue to mount under general <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> policies sold long ago, when {{no one could have}} predicted the extent or cost of such losses. In combination, these and other related events have raised serious concerns about the insurability of liability risks and have prompted calls for dramatic efforts to roll back the advance of liability law in the U. S. and Europe. With this ‘‘crisis’’ as the background, this essay represents a preliminary effort to explore <b>insurance</b> for <b>liability</b> risks, with the goal of articulating a framework that will guide more systematic and empirical study. In the main part of this essay I describe a new conceptual framework for analysing <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> risks. The framework helps explain why predicting losses can be so difficult in the <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> context and why cycles in insurance pricing are more extreme in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> than in other lines of insurance. Much of this difficulty is already understood to follow from the ‘‘long tail’’ or ‘‘duration of liability’’ problem in <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> The primary contribution of the new framework is breaking apart what I will call ‘‘liability developments risk’’ for separate analysis, facilitating a better understanding of when and why the duration of liability matters. In concluding, I use a brief analysis of medical <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> to offer some observations on insurability and to sound the call for systematic empirical research aimed at improving how <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> institutions manage <b>liability</b> developments risk...|$|R

Second, as long as access to <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> data and personnel depends on the discretion of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> organizations, this knowledge will be incomplete and, most likely, biased in favor of the public policy agenda of the organizations providing discretionary access to the data.

40|$|We {{survey the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical literature on the law and economics of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> The canonical Shavell model predicts that, {{despite the presence of}} some ex ante moral hazard (care-reduction by insureds), <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> will generally raise welfare because its risk-spreading gains will likely be larger than its adverse effects on precautionary activities. We discuss the numerous features of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts that are designed to reduce ex ante moral hazard, and examine the evidence of their effects. Most studies conclude that these features work reasonably well, so that <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> probably does not generate substantial ex ante moral hazard. Its effects on ex post moral hazard (the increased tendency of victims to sue in the presence of insurance) are not as clear, however, and the welfare consequences of increased litigation are ambiguous, for reasons we explain.

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{differences}} in terms of insurance between optional and compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances.</b> It also treats {{the purpose of the}} compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> and their accordance with that purpose. The primary purpose of the optional third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is to ensure the policyholder financial resources to cover possible claims for damages. The primary purpose of the compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> is to render possible the compensation of a third party for damage done. The policyholders financial ability to pay damages is of subordinate interest, and the purpose of compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> is thus twofold. Estate agents, insurance agents and accountants are required by law to have a third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> linked to their enterprises. The terms of the compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> are, unlike the optional insurances, dictated by the legislator. As a result, the compulsory insurance has not been developed at the same pace as the optional. This is a consequence of an unwillingness on behalf of the authorities, to compromise and to adapt the third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> {{in order to make it}} more in accordance with its purpose. Therefore, the insurance companies have also been less inclined to grant insurance on the exposed premises, which has resulted in the above-mentioned enterprise-owners risking insurance distress. The legislation of each trade offers the possibility to leave other security than the holding of a compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> to protect the third party. According to this paper, this possibility has not been enough emphasised. The conception"third party protection"should, according to the author, be emphasised in each legislation, irrespective of the form chosen. The risk exposure the enterprise-owners are exposed to can cause problems for the insurance companies in determining what liabilities should be covered by the compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> Damage prevention activities are carried out to different extent within each trade organisation, but compulsory third party <b>liability</b> <b>insurances</b> are better suited within legislations where the insurance companies have good control over the proportions of the damages and as a result can assess the risk of damage more easily...|$|R

As a result, many now look to the private market for solutions to our food safety crisis. One private market approach, food safety <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> is gaining popularity. This article examines the benefits and drawbacks to food safety <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> and raises doubts about its ability to improve food safety. The market for safe food is plagued by overwhelming information problems that (1) make foodborne illnesses extremely difficult to connect to their pathogenic sources, (2) create moral hazard and adverse selection problems that drive food suppliers to shirk on food safety, and (3) suppress tort claims by victims of foodborne illnesses. These problems limit the effectiveness of food safety <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> Yet while the food safety <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> appears to provide few of the regulatory benefits of other type of <b>liability</b> <b>insurance,</b> food safety <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> also carries risks: a potential to increase moral hazard, send false signals to insureds regarding their risk of transmitting a foodborne illness, and diminish demand for more effective means to control foodborne illnesses...|$|R
