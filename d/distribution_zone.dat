2500|$|Water {{supply in}} the Jordanian highlands, {{where most of the}} {{population}} lives, is generally intermittent. According to a 2008 study by the University of Michigan, water is delivered once a week in big cities like Amman and once every twelve days in some rural areas. According to a 2007 survey the mean rate of supply per week was 1.5 days in Madaba governorate, 2.9 days in Balqa governorate and 3.2 days in Zarqa governorate. In Amman, [...] according to the water distribution plan of Miyahuna, 8 out of 44 main <b>distribution</b> <b>zones</b> received continuous water supply [...] "except in emergency cases" [...] in 2012. Most other <b>distribution</b> <b>zones</b> were scheduled to receive water for either once a week for 24 hours or twice a week for a total of 36–48 hours. To what extent actual supply follows the distribution program, especially during summer, is not clear. Since the Disi-Amman Conveyor became operational in summer 2013 the continuity of supply in Amman has increased.|$|R

50|$|Had {{the rock}} strata been undisturbed, the typical {{landscape}} {{structure of the}} rock country would end shortly after Annweiler due to their inclination. Tectonic processes, however, led to the shifting and displacement of individual layers of rock so that, west of the Elmstein Fault roughly from Wilgartswiesen, Spirkelbach, Schwanheim Erlenbach, Niederschlettenbach up to Lembach in Alsace the rock forming Trifels beds were uplifted by about 80 to 100 metres and so these rocks continue to shape {{the surface of the}} landscape in the Dahner Felsenland and Schönau Felsenland. Only west of the (Wies-)Lauter and Sauer or Saarbach do they dive permanently beneath the younger strata of the Middle Bunter Sandstein, for example, the Karlstal beds, so that the landscape of the western Wasgau appears {{similar to that of the}} Middle Palatinate Forest. This also applies to the southern part of Wasgau because, in the area of the Col de Saverne or Pfalzburg Trough (Pfalzburger Mulde) the various rock formations are less strongly arched and therefore their surface layers were not as severely eroded. For this reason, younger rocks of the Middle and Upper Bunter form the surface of the hills, whilst Rehberg and Trifels beds only occur in deep V-shaped valleys. Also, south of a line from Ingweiler through Wingen-sur-Moder to Diemeringen, the main <b>distribution</b> <b>zone</b> of Bunter sandstone from the eastern edge of the trough to the rocks of the Lower Muschelkalk in the west narrows from a width of about 15 km to a minimum of 7 km in the area of the Col de Saverne (see map above).|$|E

We propose a simple equation that can predict the breakthrough of solutes without excessive data requirements. Conceptually the soil is divided in a distribution layer and a conveyance zone. The <b>distribution</b> <b>zone</b> act as a linear reservoir resulting in an exponential loss of solutes from this zone. In the conveyance zone the transport of solutes is described with the convective dispersive equation.

An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the Battersea and Park Lane pump-out shafts.
