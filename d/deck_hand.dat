25|$|Cruikshank {{was born}} in Bradner, Ohio in 1902 to Jesse and Jessie (Wright) Cruikshank. His father was a grain dealer who modeled fair {{business}} practices and taught the young Cruikshank to respect {{the value of the}} labor of the farmers and workers with whom the family did business. The family eventually moved to Texas. Cruikshank worked as a <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> on freighters on the Great Lakes and {{was a member of the}} Seafarers Union before attending Oberlin College. He transferred to Ohio Wesleyan University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics and theology.|$|E
2500|$|On the Tuesday and Wednesday before March 26, 1915, {{a hearing}} {{was held on}} the {{collision}} before U.S. steamboat inspectors George F. Fuller and E.S. Edwards. [...] The evidence {{was reported to have}} shown that the collision was [...] "largely in the nature of an accident." [...] An unlicensed <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> had been at the wheel of Telegraph {{at the time of the}} collision. [...] Although the <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> was deemed competent to handle the wheel, this was still a violation of the regulations, for which Capt. Henry Dunham, of Telegraph was held responsible. [...] As a result, Dunham's license was suspended for 60 days. [...] Dunham was replaced in charge of Telegraph by T.W. McCloskey, an experienced river man who had mostly worked on the route between Coquille City and Myrtle Point.|$|E

50|$|The B&R 23 is a {{sailing boat}} {{designed}} in the early 1990s. It has an ultralight construction with a very large sail plane. Typical crew is a helmsman and two <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> in trapezes. The boat is predominately used for racing.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{one of the}} Atlin's <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> below," [...] he announced. [...] "He's come on {{here from}} Horsfield's to say the boat's ready with {{a full head of}} steam up, and the packers ye hired are waiting on the wharf." ...|$|R
25|$|Captains {{were paid}} per to per trip, {{receiving}} $70 to $80 per {{trip in the}} 1920s, receiving less than $1,250 per year. <b>Deck</b> <b>hands</b> were paid $12 to $20 per trip, sometimes receiving clothes in lieu of wages or for part of their wages.|$|R
2500|$|On September 6, 1897, <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> Dell Elbon fell {{overboard}} from Ocean Wave as {{the steamer}} was {{passing through the}} Burnside Bridge. [...] Elbon was 21 years of age, and had been working as non-union employee during a wage dispute on the Ocean Wave when he fell from the boat. [...] Elbon’s father alleged that his son’s death {{was linked to the}} labor dispute and that he had been struck on the head prior to going into the water. [...] The coroner found no evidence of a blow to the head however.|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} [...] Duke of Clarence passed Lady Loch {{and shortly}} after collided with Albatross, ramming the Albatross amidships,resulting in Albatross sinking {{in a matter of}} minutes. Lady Loch hastened to the scene and upon arrival found Duke of Clarence stationary with two of her lifeboats engaged searching for survivors. Captain Edward Shimmin had managed to save himself by climbing aboard Duke of Clarence, two further sailors, Robert Kelly (second engineer) and <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> Thomas Turner, had managed to take hold of two empty fish boxes and were subsequently picked up by the lifeboats. However five crew members who were below at the time of collision drowned.|$|E
2500|$|The Lucy Walker was {{an average}} vessel of her time: [...] long with {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] She {{displaced}} 183 tons. She was built at Cincinnati, Ohio in 1843 and her home port was Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River in the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The boat frequently steamed to both Louisville, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana. She was a side-wheeler, with three boilers, only one deck, no masts, no figurehead, and an above-deck cabin. Thomas F. Eckert, John Cochran, and Thomas J. Halderman had successively served as master or captain of the Lucy Walker. Captain Halderman was a very experienced river man, who since 1820 had worked as fireman, <b>deck</b> <b>hand,</b> engineer, and captain on steamboats, and later was a steamboat inspector. For some unknown reason, Halderman was replaced in Louisville just before departure, and her owner, Joseph Vann, took over the duties as captain.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1897, the <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> of {{a number}} of river steamers, {{including}} the Bailey Gatzert, formed a union and on Saturday, August 21, 1897, they went out on strike. [...] The hands sought a raise in pay from $35 a month to $40 a month.|$|R
50|$|Stillefors {{took charge}} of the superstructure, deck layout and {{equipment}} design. In 1993 the first B&R 23 was built at Bergsviksvarvet in Stockholm by Stillefors, and soon the sailors on Lake Mälaren saw a futuristic fast boat with two <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> on wire swishing past them with water spraying around the bow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, but it's better Mr. Gray {{should pay}} them for being decent and well-behaved on board his ship, than {{that they should}} be out of work and rioting in taverns and lodging-houses. And you yourself, father, {{remember}} the herrin' fishers that come ashore at Ardie, and the <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> of the excursion boat, and the language they'll be using." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So this is {{the work}} of that new <b>deck</b> <b>hand,</b> eh?" [...] cried Captain Barforth, grimly. [...] "A fine piece of {{business}} to be in, I must say!" ...|$|E
60|$|He at once {{sent for}} Walt Wingate. The <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> who {{went after the}} man came back five minutes later to report that the fellow could not be located.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why--er--my {{handkerchief}} blew {{down here}} and I came down to get it," [...] answered the new <b>deck</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and pointed to the}} cloth in question sticking out of his pocket.|$|E
5000|$|By May 1941 {{the ship}} was described, in {{contrast}} to a somewhat shabby but free Nouméa, as lying a half mile out in the harbor, a [...] "dazzling white motor yacht" [...] the [...] "embodiment of smartness and comfort" [...] with American officers and drink stewards, Melanesian <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> and Japanese waiters that make passengers feel like millionaires at least for a night.|$|R
2500|$|On about September 1, 1915, Charm was {{backing up}} at a wharf and struck {{the bow of}} Telegraph. [...] There was no damage, and the <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> on Telegraph did not notice when the boats struck. [...] However, Captain Panter of Telegraph filed a {{complaint}} with the steamboat inspectors, and, following an investigation, the license of George Leneve, captain of the Charm, was suspended for 60 days.|$|R
5000|$|RMS Carinthia {{started on}} her maiden voyage to Montreal on 27 June 1956 with 890 {{passengers}} and crew on board. After four more voyages, she proved with her running mate [...] that the new Canadian Cunarders were so successful that other ships operating on the route were all scrapped leaving the four ships on the Montreal route. During 1960, the Carinthia suffered a fire {{in one of her}} cabins. In June of that year, some <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> set up a skiffle group on a public deck; some passengers complained of the noise and the <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> were fined a day's pay causing the [...] "skiffle strike". The ship's crew went on strike and others came out in support leaving many liners tied up in the Liverpool docks for several weeks. During 1961 she collided with the [...] In 1962 her propellers failed during a voyage. During 1964, the crew went on strike again. Carinthia was still operated from Liverpool to Montreal well into 1965, and from Southampton to Montreal and New York until after March 1967.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys did}} not go on deck until after breakfast. Then {{they walked to the}} {{starboard}} rail and stopped at the spot where Sam had first discovered the <b>deck</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hans {{looked and}} beheld Walt Wingate on the deck, in earnest {{conversation}} with the mate. The <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> was not handcuffed {{as he had been}} a short while before, when tramping the forward deck for air, by Captain Barforth's permission.|$|E
60|$|A {{search was}} instituted, {{in which all}} of the boys, Mr. Rover and Aleck joined. But though the steam yacht was searched from stem to stern, the missing <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> was not located. Some of the men even went down into the hold, but with no success.|$|E
50|$|Another {{major change}} {{is that the}} smaller, {{redesigned}} island will be further aft than those of older carriers. This shift creates deck space for a centralized rearming and refueling location, and thereby reduces {{the number of times}} that an aircraft will have to be moved after landing before it can be relaunched. Fewer aircraft movements require, in turn, fewer <b>deck</b> <b>hands</b> to accomplish them, reducing the size of the ship's crew and increasing sortie rate.|$|R
50|$|Sabino is {{operated}} by a captain, one or two engineers, and two <b>deck</b> <b>hands.</b> The captain does not directly control the direction or speed of the vessel. Instead, the captain relays his commands through a sequence of bells and gongs to the engineer, who controls the engine. Sabino has an average speed of 8 kn and will consume 60 tons of coal annually. It is estimated that Sabino carries approximately 33,000 passengers per year.|$|R
5000|$|On Sunday, December 30, 1962, Gwendoline Steers left New York City at 11:30am on {{a routine}} trip to Northport, Long Island. Aboard the tug was Captain Herbert Dickman, who had thirty years {{experience}} working on tugboats. His crew consisted of eight men including First Mate Robert E. Nolan; Engineers Ray Harrison and Hugh A. Reid; <b>Deck</b> <b>Hands</b> Robert E. Knox, Roy L. Burnett, Rasmus Nordvik, and John Iverson; and Ship's Cook Claude A. Markell.|$|R
60|$|As {{he walked}} {{along the side of}} the cabin he became aware of a figure leaning over the rail, gazing far down into the sea. By the man's general form he made the fellow out to be Walt Wingate. The <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> had hold of something, {{although}} what it was Sam could not tell.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} kind hearted, {{and as the}} Rainbow could use another <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> he told the man to bring his luggage aboard, which the fellow did. The newcomer's name was Walt Wingate, and {{he did his best}} to make friends with {{everybody}} on board. He had a low, musical voice, and was frequently whistling popular airs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you are a}} {{dangerous}} character," [...] said Captain Barforth. [...] "For the present I am going to keep you a prisoner," [...] {{and a few minutes}} later he had Wingate handcuffed and placed under lock and key in a small storeroom. The <b>deck</b> <b>hand</b> did not like this, but he was thankful to escape a worse fate.|$|E
5000|$|To {{add to the}} {{illusion}} of a sea voyage, fans created an ocean breeze, which whistled in the rigging. Lighting effects created day- and night-time, as well as flashes of lightning. There were also sounds of the ship's screw and the steam siren. Seaweed and tar provided an olfactory element of the simulation. Finally, the whole experience was complemented by actors portraying <b>deck</b> <b>hands,</b> rushing about, [...] "ostensibly to help anyone who may suffer from mal de mer".|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{our little}} hero went on <b>deck</b> and <b>handed</b> {{the glass to}} his father--retreating a step or two, {{promptly}} yet quietly, after doing so.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{swung his}} body into space and gripped the rigging. A {{moment later he}} struck the <b>deck,</b> his <b>hands</b> {{tingling}} warmly from the friction.|$|R
