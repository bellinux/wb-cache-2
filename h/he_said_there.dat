5|$|The {{survivor}} was Edgar Forwood, 67-year-old Managing-Director of Forwood Down and Company Ltd., a South Australian engineering company. He was {{the oldest}} person on board the flight, and probably the most experienced air traveller. He was interviewed by police in hospital in Perth, but {{was not aware of}} much detail about the final minutes of the flight. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no sign of fire prior to the crash and no announcement to passengers to fasten their seat belts. He died six days after the crash and was buried at the North Road cemetery in Adelaide, his home town.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days PATU and RLI patrols arrested five insurgents, two of whom were deserters. One of these {{defected}} and agreed to guide the security forces to the ZIPRA base camp, where <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were two guerrillas waiting for him to return, unaware of his desertion and subsequent defection. Shown the way by the ex-cadre an RLI patrol attacked the camp on 24 January and killed one of the two; the other fled and was captured a few days later. The members of Gang 1 were now all killed or captured while only one was outstanding from Gang 2. Gangs 3 and 4 were revealed to be near Sipolilo on 21 January by a black shopkeeper, and two Gang 3 members were encountered by Henson's troop on 24 January. Henson himself opened fire and killed one, who it emerged was the Gang 3 commander. His troop then followed about 10 men until 26 January, when they lost the insurgents' tracks.|$|E

25|$|In late 2012, the Controller and Auditor General of Tanzania, Ludovick Utouh, {{recommended}} the criminal prosecution of three former managers of ATCL for the 2007 lease of the Airbus A320 from Wallis Trading Company, a Lebanese company. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were massive misappropriation and mismanagement of the leasing agreement, {{resulting in an}} accumulated debt of US$41.4million by October 2012, {{all of which is}} guaranteed by the government. The aircraft was in ATCL's possession for 48 months, but it spent 41 of those months in France undergoing a major maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Silvestre Bello, another negotiator, {{said that}} the hostage takers said they want to escape due to abuse from prison {{officials}}. He {{said that the}}y claimed that three of their companions had their ears chopped off by prison officials and also added that they demanded {{to be transferred to}} the National Penitentiary in Muntinlupa. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> would be no hesitations to impose sanctions on prison officials involved if the investigation warranted such action. Bello also defended the military's action saying that the prisoners were determined not to be taken alive.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Hill {{has come}} to public {{attention}} several times. In November 2009, Daily Telegraph blogger James Delingpole credited Bishop Hill with reporting the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs funding of the Climate Outreach and Information Network charity {{in the amount of}} £700,000 over two years. Also in February 2010, Philip Campbell, the editor-in-chief of Nature, resigned from Sir Muir Russell's Independent Climate Change Email Review after Bishop Hill and Channel 4 News drew attention to an interview Campbell had given in 2009 to China Radio International, in which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no evidence the scientists had engaged in a coverup.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecutor}} called Joseph Faulkner, {{a tailor}} who knew Whelan in Montreal, {{hoping that he}} would testify about Whelan's Fenian connections; while he said he recollected Whelan being angered by McGee during the election season, which was contradicted by other witnesses who claimed Whelan showed no interest in politics, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no known Fenian connection. Another witness identified as Turner testified {{that he had heard}} a member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a sworn statement against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner say he would swear his grandfather's life away for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle. Later witnesses were actually directly asked to swear whether they had received any money for their testimony.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, Eric Gomez, {{president}} of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that Álvarez had an immediate rematch clause {{in place on}} his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later also revealed {{in an interview with}} ESPN the fight would take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 pounds with no re-hydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and Álvarez would be able to gain unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On June 5, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight, and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions {{said in a statement that}} Álvarez would fight for the IBF meaning he would participate in the second day weight in, which the IBF require that each boxer weighs no more than 10 pounds over the 160 pound limit. Although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no word on whether Álvarez would fight for the WBC title, Álvarez claimed that he would not be. On July 7, 2017 Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with IGN in February 2007, Barlog said that his goals for God of War II were to continue the previous game's story, expand on several elements, and to feature more epic moments as opposed to cinematics during gameplay. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were many additions to the game, {{but they did not}} differ greatly from the style of the previous game. Set-pieces and large scale epic moments were reworked [...] "so that each battle you have really feels epic and unique." [...] Barlog also hinted that another sequel would be made; he said, [...] "The story has not yet been completed. The end has only just begun." ...|$|E

500|$|Although all {{the grounds}} (except 11) were {{reviewed}} by the court, {{the reason for the}} referral to the Court of Appeal was ground 15, the discovery of DNA on the silencer, the result of a test not available in 1986. The silencer evidence during the trial came from a Mr. Hayward, a biologist in private practice, formerly of the Forensic Science Laboratory. He had found a [...] "considerable amount of blood" [...] inside the silencer; he had stated that it was human blood and that the blood group was consistent with it having come from Sheila. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "remote possibility" [...] that it was a mixture of blood from Nevill and June.|$|E
500|$|Reuters {{reported}} that Tsakalotos was considering not {{running in the}} September 2015 legislative election, as {{he did not want}} to have to implement the bailout agreement. However, these fears were assuaged by Alexis Tsipras when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no doubt that Tsakalotos would stand in the election. He also claimed that, during the election campaign, without Tsakalotos' involvement, there would have been no bailout package. In recognition of that, Tsakalotos was made to head the list for Syriza in Athens B. In an interview during the campaign, Tsakalotos admitted that the Greek government had suffered [...] "defeat" [...] during negotiations with creditors, implying that some responsibility for this lay with his predecessor, Varoufakis.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Arjen and Bernadien's first meeting {{have been reported}} by his former youth coach, Barend Beltman: [...] "Arjen was driven and determined at a young age. He was always on time, never late. But one Friday afternoon he showed up 15 minutes past the start of practice. I asked him what was going on. 'We were at the market square, having fun,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>There</b> were some girls {{with him and his}} friends, so I asked, 'Was she worth it?' 'Yes, trainer, she was,' he told me. I told him to get his gear and join the training session. At his wedding, I heard the woman he met that day was now his wife and mother of his children. Bernadien is her name." ...|$|E

500|$|Liverpool's {{recovery}} {{depended on}} new players being acquired and, in his autobiography, Shankly recalled the struggles {{he had with}} the board to make them realise the club's potential {{and the need to}} spend money on good players. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were times when he felt like walking out. He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly's appointment and shared Shankly's vision of Liverpool as the best club in England. At one board meeting in 1961 when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland, the board's initial response was that [...] "we can't afford them" [...] but Sawyer stepped in and said: [...] "We can't afford not to buy them".|$|E
500|$|On May 24, 1964, {{six months}} after the shooting, the New York Herald Tribune {{reported}} that Altgens—the man responsible for [...] "probably the most controversial photograph of the decade", {{and one of the few}} people standing near the motorcade when Kennedy was shot—had not been questioned either by the FBI or by the Warren Commission. A newspaper column printed in Chicago's American the following day made the same observation. FBI investigators interviewed Altgens eight days later, on June 2, 1964; he testified before the Warren Commission on July 22. By this time, Altgens was aware of the individual who resembled Oswald; Lovelady had been interviewed for the Herald Tribune article, and Altgens testified that he too had been contacted. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was nothing to share because he had not taken part in any assignments involving depository employees.|$|E
500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that this was just a joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> had been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E
5000|$|For the boys, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that Vishwas is {{very good}} and has got good talent, which will take him far. For Vineet, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> is a little problem but was very vague.|$|R

500|$|Nielsen's {{career began}} in {{dramatic}} roles on television during [...] "Television's Golden Age", appearing in 46 live programs in 1950 alone. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> [...] "was very little gold, we only got $75 or $100 per show." [...] He narrated documentaries and commercials {{and most of}} his early work as a dramatic actor was uneventful. Hal Erickson of Allmovie noted that [...] "much of Nielsen's early work was undistinguished; he was merely a handsome leading man in an industry overstocked with handsome leading men." [...] In 1956 he made his feature film debut in the Michael Curtiz-directed musical film The Vagabond King. In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Nielsen remembered Curtiz as [...] "a sadist, a charming sadist, but a sadist". Nielsen called this film [...] "The Vagabond Turkey". Though the film was not a success, producer Nicholas Nayfack offered him an audition for the science fiction film Forbidden Planet, resulting in Nielsen's taking a long contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).|$|E
500|$|On gender equality, Findlay {{announced}} plans for legislation to address the gender pay gap, as well as {{increasing the number of}} women MSPs and the number of women on [...] "the bodies that take decisions for our country". He said that he would lobby the UK government to scrap the UK Trident programme if UK Labour leader Ed Miliband became prime minister in the next election and that he wanted to renationalise the railways in Scotland, bring an end to public-private partnerships, and commit the party to full employment. He supported introducing a 50 per cent tax band [...] "to tackle poverty and youth unemployment", but urged caution on tax devolvement to ensure Scotland did not end up [...] "worse off". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> would be [...] "no privatisation of the NHS under my leadership". If elected he promised to [...] "hit the ground running", and said he would be ready to take on SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon at the next session of First Minister's Questions.|$|E
500|$|The Aid and Rescue Committee {{decided to}} ask Wisliceny whether the SS were, as Kasztner {{wrote in a}} later report, [...] "prepared to {{negotiate}} with the illegal Jewish rescue committee on an economic basis about the moderation of the anti-Jewish measures". Brand and Kasztner met Wisliceny on 5 April. They told him they were in a position to continue Fleischmann's negotiations and could offer $2 million with a down payment of $200,000. They asked that there be no deportations, mass executions or pogroms in Hungary, no ghettos or camps, and that Jews who held immigration certificates for Palestine (issued by the British mandatory government) be allowed to leave. Wisliceny accepted the $200,000, but indicated that $2 million might not be enough. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> would be no deportations and no harm to the Jewish community while negotiations continued, and arranged for Aid and Rescue Committee exemptions from anti-Jewish laws to allow its members to travel and use cars and telephones.|$|E

5000|$|Vice President Joe Biden {{mentioned}} Maybank at {{the dedication}} ceremony for the Ernest Hollings Special Collections Library at the University of South Carolina on July 23, 2010. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You know, an old governor of yours, Burnet Maybank, once wrote an essay entitled, 'Who Is the South Carolinian?' And here's what it <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there's</b> a deal—there is a deal of kindness about him, describing the South Carolinian. He feels favored when asked for personal assistance. A neighborly spirit prompts him to render service with a scorn for remuneration." ...|$|R
