He has {{compared}} the Quran to Mein Kampf and has campaigned to have the book banned in the Netherlands. He advocates ending immigration from Muslim countries, and supports banning {{the construction of new}} mosques. Wilders was a speaker at the Facing Jihad Conference held in Israel in 2008, which discussed the dangers of jihad, and has called for a hard line against what he called [...] "street terror" [...] exerted by minorities in Dutch cities. His controversial 2008 film featuring his views on Islam, Fitna, received international attention and extreme criticism. His party was also sued due to content being used in his film without permission. He has been described in the media as populist and labeled far-right, although this is disputed by other observers. Wilders, who long refused to align himself with European far-right leaders such as Jean-Marie Le Pen and Jörg Haider and expressed concern about being [...] "linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups", views himself as a right-wing liberal. More recently, however, Wilders worked together with the French National Front's Marine Le Pen in an initially ill-fated, but eventually successful attempt to form a parliamentary group in the European Parliament which now includes parties from nine countries, among them Austria's Freedom Party, Italy's Northern League, and Belgium's <b>Flemish</b> <b>Interest.</b>|$|E

In the run-up to and aftermath of those European elections, Wilders worked with the French Front National's Marine Le Pen to try {{to form a new}} parliamentary group in the European Parliament. They first announced their collaboration during a joint press conference in November 2013, where Wilders vowed that [...] "today {{is the beginning of the}} liberation from the European elite, the monster in Brussels". Wilders visited the Sweden Democrats party and spoke with the Austrian Freedom party's leader Heinz-Christian Strache to help bring about the alliance, even while rejecting Hungary's Jobbik and Germany's NPD because he wanted to exclude [...] "right-wing extremist and racist" [...] parties. Three days after the elections finished, Le Pen and Wilders presented another press conference, this time with Matteo Salvini of Italy's Northern League, Harald Vilimsky of Austria's Freedom Party and Gerolf Annemans of Belgium's <b>Flemish</b> <b>Interest</b> party, to promise that the parliamentary group would be formed. Eventually, however, the effort failed because it could only unite parties from six EU member states, one fewer than is required by parliamentary rules. This was in part due to a refusal to include the Greek Golden Dawn or Poland's Congress of the New Right, and in part because parties like the Danish People's party and the True Finns refused to join.|$|E

50|$|During {{a remarkably}} {{successful}} career lasting from 1506 {{until her death}} in 1530, Margaret broke new ground for women rulers. After the early death of her brother Philip of Spain, in November 1506 she became the only woman elected as its ruler by the representative assembly of Franche-Comté (her title was confirmed in 1509). Her father Emperor Maximilian named her governor of the Low Countries and guardian of her young nephew Charles (the future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) in 1507. From her newly built palace at Mechelen, Margaret acted as intermediary between her father and her nephew's subjects in the Netherlands, negotiated a treaty of commerce with England favorable to the <b>Flemish</b> cloth <b>interests,</b> and {{played a role in}} the formation of the League of Cambrai (1508).After his majority in 1515, Charles rebelled against her influence, but he soon recognized her as one of his wisest advisers, and -the only regent ever re-appointed indefinitely by the ruler who dismissed her- she was again governor of the Netherlands from 1519 until her death in on 1 December 1530.

40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{explanatory}} power and to explore the compatibility of three major accounts of policy continuity and change in cross-border policy domains: negotiation analysis (NA), the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), and the punctuated-equilibrium (PE) framework. These frameworks are used to analyze policies for the river Scheldt estuary between 1967 and 2005. The estuary of the river Scheldt is situated partly in the Belgian region of Flanders and partly in the Netherlands. Major international policy issues in this estuary are the maritime access to the port of Antwerp, water and sediment pollution, and estuarine rehabilitation. It will be shown that the negotiations on these issues are characterized by complex issue linkages, and that NA does very well in explaining both deadlocks and international policy agreement. However, unlike the ACF, NA does not specify how actors come to define their interests. Moreover, we will argue that learning across the prodevelopment Antwerp coalition and the cross-border environmentalist coalition accounts for a gradual convergence of Dutch and <b>Flemish</b> perceived <b>interests.</b> Finally, PE offers useful complementary insights as Scheldt estuary policies cannot be understood without addressing the interrelations between the processes of negotiation, learning, the creation and enforcement of game rules, which {{have been going on}} in different venues simultaneously. ...|$|R

It was not unusual to rebuild the publicly visible facades of a house leaving those less visible, or lower in the social hierarchy of the house untouched, perhaps with a plan to carry out a second stage of rebuilding as funds (or inclination) allowed. The straight joints and discrepancy in the courses of brickwork between the west elevation and that of the southern in-fill show clearly the different phases of renovation.|$|R

To investigate the expectations of pharmacists related to continuous education, and to explore new concepts in training. An 1) On-line survey of recently graduated pharmacists, focusing on competency development and personal learning styles 2) Brainstorm sessions (n= 3) with pharmacists, academic staff and IPSA-members to discuss new concepts in training 3) Prospective, quasi-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial and semi-structured interviews with pharmacists Analysis was performed with Statistica, Microsoft Excel and Nvivo 10. In total, 363 pharmacists aged 23 - 33 years completed the questionnaire. Attending oral lectures was still the most preferred way of learning. However, respondents indicated that current lectures should focus more on community pharmacy practice. Moreover, they showed interest for further development of e-learning modules, and for interactive workshops with real cases. The working group recommended the implementation of learning cycles, including preparatory work by attendees and evaluations after the course. They also suggested the development of several learning tracks and work forms to offer pharmacists the possibility to make choices according to their personal needs. Although the trial (n= 63) showed that preparation before a course did not result in a significant increase in knowledge, a greater sense of involvement was reported. Ideal preparation is short (10 - 30 minutes), case-based, practice-oriented and not too difficult.

40|$|Digital {{information}} systems (ISs) aim for efficiency gains, savings and high {{benefits such as}} better service delivery or improved fraud detection. Yet benefits are often not reached in practice as IS projects are confronted with serious obstacles. Despite high efforts and enthusiastic project teams, failure is omnipresent for public sector ISs all over the world. Public sector IS failure can imply nasty consequences such as wasted tax payers’ money, governmental reputational damage, a poor front-office service or inefficiencies etc. (Rana et al, 2013; Goldfinch, 2007; McManus & Wood-Harper, 2007; Lyytinen & Hirschheim, 1987). Understanding failure is essential to develop, implement, manage and operationalise ISs effectively (Sauer & Davis, 2012). There is still a high need and much room for additional failure research. This dissertation aims to reduce three main research gaps: (1) A shortage of in-depth research on how public sector IS projects unfold and result in failure. (2) A lack of government-to-government (G 2 G) IS studies, {{while the majority of}} G 2 G IS projects is a partial or total failure. (3) A dearth of models to study IS project failure (Goldfinch, 2007; Homburg & Bekkers, 2002; Kautz & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2013; Pan et al, 2006 a,b; Yang & Maxwell, 2011). Given these gaps, the main research question of this dissertation focuses on how G 2 G IS projects in Flanders unfold and result in failure. This question is operationalised via three sub-questions. The first concerns what useful models from the IS research domain exist to analyse G 2 G IS failure in Flanders. The second sub-questions looks on how these models could be refined. While the third focuses on what determines failure according to Flemish G 2 G IS managers. The IS failure research literature distinguishes multiple concepts, causes and management approaches of failure. In this dissertation a G 2 G IS project is believed to have failed when it does not meet the expectations of its stakeholders and runs out of support (Lyytinen & Hirsscheim, 1987; Sauer, 1993). The usefulness of three models to analyse G 2 G IS failure was studied. Two of these models fit the rational factor lens on failure which sees failure as a combination of causally linked factors, failure is identified by {{the presence or absence of}} these factors (Kautz & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2013; Sauer & Davis, 2012). The first model which fits the factor lens is the IS success model of Delone & McLean (1993; 2003), the second model is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology by Venkatesch et al (2003). The third selected model fits the process lens, this lens sees failure as a personal value judgement and as the result of dynamic interaction processes between multiple context factors, the IS project organisation and its key stakeholders, whereby the IS ultimately runs out of support. Sauer’s (1993) IS failure model fits this lens. The usefulness of each model was tested based on two criteria: its applicability to research failure in a public sector context and its degree of completeness for detecting causes of failed G 2 G IS projects. The D&M model, UTAUT and IS failure model were tested on 5 Flemish G 2 G IS projects (the Road Sign Database, the Environmental Complaints Registration and Monitoring System, Going Out, the Library Information and Monitoring System and the Plan Merits system). The first two projects were tested in case studies, the last three via a survey combined with interviews. The IS failure model was also tested on a sixth IS project (i. e. the Digital Building Permit IS). All ISs were initiated by a Flemish project organisation (also called the IS project managers or idea champions) and required mainly data of municipalities. Three research steps were undertaken to test the usefulness of each model. First, data were collected via document analysis and interviews. No model specific questions were asked during interviews in order to let the data emerge inductively and speak for itself. Second, the IS projects were re-examined by looking through the lens of the D&M model, UTAUT and IS failure model. This deductive approach provided insight whether or not these models were applicable to analyse G 2 G IS failure causes. In a third step, the causes of failure that the models detected were compared to the indeductive list of causes, which allowed for a check of completeness. The research results show that each model can be applied to the public sector and is able to detect several causes of G 2 G IS failure. The D&M model appeared to be the least complete in detecting failure factors, while the IS failure model is the most complete one. The combination of the D&M model and UTAUT learns more than each model on its own. The IS failure model goes beyond the identification of factors as it is able to explain how ISs failed via multiple interactions of support, management and context processes. In total the models identified 21 recurrent failure factors. Although the three models are useful, they could be further refined, for example by better defining (sub-) constructs, describing how sub-constructs could be operationalised or by adapting constructs to a public sector context. In order to answer the third sub-question concerning what Flemish G 2 G IS managers determine as a failure, 20 G 2 G experts were interviewed and 32 Flemish G 2 G IS project managers were put together in five focus groups to allow cross-fertilisation of knowledge. The Flemish G 2 G IS managers and experts signalled 14 recurrent political-administrative, technical, economical and legal problems of failure. They also described the context of these problems and with whose support these might be solved. The experiences of the questioned G 2 G IS expert and managers combined with practical insights from the studied IS projects, led to some management advice: 1. Check for no go's at the start 2. Oblige a business and value case 3. Pay attention to supplier management 4. Say yes to user involvement, no to scope creep 5. Make clear agreements 6. Do not cut on testing and consider an agile way of working 7. Provide sufficient service quality 8. Do not block critique 9. Prove an IS's value 10. Don't burn your bridges 11. Be visionary This dissertation took an interpretivist stance in order to uncover deeper causes of failure. Based on the insights gained throughout this PhD journey, some G 2 G specific elements and five root causes of why Flemish G 2 G IS projects result in failure could be identified: 1. The tendency to focus on <b>Flemish</b> government <b>interests</b> and a local IS fatigue 2. A lack of coordination and integration of Flemish IS initiatives 3. A political lack of understanding ISs 4. Differences in organisational capacity 5.

The party was denied state funding and was therefore disbanded. Vlaams Blok supporters saw the conviction as a politically motivated action, and point out that the constitution had to be changed to allow for the conviction.
