A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E

In this case, the EMF {{is due to}} the <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> (qE) term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an induced EMF, as described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation (one of the four modern Maxwell's equations).|$|E

25|$|Finally, in 1785, the French {{physicist}} Charles-Augustin de Coulomb {{published his}} first three reports of electricity and magnetism where he stated his law. This publication was essential {{to the development of}} the theory of electromagnetism. He used a torsion balance to study the repulsion and attraction forces of charged particles, and determined that the magnitude of the <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
25|$|Cavendish's {{electrical}} and chemical experiments, like those on heat, had begun while {{he lived with}} his father in a laboratory in their London house. Lord Charles Cavendish died in 1783, leaving almost all of his very substantial estate to Henry. Like his theory of heat, Cavendish's comprehensive theory of electricity was mathematical in form and was based on precise quantitative experiments. In 1771 he published an early version of his theory, based on an expansive electrical fluid that exerted pressure. He demonstrated that if the intensity of <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> was inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid in excess of that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally. Cavendish continued to work on electricity after this initial paper, but he published no more on the subject.|$|E

Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar.

500|$|Justus von Liebig {{is another}} {{important}} figure {{in the development of}} the new thinking, although his position is ambiguous. [...] He explained chemical processes in the body in terms of addition and subtraction of simple molecules from a larger organic molecule, a concept that Bird followed in his own work. [...] But even the materialistic Liebig continued to invoke the vital force for processes inside living animal bodies. [...] This seems to have been based on a belief that the entire living animal is required for these chemical processes to take place. [...] Bird helped to dispel this kind of thinking by showing that specific chemistry is related to specific organs in the body rather than to the whole animal. [...] He challenged some of Liebig's conclusions concerning animal chemistry. For example, Liebig had predicted that the ratio of uric acid to urea would depend on the level of activity of a species or individual; Bird showed this to be false. [...] Bird also felt that it was not enough simply to count atoms as Liebig did, but that an explanation was also required as to why the atoms recombined in one particular way rather than any other. [...] He made some attempts to provide this explanation by invoking the <b>electric</b> <b>force,</b> rather than the vital force, based on his own experiments in electrolysis.Brock, p. 310Rosenfeld, 2003, p. 1701Wermuth, p. 5Rosenfeld, 1999, p. 50 ...|$|E
