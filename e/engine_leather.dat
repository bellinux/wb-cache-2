25|$|A {{passenger}} airbag was offered {{as an option}} in the Series II facelift of October 1995. The unique design allowed it to protect the not only the front passenger, but the centre passenger as well (only the entry-level GLi was offered with the optional bench seat). The Fairmont Ghia was the only trim level to receive dual airbags as standard, which also benefited from the XR6 <b>engine,</b> <b>leather</b> upholstery, extensive use of chrome and lowered suspension. With the use of neoprene rubber insulation, road and wind noise was cut off from within the cabin, contributing to vehicle refinement. Ford also dropped the XR6 station wagon from the lineup in the Series II.|$|E
5000|$|The Limited was the top-of-the-line {{version of}} the Kia Borrego, had a $37,995.00 MSRP base price, and added {{features}} such as: a standard 4.6L V8 <b>engine,</b> <b>leather</b> seating surfaces, power dual front bucket seats, upgraded alloy wheels, heated dual front bucket seats, optional touch-screen GPS navigation with voice recognition, and a Homelink transmitter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{convertible}} {{returned for}} the 1964 300K, but the [...] "cross-ram" [...] engine became an extra-cost option {{available on the}} 300K only. A 413 CID L Wedge with a single Carter AFB 3614S 4-barrel carburetor, a regular intake manifold, and [...] was the new standard <b>engine.</b> <b>Leather</b> upholstery was no longer standard either. All this reduced the baseline price by over a thousand dollars, and sales responded with the largest total ever; 3,022 coupes and 625 convertibles. A center console was standard.|$|E
25|$|Even the {{standard}} GT conversion gets Shelby headrest covers, special GT dash plaque and <b>engine</b> plate. <b>Leather</b> upholstery in black is standard along with electrically adjustable seats.|$|R
5000|$|The more {{expensive}} [...] "Lux" [...] trim level had {{the more powerful}} 2.4 l, 142 hp <b>engine,</b> a <b>leather</b> interior, an anti-theft system, and front fog lamps.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} years of {{aviation}} pilots started wearing leather flying helmets as a form of protection from the cold and the noise of aircraft <b>engines.</b> <b>Leather</b> was becoming a popular choice for protective gear with the rise of motor sport and aviation {{at the start of the}} 1900s. It has many advantages that made it the ideal material for flying helmets. It is warm, durable, impermeable to liquids therefore waterproof, flexible and can be cut to curve around the head. It is wind-proof and has the great advantage of not accumulating dust. It was also found that leather helmets offered a level of protection against fire.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Mazda Canada {{offered a}} limited special edition model of its Mazda MX-3 GS to {{celebrate}} the company's 25th year in Canada. At the same time, Mazda USA offered a similar model in a special edition as well. Only a total of 2,000 were supposedly made. The special edition MX-3 featured the V6 <b>engine,</b> <b>leather</b> interior (including seats, steering wheel and shift knob), heated seats (Canada only), and custom Enkei manufactured 15 inch alloy wheels. Most special edition models came in the color [...] "raspberry metallic"; however, there was also [...] "blaze" [...] red, [...] "brilliant" [...] black, and [...] "laguna" [...] blue.|$|E

50|$|The Luce Royal Classic (and lesser-spec Limited) {{was more}} {{expensive}} than its 929 counterpart, featuring greater technical innovation—both were pillarless hardtops. The Royal Classic was factory fitted with a turbocharged 13B Rotary or 2.0-liter V6 <b>engines,</b> electric <b>leather</b> seats, digital speedometer, a cool-box for canned beverages, prominent emblems, electronically adjustable suspension and power options throughout. In order to satisfy Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, this generation vehicle was built in two versions; the 3.0-liter V6 was installed in the longer and wider hardtop bodystyle, and the smaller engines, including the rotary engine, were installed in the shorter and narrower sedan bodystyle. Japanese owners who chose the rotary engine received financial benefits in a lower annual road tax bill over trim packages with the larger V6 engine. It was the larger model that carried over to the next platform that introduced the Mazda Sentia.|$|R
50|$|As part of Chrysler's new {{marketing}} strategy which addressed concerns that its brands were treading into each other's marketing territory, Plymouth, as Chrysler Corporation's low-price brand for essentially its entire existence, was to focus exclusively on value. As a result, the Breeze (as {{well as the}} base model Stratus) filled the position as the entry-level JA car. Due to this, the Breeze lacked certain features including an available V6 <b>engine,</b> alloy wheels, <b>leather</b> interior, body-colored door handles, fog lights, and Chrysler's Autostick transmission, {{all of which were}} offered on the Stratus and Cirrus.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore a route towards surface engineering both {{by the introduction of}} a conceptual framework called Interactive Surface Modelling (ISM) and by the actual application of the concept on two functional surfaces of importance to the automotive industry: cylinder liners for <b>engines</b> and <b>leather</b> imitation surfaces for the interior of cars. The results are presented in six separate but related papers concerning the construction of the ISM system shell and the use of modern technology to explore and represent the functional knowledge relevant to the specification of surface properties. Functional demands control the route from the designer's specification of suitable characterization parameters to the manufacturing engineer's choice of machining processes and data and ultimately to the quality control engineer's choice of measuring devices and measuring strategy. A prototype was developed, where two functional surfaces were implemented: the cylinder liner surface for car <b>engines</b> and the <b>leather</b> imitation surface for car interiors. The prototype system was developed in the MS-Windows environment using commercial softwares and a unique concept for the specification of desired surface properties where functional surfaces are divided into a number of separate functional requirements (more or less independent) that could separately be specified in terms of design parameters, manufacturing variables, and measuring dito. Several tools were developed for the representation of the surface topography and characterization of the functional behaviour of the surface. CAD systems were used for the representation of simulated 3 D surfaces and various 3 D surface roughness measuring devices were tested to see which method would give the best insight and knowledge of cylinder liner surfaces subjected to engine tests. In order to study the wear process in the cylinder liner surface, an effective relocation and replication technique was developed and measurements were made not only with traditional stylus equipments but also with Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) that revealed some of the mechanisms of cylinder liner wear invisible to the ordinary 3 D stylus technique. The introduction of the AFM measurements to the field of surface engineering was a major breakthrough for the functional characterization of surfaces in my work with the ISM concept and much points to the benefits of using the AFM to seek answers to surface engineering questions in the new world of surface features accessible to this instrument...|$|R
50|$|From 1842 he alternated as {{engine driver}} with his assistant, Bockmüller. His health was seriously damaged by his occupation, however, {{because he would}} stand on the driver's {{platform}} in all weathers in a gentleman's overcoat and top hat, but without any protection from the elements. Not until the winter of 1845/46 were <b>engine</b> drivers given <b>leather</b> coats as protection against the weather. Finally, eight years later, the engines were furnished with protective roofs over the driver's stand. In spite of tempting offers by the Bavarian State Railway, Wilson remained with the Ludwig Railway. In 1859, {{he was unable to}} work regularly {{as a result of his}} worsening health. At the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Ludwig Railway he was greatly honoured. He died on 17 April 1862 in Nuremberg) as a result of his illness. He was buried at St. John's Cemetery in Nuremberg, his funeral being attended by a large section of the population. His grave is still visible today.|$|R
