40|$|Symplectic integrators do not, in general, {{reproduce}} all {{the features}} of the dynamics of the Hamiltonian systems which they approximate. For example, energy conservation is lost, and global features such as separatrices can be destroyed. We study these effects for a Hamiltonian system with a single degree of freedom and the simplest possible symplectic integrator. We look at a sequence of Hamiltonian systems of higher and higher dimension, that interpolate between the original Hamiltonian system and the symplectic integrator. In these <b>intermediate</b> Hamiltonian <b>systems</b> we can make concrete statements about energy conservation and separatrix splitting. The qualitative dynamics of the symplectic integrator seems to be inherited from these <b>intermediate</b> <b>systems,</b> and in some cases we can even deduce quantitative results for the symplectic integrator from those of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>systems.</b> 1...|$|R
60|$|With M M, the {{magnetic}} line, running {{from top to}} bottom, with f f its northern pole, or pole of attraction; and m m its south, or pole of repulsion, and E E, running from left to right, one of the lines that spring from each point of M M, with its east, or pole of contraction, and d its west, or pole of diffluence and expansion—we have presented to us the universal quadruplicity, or four elemental forms of power; in the endless proportions and modifications of which, the innumerable offspring of all-bearing Nature consist. Wisely docile to the suggestions of Nature herself, the ancients significantly expressed these forces under the names of earth, water, air, and fire; not meaning any tangible or visible substance so generalized, but the powers predominant, and, as it were, the living basis of each, which no chemical decomposition can ever present to the senses, were it only that their interpenetration and co-inherence first constitutes them sensible, and is the condition and meaning of a—thing. Already our more truly philosophical naturalists (Ritter, for instance) have begun to generalize the four great elements of chemical nomenclature, carbon, azote, oxygen, and hydrogen: the two former as {{the positive and negative}} pole of {{the magnetic}} axis, or as the power of fixity and mobility; and the two latter as the opposite poles, or plus and minus states of cosmical electricity, as the powers of contraction and dilatation, or of comburence and combustibility. These powers are to each other as longitude to latitude, and the poles of each relatively as north to south, and as east to west. For surely the reader will find no distrust in a system only because Nature, ever consistent with herself, presents us everywhere with harmonious and accordant symbols of her consistent doctrines. Nothing would be more easy than, by the ordinary principles of sound logic and common sense, to demonstrate the impossibility and expose the absurdity of the corpuscularian or mechanic system, or than to prove the intenable nature of any <b>intermediate</b> <b>system.</b> But we cannot force any man into an insight or intuitive possession of the true philosophy, because we cannot give him abstraction, intellectual intuition, or constructive imagination; because we cannot organize for him an eye that can see, an ear that can listen to, or a heart that can feel, the harmonies of Nature, or recognise in her endless forms, the thousand-fold realization of those simple and majestic laws, which yet in their absoluteness can be discovered only in the recesses of his own spirit,—not by that man, therefore, whose imaginative powers have been ossified by the continual reaction and assimilating influences of mere objects on his mind, and who is a prisoner to his own eye and its reflex, the passive fancy!—not by him in whom an unbroken familiarity with the organic world, as if it were mechanical, with the sensitive, but as if it were insensate, has engendered the coarse and hard spirit of a sorcerer. The former is unable, the latter unwilling, to master the absolute pre-requisites. There is neither hope nor occasion for him “to cudgel his brains about it, he has no feeling of the business.” If he do not see the necessity from without, if he have not learned the possibility from within, of interpenetration, of total intussusception, of the existence of all in each as the condition of Nature’s unity and substantiality, and of the latency under the predominance of some one power, wherein subsists her life and its endless variety, as he must be, by habitual slavery to the eye, or its reflex, the passive fancy, under the influences of the corpuscularian philosophy, he has so paralysed his imaginative powers as to be unable—or by that hardness and heart-hardening spirit of contempt, which is sure to result from a perpetual commune with the lifeless, he has so far debased his inward being—as to be unwilling to comprehend the pre-requisite, he must be content, while standing thus at the threshold of philosophy, to receive the results, though he cannot be admitted to the deliberation—in other words, to act upon rules which he is incapable of understanding as LAWS, and to reap the harvest with the sharpened iron for which others have delved for him in the mine.|$|E

40|$|Fieldbus {{networks}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in industrial computer-controlled systems. More recently, there has been the desire to extend the capabilities of fieldbuses to cover functionalities not previously considered in such networks, with particular emphasis on industrial wireless communications. Thinking about wireless means considering hybrid wired/wireless solutions capable of interoperating with legacy (wired) systems. One possible solution is to use <b>intermediate</b> <b>systems</b> (IS) acting as repeaters to interconnect the wired and wireless parts.
