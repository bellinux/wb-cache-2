Instead of using active devices, {{which are the}} main sources of noise and power consumption, an oscillation at half of the input frequency is sustained by the parametric process based on non-linear interaction with the input signal.

Background. Coherent optical {{spectrum}} analyzers (COSA) {{are widely used}} in data processing systems. The efficiency of the spectrum analyzers is determined by their generalized characteristics such as the operating range of spatial frequencies, spatial bandwidth, the spatial spectral resolution and the energy resolution. One of such characteristics is geometric noise bandwidth GNBW that determines the spatial spectral resolution of spectrum analyzer. Objective. The {{purpose of this article}} is to provide a physical and mathematical model of COSA for calculating its geometric noise bandwidth, which determines the spatial spectral resolution of the spectrum analyzer. Methods. Based on the analysis of physical-mathematical model of COSA invited to determine the field amplitude at the output of the spectrum analyzer using the geometric noise bandwidth. Results. It was found that the spectrum analyzer can be considered as a coherent optical invariant linear system characterized by the impulse response and a transfer function.

A hard limiter shows phase shift variations through inputamplitude dependent changes in output waveform, combined with bandwidth limitations. It is shown that these can be kept small only for limiter bandwidths much larger than the input frequency. A linear amplifier with variable gain used for AM suppression does not suffer from this problem. A CMOS variablegain amplifier with gain-insensitive phase shift has been designed for this purpose.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the adsorption of components from a binary mixture, the nonlinear frequency response (FR) of a chromatographic column, packed with the adsorbent of interest, is analyzed using the concept of higher order frequency response functions (FRFs). At first the same approach is used to study the single solute adsorption. By applying the nonlinear FR method for estimation of single solute adsorption isotherms the first, second and third local derivatives of the isotherm for chosen steady-states can be estimated from the low frequency asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding FRFs. This method appears to be somewhat more complex compared to other classical ones, but very useful for estimation of isotherms possessing complex shapes (e. g. inflection points) ([1]). Analysis of the theoretically derived FRFs for the binary adsorption case {{has shown that the}} local derivatives of the competitive isotherms can be also estimated from the low frequency asymptotes of the corresponding FRFs. In this case, the periodical concentration change of one and both components at the input should be considered ([2]). The aim of this investigation is to find the best way to estimate these FRFs from the inlet and outlet concentration changes. The first step is to perform the harmonic analysis over the selected input and output data corresponding to a certain frequency and <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the inlet concentration change. Afterwards the FRFs are calculated from the input and output harmonics, whereby one or more <b>input</b> <b>amplitudes</b> can be used. It has been shown at the single solute adsorption case, that the nonlinearity of the investigated system is more pronounced at higher <b>input</b> <b>amplitudes</b> ([1]). If it is necessary to use higher <b>input</b> <b>amplitude</b> for very accurate estimation of the third order FRF, then contributions of higher harmonics can not be neglected and they should be properly accounted. One {{way to do that is}} to estimate the first order FRF from lower and the third order FRF from higher <b>input</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> whereby the second order FRF can be estimated from both <b>input</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Alternatively it is possible to estimate the FRFs from more <b>input</b> <b>amplitudes</b> considering contributions <b>of</b> higher harmonics up to the seventh. Since it is possible to change periodically the concentration of only one component at the input, keeping the concentration of the other component constant, one should be careful regarding the input function which is used for calculation of the FRFs. The applicability of this method will be evaluated. [1] Ilić M., Petkovska M., Seidel-Morgenstern A.
