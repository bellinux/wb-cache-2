Through simulation of generated danger flow, consistent with the operating conditions of the plant, the compliance conditions in the early step of emergency management and the practical procedures for the implementation of the identified hazard scenarios have been laid down.

40|$|Corn ethanol {{plants have}} been criticized {{for a number of reasons}} in recent years. This paper {{provides}} another ground for criticizing these plants. Historical corn and gasoline prices are uncorrelated, but widespread adoption of corn ethanol production might reasonably lead to future correlation between these prices. We present a real options [...] like valuation of an ethanol plant as a spark spread between the corn price and the gasoline price. This analysis shows that the value of an ethanol plant monotonically decreases with increasing correlation and the optimal production schedule greatly depends on the correlation. Even relatively small new correlations can result in a significant proportional value decrease; a 50 % correlation between corn and <b>gasoline</b> causes ethanol <b>plants</b> to lose 10 % of their value.

The 10 mi by 3 mi field {{includes}} southeastern Payne County, northwestern Creek County, and northeastern Lincoln County. Named for its primary supply center at Cushing, Oklahoma, the field was developed from 1912, when the discovery well, the Wheeler No. 1 Oil Well came in near Drumright for wildcatter Thomas Baker Slick, Sr.. [...] Peak production was in May 1917 at 310,000 barrels per day, accounting for two thirds of the refinable crude oil production in the western hemisphere during that time, and provided twenty percent of the petroleum sold in the United States in 1915-1916. At the peak, 3,090 wells were producing, making the field the most significant production field in Oklahoma. The Drumright Dome, near Drumright, Oklahoma, was the first area to be exploited, followed by the Shamrock Dome. The field stimulated the construction of up to fifty refineries and ten natural <b>gasoline</b> ("casinghead gasoline") <b>plants</b> in the area. Production declined quickly after 1920, dropping to 6,209 barrels per day in 1955.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe carbon {{mitigation}} {{benefits and}} economics are described for alternative coal energy conversion options for which CO 2 is captured and sold for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Both the CO 2 capture cost and internal {{rate of return}} on equity (IRRE) are considered as economic metrics. Post-combustion, oxycombustion, and pre-combustion capture options are considered for power generation, and pre-combustion capture options are also considered for making synthetic gasoline and for coproducing gasoline and electricity. In addition, coprocessing some biomass with coal is considered for <b>plants</b> coproducing <b>gasoline</b> and electricity. Findings for prospective crude oil prices are that: (i) the most profitable options using only coal are systems providing synthetic gasoline; (ii) systems coproducing electricity + gasoline are more profitable than any systems providing only electricity; (iii) options coprocessing some biomass will become the most profitable options at high GHG emission prices, and (iv) <b>gasoline</b> and coproduction <b>plants,</b> even sited remotely from CO 2 EOR market opportunities, are likely to be competitive in EOR markets if an adequate CO 2 pipeline infrastructure were in place; (v) coal/biomass systems coproducing gasoline + electricity {{are likely to be more}} profitable coal/biomass systems making gasoline for crude oil prices less than $ 75 /barrel...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{refinery}} began a long-range modernization and expansion of its facilities to accommodate the new post-war consumer demands for petroleum products. The refinery constructed units that increased production of highly refined products for the postwar generation of higher-compression engines. In 1951, a [...] residuum stripper was constructed to convert heavy residual fuel oil into lighter products. In 1959, the company made a major breakthrough when it developed the Isocracking process which uses catalysts to rearrange the existing molecules of heavy fuel oils to remove sulfur and convert low-value fuel oils into higher-yield products such as gasoline. The company also completed a new fluid catalytic cracking unit capable of processing [...] daily of feed stock, further adding to the high-octane gasolines being demanded in rapidly increasing quantities by modern, high-compression automobile engines. In 1965, a breakthrough came when the Richmond refinery opened the world's largest Isomax hydrocracking complex. The unit converts heavy petroleum oils to lighter stocks for gasoline and other higher valued products. The -a-day unit increased the <b>plant's</b> <b>gasoline</b> output by 40%. A solvent de-asphalting plant and a hydrogen manufacturing plant were also constructed to support the Isomax and were the largest of their kind ever constructed.|$|R
