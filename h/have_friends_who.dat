40|$|Although {{high rates}} of sexual victimization have been {{reported}} among homeless youth, less is known about whether the risk factors vary for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth compared to heterosexual youth. Based on a sample of 172 homeless young adults ages 19 to 26, results revealed that depressive symptoms, prostitution, and <b>having</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> traded sex {{were significantly associated with}} higher levels of sexual victimization. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual young adults experienced more sexual victimization compared to heterosexual young adults. A test for interactions revealed that the effect of sexual orientation on sexual victimization was moderated by trading sex and <b>having</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> traded sex. Finally, there is support for partial mediation of the effects of sexual abuse, neglect, and depressive symptoms on sexual victimization through other risk factors...|$|R

I {{am not an}} artist who can sit about here for days and potter about with a paintbox, and look at a sunset or a streak of wild lavender, or the shimmering of the yellow sands, {{as though it were}} {{something}} so marvelous that life itself stood still while they realized it. I like beautiful places and beautiful things, but I hate the impersonality of it all. I want to feel the touch of lace and furs and fine linen, to eat soft food, to listen to music, to ride when I want to, to sleep when I want to, to <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> admire me, men friends worth speaking to, different from these yokels round here.

You had no friends in Paris--neither, I think, had he. I believe I am correct in saying that you had neither of you ever been there before. If your brother has fallen into bad hands, and if those same people are trying to work upon your fears by leading you into this sort of thing--well, I <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> are powerful enough to bring you safely out of any den of thieves in the world. You are in an impossible situation, my dear young lady. Nature never meant you for an adventuress. There is no necessity for you to become one. Why do you look at me like that?" ...|$|E

Many a gentleman lives well upon a soft head, who would find a heart of the same quality a very great drawback. Listen to me. This {{is a matter of}} business, with which sympathies and sentiments have nothing to do. As a mutual friend, I wish to arrange it in a {{satisfactory}} manner, if possible; and thus the case stands.--If you are very poor now, it's your own choice. You <b>have</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who,</b> in case of need, are always ready to help you. My friend is in a more destitute and desolate situation than most men, and, you and he being linked together in a common cause, he naturally looks to you to assist him. He has boarded and lodged with me a long time (for as I said just now, I am very soft-hearted), and I quite approve of his entertaining this opinion. You have always had a roof over your head; he has always been an outcast. You have your son to comfort and assist you; he has nobody at all. The advantages must not be all one side. You are in the same boat, and we must divide the ballast a little more equally.' ...|$|E
