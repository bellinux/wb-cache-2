5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|Balch's {{investigations}} into geomorphology and hydrology {{led to his}} decision {{to try to find}} the origins of the water that rose to the surface at Wookey Hole Caves, the source of the River Axe. In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as he believed it was too dangerous for amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E

5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E
5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> the ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E

Veronica talks to one of Betina’s friends, who says that Dick mistreated her, and Betina’s goal was for Dick to get her pregnant so she could get him in trouble. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Veronica is pushed into second place at the Kane scholarship after Angie. Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford. Wallace points out Rhonda’s sister to Veronica, but she doesn’t give Veronica any information. Veronica asks Keith to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> the financial records of the bus crash victims. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda’s family, who got a $2 million bailout from Woody (Steve Guttenberg).|$|E
5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
