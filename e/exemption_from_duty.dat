Following the resignation of his brother, Barnuta, Vitslav I was mentioned in documents in 1221 as the Prince of Rügen. This year is also first time that there is a record of German settlers in the mainland territories of Rügen. In subsequent years, he again {{took part in}} wars on the side of Valdemar II, for example, in 1225 at the Battle of Mölln and in 1227 at the Battle of Bornhöved. Despite the defeat of the Danes, he held firmly to his feudal relation with Denmark. In 1231 he founded the Cistercian monastery of Neuenkamp (now Franzburg). In 1234, he gave Stralsund its town rights and granted the town privileges such as fishing rights and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty.</b> During his reign, the Principality of Rügen reached its greatest extent.|$|E

They may inspect such baggage. Since the amendments to CEMA 1979 inserted by the Policing and Crime Act 2009 Officers may also require a person entering or leaving the United Kingdom to produce a Passport (or National ID Card when that may be used as an alternative) and answer questions about their journey. Any person entering the UK from outside the EU who fails to declare any thing or to produce any baggage or thing as required (unless it they are entitled to <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty</b> and tax by virtue of any order under section 13 of the Customs and Excise Duties (General Reliefs) Act 1979) commits an offence.

40|$|Abstract Background Traditionally, {{studies on}} the {{etiology}} of low back pain {{have been carried out}} in adult populations. However, since low back pain often appears early in life, more research on young populations is needed. This study focuses on the importance of social background factors and previous low back pain in the development of low back pain in military recruits. Methods During a three-month period, Danish military recruits with different social backgrounds live and work under the same conditions. Thus, there is an opportunity to investigate the influence of social background on the development of low back pain, when persons are removed from their usual environment and submitted to a number of new stressors. In addition, the importance of the recruits' previous low back pain history in relation to low back pain during military service was studied. This was done by means of questionnaires to 1, 711 recruits before and after this three-month period. Results Sedentary occupation was negatively associated with long-lasting low back pain (> 30 days during the past year) at baseline with an odds ratios of 0. 55 (95 % CI: 0. 33 – 0. 90). This effect vanished during service. Having parents with higher education increased the risk of low back pain during service (OR: 1. 9; 1. 2 – 3. 0, for the highest educated group), but not of the consequences (leg pain and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty),</b> whereas high IQ decreased the risk of these consequences (odds ratios as low as 0. 2; 0. 1 – 0. 8 for <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty</b> in the group with highest IQ). Long-lasting low back pain prior to service increased the risk of long-lasting low back pain (OR: 4. 8; 2. 1 – 10. 8), leg pain (OR: 3. 3; 1. 3 – 8. 3) and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty</b> during service (OR: 5. 9; 2. 4 – 14. 8). Conclusion Sedentary occupation is negatively associated with low back pain at baseline. This protective effect disappears, when the person becomes physically active. For predicting trouble related to the low back during service, the duration of low back pain prior to service and IQ-level are the most important factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Malingering is the {{deliberate}} production of feigned symptoms {{by a person}} seeking external gain such as: financial compensation, <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty,</b> or leniency from the criminal justice system. The Test Translation and Adaptation Guidelines developed by the International Test Commission (ITC) specify that only tests which have been formally translated into another language and validated should be available for use in clinical practice. Thus, the current study evaluated {{the psychometric properties of}} a Spanish translation of the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS). Using a simulation design with 80 Spanish-speaking Hispanic American outpatients, the Spanish SIRS was produced reliable results with small standard errors of measurement (SEM). Regarding discriminant validity, very large effect sizes (mean Cohen's d = 2. 00) were observed between feigners and honest responders for the SIRS primary scales. Research limitations and directions for future research are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|For {{response}} styles, malingering {{describes the}} deliberate production of feigned symptoms by persons seeking external gain such as financial compensation, <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty,</b> or leniency from {{the criminal justice}} system. In contradistinction, defensiveness occurs when patients attempt to downplay their symptoms of psychological impairment. Both of the aforementioned response styles can markedly affect the accuracy of diagnosis, especially on self-reports, such as multiscale inventories. As an important oversight, no {{studies have been conducted}} to examine the effect of culturally specific response styles on profile validity and the classification of malingering among Hispanic American clinical populations. The current study investigated whether the Spanish Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) effectively distinguished between Spanish-speaking outpatient groups randomly assigned to honest, feigning, and defensive experimental conditions. In examining the results, PAI malingering indicators utilizing Rare Symptoms strategies (NIM and MAL) demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes. For defensiveness, Spanish PAI indicators also demonstrated moderate to very large effect sizes (M d = 1. 27; range from 0. 94 to 1. 68). Regarding psychometric properties, Spanish PAI validity scales, provide adequate to good data on reliability and discriminant validity. Clinical utility of the Spanish PAI increases as different cut scores are employed...|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{has often}} {{encouraged}} the Crown and Aboriginal parties to find negotiated solutions to their disputes. The complex social, political, economic and legal interests which {{are embedded in}} many sectors of the Canadian population are not best resolved {{in the context of}} legal proceedings. Courts should, however, do more than lament the lack of negotiations - they should make decisions that create incentives for high quality, effective dispute resolution processes. This article describes the framework for negotiation set out in R. v. Sparrow (on Aboriginal rights to fish), Delgamuukw v. British Columbia (on Aboriginal title to lands) and Marshall v. Canada (on treaty rights to fish). Those cases would provide incentives for the parties to negotiate. By contrast, in the case of Mitchell v. M. N. R. (<b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>duty</b> on border crossing), the two judgments of the Supreme Court turn on the interpretation of history and the incompatibility with Canadian sovereignty. While it is not inappropriate to take those factors into account, the Court sets those up as threshold issues that need to be resolved before the Court would consider how to balance Aboriginal rights with Crown infringements. Unfortunately, the approach used in Mitchell will provide disincentives to negotiate workable accommodations for contemporary problems...|$|E
