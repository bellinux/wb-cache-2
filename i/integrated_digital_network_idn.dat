40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the policies of}} the EC aiming towards a coordinated introduction of an <b>Integrated</b> Services <b>Digital</b> <b>Network</b> (ISDN) in all member countries by 1993. ISDN originally {{was supposed to be a}} new telecommunications network that eventually would replace the old telephone network. ISDN is " [...] . a network, in general evolving from a telephone <b>IDN</b> (<b>Integrated</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Network),</b> that provides end-to-end digital connectivity to support a wide range of services, including voice and non-voice services, to which users have access by a limited set of standard multipurpose user-network interfaces" (CCITT). In this paper I will argue that the ISDN activities of the EC are somewhat trapped between the attempt to liberalize the so far closed and fragmented European telecommunications markets on the one hand and the aim to build up a strong independent European telecommunications industry and a European wide telecommunications network on the other hand. ISDN therefore cannot fulfil the expectations of the Commission...|$|R

The results obtained bring out its poor reliability thus pointing to the convenience of proposing other systems. Therefore, as a solution, a new mutual synchronization system is suggested whose greater reliability is the consequence of better use of the information available in each control center...|$|R
50|$|Frame Relay {{originated}} as {{an extension}} of <b>integrated</b> services <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> (ISDN).

The suggested changeover to the ISDN <b>network</b> (<b>Integrated</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Network)</b> with a transmission rate of 64 kbit/s will get rid of slow page turning and be of great help to business communications.
