40|$|Crack front {{waves are}} {{localized}} waves that propagate along {{the leading edge}} of a crack. They are generated by the interaction of a crack with a localized material inhomogeneity. We show that front waves are nonlinear entities that transport energy, generate surface structure and lead to localized velocity fluctuations. Their existence <b>locally</b> <b>imparts</b> inertia, which is not incorporated in current theories of fracture, to initially "massless" cracks. This, coupled to crack instabilities, yields both inhomogeneity and scaling behavior within fracture surface structure. Comment: Embedded Latex file including 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Various cytokines {{have been}} {{evaluated}} as potential anticancer drugs; however, most cytokine trials have shown relatively low efficacy. Here, we found that treatments with IL- 12 and IL- 18 or with a mutant form of IL- 2 (the "superkine" called H 9) provided substantial therapeutic benefit for mice specifically bearing MHC class I-deficient tumors, but these treatments were ineffective for mice with matched MHC class I+ tumors. Cytokine efficacy {{was linked to the}} reversal of the anergic state of NK cells that specifically occurred in MHC class I-deficient tumors, but not MHC class I+ tumors. NK cell anergy was accompanied by impaired early signal transduction and was <b>locally</b> <b>imparted</b> by the presence of MHC class I-deficient tumor cells, even when such cells were a minor population in a tumor mixture. These results demonstrate that MHC class I-deficient tumor cells can escape from the immune response by functionally inactivating NK cells, and suggest cytokine-based immunotherapy as a potential strategy for MHC class I-deficient tumors. These results suggest that such cytokine therapies would be optimized by stratification of patients. Moreover, our results suggest that such treatments may be highly beneficial in the context of therapies to enhance NK cell functions in cancer patients...|$|R

In addition to the Penrose process through particle fission, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism by magnetic tension, and the magnetohydrodynamic Penrose process, we examine energy extraction from a black hole caused by magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere. The reconnection redistributes the angular momentum efficiently to yield the negative energy at infinity. We derive a condition for the process to operate in a simple situation, where the plasma is incompressible and the magnetic energy is converted completely to the plasma kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>locally.</b> Astrophysical situations of magnetic reconnection around the black holes are also discussed...|$|R

Afterwards, the critical buckling forces for the similar beams with discontinuities positioned at different locations are determined by means of the finite element method (FEM), in order to find a similarity between the critical force drop and the damage position. It was finally demonstrated that it is a correlation between these two features; in fact, the force decrease is proportional with the <b>energy</b> <b>locally</b> stored in the beam...|$|R

40|$|Summary. A {{survey of}} public and private forest sector {{stakeholders}} explored perceptions on items that should be included in a definition of woody biomass and prospects for different renewable energy platforms. The study also elicited opportunities and challenges of woody biomass to become a sustainable energy feedstock. Of all wood-to-energy platforms combustion was rated with the highest potential, followed by cellulosic ethanol, gasification and pyrolysis. The capacity to generate <b>energy</b> <b>locally</b> and to create additional work opportunities for harvesters and loggers were classified as prime opportunities. A major barrier to the use of wood as an energy feedstock is the costs of harvesting and transporting biomass material to an energy facility. Prospects for additional income to landholders were dim and could limit the supply of woody biomass...|$|R
5000|$|To date, micro-CHP systems achieve much {{of their}} savings, and thus {{attractiveness}} to consumers, by the value of electrical energy which is replaced by the autoproduced electricity. A [...] "generate-and-resell" [...] or net metering model supports this as home-generated power exceeding the instantaneous in-home needs is sold back to the electrical utility. This system is efficient because the energy used is distributed and used instantaneously over the electrical grid. The main losses are in the transmission from the source to the consumer which will typically be less than losses incurred by storing <b>energy</b> <b>locally</b> or generating power at less than the peak efficiency of the micro-CHP system. So, from a purely technical standpoint dynamic demand management and net-metering are very efficient.|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} {{recovery}} and recrystallisation, growth phenomena can be separated into continuous and discontinuous mechanisms. In the former the microstructure evolves from state A to B (in {{this case the}} grains get larger) in a uniform manner. In the latter, the changes occur heterogeneously and specific transformed and untransformed regions may be identified. Abnormal or discontinuous grain growth is characterised by a subset of grains growing at a high rate and {{at the expense of}} their neighbours and tends to result in a microstructure dominated by a few very large grains. In order for this to occur the subset of grains must possess some advantage over their competitors such as a high grain boundary <b>energy,</b> <b>locally</b> high grain boundary mobility, favourable texture or lower local second-phase particle density.|$|R
