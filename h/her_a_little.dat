5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E

25|$|HMS Charlotte was a mercantile {{schooner}} that Royal Navy hired or chartered in 1796 (or earlier), {{purchased in}} 1797 and commissioned in 1798. In her brief military {{career in the}} Caribbean she captured two small enemy privateers before she herself fell prey to a French privateer. The British recaptured <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more than a year}} later but then broke her up in 1799 rather than recommissioning her.|$|E

While Kanin was acting in Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, {{she came to the}} attention of Michael Kanin, who had just been hired as a writer in the B unit. Michael was trained as an artist and had turned to commercial art and painting scenery for burlesque houses to help support his parents during the Depression. They were introduced by a mutual friend, and Michael practically asked Kanin to marry him right then and there, but it took <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while to come around to the idea.|$|E
25|$|Although Colchen's {{high jump}} and {{basketball}} career coincided, it look <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer {{to reach the}} same heights in basketball. Playing as a centre, she made her international debut for the French basketball team in February 1946, appearing against Belgium. In her first major tournament appearance at the 1950 FIBA European Women's Basketball Championship she was France's leading points scorer in two of their group games and two games in the final group stage (amassing 25 against Italy) in their last game. The team finished fourth overall, with Colchen averaging 14.5 points per game. At 87 in total, she was the tournament's leader on points. She returned for the 1952 European Championship but played a smaller role, appearing in only two games, but still being the team's third-highest scorer. France finished seventh that year.|$|E
25|$|Bertha Jorkins was {{a student}} at Hogwarts {{at the same time as}} James Potter and company. She was known as nosy, with a good head for gossip. She became a Ministry of Magic {{employee}} after leaving Hogwarts. In the summer before the events of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, she was killed by Voldemort. Rowling later revealed that her death was used to turn Nagini, Voldemort's snake, into a Horcrux. Some months before her murder, she accidentally discovered that Barty Crouch Jr., who supposedly died in Azkaban prison, was still alive and being hidden by his father. Barty Crouch Sr silenced her with a powerful Memory Charm, which made <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> befuddled. Voldemort irreparably damaged her mentally and physically while breaking the Memory Charm, through which he gained information about the Triwizard Tournament and Crouch Jr.. During the duel between Harry and Voldemort in the graveyard at Little Hangleton, Bertha is one of the shadows that spills out from Voldemort's wand and helps Harry escape. She appears to be wiser after her death, and supports Harry during The Goblet of Fire so he can defeat Voldemort, her murderer.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{praised the}} episode saying, [...] "Body of Proof threw just enough curves {{to keep me}} guessing this week and provided enough personal interaction between our characters to {{make me want to}} tune in for more". She praised the interaction between Megan and Lacey calling their conversation [...] "cute", adding [...] "It's nice to watch Megan make extra time to spend with her daughter". She called the Alan's actions [...] "pathetic" [...] for trying to apologize to Martin for killing his wife saying, [...] "You've got to be kidding!". Orlando added that she did not [...] "see coming" [...] Martin's reaction to the apology; he shot Alan, stating [...] "I could understand the sentiment". She praised the interaction between Megan and Peter, highlighting their conversation over Peter's girlfriend. Orlando said that she could not understand Megan's facial expressions to Peter's girlfriend, whether it was one of jealousy or tease. She said, [...] "Megan was certainly giving Peter a lot of ribbing about his new girlfriend. Was Megan just having fun with him or did it bother <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little?</b> I couldn't quite tell". She finished in saying, [...] "A [...] "Hunting Party" [...] led to a tragic death and a merry go round of suspects on Body of Proof this week".|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time.|$|E
2500|$|Flyer was {{designed}} to be the fastest propeller-driven vessel in the Pacific Northwest, and was very fine-lined, that is, tall and narrow. [...] Captain Scott was so proud of his new ship that he rode on her as she was launched into the Willamette River. This proved to be a mistake. [...] Neither boilers nor engines had been installed in Flyer before launch, and without their weight deep in her hull to act as ballast, she simply flopped over in the water, and Captain Scott had to exit by climbing out a window. After that, another hull was built around her with the hope of making <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less top–heavy, but this was imperfectly sealed, so water sloshed around in between the hulls {{for the rest of the}} vessel's operational life. Surprisingly, this did not affect the Flyers speed, although she did acquire a permanent list to port, or at least the hint of a list. Once finally completed, the company sent Flyer to Puget Sound and brought Bailey Gatzert around to the Columbia River to run with the Telephone.|$|E

2500|$|Magnani {{worked with}} Tennessee Williams {{again for the}} 1960 film, The Fugitive Kind (originally titled, Orpheus Descending) {{directed}} by Sidney Lumet, in which she played Lady Torrance and starred with Marlon Brando. The original screenplay Orpheus Descending was another play inspired by Magnani, although she similarly did not feature in the Broadway play. In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date... She is simply a rare being who seems to have about <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lightning-shot cloud all her own.... In a crowded room she can sit perfectly motionless and silent and still you feel the atmospheric tension of her presence, its quiver and hum {{in the air like a}} live wire exposed, and a mood of Anna's is like the presence of royalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.
