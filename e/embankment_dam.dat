5|$|An <b>embankment</b> <b>dam</b> is {{a massive}} {{artificial}} water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E

25|$|A {{tailings}} dam is typically an earth-fill <b>embankment</b> <b>dam</b> used to store tailings, which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore. Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a {{tailings dam}} is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout {{the life of the}} particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it fills with a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings (depending on their size) along with dirt.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of exterior deformation {{is one of}} the most important measuring items for safety management of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams.</b> By using targets installed on the crest and slopes of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams,</b> their exterior deformation has been measured by conventional surveying methods. According to the Japanese dam safety management standard, the measurement frequency of exterior deformation of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams</b> is set as once a week at the period of the first filling of reservoir, that is, the first term of dam management, and once every three months in the third term that is the final management stage when behavior of the dam and its foundation come to be stable. But, because the surveying work is relatively time consuming one, rapidly responding after a large earthquake or in other emergencies is a big challenge. The global positioning system (GPS) is a system that can perform surveys quickly in relatively low cost. GPS is a weather-proof positioning system using satellites that is well known for its role in car navigation and in surveying applications. The results of our previous research made it clear that we should investigate how to install GPS sensors on the crest in order to fully introduce GPS sensors as the method of measuring exterior deformation of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams.</b> In this research, we develop the backfill type GPS sensors, and make the verification test for them...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{performance}} evaluation of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams</b> {{are applied to}} confirm that the earthquake-induced settlement of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams</b> crest is enough small, because the overflow from the crest could cause catastrophic failure of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams.</b> Now in Japan, trial of “Guidelines for Seismic Performance Evaluation of Dams during Large Earthquakes (Draft) ” has been conducted. According to the guidelines, earthquake-induced settlement of dam crest should be basically evaluated by the method combining dynamic analysis and Newmark’s method. This method uses the dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method, and next calculates the deformation as an amount of displacement of the slip circle due to earthquake response. But other deformation evaluation method for <b>embankment</b> <b>dams</b> has been recently developed based on cumulative damage theory. The deformation evaluation method based on cumulative damage theory also uses the dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method, and calculates the deformation as a residual strain by cyclic loading due to earthquake response. In this paper, we first describe dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method for a rockfill dam with a central earth core, and then evaluate the settlement obtained from cumulative damage theory. The results of our research make it clear that the settlement of model dam crest ranges from about 36 cm to 160 cm based on cumulative damage theory due to an earthquake motion with a maximum acceleration of more than 700 gal. The observed settlement of the crest of existing <b>embankment</b> <b>dams</b> due to earthquakes are compared to the calculated values based on the cumulative damage theory, and we confirm that relationship between observed values of existing dams and calculated values of model dam has a good coincidence and that cumulative damage theory is available to evaluate the settlement of dam crest due to a large earthquake...|$|R

40|$|Internal erosion {{occurs when}} {{fine-grained}} particles {{are allowed to}} erode in a material {{by the action of}} seepage, and {{it is one of the}} major causes for the failure of <b>embankment</b> <b>dams.</b> <b>Embankment</b> <b>dams</b> are normally composed of zones, each with a purpose: the imperviousness of the core, the erosion-control and structure-stability provided by the filter and the support fill, respectively. A poorly functioning zone will adversely affect the performance of a dam, and the filter, if inadequate, is thus unable to protect against internal erosion of the core. Two existing <b>embankment</b> <b>dams</b> are studied herein, both are located in Sweden and with cores composed of glacial till against granular filter, but with different performance records; one has suffered a sinkhole-event due to internal erosion, the other has operated without signs of distress.
