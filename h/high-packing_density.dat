30|$|Ar[*]=[*] 70  Pa, the {{interactions}} between Au NPs are added. Note that the surface morphology of 3 D nanostructures {{is characterized by the}} presence of Au NP aggregates, <b>high-packing</b> <b>density</b> of Au NPs, variety of incident angles, and wide distributions of size, shape, and interparticle distance. Their low-frequency modes of surface plasmons are split into two branches {{with a wide range of}} relaxation times. In addition, an important feature of low-frequency branches of samples 2, 2 ′, and 1 ′ is a negative group velocity in the ratio of dω(k)/dk.|$|E
30|$|Rare-earth (RE)-doped {{phosphors}} have a {{broad range}} of applications in cathode ray tubes (CRTs), plasma display panels (PDPs), field emission displays (FEDs), X-ray detectors, fluorescent lamps and so on [1 – 3]. In recent years, RE-doped nanophosphors have received a great deal of research attention due to the unique applications in higher-resolution displays, drug delivery system and biological fluorescence labeling [4 – 8]. Furthermore, fluorescent lamps made from small-sized phosphors always have <b>high-packing</b> <b>density</b> and low loading [9]. RE-doped nanophosphors are expected to have high brightness and luminescence quantum yield for practical applications. Unfortunately, high specific surface area and surface defects of the nanophosphors always result in serious surface recombination, which is a pathway for nonradiative relaxation [10]. Consequently, RE-doped nanophosphors have lower luminescence efficiency compared to their corresponding bulk powder phosphors [11, 12]. More attention should be paid to improve the luminescence efficiency of RE-doped nanophosphors.|$|E
30|$|Great {{positive}} {{effect of the}} coupled parameters (w/b and HRWRA) in increasing the slump flow was observed with the ESH–LWSCC mixtures. For example, when both parameters (w/b and HRWRA) were maximized at 1.2  % and 0.40, the maximum predicted slump flow for ESH mixtures was 850  mm. This {{can be attributed to}} the aggregate shape/gradation and packing density because a lower amount of fluidity is needed to achieve high workability for <b>high-packing</b> <b>density</b> mixture, as in the case of ESH aggregates. According to Assaad and Khayat (2006), the w/b is closely related to flowability of concrete and an increase in w/b improves the flowability of the concrete. Sonebi et al. (2007) state that the SCC fresh properties are significantly influenced by the dosage of water and HRWRA. It is expected that LWSCC mixtures will exhibit similar behaviour compared with normal weight SCC mixtures under the influence of HRWRA.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{photometric}} and polarimetric observations carried {{out for some}} bright atmosphere-less bodies of the Solar system near the zero phase angle reveal the simultaneous existence of two spectacular optical phenomena, the so-called brightness and polarization opposition effects. In a number of studies, these phenomena were explained by the influence of coherent backscattering. However, in general, the interference concept of coherent backscattering can be used only in the case where the particles are in the far-field zones of each other, i. e., when the scattering medium is rather rarefied. Because of this, {{it is important to}} prove rigorously and to demonstrate that the coherent backscattering effect may also exist in densely packed scattering media like regolith surface layers of celestial bodies. From the results of the computer modeling performed with the use of numerically exact solutions of the macroscopic Maxwell equations for discrete random media with different packing densities of particles, we studied the origin and evolution of all the opposition phenomena predicted by the coherent backscattering theory for low-packing-density media. It has been shown that the predictions of this theory remain valid for rather <b>high-packing</b> <b>densities</b> of particles that are typical, in particular, of regolith surfaces of the Solar system bodies. The results allow us to conclude that both opposition effects observed simultaneously in some high-albedo atmosphereless bodies of the Solar system are caused precisely by coherent backscattering of solar light in the regolith layers composed of microscopic particles...|$|R
40|$|Light-matter {{interaction}} at the nanoscale in {{magnetic materials}} {{is a topic}} of intense research in view of potential applications in next-generation high-density magnetic recording. Laser-assisted switching provides a pathway for overcoming the material constraints of high-anisotropy and <b>high-packing</b> <b>density</b> media, though much about {{the dynamics of the}} switching process remains unexplored. We use ultrafast small-angle x-ray scattering at an x-ray free-electron laser to probe the magnetic switching dynamics of FePt nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix following excitation by an optical femtosecond laser pulse. We observe that the combination of laser excitation and applied static magnetic field, one order of magnitude smaller than the coercive field, can overcome the magnetic anisotropy barrier between "up" and "down" magnetization, enabling magnetization switching. This magnetic switching is found to be inhomogeneous throughout the material, with some individual FePt nanoparticles neither switching nor demagnetizing. The origin of this behavior is identified as the near-field modification of the incident laser radiation around FePt nanoparticles. The fraction of not-switching nanoparticles is influenced by the heat flow between FePt and a heat-sink layer...|$|E
30|$|Another {{strategy}} for low voltage OFETs is improving the charge transport in organic semiconductors. Charge transport {{occurs in the}} few monolayers near the interface between the organic semiconductor/dielectric and {{is limited by the}} thermally activated hopping process between the molecules in the disordered regions [11, 12]. To improve the device performance, the disordered region of the semiconductor should be suppressed, and additional interface treatments are required for optimal charge transport. For example, the molecular parameters of organic semiconductors were modified by controlling their regioregularity, molecular weight, side chain length, doping level and end-group. Interface engineering has been introduced to improve the molecular ordering, orientation, assembly, packing and film morphology of organic semiconductors [13]. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are good candidates for effective surface treatment due to their <b>high-packing</b> <b>density,</b> being only a few nm thick and allowing interface control with end-functional groups [14]. Among various SAMs with different binding groups, such as carboxyl groups, thiols and silanes, phosphonic acid self-assembled monolayers (PA-SAMs) have attracted attention due to readily assembling on activated metal oxides because their reaction is not limited by the contents of surface hydroxyl groups and supplies their own hydroxyl moieties [15]. They also have the advantages of stability and prevention of homocondensation between phosphonic acid molecules compared with other binding groups, resulting in the highly ordered, dense and robust monolayers of phosphonic acid molecules on metal oxide surfaces.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} studies, {{electrostatic}} layer-by-layer (LbL) adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes {{has proven to}} be a promising method for the preparation of polyelectrolyte multilayer membranes (PEMMs). Till now, this method was mainly used to assemble flat sheet and tubular membranes. Since hollow fiber membrane has some advantages such as <b>high-packing</b> <b>density,</b> self-contained mechanical support and hence the consequent economical superiority, this study therefore seeked to assemble inner skin hollow fiber PEMMs by using a dynamic LbL adsorption technique. The assembly process was successfully accomplished by alternatively dynamically filtrating polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) on a hydrolyzed hollow fiber polyacrylonitrile(PAN) membrane under a negative pressure condition. In the case of pervaporation separation of 95 wt. % ethanol-water mixture (50 C), the membrane obtained with only 4. 5 and 6. 5 bilayers had separation factor of 245 and 1338 while the permeate fluxes were 290 and 120 g/(m(2) h), respectively. The pervaporation separation behavior of various alcohol/water mixtures with the alcohols being t-butanol, 2 -propanol and ethanol were also investigated. Finally, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy clearly confirms a uniform and defect-free layer formed on the inner surface of hollow fiber support. Since different polyelectrolyte pairs could be used to assemble PEMMs for different uses, it was expected that the dynamic negative pressure LbL adsorption technique could also potentially be used to prepare many types of PEMMs in other fields.
