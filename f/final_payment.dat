5|$|The Qing Emperor's {{undercover}} emissary Jack Knife {{arrives in}} the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them.

The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the <b>final</b> <b>payment</b> needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.|$|E
5|$|When Richard I, King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his {{rebellion}} against {{his father and}} invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the Third Crusade, but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between William Longchamp, the justiciar whom Richard had left {{in charge of the}} kingdom, and Prince John, Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the <b>final</b> <b>payment</b> of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.|$|E

40|$|An Efficiency Analysis of Minnesota Counties: A Data Envelopment Analysis Using 1993 IMPLAN Input-output Data Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a multi-input, multi-output {{optimization}} model {{used to measure}} relative efficiency or the best practice counties.

The IMPLAN data contains estimates of four forms of <b>final</b> <b>payments.</b> Transfer payments are added as inputs but are taken from a separate source. IMPLAN also includes four forms of final demand as outputs. These inputs and outputs form a production frontier of "best practice" counties.

Large quantities of undelivered goods were in Britain or in transit when Lend-Lease terminated on 2 September 1945. Britain wished to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. In 1946, the post-war Anglo-American loan further indebted Britain to the U.S. Lend-Lease items retained were sold to Britain at 10% of nominal value, giving an initial loan value of £1.075 billion for the Lend-Lease portion of the post-war loans.

40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the magnitude of expected income shocks will impact consumption smoothing, because individuals only adjust consumption intertemporally if future income shocks are large enough. We examine how the magnitudes of <b>final</b> mortgage <b>payments</b> (which increase disposable income) impact credit card consumption and debt. Our confidential bank account data allows us to identify the exact date and magnitude of the <b>final</b> mortgage <b>payment,</b> and also to exploit the random timing of <b>final</b> mortgage <b>payments</b> across individuals. As predicted, we find recipients of smaller expected income shocks increase consumption, but recipients of larger expected income shocks reduce debt...|$|R

Procedure of calculation of corporate income tax payments is different as for most taxes, therefore it requires adjustments also to modelling approaches, which are traditionally used for tax revenues forecasting.

Advance payments depend on previous tax payments adjusted for inflation, but <b>final</b> <b>payments</b> depend on profit. For econometric equations other factors are considered as well.

By 1845, the spectre of railway competition was looming large, and the proposals for the Trent and Mersey Company to merge with a railway company were causing concern. It was discussed at the 1845 general meeting, as it seemed likely that such a move would be detrimental to the Macclesfield Canal.

From this vast swath of territory were created three provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta) and two territories (Yukon Territory and North-West Territories, now Yukon and Northwest Territories), and two extensions each to Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba.
