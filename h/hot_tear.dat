40|$|International audienceAluminum alloy 7050 {{is known}} for its {{superior}} mechanical properties, and thus finds its application in aerospace industry. Vertical direct-chill (DC) casting process is typically employed for producing such an alloy. Despite its advantages, AA 7050 is considered as a "hard-to-cast" alloy because of its propensity to cold cracking. This type of cracks occurs catastrophically and is difficult to predict. Previous research suggested that such a crack could be initiated by undeveloped hot tears (microscopic <b>hot</b> <b>tear)</b> formed during the DC casting process if they reach a certain critical size. However, validation of such a hypothesis has not been done yet. Therefore, a method to produce a <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> with a controlled size is needed as part of the verification studies. In the current study, we demonstrate a method that has a potential to control the size of the created <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> in a small-scale solidification process. We found that by changing two variables, cooling rate and displacement compensation rate, the size of the <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> during solidification can be modified in a controlled way. An X-ray microtomography characterization technique is utilized to quantify the created <b>hot</b> <b>tear.</b> We suggest that feeding and strain rate during DC casting are more important compared with the exerted force on the sample for the formation of a <b>hot</b> <b>tear.</b> In addition, we show that there are four different domains of hot-tear development in the explored experimental window-compression, microscopic <b>hot</b> <b>tear,</b> macroscopic <b>hot</b> <b>tear,</b> and failure.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility of ternary Al-Si-Mg alloys has been made using direct crack observation, measurement of load response, and predictions made by a modified Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud (RDG) hot tearing model. A peak in both the <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility and the load at solidus occurred at approximately 0. 2 Si and 0. 15 Mg, and then the <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility decreased as the total solute content increased. In general, a good correlation was found among the observation of cracks, the load at solidus, and the predictions of the RDG hot tearing model, although it was shown that correlation with the RDG model depended critically on the fraction solid at which solid coalescence was assumed to occur. A combination of these approaches indicated that when the total Si+Mg content and the Si:Mg ratio increased toward four, a decrease occurred in the <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility because {{of an increase in}} the amount of final eutectic formed. At the lowest Si:Mg ratio of 0. 25, the RDG model also predicted a lower relative <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility than that measured by the load at solidus. In these alloys, the final stages of solidification are predicted to occur over a large temperature range, and hence, both the predictions of the RDG model and the measurement of the load were dependent on which fraction solid was chosen for grain coalescence. In the alloys studied in this article, the formation of small amounts of the ternary eutectic Al+Mg 2 Si+Si caused the highest <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility. ...|$|E
40|$|Hot tearing {{continues}} to be a major problem in both Direct Chill (DC) and shape casting of aluminium alloys. It can limit productivity and influence the viability of casting some alloy compositions. While the underlying cause of hot tearing is understood i. e. the inability of liquid to feed imposed strain on the mushy material (two-phase region where developing solid and liquid coexist), work continues on improving the understanding of the mechanisms at play. There have been numerous <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> experiments developed using different configurations and various levels of complexity. There have also been many models developed to predict hot tearing. Some are empirical in nature or based upon the solidification characteristics of a given alloy while others are more detailed and take into consideration parameters such as solidification shrinkage, thermal contraction and permeability. The objective of this thesis was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> process and to determine the fundamental mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. <b>Hot</b> <b>tear</b> experiments were conducted using the CAST <b>Hot</b> <b>Tear</b> experimental rig at the University of Queensland on a range of Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys. <b>Hot</b> <b>tear</b> severity was quantified and compared with published work. Data from the experiments was also used to validate some established models. The experimental rig was also modified to allow visual observation of <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> initiation and propagation. Hot tensile testing was also carried out on selected Al-Cu alloys to assess the suitability of using the reheating method to study hot tearing. However, comparison of results with <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> testing was difficult as the slow reheating rate in the hot tensile tests allowed solid-state diffusion to occur. With <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> testing of both Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys, it was found that as the solute content increased, tensile coherency (fraction solid at which load development began) occurred at lower fraction solids. In the Al-Cu alloys, it was found that the type of tearing varied with solute content. At low solute levels there was generally a single large primary tear in both grain refined and non-grain refined alloys. As the solute level increased, the large primary tear gradually diminished and was replaced by smaller secondary tears distributed over a wider area. In the grain refined alloys, the smaller secondary tears transitioned into distributed porosity as the solute content increased further. <b>Hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility results from the Al-Cu alloys correlated well with other published studies, particularly with data from an experimental rig with a similar configuration (where feeding is provided to the central hot spot). The results also correlated well with established <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> models. In the Al-Zn alloys, <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility results did not correlate with previous studies. This variation was attributed to differences in the design of the experimental rig. The CAST <b>Hot</b> <b>Tear</b> rig provides liquid feeding to the central hot spot while the experimental rigs used in previous studies did not. However, susceptibility results correlated well with hot tearing models that were based on permeability of the mushy material. Visual observation of hot tearing showed that intergranular tears first appeared at very low loads in the centre of the cast bar and later linked with interdendritic tears through a sidewall grain. With a given test geometry and cooling conditions, it is argued that hot tearing susceptibility is determined by the tensile coherency point and the permeability of the mushy material at that point. Therefore, it is proposed that there are two mechanisms that can lead to hot tearing. The first occurs when feeding becomes insufficient due to low permeability before tensile coherency occurs. This leaves a void between opposing solidification fronts and is characterised by the presence of just one primary tear. Alternatively, the classic tear mechanism occurs when feeding becomes insufficient after tensile coherency. The extent and localisation of tearing is dependant upon how early tensile coherency occurs and how long afterwards feeding becomes insufficient. In addition, a <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility map has been developed to visually represent the combined influence of tensile coherency and permeability on hot tearing susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>hot</b> <b>tears</b> during DC casting is complicated {{because of the}} complex cooling conditions and subsequent development of thermal stresses.

The grain size of the semi-solid cast Al-Cu samples appears to be finer than those cast in liquid state with high superheat temperatures. In addition, the metal slurries had sufficient fluidity to fill the molds even with low gravity pressures. The results suggest that semi-solid gravity casting is a feasible process to help reduce <b>hot</b> <b>tearing...</b>|$|R
