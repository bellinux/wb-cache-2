25|$|Time {{independent}} {{solutions to}} field equations do not emit radiation, because a time independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking {{set out to}} show that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that they do, and <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy {{of a black hole}} is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E
500|$|A {{resurgence}} of lesbian visibility and sexual fluidity was noted in 2009 with celebrities such as Cynthia Nixon and Lindsay Lohan commenting openly on {{their relationships with}} women, and reality television addressing same-sex relationships. Psychiatrists and feminist philosophers write that the rise in women acknowledging same-sex relationships is due to growing social acceptance, but also concede that [...] "only {{a certain kind of}} lesbian—slim and elegant or butch <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> androgynous way—is acceptable to mainstream culture".|$|E
500|$|The Kiev Museum of Wax Figures {{included}} a Sharon Stone wax figure. It is {{modeled after the}} scene in Basic Instinct in which she uncrosses her legs and exposes her genitalia during a police interrogation. Yevhen and Oleksy Sazhyn, {{the father and son}} running the museum, reported that the design process for the figure took eight months. They found sculptures based on women were more difficult to plan than those on men. For the creation of the Sharon Stone figure, they said: [...] "capturing her legs <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> position was tricky business".|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{positive}} feedback tends {{to lead to}} instability via exponential growth, oscillation or chaotic behavior, negative feedback generally promotes stability. Negative feedback tends to promote a settling to equilibrium, and reduces the effects of perturbations. Negative feedback loops <b>in</b> which <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> amount of correction is applied with optimum timing can be very stable, accurate, and responsive.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{possible}} for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way, the block will move closer {{to the source of}} the gliders. If three gliders are shot <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way, the block will move farther away. This [...] "sliding block memory" [...] can be used to simulate a counter. It {{is possible}} to construct logic gates such as AND, OR and NOT using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a finite state machine connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a universal Turing machine, so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints: it is Turing complete.|$|E

Flamenco has everything {{that it takes to}} {{follow in the footsteps of}} jazz and become a language to people of all countries and all cultures. We forget that before being a universal language, jazz was only the mode of expression of blacks in New Orleans! Like jazz, flamenco is based on improvisation and dialogue between instrumentalists.

Now, placing one's house <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place is a very {{important}} matter. Some people are dreadfully careless about this. Jimmy Skunk, for instance, often makes the mistake of digging his house (you know Jimmy makes his house underground) right where everyone who happens along that way will see it. Perhaps that is because Jimmy is so independent that he doesn't care who knows where he lives.|$|E

60|$|A {{great many}} people already know Mr. Hagedorn through his verse. Faces in the Dawn will, however, be their {{introduction}} {{to him as a}} novelist. The same qualities that have served to raise his poetry above the common level help to distinguish this story of a German village. The theme of the book is the transformation that was wrought in the lives of an irritable, domineering German pastor and his wife through the influence of a young German girl and her American lover. Sentiment, humor and a human feeling, all present <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> measure, warm the heart and contribute to the enjoyment which the reader derives in following the experiences of the well drawn characters.|$|E
