5|$|The Daily Express ran {{the story}} on 1 October 1994. They {{reported}} that charred £50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning <b>had</b> <b>really</b> taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul <b>had</b> <b>really</b> seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E

5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent {{the beginning of the}} year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother <b>had</b> <b>really</b> been a nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{completely}} oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, {{and was therefore}} surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private. Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne – {{with the intention of}} informing her of the event. It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what <b>had</b> <b>really</b> happened. After questioning servants and Royal Household for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present and had given Abigail a dowry of £2000 from the Privy Purse. This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and <b>had</b> <b>really</b> just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E

After a considerable period of debate over whether to restore the old building or tear it down, restoration work began {{in the summer of}} 1989 and Old Main was renovated extensively. The renovation proceeded ahead of schedule, and it was finished during the spring semester of 1991 at a cost of $10 million. It was rededicated during the Fall of 1991.|$|E

The cryonics movement had been launched in 1962 by Robert Ettinger's book, The Prospect of Immortality. In the 1960s, Saul Kent had been a co-founder of the Cryonics Society of New York. Alcor gained national prominence when baseball star Ted Williams was cryonically preserved by Alcor in 2002 and a family dispute arose as to whether Williams <b>had</b> <b>really</b> wanted to be cryopreserved.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opinion}} of the author of his {{biography}} in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, next to the Diary Evelyn's most valuable work is Sylva. Evelyn believed that the country was being rapidly depleted of wood by industries such as glass factories and iron furnaces, while no attempt was being made to replace the damage by planting. Evelyn put in a plea for afforestation, and besides producing a valuable work on arboriculture, he was able to assert in his preface to the king that he <b>had</b> <b>really</b> induced landowners to plant many millions of trees.|$|E

25|$|Waqar {{explained}} {{his ability to}} reverse swing by the manipulation of an old ball; with one side shiny, one side rough, the ball would move {{in the opposite direction}} to conventional swing. This led to Waqar having the ability to bowl inswingers and outswingers in the cricket pitch and in effect both Waqar and Akram became successful in taking wickets by this variation of swing bowling. His fastest timed delivery in cricket was 153km/h or 95.1mph, a delivery he bowled against South Africa in 1993 but this was after he had suffered serious back injuries which <b>had</b> <b>really</b> reduced his bowling speeds. He was also effective in the use of bouncers or short pitch deliveries; Waqar's bowling against South Africa in Sheikhupura in Pakistan, is remembered for his effective use of the short pitched delivery.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 Edward Teller {{contributed to}} a Hoover Institution {{publication}} where he claimed that the US would be facing an emboldened USSR due to their work on civil defense. Two years later {{at a conference in}} Italy, he made the same claims about their ambitions, but with a subtle change; now he claimed that the reason for their boldness was their development of new space-based weapons. According to the popular opinion at the time, and one shared by author Frances FitzGerald; there was absolutely no evidence that such research was being carried out. What <b>had</b> <b>really</b> changed was that Teller was now selling his latest nuclear weapon, the X-ray laser. Finding limited success in his efforts to get funding for the project, his speech in Italy was a new attempt to create a missile gap.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 an {{election}} promise by Viktor Yanukovych (leader of the Party of Regions) to adopt Russian {{as the second}} official language might also have increased the turnout of his base, but it was rebutted during the campaign by his opponent (Viktor Yushchenko), who pointed out that Yanukovych could have already taken steps towards this change {{while he was a}} Prime Minister of Ukraine if this <b>had</b> <b>really</b> been his priority. During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities. Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.|$|E
