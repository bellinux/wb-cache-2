Dvorak shared his recollection about murmurs that were exchanged when the bamboo pole was introduced. With respect to the use of fiberglass poles, he stated that he [...] "doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> the hollering is about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Birkin said in 2004 that, [...] "It wasn't a rude song at all. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> {{the fuss}} was about. The English just didn't {{understand}} it. I'm {{still not sure}} they know what it means." [...] When Gainsbourg went to Jamaica to record with Sly and Robbie, they initially did not get on well. They said [...] "We know just one piece of French music, a song called Je t'aime… Moi Non Plus, which has a girl groaning in it." [...] Gainsbourg said [...] "It's me", and their mood changed immediately.|$|E
2500|$|John Shelby Spong once accused Williams {{of being}} a [...] "neo-medievalist", preaching orthodoxy {{to the people in}} the pew but knowing in private that it is not true. In an {{interview}} with Third Way Magazine Williams responded: [...] "I am genuinely a lot more conservative than he would like me to be. Take the Resurrection. I think he has said that of course I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> the reputable scholars think on the subject and therefore when I talk about the risen body I must mean something other than the empty tomb. But I don't. I don't know how to persuade him, but I really don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh! she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> that meant! that Percy {{would not}} {{hesitate}} one single instant to throw his {{life into the}} hands of his enemies, in exchange for that of others.

6000|$|... "That ain't my fault! Some folks can go gadding {{around in}} automobuls, and some folks {{has to stay}} at home. If you think I'm going to sit up all night cooking for people that come chassayin' in here God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> {{hours of the day}} and night----! There's an all-night lunch down the street." ...|$|R

2500|$|La Bretagnes {{career was}} not marked entirely by misfortune. On her August 1902 crossing, {{a group of}} about 30 first-cabin {{passengers}} formed a vegetarian society, which they called [...] "La Société des Legumineux", that gave the steward fits because they ignored the chef's signature meat dishes of roast beef and Philadelphia chicken. The same voyage carried eight Franciscan nuns—reportedly the last of the expelled order to leave France—on their way to Canada. In September 1905, The New York Times heralded the arrival on La Bretagne of 30 dressmakers and milliners with the latest fall fashions from Paris. Over 200 trunks of women's clothing arrived on the liner, and were inspected by married customs inspectors because, according {{to the head of the}} inspectors, [...] "a married man is the only person in the world would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> that stuff was".|$|E
60|$|I said a {{few words}} in answer--I hardly <b>know</b> <b>what.</b> <b>All</b> my {{attention}} was concentrated on the white gleam of Miss Fairlie's muslin dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "No noise, please, if ye'll be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my licends, and be summons'd, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all!</b> 'Night t'ye!" ...|$|E
60|$|Jack. My {{brother is}} in the dining-room? I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it <b>all</b> means. I think it is {{perfectly}} absurd.|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. Yes, you have. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you <b>all</b> {{think of}} me. Dont imagine I'm sore about it. I forgive you.|$|R
60|$|HARNESS. As {{business}} men, I wonder you're {{not ashamed}} of this waste of force, gentlemen. You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it'll <b>all</b> end in.|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} Captain Manly had come bustling up and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> the {{disturbance}} meant. Whereupon our hero cried out, {{still in the}} extremity of passion: ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he struck}} me {{lightly on the}} chest for emphasis. Disregarding his peculiarities of manner, I wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this {{had to do with}} the man being an anarchist.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{something}} very serious, though I don't <b>know</b> <b>what.</b> <b>All</b> I know is what I heard a man call out bynow--that it very much concerns somebody {{who lives in the}} parish.' ...|$|E

6000|$|No. But {{they are}} {{probably}} true. He was a feeble brat from the [...] first. I believe they had to baptize him {{on the day he}} was born. [...] What can one expect after such presumption--calling him the New [...] Messiah, and God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>all.</b> Ours is the only country which [...] did not write fulsome poems about him. [...] "Wise English!" [...] the Tsar [...] Alexander said drily when he heard it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am dying," [...] {{answered}} the other quite calmly. [...] "I {{am in the}} quite literal sense of the words dying to know something. I want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this can possibly mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this means,' exclaimed Ida, {{in great}} agitation; 'nor {{what you and}} Rose are at! Making up such horrible, abominable insinuations against me, your poor sister! But Rose Rollstone always hated me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, sir," [...] {{said the}} man, leaning down {{his head as}} low as {{possible}} from his elevated seat, and speaking in a hushed voice, [...] "you are a real gentleman. Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this is?" ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{thinking}} of him. She was deeply gratified to think he had entered the great movement, {{and that she had}} been instrumental in converting him. Her heart warmed to him strangely for his honesty and his sincerity; and then he was so fine and earnest and strong-limbed! The pressure of his arm at her side moved her, and she smiled at herself. Unlike Bradley, she was self-analytical; she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> these things meant.|$|R
6000|$|A {{stranger}} {{would not}} have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> it <b>all</b> meant, and yet {{there was something in}} what he said that made his wife turn white. But she answered quietly: ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{gazed at}} me with surprise. 'What?' he exclaimed, at last. 'And you kin cycle like that! Not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> the cycling world is mad about! Why, you don't {{mean to tell me}} you're not a pro-fessional?' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{upshot of}} my perplexities was that I {{set off to}} Mycening to lay them before Miss Woolmer, another of the few {{belonging}} to neither clan, to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this meant, {{as well as to}} be interested in my nephews.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can {{you talk}} about shame, papa?" [...] and she stopped while the waiter creaked in with the paper, and then slowly creaked out again; [...] "how {{can you talk}} about shame? you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> your friends think about this question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>knew,</b> sir, <b>what</b> <b>all</b> {{the world}} <b>knows,</b> that Constantine would {{be rid of}} his uncles, whom he fears, though they are maimed. No more, I swear it, no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' {{returned}} Lucilla, {{her lips}} trembling with bitter irony. 'Now I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you <b>all</b> are made of. We are obliged for your offered exertion, {{but we are}} not inclined to become traitors.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they <b>all</b> are saying," [...] cried Betty, {{trying to}} hear the {{different}} voices; for {{there were so many}} going at once it was difficult to understand the sweet new language.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is cruel, and infamous," [...] he protested, {{conscious}} innocence {{within him}} still striving {{to fight a}} hard battle against overwhelming odds. [...] "Gentlemen! ... as I am a man of honor, I swear that I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this means!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Matter!' she repeated, chafing {{her hands}} and elbows, nervously, and looking {{anywhere}} but at him. 'That's good in you, Britain, that is!

6000|$|... "Heaven knows, beloved of my life," [...] said he, [...] "that my praise {{is not a}} lover's praise, but the truth.

50|$|The next morning, the Holmes {{brothers}} visit Amyus who {{concludes that}} the conspirators will have taken flight and will be heading to America, so he needs to follow them.

6000|$|No one in {{all those}} myriads cheered like the man from prison. The tears poured down his face, and he only stopped cheering at last because the thing had choked him.

(But for all that he did not even pretend to himself that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> this emotion was about.) Hooray! O God!--Hoo-ray! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A most amazin' young bird,' {{said the}} sergeant. 'He turns up {{in charge of}} a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his father's Lodge {{certificates}} round his neck, talkin' God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>all</b> of a red bull. The buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, an' the bhoy sets cross-legged on the Chaplain's bed prophesyin' bloody war to the men at large. Injia's a wild land for a God-fearin' man.
