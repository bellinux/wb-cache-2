30|$|The {{tracking}} procedure identifies {{a set of}} <b>key</b> <b>points</b> (as natural visual features) {{from each}} frame of the video sequence. The estimation of the camera parameters (location and orientation) keeps track of all the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> during time.

30|$|<b>Key</b> <b>points</b> include location, scale, and orientation. To {{maintain}} invariance of {{view angle}} and illumination, the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> {{need to be}} described {{by a set of}} vectors.

30|$|At first, the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> is {{characterized}} by position, scale, and direction. To maintain the invariance of perspective and illumination changes, the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> should be described {{by a set of}} vectors.

Besides, the independent characteristic of descriptor is guaranteed to improve the probability of correct matching of feature points.|$|R
30|$|The SIFT {{algorithm}} used [43] makes a scale-space {{transformation and}} calculates {{the difference of}} Gaussian (DoG) for the images at different scales. Local extremes are calculated by comparing the DoG sampling points to eight neighboring points in the same scale and nine neighboring points in higher and lower scales. The DoG <b>point</b> is a <b>key</b> <b>point</b> if its value is the highest or lowest in the neighborhood. Other points are excluded. Next, <b>key</b> <b>points</b> with low contrast or along an edge are excluded. Orientation histograms with 36 bins are calculated for the remaining <b>key</b> <b>points.</b> The orientation histogram is based on gradient orientations calculated from the surroundings of a <b>key</b> <b>point</b> after Gaussian filtering. The highest peak of the orientation histogram describes the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> orientation. If the histogram includes peaks with heights that are at least 80 % of the highest peak, they are marked as the new <b>key</b> <b>points</b> for that direction. Finally, the key-point descriptors are defined. A key-point descriptor includes the orientation histograms from the neighborhood of the <b>key</b> <b>point.</b> In our implementation, the descriptors have four orientation histograms with eight bins that describe the cell values for the feature vectors.|$|R
40|$|Facial {{animation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important contents in 3 D CG animations. By the development of scanning and tracking methods of a facial motion, a face model which consists of more than 100, 000 points can be used for the animations. To edit the facial animations, <b>key</b> <b>point</b> based approaches such as "face rigging" are still useful ways. Even if a facial tracking method gives us all point-to-point correspondences, a detection method of a suitable set of <b>key</b> <b>points</b> is needed for content creators. Then, we propose a method to detect the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> which efficiently represent motions of a face. We optimize the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> for a Radial Basis Function (RBF) based 3 D deformation technique. The RBF based deformation is a common technique to represent a movement of 3 D objects in CG animations. Since the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> based approaches usually deform objects by interpolating movements of the <b>key</b> <b>points,</b> these approaches cause errors between the deformed shapes and the original ones. To minimize the errors, we propose a method which automatically inserts additional <b>key</b> <b>points</b> by detecting the area where the error is larger than the surrounding area. Finally, by utilizing the suitable set of <b>key</b> <b>points,</b> the proposed method creates a motion of a face which are transferred form another motion of a face...|$|R

30|$|After the excavations, the {{direction}} of the main deformation of the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> is inside the surrounding rock to the excavating surface, and the deformation of the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> on the vault is mainly vertical, and is horizontal when the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> was on the sidewall. The displacement of the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> of the downstream side wall of the main powerhouse is larger than that of the upstream side wall at the same altitude in unit # 4. The maximum displacement of the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> of the downstream side wall of the main plant of the unit # 4 is the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> # 5 whose horizontal displacement is 35.97  mm after eight-step excavation. The vertical displacement of the vault of the main power house after one-step excavation is 7.54  mm, and that reaches 11.70  mm after eight-step excavation. The variation of displacement of the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> of transformer chamber is similar to the main power house. The vertical displacement of the vault of the main power house is 6.62  mm after the one-step of excavation and increases to 11.77  mm. The horizontal displacement of the upstream sidewall of transformer chamber is 21.80  mm after the eight-step excavation, which is larger than that of the downstream sidewall.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by retinex theory, {{we propose}} a novel method for {{selecting}} <b>key</b> <b>points</b> from a depth map of a 3 D freeform shape; we also use these <b>key</b> <b>points</b> {{as a basis}} for shape registration. To find <b>key</b> <b>points,</b> first, depths are transformed using the Hotelling method and normalized to reduce their dependence on a particular viewpoint. Adaptive smoothing is then applied using weights which decrease with spatial gradient and local inhomogeneity; this preserves local features such as edges and corners while ensuring smoothed depths are not reduced. <b>Key</b> <b>points</b> are those with locally maximal depths, faithfully capturing shape. We show how such <b>key</b> <b>points</b> can be used in an efficient registration process, using two state-of-the-art iterative closest point variants. A comparative study with leading alternatives, using real range images, shows that our approach provides informative, expressive, and repeatable points leading to the most accurate registration results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|We {{focus on}} the problem of {{large-scale}} near duplicate image retrieval. Recent studies have shown that local image features, often referred to as <b>key</b> <b>points,</b> are effective for near duplicate image retrieval. The most popular approach for <b>key</b> <b>point</b> based image matching is the clustering-based bagof-words model. It maps each <b>key</b> <b>point</b> to a visual word in a code-book that is constructed by a clustering algorithm, and represents each image by a histogram of visual words. Despite its success, there are two main shortcomings of the clustering-based bag-of-words model: (i) it is computationally expensive to cluster millions of <b>key</b> <b>points</b> into thousands of visual words; (ii) there is no theoretical analysis on the performance of the bag-of-words model. We propose a new scheme for <b>key</b> <b>point</b> quantization that addresses these shortcomings. Instead of clustering, the proposed scheme quantizes each <b>key</b> <b>point</b> into a binary vector using a collection of randomly generated hyper-spheres, and a bag-ofwords model is constructed based on such randomized quantization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the resulting image similarity provides an upper bound for the similarity based on the optimal partial matching between two sets of <b>key</b> <b>points.</b> Empirical study on a database of 100, 000 images shows that the proposed scheme is not only more efficient but also more effective than the clustering-based approach for near duplicate image retrieval. 1...|$|R

This paper makes an attempt to analyze the local feature structure of iris texture information based on the relative distance of <b>key</b> <b>points.</b> When preprocessed, the annular iris is normalized into a rectangular block. Multi-channel 2 -D Gabor filters are used to capture the iris texture. In every filtered sub-image, we extract the points that can represent the local texture most effectively in each channel. The barycenter of these points in each channel is called the <b>key</b> <b>point</b> and a group of <b>key</b> <b>points</b> are obtained. Then, the distance between the center of <b>key</b> <b>points</b> of each sub-image and every <b>key</b> <b>point</b> is called relative distance, which is regarded as the iris feature vector. Iris feature matching is based on the Euclidean distance. Experimental results on public and private databases show that the performance of the proposed method is encouraging.

30|$|For Dataset-A, {{to limit}} the impact of {{inaccurate}} skeleton/pose estimation on the proposed method, we used manually marked <b>key</b> <b>points</b> in our tests.

This is also a possible reason of the performance drop on Dataset-B, comparing to Dataset-A. Although there are many toolboxes that can be exploited, such as [34, 35], {{the study of the}} impact of inaccurate skeleton/pose estimation on activity classification {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper.|$|R

30|$|Feature {{transform}} (SIFT) is {{a popular}} method in object recognition [13, 14]. They extract the features of an image using the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> that are invariant to scale change. To detect such <b>key</b> <b>points,</b> they search the stable features across all possible scales using a scale space and such <b>key</b> <b>points</b> are associated with location, scale, and orientation information. To define the local image features, they sample the local image intensities around the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> at the appropriate scale of the <b>key</b> <b>point.</b> Bicego et al. used SIFT features for authentication in [15], wherein they used the distance between all pairs of keypoint descriptors in the two images to define the matching score. For face authentication, this type of algorithm was not as successful {{as it was in}} other object recognition problems using SIFT-like features. Unfortunately, the planarity assumption underlying the theory of SIFT features and the highly non-planar and self-occluding nature of faces result in weak performance on face recognition tasks. In [16], SIFT features are combined in a mixed local-global strategy supporting a recognition-from-parts approach to address occlusion.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an efficient method for learning and reproduction of complex trajectories for robot programming by demonstration. Encoding of the demonstrated trajectories is performed with hidden Markov model, and generation of a generalized trajectory is achieved by using the concept of <b>key</b> <b>points.</b> Identification of the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> is based on significant changes in position and velocity in the demonstrated trajectories. The resulting sequences of trajectory <b>key</b> <b>points</b> are temporally aligned using the multidimensional dynamic time warping algorithm, and a generalized trajectory is obtained by smoothing spline interpolation of the clustered <b>key</b> <b>points.</b> The principal advantage of our proposed approach is utilization of the trajectory <b>key</b> <b>points</b> from all demonstrations for generation of a generalized trajectory. In addition, variability of the key points' clusters across the demonstrated set is employed for assigning weighting coefficients, resulting in a generalization procedure which accounts for the relevance of reproduction of different parts of the trajectories. The approach is verified experimentally for trajectories with two different levels of complexity. 9 2012 IEEE. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
