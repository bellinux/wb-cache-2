5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were <b>durable</b> <b>goods.</b> Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E

40|$|We study {{consumption}} of <b>durable</b> and nondurable <b>goods</b> when the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> {{is subject to}} transaction costs. In the model, agents derive utility from a service flow of a <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> and a consumption flow of a nondurable good. The key feature of the model is {{the existence of a}} fixed transaction cost in the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> market. The fixed cost induces an inaction region in the purchase of the <b>durable</b> <b>good.</b> More importantly, the inability to adjust the durable stock induces variation in {{consumption of}} the nondurable good over the inaction region. The variation {{is a function of the}} degree of complementarity between <b>durable</b> and nondurable <b>goods</b> in the period utility function, the rate of intertemporal substitution, and a precautionary motive induced by incomplete markets. We test the model using the PSID.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{hyperbolic}} discounting on competitive equilibria in secondary markets for a <b>durable</b> <b>good.</b> Under exponential discounting, secondary markets are irrelevant in our model. They do not affect the price in the initial period and are neutral to the allocation. Under hyperbolic discounting, secondary markets are not neutral: they do affect price and allocation. The price in the unique competitive Markov equilibrium {{is lower than the}} price in the absence of secondary markets. This affects the equilibrium supply of the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> in the initial period. We characterise all stationary competitive equilibria in terms of prices. In particular, we obtain that there are stationary competitive equilibria in which trade occurs in each period and the allocation of the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> is inefficient.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the stability}} of cartels of firms that sell a <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> and an associated maintenance service within a repeated game framework that features overlapping generations of consumers. We show that the most profitable collusive price settings correspond with the continuum of monopoly pricing strategies, within which a higher price in the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> market is exchanged for lower price in the maintenance service market and vice versa. In our main result, we show that the strategy of colluding only in the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> market at monopoly prices is easier to sustain than any other. Moreover, these price settings maximise the cartel 2 ̆ 7 s profits. We also present two extensions. In the first, we show that if the firms are able to exert monopoly control over their maintenance markets, then the potential for collusion is enhanced. In the second, we show that if the firms sell the maintenance service bundled with the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> {{in the form of}} a warranty contract, the potential for collusion is diminished...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Krugman {{repeatedly}} criticized the Bush tax cuts, {{both before and}} after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening income distribution in the US. Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other <b>durable</b> <b>goods),</b> and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit.

As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production. By May 1938 retail sales began to increase, employment improved, and industrial production turned up after June 1938. After the recovery from the Recession of 1937–38, conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and, when unemployment dropped to 2% in the early 1940s, they abolished WPA, CCC and the PWA relief programs.

On several occasions, the Brazilian ISI process, which {{occurred}} from 1930 {{until the end}} of the 1980s, involved currency devaluation as a means of boosting exports and discouraging imports (thus promoting the consumption of locally manufactured products), as well as the adoption of different exchange rates for importing capital goods and for importing consumer goods. Moreover, government policies toward investment were not always opposed to foreign capital: the Brazilian industrialization process was based on a tripod which involved governmental, private, and foreign capital, the first being directed to infrastructure and heavy industry, the second to manufacturing consumer goods, and the third, to the production of <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> (such as automobiles).

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} non-separable preferences over durable and nondurable consumption for asset pricing tests when adjusting durable consumption is costly. In an economy without adjustment costs, in which a frictionless rental market exists for the <b>durable</b> <b>good,</b> the standard Euler equation with respect to nondurable consumption will hold for each individual agent {{as well as for}} aggregate data. If the adjustment of the <b>durable</b> <b>good</b> is costly, however, aggregation generally fails. We use aggregate data to find substantial deviations from the frictionless model, consistent with the presence of non-convex adjustment costs for the <b>durable</b> <b>good.</b> We also show how empirical asset pricing tests that use aggregate data can be affected by these deviations. We then propose and implement asset pricing tests that are robust to the presence of adjustment costs by relying on microeconomic data.

This can increase the branded firm's profit by encouraging consumer purchase without delay, despite the revenue loss to the counterfeiter. Total welfare can also increase, because early purchase eliminates delay cost and consumers enjoy the good for both periods. ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{beginning}} of the diamond industry, all of South Africa was experiencing depressed economic conditions. Ostrich-farming was in its infancy, and agriculture had only been lightly developed. The Boers, except those in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town, lived in impoverished conditions. They only traded marginally with the Colony for <b>durable</b> <b>goods.</b> Even the British colonists were far from wealthy. The diamond industry was therefore considerably attractive, especially to colonists of British origin. It was also a means to demonstrate that South Africa, which appeared to be barren and poor on the surface, was rich below the ground. It takes ten acres (40,000m²) of Karoo to feed a sheep, but it was now possible that a few square metres of diamantiferous blue ground would be able to feed a dozen families. By the end of 1871, a large population had already gathered on the diamond fields, and immigration increased dramatically, which brought in many newcomers. Among the first to seek a fortune on the diamond fields was Cecil Rhodes.|$|E
