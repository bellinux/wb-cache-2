40|$|ABSTRACT: Gum Dammar is {{a natural}} {{resinous}} material of plant Shorea javanica, family–Dipterocarpaceae. In the present investigation Dammar gum (DG) and alcohol soluble fraction of Dammar gum (DA) are evaluated for their physicochemical, mechanical and film forming characteristics. Films were produced by casting/solvent evaporation method from plasticizer free and plasticizer containing solutions. Films prepared from different formulations were studied for their mechanical (tensile strength, percent elongation and Young’s modulus), water vapor transmission and moisture absorption characteristics. Unplasticized DG, DA films were brittle and posed the problem of breaking during handling.

40|$|Bitter vetch protein films {{containing}} {{positively charged}} spermidine, {{alone or with}} low amounts of glycerol, showed high tensile strength that progressively decreased by increasing the plasticizer concentration. Accordingly, lower <b>film</b> <b>elongation</b> at break and higher Young’s module values were detected {{in the presence of}} the polyamine without or with small amounts of glycerol. These data suggest that spermidine not only acts as a plasticizer itself by ionically interacting with proteins, but that it also facilitates glycerol-dependent reduction of the intermolecular forces along the protein chains, consequently improving the film flexibility and extensibility. Thus, spermidine may be considered not only as a primary, but also as a secondary plasticizer because of its ability to enhance glycerol plasticizing performance. Such double behavior of the polyamine was confirmed by the film permeability tests, since spermidine increased the barrier properties to gases and water vapor, while glycerol emphasized this effect at low concentrations but led to its marked reversal at high concentrations. Film microscopic images also substantiated these findings, showing more compact, cohesive, and homogeneous matrices in all spermidine-containing films...|$|E

40|$|Several {{groups have}} {{reported}} spontaneous formation of periodic pillar-like arrays in molten polymer nanofilms confined within closely spaced substrates maintained at different temperatures. These formations {{have been attributed}} to a radiation pressure instability caused by acoustic phonons. In this work, we demonstrate how variations in the thermocapillary stress along the nanofilm interface can produce significant periodic protrusions in any viscous film no matter how small the initial transverse thermal gradient. The linear stability analysis of the interface evolution equation explores an extreme limit of Bénard-Marangoni flow peculiar to films of nanoscale dimensions in which hydrostatic forces are altogether absent and deformation amplitudes are small in comparison to the pillar spacing. Finite element simulations of the full nonlinear equation are also used to examine the array pitch and growth rates beyond the linear regime. Inspection of the Lyapunov free energy as a function of time confirms that in contrast to typical cellular instabilities in macroscopically thick <b>films,</b> pillar-like <b>elongations</b> are energetically preferred in nanofilms.

The hydrolysates newly obtained were supplemented with glycerol and directly used as film-forming solutions for development of the corresponding films (FH 0, FH 1 and FH 2). Viscoelastic properties of the film-forming solutions showed improved gel-like behaviour when the κ/ι-hybrid carrageenan extraction at 90 °C was promoted. FTIR analysis revealed that FH 2 had the highest relative proportion of κ-carrageenan.

Very slight differences in water solubility and water vapour permeability were found among the three types of film, but FH 0 had the highest tensile strength and Young's modulus responses, whereas <b>film</b> <b>elongation</b> tended to increase with progressive carrageenan extraction in FH 1 and FH 2.

Preliminary research demonstrated that edible coatings could effectively extend the shelf life of based avocado and peach. The respiration rate, moisture loss, firmness, chemical parameters and color changed in a lower rate in coated fruits as compared with the control. Pectin-based film formulations were then evaluated to identify the proper type and concentration of pectin, lipids and plasticizers in the film. The effects of pectin, beeswax and sorbitol concentration on water vapor permeability, mechanical properties and opacity of the films were then evaluated using response surface methodology to identify appropriate levels of different components. Results of studies on film structure revealed that water vapor permeability increased by pectin and sorbitol concentration and was decreased by beeswax concentration. Mechanical properties were mainly affected by pectin and sorbitol concentration. Beeswax was the most influential factor that affected opacity which increased with increasing beeswax concentration. In order to successfully employ these films, their adsorption behavior, thermal and thermomechanical properties were evaluated as a function of moisture content and sorbitol concentration. The adsorption behavior was strongly influenced by sorbitol concentration. Moisture content and sorbitol concentration increased the <b>films</b> <b>elongation</b> at break, but decreased tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and Tg, and increased water vapor permeability of the films. Finally, avocado was coated with a pectin-based film and the associated quality changes were evaluated during storage. From storage studies, kinetic parameters (rate constants) and activation energy were quantified to help model the quality changes in avocado quality as function of storage temperature and time. Pectin-based coating resulted in slowing down the rate of quality changes in avocado at each storage temperature. In general, most changes were well described by some form of zero or first order rate. Temperature sensitivity of rate constant was adequately described by the Arrhenius model. A hyperspectral imaging technique was also used to gather additional tools for following quality changes associated with stored avocados. Artificial neural network (ANN) concepts were evaluated as alternated models for predicting quality changes in coated and non-coated avocados during storage at different temperature. Modeling of quality changes in avocado indicated that compared to conventional mathematical models, ANN has more feasibility to predict of these changes. Models developed for firmness, weight loss and total color difference had better fitness than respiration rate. Finally, the effect of coating on disease severity and different properties of avocados infected by Lasiodiplodia theobromae was studied. The coated fruits demonstrated slower rate of disease progress, respiration rate, softening and color changes. Respiration rate, firmness and color parameters were sensitive to coating and disease severity, and thus these parameters could successfully used to predict fruit quality from disease in coated and uncoated avocados...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{solubility}} (PS) {{values of}} different soy protein isolate (SPI) films were determined in water, 0. 01 N HCl, 0. 01 N NaOH, 4 M urea, and 0. 2 M 2 -mercaptoethanol. Tensile and color (L, a, and b values) properties of films also were determined. Control films were cast from heated (70 degrees C for 20 min), alkaline (pH 10) aqueous solutions of SPI (5 g/ 100 mL of water) and glycerin (50 % w/w of SPI). Additional films were cast after incorporation of dialdehyde starch (DAS) at 10 % w/w of SPI or {{small amounts of}} formaldehyde in the film-forming solutions. Also, control film samples were subjected to heat curing (90 degrees C for 24 h), UV radiation (51. 8 J/m(2)), or adsorption of formaldehyde vapors. PS of control films was highest (P < 0. 05) in 2 -mercaptoethanol, confirming the importance of disulfide bonds in SPI film formation. All treatments were effective in reducing (P < 0. 05) film PS in all solvents. Both DAS and adsorbed formaldehyde rendered the protein in films practically insoluble in all solvents. Adsorption of formaldehyde vapors and heat curing also substantially increased (P < 0. 05) film tensile strength from 8. 2 to 15. 8 or 14. 7 MPa, respectively. However, heat curing decreased (P < 0. 05) <b>film</b> <b>elongation</b> at break from 30 to 6 %. Most treatments had small but significant (P < 0. 05) effects on b color values, with DAS-containing films having the greatest (P < 0. 05) mean b value (most yellowish). Also, DAS-containing, heat-cured, and UV-irradiated films were darker, as evidenced by their lower (P < 0. 05) L values, than control films. It was demonstrated that PS of SPI films can be notably modified through chemical or physical treatments prior to or after casting...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBetacyanins used {{as natural}} red color (NRC) {{are known as}} antioxidants. The present paper was focused on their effect on {{physicochemical}} properties of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) films. All the films were evaluated for their photo-aging stability on optical, mechanical, barrier, thermal and structural properties. Both, tensile strength and Young's modules of NRC composite <b>films</b> decreased, while <b>elongation</b> significantly increased compared to control films. Dynamic vapor sorption data fitted by Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model showed lower values of sorption energy for NRC composite films. NRC films showed an initial decrease in oxygen permeability that was more decreased after 20 days of photo-aging. Inversely, {{a significant increase in}} water vapor permeability of films by increasing NRC was observed. The films composed of 4 % NRC (v/v) showed the highest WVP and lowest oxygen permeability. HPMC films transparency decreased with NRC contents...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{regenerated}} cellulose (RC) biocomposite films were prepared using casting method where oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) were dissolved in N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (DMAc/LiCl) solution. The increasing of OPEFB contents up to 2 wt% increased the tensile strength and {{modulus of elasticity}} of RC biocomposite <b>films</b> while the <b>elongation</b> at break decreased. However, at 3 and 4 wt% of OPEFB content, the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity decreased with increases OPEFB content, but elongation at break increased. The increment of tensile strength and modulus of elasticity at 2 wt% {{is due to the}} OPEFB fiber that partially dissolved and dispersed with the OPEFB matrix. The morphology studies illustrate that at 2 wt% of OPEFB content of biocomposite films surface consists less voids and agglomerations than at 4 wt%. This can be considered the RC filler was partially dispersed with the RC matrix in the biocomposite films...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{adipic acid}} (AA) {{was used as}} a {{crosslinking}} agent to improve the properties of kapok husk (KH) filled soy protein isolate (SPI) biocomposite films. The effects of AA content on tensile properties and morphology of SPI/KH biocomposite films were investigated. The increasing of AA content from 0 % to 1. 0 % has increased the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of biocomposite <b>films,</b> whereas the <b>elongation</b> at break decreased. Incorporation of 1. 0 % of AA showed the highest tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of crosslinked biocomposite films. In addition, at 1. 5 % of AA the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity decreased but elongation at break increased. Thus, at higher AA content it performs plasticity effect to the SPI/KH biocomposite films. The morphology study indicates the crosslinking with AA improved the interfacial interaction between KH filler and SPI matrix...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this present}} work is to {{investigate}} the effect of plasticizers like Sorbitol on microstructural and mechanical properties of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) blend films. The pure blend and plasticized blend films were prepared by solution casting method and investigated using wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) method. WAXS analysis confirms that the plasticizers can enter into macromolecular blend structure and destroy the crystallinity of the films. FTIR spectra show {{that there are a}} shift and decrease in the intensity of the peaks confirming the interaction of plasticizer with the blend. Mechanical properties like tensile strength and Young’s Modulus decrease up to 0. 6 % of Sorbitol content in the <b>films.</b> Percentage of <b>elongation</b> at break increases suggesting that the plasticized films are more flexible than pure blend films. These films are suitable to be used as environmental friendly and biodegradable packaging films...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{composite}} films were prepared using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and xylan as degradable raw materials under the addition of glycerol and ammonium zirconium carbonate (AZC). The influences of AZC on the mechanical properties, water-resisting properties, thermal stability, solubility (S), and water vapor permeability of PVA/xylan composite films were comparatively discussed. The results showed that AZC had {{a positive impact on}} improving the water resistance and mechanical properties of composite <b>films</b> especially for <b>elongation</b> at break (EAB). With increasing the AZC amounts from 0 % to 15 %, EAB increased rapidly from 18. 5 % to 218. 0 %, and the S values decrease from 11. 64 % to 8. 64 %. When the AZC amount reached 15 %, the tensile strength still performed well (22. 10 [*]MPa). The great compatibility of components in composite films was also observed. Moreover, the addition of AZC had great influences on the thermal stability of composite films and the degradation in soil...|$|R
