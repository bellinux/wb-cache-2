On the other hand, the cutting velocity v increases with spindle turning speed n, which can in turn increase the shear strain rate γ̇ of shear zone (Eq. (16)). According to the quasi-solid–liquid transition constitutive equation of sand mould cutting (Eq. (23)), the stress in the shear zone will increase the cutting forces.

This paper studies the machining stability in milling of thin-walled plates and develops a three-dimensional stability lobe diagram of the spindle speed, tool position, and axial depth of cut. The workpiece-holder system is modeled as a 2 -degree-of-freedom system considering that the tool system is much more rigid than the thin-walled plate, and dynamic equations of motion described for the workpiece-holder system are solved numerically in time domain to compute the dynamic displacements of the thin-walled plate. Statistical variances of the dynamic displacements are then employed as a chatter detection criterion to acquire the stability lobe diagram.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. There is {{a growing}} global demand for titanium. The {{aircraft}} industry {{is the driving force}} behind the demand for titanium. The reason for this is that titanium has attractive properties that justify its use both economically and environmentally. Titanium alloys have superior strength-to-weight ratios. This implies that by substituting components manufactured from other metals in the aircraft with titanium components, a substantial reduction in structural weight can be achieved. From an economical point of view a lower mass implies lower fuel consumption. From an environmental point of view lower fuel consumption implies less harmful greenhouse emissions. Ti 6 Al 4 V components are the most widely used titanium alloy products in aircraft components. Ti 6 Al 4 V is known as a difficult-to-machine material. This is due to its low thermal conductivity and small contact area between the tool and the chips causing higher temperatures to be generated closer to the cutting edge of the insert. This will subsequently increase the rate at which the cutting tool wears. For this reason relatively low cutting speeds and feed rates are employed for the machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V compared to the machining of steels. Ti 6 Al 4 V is an exceptionally high cost material. The low cutting speeds and feed rates used in Ti 6 Al 4 V machining raises the machining cost of parts and contributes to an increase in the price of Ti 6 Al 4 V parts. By employing higher cutting speeds and feed rates machining times on Ti 6 Al 4 V products could be decreased, subsequently lowering the price for Ti 6 Al 4 V components. An increase in cutting speeds and feed rates will subsequently cause an increase in generated cutting temperatures, resulting in an increase in tool wear. This stresses the importance of controlling the cutting temperature during machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V in order to prolong tool life. The focus of this work was to investigate different lubrication strategies for polycrystalline diamond (PCD) and tungsten carbide inserts for Ti 6 Al 4 V milling operations in the quest to develop improved feasible cutting parameters. The results of this study showed that flood lubrication should be utilized for PCD inserts, while a “softer” 60 bar high pressure through spindle lubrication worked best for the tungsten carbide inserts. By utilizing these lubrication strategies, cutting speeds of 100 m/min and <b>feeds</b> <b>per</b> <b>tooth</b> of 0. 05 mm/rev for both the PCD and tungsten carbide grades could be attained with satisfactory tool life...|$|R

Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the <b>feed</b> rate <b>per</b> <b>tooth</b> on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling.
