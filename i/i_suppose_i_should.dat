500|$|After {{the final}} whistle Plymouth Argyle's captain Michael Heathcote {{received}} the winners' trophy before parading {{it in front}} of the club's supporters on the pitch. For the club's manager, Neil Warnock, it was his fourth play-off success at Wembley Stadium. He commented on his past experiences that [...] "It can't be a hindrance, having done it before, but it doesn't make it any less tense. It makes it a very long season. I had booked a holiday starting today - <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have known better".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{let him get}} in there. That was my {{resolute}} purpose. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have knocked}} him off his horse with my whip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't disappointed," [...] {{the sturdy}} little doctress replied. [...] "If any {{question}} had been opened, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have had to}} stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going away}} to Germany," [...] {{he went on}} to her silence. [...] "But I shan't be giving so much {{attention}} to Germany as <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> when <b>I</b> planned it out. But somehow--if I felt--that I'd kissed you...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{it is not}} monstrous, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> let Gemmell press my {{hand under}} the {{conviction}} that, after all, I am a trump." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; it isn't that! But I am very unhappy--yes, very, very unhappy! Oh, <b>I</b> didn't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{ever feel}} so toward any one. I hate her!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} known how to take a jest from a woman. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have laughed this off. Instead, I made a fool of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, my dear. If the Secretary of State were to {{say that}} I was his wife, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have to take it}} as a fact.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She could wait, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ask her, and no mistake. If {{one is to}} love a girl, it's no {{good one}} {{going on in that}} way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boy {{and girl}} nonsense," [...] said Mr. Barrett, sharply. [...] "Why, it’s fifteen years ago. <b>I</b> don’t <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> know her if I saw her. Is her mother alive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The marks {{were some}} twenty {{yards from the}} body and no one gave them a thought. <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have done so had I not known this legend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; {{but there}} was such an uproar--what with the church bells, {{everyone}} shouting, and the women screaming--that <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have heard it unless it had been quite close." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be {{too old to}} get in at the bottom. It seems a {{long way}} off for a man who is the owner of Bragton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came to the}} Hall to find Miss Fentolin," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{heard the}} click of your typewriter. I came to you, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say, on impulse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{certainly}} wouldn't have fought; {{but what}} I {{should have done}} would, I suppose, have depended upon circumstances. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have jumped overboard if I had the chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you know}} it, I know,' {{retorted}} Fanny. 'Well, my precious child! If {{he is not}} to be trusted by himself, it follows, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go with him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why it is mine, I suppose," [...] said Phonny. [...] "Though if Stuyvesant had not {{advised me}} to bring the hatchet in, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have cut myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, no, <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> if it hadn't {{been that}} I {{expected}} to make her useful. She goes as my daughter, and she looks on me as {{an old friend of}} her father's.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm rather {{glad you}} take it like that," [...] Letitia remarked. [...] "Now I {{come to think of}} it, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have had to say 'yes' {{sometime}} or another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You couldn't {{feed the}} Nilghai under twice the money--not though {{you gave him}} Army beef. Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have found it out sooner or later. What is there to laugh at?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were an Indian <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{thank you}} for the compliment, Anthony, but as it is I don't know. But how well you are looking, how well and by comparison--fat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{should have}} liked to see you dressed up like a pedlar, with your face all painted, and a wig and whiskers,” the girl said, “though <b>I</b> don’t <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have {{recognized}} you in that disguise to-day.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> see {{anything}} horrid or even disagreeable. I {{know it is}} all very beautiful; but then every person who goes for the innocent pleasures' sake only helps {{to keep up the}} whole thing--evil and all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I did {{not come}} and see you here, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never see you," [...] said he, seating himself. [...] "I do not often go to parties, and when I do you {{are not likely to}} be there." ...|$|R
60|$|SCHUTZMACHER. Oh, in my {{case the}} secret was simple enough, though <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have got into trouble if it had {{attracted}} any notice. And I'm afraid you'll think it rather infra dig.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] added Mrs. Holt, [...] "no {{one need}} listen who doesn't wish to. Since you were {{good enough to}} reconsider your {{decision}} and attend divine service, Howard, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{just look}} at them all come out to see me!" [...] she said. [...] "But there, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have done the same. How do you do, Mrs. Mathews? How are you, Mrs. Harrison?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I'd be a {{blooming}} bounder as a wild man," [...] laughed Clayton, ruefully. [...] "Those noises {{at night}} make {{the hair on}} my head bristle. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be ashamed to admit it, but it's the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] cried Cornelia, [...] "it's {{very kind}} of you, and no one's to blame but me. <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> care; only"--she bit her lips hard, and added deep in her throat--"I hated to have my mother---- But I am {{rightfully}} punished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--yes, I {{am afraid}} so. You see it's a public subject {{on a public}} matter, and I don't see that father and son have {{anything}} to do with it. If I were in the Assembly, <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be bound to support my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a farmer's son, I believe, {{and he was}} an {{interested}} party, {{though not}} the chief actor of the story. The chief actor, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say actress, was Martha Bennett. You know her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. I {{certainly}} won't {{leave you}} {{so long as you}} are in mourning. It would be most unfriendly. If I were in mourning you would stay with me, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> think it very unkind if you didn't.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know, Skinner; <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have done}} as other people did. If {{one does not}} know the comfort of a wash and a clean shirt, one would not miss it, you see. I have {{sometimes}} thought--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell, {{entering}} {{with his}} hat on, and his overcoat on his arm; [...] "Oh no, you haven't, you poor, suffering creature! That was a heavenly dream! Why, good gracious, man, you're not dressed!" [...] Campbell is himself in perfectly appointed evening-dress, and he stares in dismay at the travelling-suit which Roberts still wears. [...] "You can't {{go in that}} figure, you know. You might to Mrs. Curwen's, but you'd give Mrs. Miller deadly offence; she'd think the Curwen had put you up to it. Didn't Agnes tell you I'd be here at ten for you? What {{have you been doing}} with yourself? <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find you walking up and down here, fuming with impatience." ...|$|R
60|$|DOCTOR. [Smiling.] And so, oddly enough, did <b>I.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> we <b>should</b> both like to {{get hold}} of him by a {{separate}} ear.|$|R
60|$|The {{task was}} done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed a reward, and {{received}} at least five kisses; which, however, he generously returned. Then {{they came to the}} door, and from their conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.|$|R
