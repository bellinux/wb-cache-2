An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> the Labrador Current.|$|E

5|$|A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud <b>Drifting</b> <b>in</b> Silent Darkness, {{written by}} Takashi Yano and {{illustrated}} by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator.

It also explores his growing relationship with Temari, culminating in him struggling to name his child with her, {{years after the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs.

After <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK.

Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Beta produced heavy rains over northern Panama, amounting up to 3inches (76mm), which caused several mudslides {{as well as}} three fatalities. On October29, the storm passed over Providencia Island, caused significant damage to structures, and injured 30 people. In Honduras and Nicaragua, over 1,000 structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed. Ten people were initially feared dead after their boat went adrift during the storm. However, a Panamanian vessel rescued the men after <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> the water for several hours. Rains in Honduras totaled to 21.82in (554mm) and 6.39in (162mm) in Nicaragua. Six {{people were killed in}} Nicaragua {{as a result of the}} storm and the cost to repair damages exceeded 300million córdoba ($14.5million USD). Overall, Beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than $15.5million in damage across four countries.|$|E

It was initially feared that ten others, who were listed as missing, were killed when their vessel disappeared during the storm. But they were later rescued by a Panamanian vessel after <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> the waters for several hours. Throughout the country, a total of 376 latrines, 215 homes, two schools, two community children centres, two community water tanks and five solar panels were destroyed. An additional 852 homes, 21 schools, and three health centres were damaged. The cost to repair damages caused by the hurricane were estimated at $2.1million (2006USD).

A message from Hyperion communicates that the player is committing {{an act of}} treason and must remove their armament and surrender. Nevertheless, the player fights their way through Selene fighters and faces the Hyperion, the game's final boss. The ending sequence depicts the player's spacecraft damaged and <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> space. The pilot engages its thrusters and dives into an army of Selene spacecraft with the Moon in the background. An epilogue follows which states that {{the actions of the}} lone Einhänder pilot effectively ended the war by destroying the armies of both sides, leading to an eventual peace; however, the pilot's name and deeds were stricken from the records, and they are remembered only by veterans of the war. After the end credits, a lone Einhänder spacecraft is shown powering up.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E
5|$|The Ark, also {{referred}} to as Installation 00, is located outside the Milky Way galaxy and serves as the construction and control station for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During Halo 3, the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to the Ark and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked High Charity, crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the Arbiter. In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 04B under construction in The Ark, the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty Spark, a premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend 'his' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages The Ark as Master Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> space while the Arbiter returns to Earth successfully. The Ark appears in other Halo novels and the video game Halo Wars 2.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{have shown}} a simple {{approach}} to actively stabilize the microscope sample against <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> all three dimensions during super-resolution data acquisition. In our current implementation using bright-field imaging and a low cost CCD camera, we can reduce the <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> xy to about 10 nm and in z to about 20 nm over the duration of several minutes. The principal advantages of our method are its ease of implementation and wide applicability: {{we were able to}} measure <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> all three dimensions simultaneously without adding much complexity or cost to our microscope and with no special sample preparations.|$|R

When he looks through the fireplace, the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a time window, a device that allows direct access to another time and place. The Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette's bedroom {{only to find that}} months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. After it threatens him with a saw-like device that slides out of its arm, the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. While trying to find Rose and Mickey, the Doctor discovers a horse that stepped through a time window, who he later names Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV.|$|E
