5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{found as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{tightly and}} orderly packed {{in the process}} called DNA condensation, to fit the small {{available}} volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.|$|E
30|$|Total {{deoxyribonuclease}} (<b>DNA)</b> <b>was</b> purified from C. gariepinus tissues using EZNA, tissue DNA kit (OMEGA, USA). The purified <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{subjected to}} spectrometry using a Nanodrop 1000. The absorbance of extracted <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> read at A 280 nm.|$|R
30|$|Soil <b>DNA</b> {{extraction}} <b>was</b> {{based on}} the manufacturer’s protocol (FastDNA Spin kit, MP Biomedicals, USA). The total <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> purified using agarose gel electrophoresis. Pure <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> extracted using extraction kit (Roche). <b>DNA</b> quality <b>was</b> assessed with a ScanDrop 200 spectrophotometer.|$|R
30|$|Blood samples (3  mL) were {{collected}} in EDTA tubes and genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> isolated from whole blood samples using the whole blood DNA kit (Biotake corporation, Beijing, China). <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> extracted from 200  µL of the whole bloods according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> diluted to 10  ng/µL for working solutions and the isolated <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> stored at − 20  °C.|$|R
5|$|The {{complementary}} base to adenine in <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> thymine, {{whereas in}} RNA, it is uracil, {{which is an}} unmethylated form of thymine.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{transcription}} factor, {{a protein}} that binds to specific DNA sites and thereby regulates {{the activity of}} specific genes, Tbr1 is localized in the nucleus where the cell’s <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> located. Tbr1 is expressed in glutamergic neurons rather than GABAergic neurons.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{this body}} of {{research}} established the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA. This dogma has since {{been shown to have}} exceptions, such as reverse transcription in retroviruses. The modern study of genetics at the level of <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> known as molecular genetics.|$|E
30|$|The <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} from the liver and purified as described by the manual of DNA kits (Takara company), A 260 /A 280 (> 1.8) indicated that the <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently free of protein. The purified <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> resuspended in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.2).|$|R
30|$|Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} from each activated sludge sample using the PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocols. The extracted <b>DNA</b> samples <b>were</b> stored at − 20  °C for subsequent assays. The intact <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> confirmed on 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis.

5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide.|$|E
5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> a long polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it {{is composed of}} two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} first involves transcription, {{in which}} <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{used as a}} template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.|$|E
30|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> extracted, using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, China). The {{protocol}} was performed {{according to the}} manufacturer’s instructions. The {{quantity and quality of}} the extracted <b>DNA</b> <b>were</b> measured, using the UV-spectrophotometer (T 80 plus, PG Instruments Limited, England), and <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> visualized by electrophoresis (Cleaver, power PAC 300) in 1 % agarose gel in 1 X Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) buffer stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 [*]μg/ml) (Sambrook 2001). The <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> stored at −[*] 20 [*]°C for further PCR work.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{work was}} an {{optimization}} of separation deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{with the use}} of nucleic acid reversible adsorption to the surface of magnetic particles coated by functional groups. Six carriers <b>were</b> verificated for <b>DNA</b> isolation: P (HEMA-co-GMA) ox, F-kol B 30 ox, F-kol 77 ox, F-kol B 100 ox, F-kol 135 ox, coated with carboxyl groups and Perovskit 439 (coated by silicone). Bacterial <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> isolated by phenol extraction procedure, first. <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> reversibly bond to magnetis carrier in the presence of high concentration of NaCl (5 M) and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG 6000). The final PEG and NaCl concentrations of 16. 0 % (w/v) and 2. 0 M, respectively, <b>were</b> used. <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> eluted into TE buffer. The quality of extracted <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> checked by PCR amplification. It was found out that although different quantities of <b>DNA</b> <b>were</b> isolated, the quality of isolated <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> always compatible with PCR. Nanoparticles Perovskit 439 had the best separative characteristics in comparison to the other magnetic carriers because highest amounts of <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> isolated. However, next optimisation of <b>DNA</b> separation procedure <b>is</b> required for the use of studied microspheres in real samples...|$|R
40|$|Giant-cell <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{isolated}} from pea (Pisum sativum) inoculated with Meloidogyne incognita {{and used in}} slot blots to test for selective sequence amplification. Four sequences representing low (ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase and actin), mid-level (histone 3), and highly repetitive (large ribosomal repeat) sequence <b>DNA</b> <b>were</b> used as probes. Known amounts of root-tip DNA and giant-cell <b>DNA</b> <b>were</b> blotted onto hybridization membranes and probed. The signal strength on autoradiographs containing equal amounts of root-tip DNA and giant-cell <b>DNA</b> <b>were</b> compared with a scanning densitometer. No difference in signal strength between equal amounts of root-tip DNA and giant-cell <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> found. Thus, for the probes tested, {{there is no difference}} in copy number and, hence, no selective DNA sequence amplification has occurred...|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
5|$|Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, {{where it}} is {{determined}} {{that he has the}} alien virus in his blood. The Black-Haired Man (Scott Eberlein) kidnaps him soon after, and brings him to the power plant. They find the alien, who attacks the Black-Haired Man but not Gibson, as witnessed by Mulder from outside the locked door. Mulder and Scully are ordered to not associate with the X-Files and are reassigned under Assistant Director Kersh. Spender is visited by The Smoking Man in his office. Mulder continues to work on restoring the X-Files, and is told by Scully that Fowley's report does not reflect what really happened. Scully tells Mulder that the alien virus <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> also part of all human DNA, but in Gibson the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> active. In the power plant, Gibson is trapped inside with the alien, which sheds its skin, revealing the traditional grey alien form.|$|E
5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E
30|$|Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} from fresh leaf tissues of putative transgenic plants using the DNA extraction kit (Bioneer, Korea) and purified after the RNase treatment, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Purified <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> analyzed using 0.8 % {{agarose gel electrophoresis}} and quantified using the Nano-Drop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A). Only high-quality genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> used for PCR and Southern blot analysis.|$|R
50|$|Brown's <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{found on}} the gun. His <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> also {{found on the}} left thigh of Wilson's pants and on the inside driver's door handle of Wilson's police SUV, the result of Brown's spilled blood {{staining}} Wilson's pants and the door handle. Wilson's <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> found on Brown's left palm but was not found under Brown's fingernails or on his right hand.|$|R
50|$|Cells {{with the}} normal amount of <b>DNA</b> <b>are</b> called diploid. Cells {{with too much}} or too little <b>DNA</b> <b>are</b> called aneuploid. Aneuploid cells are more likely to spread than diploid cells.|$|R
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E
5|$|The {{other living}} female-line {{relative}} of Richard III is Wendy Duldig, an Australian resident in England and a 19th-generation descendant of Anne of York. Duldig, {{who has no}} surviving children, {{is connected to the}} Ibsen family through Anne's granddaughter Catherine Constable, neé Manners. Descendants of Constable, including one of Duldig's ancestors reportedly emigrated to New Zealand. Duldig's mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> reportedly a close match, i.e. it features one mutation.|$|E
30|$|Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} from buccal swab using a QIAamp DNA Minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Concentration of extracted <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> determined by fluorometric method (through Qubit by Invitrogen). On average, the <b>DNA</b> concentration registered <b>was</b> 20  μg/ml, which {{is sufficient for}} performing PCR.|$|R
30|$|Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, USA), and <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> bisulphite treated {{using the}} EZ DNA methylation Kit™ (Zymo Research, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.|$|R
40|$|Freeze-drying of Escherichia coli cells caused strand breaks of {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) in both radiation-sensitive and -resistant strains. However, in the radiation-resistant strain E. coli B/r the damaged <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{repaired}} after rehydration, {{whereas in the}} radiation-sensitive strain E. coli Bs- 1 the damaged <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> not repaired and the <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> degraded. Repeated freeze-drying did not break the damaged DNA into smaller pieces...|$|R
5|$|The {{reason for}} the {{presence}} of these non canonical bases in <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> not known. It seems likely that {{at least part of the}} {{reason for the}}ir presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.|$|E
5|$|When a cell's <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> {{damaged by}} a virus, {{and if the}} cell cannot repair itself, this often {{triggers}} apoptosis. One {{of the results of}} apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The <b>DNA</b> <b>is</b> first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
30|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> {{isolated}} from the SCNEC elements of specimens obtained during surgery. Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> extracted from frozen tumor specimens using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{cell-free}} {{system for}} studying a priming factor {{involved in the}} repair of bleomycin-damaged <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> established. The template-primer used for the repair <b>DNA</b> synthesis <b>was</b> prepared by treating the closed circular, superhelical form of pUC 19 plasmid DNA with 2. 2 microM bleomycin and 20 microM ferrous ions. Single-strand breaks were introduced into pUC 19 DNA by the bleomycin treatment, and the <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> consequently converted largely into the open circular form. A system for repair of this bleomycin-damaged <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> constructed with a priming factor, DNA polymerase (DNA polymerase beta or Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I), ATP, T 4 DNA ligase and four deoxynucleoside triphosphates. After incubation, the conformation of the <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The open circular <b>DNA</b> <b>was</b> largely converted to the closed circular DNA, indicating that the single-strand breaks of <b>DNA</b> <b>were</b> repaired. When the priming factor <b>was</b> omitted, <b>DNA</b> repair did not occur. The present system seemed to be applicable {{to the study of}} priming factors involved in the repair of DNA with single-strand breaks caused not only by bleomycin but also by ionizing radiation or active oxygen. </p...|$|R
