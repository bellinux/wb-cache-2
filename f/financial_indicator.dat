50|$|The PRIX index (or Political Risk for Oil Exports Index) is a <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> for {{international}} oil markets {{to understand the}} political risks associated with oil exports. The index forecasts and sums up political risks {{around the world that}} may affect the supply of oil to international markets. It is based on the same methodology as a Purchasing Managers' Index. Around 250 country analysts provide input, which is subsequently used to calculate an index value for each of the world’s 20 largest oil-exporting countries. Each of these country values is subsequently weighted by the exports of the countries in order to compute a single, weighted, global PRIX index number that sums up the political risk {{for international}} oil markets during the coming three months.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of external financial factors on economic activity in emerging economies (EMEs) motivated by a considerable increase in foreign financing by the corporate sector in EMEs since the early 2000 s, mainly {{in the form of}} bond issuance. A quarterly external <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> for several EMEs is built using bond-level data on spreads of corporate bonds issued in foreign capital markets, and its relationship with economic activity is examined. Results show that the indicator has considerable predictive power on future economic activity. Furthermore, an identified adverse shock to the <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> generates a large and protracted fall in real output growth, and about a third of its forecast error variance is associated with this shock. These findings are robust to controlling for possible spillovers from sovereign to corporate risk, among other considerations...|$|E

It reveals a necessity of comparing when conducting analysis of values of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> of bank activity, which are rated, with relevant values by the group of banks and the whole banking system. In the result of application of the proposed methods it seems possible to assess positive and negative sides of activity of a specific bank compared to its competitors.

40|$|Business failure {{has been}} one of the most {{investigated}} topics in the finance and the strategic literature during the last seven decades. However, most of this literature has been heavily focused on business failure prediction (with a clear focus on short-term prediction) and, simultaneously, only a few studies have investigated business failure prevention, focusing on understanding how a company may fail through "failure paths" and on the identification of very early warning financial and non-financial signals and symptoms. This may be explained by a conceptual difficulty to exactly represent what business failure prevention may mean and by a practical difficulty to build a <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> really allowing to announce a bankruptcy at least three years or more in advance, giving then time to potential corporate recovery. With this paper, we then propose an investigation of this concept of "Business Failure Prevention" and we test on a sample of 6 250 Belgian SMEs the ability of a specific <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> (referred as "Economic Added Result" and based on the amount of accounting value added which remains within a company when it has paid for its internal and external production factors) to effectively predict a business failure at least three years before it happens.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a New Keynesian {{quantitative}} model with endogenous investment and a stock-market sector to shed further light on two unsettled issues: whether central banks should include some <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> in their policy rules, and what indicator {{may be expected}} to generate better stabilization performance. For comparative purposes, the authors replicate the policy framework and assessment strategy of the well-known no-inclusion model of Bernanke-Gertler (1999, 2000) and assess performance of five policy rules. Two of these are traditional Taylor rules (i. e., do not incorporate financial indicators) that differ in the relative weight they put on output and inflation gaps. The other three are financial Taylor rules. These involve the addition of one <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> in each case. Specifically, the deviation from trend of stock prices, of Tobin's q (the rate of change in stock prices relative to capital stock) and of investment. The authors obtain results that are at variance with Bernanke-Gertler, first, because the best performing rule of the traditional rules is output aggressive instead of inflation aggressive and, second, because the financial rule with Tobin's q outperforms the traditional inflation-aggressive one under all dimensions and cases. However, the authors cannot draw a univocal conclusion as regards the comparison between the financial rule with Tobin's q and the traditional but output aggressive rule.
