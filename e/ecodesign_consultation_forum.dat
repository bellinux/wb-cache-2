40|$|Abstract: Considering police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> as a device, or tactic, to ‘civilize’ policing, the {{possibilities}} {{and limitations of}} ‘civilizing policing’ using this method can be shown. Police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> can ‘civilize’ policing – in the sense Loader and Walker (2007) use the term – by contributing to police reform, democratic policing, and police legitimacy. Using the case of Edinburgh, Scotland, the achievements of police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> for reform, democratic policing, and legitimacy, are examined and an argument made that <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> can make positive contributions {{in each of these}} areas. However, the example of <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> also reveals significant conceptual and structural limitations to the ideas of reform, democracy, and legitimacy when applied to the police. These limitations are articulated using the social theory of Simmel, Weber, and Lukes: Simmel and Weber reveal the inflexibility and non-negotiable aspects of the police that defies reform and democratic ambitions; Lukes provides an important precautionary perspective on the ‘democraticness’ of democratic devices; and, comparing Lukes with the work of Weber provides a view on legitimacy that reveals advanced complexities to ‘police legitimacy’. In sum, police-public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> contribute to ‘civilizing policing’, but it is also useful to reflect and consider the non-negotiable limits the ‘form’ of the police applies to possible positive change...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in August 2005, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council (ANMC) {{project that}} culminated in the {{production}} of a National framework for the development of decision-making tools for nursing and midwifery practice (National DMF) (Attachment 1) involved Australia-wide consultation and extensive review by stakeholders and clinicians. The need for a National DMF was identified in the ANMC’s strategic goals for 2004 – 2007, and in the recommendations of the report of the National Review of Nursing and Nurse Education: Our Duty of Care (2002). The process for development of the final National DMF commenced with the appointment of the project consultant and a Project Management Committee (PMC) {{in the latter half of}} 2005. A draft consultation document was developed based on a literature review and developments in Australia and internationally. The Draft National DMF and background paper / literature review were then used as the basis of consultation, both via written submission from key stakeholders and at <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> held in all Australian States and Territories in February and March 2006. Twenty-seven written submissions were received and 530 people attended the nine <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> 1. A second consultation draft incorporating the feedback from the written submissions and <b>consultation</b> <b>forums,</b> and input from representatives of the NMRAs which had frameworks / tools in their jurisdictions, was then circulated to members of the Reference Group in October – November 2006.

It is based on the ECCV community <b>consultation</b> <b>forum</b> Qualified but not Recognised and highlights the participants’ contributions. An overview of the policy context is given, with consideration to international, federal, Victorian state and professional associations. A summary of the discussions during the forum is also provided, with recommendations to address the various issues considered. The recommendations focus on affordable and accessible bridging courses, a centralised advisory service and an appeals mechanism for migrants seeking recognition.   The recognition of overseas skills and qualifications is an issue significant to Victoria’s large multicultural population and migrant communities. Migrants employed at a level suitable to their experience and qualifications provide a benefit, not only to themselves, but to the wider society also. Australia’s system for the recognition of overseas qualifications is one that is well regarded internationally, but the areas requiring improvement are significant. Unlike Canada, there is no regulatory body or appeals mechanism accessible to migrants seeking recognition of their overseas qualifications. Furthermore, bridging programs and courses currently available are fragmented and can be expensive for migrants.  ...|$|R

In addition, more than 60 % of them could save their income at least 25 - 40 % of their total monthly income, suggested that capital foundation required for business creation might then be compromised. Second, the structural constraint of unmonitored Indonesian trainees might cause problems in which—after having cultural distress while working in Japan and less conducive condition in managing their capital after returning to Indonesia—the potential to become an law-breaking overstay workers is considerably high and might cause a more sophisticated problem in the future.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} consultation on a proposed system for classifying models of maternity care in Australia. It {{is one of several}} components of the National Maternity Data Development Project and is a companion report to the publication, Foundations for enhanced maternity data collection and reporting in Australia: National Maternity Data Development Project Stage 1. Summary The National Maternity Data Development Project seeks to develop a standardised nomenclature for maternity models of care that will enable current and future models of care provided in Australia to be identified and described. Following the findings of a literature review, the Nomenclature for Models of Care Working Party approved one of three proposed solutions for classifying models of care using a data framework combined with a set of defined Major Model Categories (MMCs). This proposed solution, known as the Maternity Care Classification System (MaCCS), was then presented at a series of <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> in each jurisdiction as well as at a national workshop that reviewed proposed amendments from the jurisdictional forums. Following consensus at the national workshop on all proposed changes, the resulting data items and MMCs were sent out for further consultation via an electronic survey instrument. A total of 98 participants attended the <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> held in each state and territory and over 360 people responded to the electronic survey. Feedback was received {{from a wide range of}} stakeholders including obstetricians, midwives, general practitioners, consumers, policy-makers, data managers, neonatologists, researchers and academics. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive. All stakeholder groups acknowledged the need for a classification system that would capture the different characteristics of models of care without relying solely on the name of the model. The results of the consultation echoed the findings of the literature review-that there were too many differences between models of care sharing the same category or name for a simple naming system to be effective in identifying models of care for evaluation or reporting. Forum participants and survey respondents supported collecting data about characteristics of models of care at the institutional rather than the individual level to reduce the burden on clinicians. Using the MaCCS annually at a hospital to create the 2 ̆ 7 model of care 2 ̆ 7 codes will make data collection easier. Nonetheless, there were still some concerns about when the model of care would be recorded for each woman, given the retrospective nature of the Perinatal Data Collection forms. Without the use of a shared electronic antenatal record, recording practices for the model of care during the antenatal period and changes to the model may be variable and these data may not be accessible to the midwife at birth, which could result in inaccurate data. The content of the proposed MaCCS was improved and refined as a result of consulting [or consulting and engaging with] all relevant stakeholder groups. This resulted in a more robust and workable set of model characteristics. The positive feedback from the consultation process confirms that the proposed MaCCS should be progressed as the most suitable tool to define and record models of maternity care in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the last}} two decades the role of the {{architectural}} ‘crit’ as an educational tool has increasingly come under scrutiny. In such research, the crit has been portrayed as a forum for critical debate, dialectics or enculturation as much, if not more so, than as a site of design development and formative assessment. The present paper is focussed on the rhetoric, or language and associated logic structure, that underpins presentations of design in academia. The paper considers the relationship between two forms of presentation - the oracular and the dialectic - as they are employed in philosophical and architectural discourse. While architects’ rhetoric can reflect individualistic and inconsistent theories, one aspect of their work is relatively universal and consistent. Buildings are designed in consultation. In design studios and crits, client meetings, public <b>consultation</b> <b>forums,</b> appeals tribunals, design review forums and over coffee fundamental planning and massing strategies are resolved during the course of verbal discussions. The act of talking about buildings may seem unremarkable, until, that is, we recognize design talk as a kind of philosophical inquiry, otherwise known as dialectic. Devised in ancient Greece as a rational alternative to oracular pronouncements, shown in action through Plato’s middle and late dialogues, and since employed by philosophers including Hegel, Kant and Marx, dialectic is an established method of inquiry, particularly with regards to the kinds of ethical questions that building projects can pose. This thread of inquiry is developed in the paper with a particular focus on the presentation of design in an academic environment...|$|R
40|$|Belgium, and the Flemish Government in particular, {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of funding a relatively large number of advisory bodies of varying constitution, such as advisory councils, ad-hoc committees, expert groups, citizen <b>consultation</b> <b>forums</b> etc. Policy-making in Flanders has thus traditionally been characterized by a high density of advisory bodies with varying impacts and status. These advisory bodies tend to be highly integrated into the official policy-making cycle. In addition, the advisory landscape tends to make more use of experience-based expertise that a wide range of societal stakeholders can provide than of academic expert opinion. This is not surprising in a consensus-based political system with neo-corporatist traits. Recently, the Flemish government has reshaped its advisory landscape in response to three concerns: the political will to restore political primacy in policy making, the desire to control the growing competition of advice and advisory bodies, and the need for securing societal support for policy interventions. In this paper, we analyze the defining aspects of the new strategic advice councils in Flanders such as their age, size, membership mix, and legacy. We also explore the relationship of these factors with participant satisfaction about the advisory process and the use of advice by policy makers. For this, we will make use of the results of a 2009 survey with the members of the new strategic advisory system, which had a response rate of 72. 4 %. The survey was conducted in nine out of the twelve strategic advisory councils in Flanders and provides material for a comprehensive analysis of Flanders’ formalized system of permanent advisory bodies. status: publishe...|$|R
