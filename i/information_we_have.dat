25|$|The central {{relationship}} in Bellini's life {{seems to have}} been with Francesco Florimo, originally a student friend at the Naples Conservatory. Florimo came from a village near Catania. Throughout Bellini's lifetime, the two shared a close correspondence, the source of much of the <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> concerning the composer's life. Bellini wrote sometimes very long letters to him from the many places he lived and traveled to. Meanwhile, Florimo remained in Naples, ultimately becoming the Conservatory librarian.|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> about ancient poets is largely drawn {{from their own}} works. Unfortunately, Apollonius of Rhodes reveals nothing about himself. Most of the biographical material comes from four sources: two are texts entitled Life of Apollonius found in the scholia on his work (Vitae A and B); a third is an entry in the 10th-century encyclopaedia the Suda; and fourthly a 2nd-century BCE papyrus, P.Oxy. 1241, which provides names of several heads of the Library of Alexandria. Other scraps can be gleaned from miscellaneous texts. The reports from all the above sources however are scanty and often self-contradictory.|$|E

The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. <b>Information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad.

25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited <b>information,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E

50|$|However, as time evolves, {{that initial}} <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> becomes less {{directly}} accessible. Instead of being easily summarisable in the macroscopic {{description of the}} system, it increasingly relates to very subtle correlations between the positions and momenta of individual molecules. (Compare to Boltzmann's H-theorem.)

2500|$|Most of the biographical <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> of Theophrastus was {{provided}} by Diogenes Laërtius' Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, written more than four hundred years after Theophrastus' time. He {{was a native of}} Eresos in Lesbos. His given name was Tyrtamus (Τύρταμος), but he later became known by the nickname [...] "Theophrastus," [...] given to him, it is said, by Aristotle to indicate the grace of his conversation (from Ancient Greek Θεός [...] "god" [...] and φράζειν [...] "to phrase", i.e. divine expression).|$|E

2500|$|Epicharmus of Kos or Epicharmus Comicus or Epicharmus Comicus Syracusanus (...) , {{thought to}} have lived between c. 540 and c. 450 BC, was a Greek dramatist and philosopher often {{credited}} with {{being one of the}} first comic writers, having originated the Doric or Sicilian comedic form. Aristotle (Poetics 5.1449b5) writes that he and Phormis invented comic plots (μῦθοι, muthoi). Most of the <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> about Epicharmus comes from the writings of Athenaeus, Suda and Diogenes Laertius, but fragments and comments come up in a host of other ancient authors as well. [...] There have also been some papyrus finds of longer sections of text, but these are often so full of holes {{that it is difficult to}} make sense of them. Plato mentions Epicharmus in his dialogue Gorgias and in Theaetetus. [...] In the latter, Socrates refers to Epicharmus as [...] "the prince of Comedy", Homer as [...] "the prince of Tragedy", and both as [...] "great masters of either kind of poetry".|$|E

[...] Myers also indicated in a press release for the college magazine, Sarah Lawrence, that the college will be involved in developing the new database of colleges discussed in the Annapolis Group statement as they [...] "believe in accountability and openness, and that the public has a right to solid and reliable information about the important decisions involved in choosing a college." [...] The press release also indicated that Sarah Lawrence [...] "plans not to participate in the peer reputational survey or data collection for U.S. News and World Report’s rankings" [...] as, according to Myers, [...] "by submitting data and the peer reputation survey we have tacitly been endorsing these rankings [...] all the <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> provided to U.S. News in the past will be available to the public through other channels.” ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{indicative}} of Basil's intentions for this church that he endowed it with its own administration and estates, {{on the model of}} the Hagia Sophia. During his and his immediate successors’ reign, the Nea {{played an important role in}} palace ceremonies, and at least until the reign of Constantine VII, the anniversary of its consecration was a major dynastic feast. At some point in the late 11th century it was turned into a monastery, and was known as the [...] "New Monastery" [...] (Νέα Μονή). Emperor Isaac II Angelos stripped it of much of its decoration, its furniture and liturgical vessels, and used them to restore the church of St Michael at Anaplous. The building continued to be used by the Latins and survived the Palaiologan period until after the Ottoman conquest of the city. The Ottomans however used it for gunpowder storage. Thus in 1490, when the building was struck by a lightning, it was destroyed and subsequently torn down. As a result, the only <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> about the church comes from literary evidence, especially the mid-10th century Vita Basilii, as well a few crude depictions in maps.|$|E
2500|$|The case {{failed because}} of lack of proper {{evidence}} thanks to Jatin's policy of a loose decentralised organisation federating scores of regional units, as observed by F.C. Daly more than once: [...] "The gang is a heterogeneous one, with several advisers and petty chiefs... From <b>information</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> on record we may divide the gang into four parts: (1) Gurus, (2) Influential supporters, (3) Leaders, (4) Members." [...] J.C. Nixon's report is more explicit : [...] "Although a separate name and a separate individuality have been given to these various parties in this account of them, and although such a distinction was probably observed amongst the minor members, it is very clear that the bigger figures were in close communication with one another and were frequently accepted members of two or more of these samitis. It may be taken that at some time these various parties were engaged in anarchical crime independently, although in their revolutionary aims and usually in their origins they were all very closely related." [...] Several observers pinpointed Jatin so accurately that the newly appointed Viceroy Lord Hardinge wrote more explicitly to Earl Crewe (H.M.'s Secretary of State for India): [...] "As regards prosecution, I (...) deprecate the net being thrown so wide; as for example in the Howrah Gang Case, where 47 persons are being prosecuted, of whom only one is, I believe, the real criminal. If a concentrated effort had been made to convict this one criminal, I think it would have had a better effect than the prosecution of 46 misguided youths." [...] On 28 May 1911, Hardinge recognised : [...] "The 10th Jats case was {{part and parcel of the}} Howrah Gang Case; and with the failure in the latter, the Government of Bengal realised the futility of proceeding with the former... In fact, nothing could be worse, in my opinion, than the condition of Bengal and Eastern Bengal. There is practically no Government in either province..." ...|$|E
