2500|$|RC's {{system of}} {{centralised}} control has been deprecated by ex-members {{who would have}} preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this was pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L. Ron Hubbard.|$|E

"In 1946, after {{returning}} to Montreal from service with the Free French Forces, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the crude technique previously used for radioautography had to be improved". In collaboration with Leonard Bélanger, Leblond worked on increasing {{the resolution of the}} autoradiographic technique. They were advised by physicist Pierre Demers to melt the emulsion from Eastman Kodak lantern slides, paint it directly on the sections, and then develop the emulsion while it was still attached to the histologic sections. This resulted in a tenfold improvement in resolution. Subsequently, Leblond and his colleagues developed a technique in which the histologic slides were dipped directly into liquid emulsion. The use of thinner sections and emulsion coats led to further advances in resolution, and the introduction of tritium was a technical milestone.|$|E
