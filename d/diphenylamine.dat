25|$|During {{the course}} of her work, Bernheim {{utilized}} rabbit liver extracts and obtained the enzyme by adding kaolin to the liver extracts at pH 6.5. Following this, crude tyramine was procured by heating tyrosine {{in the presence of the}} catalyst <b>diphenylamine.</b> The extracted enzyme was added to tyramine, in the presence of water and buffer, and the Barcroft technique was utilized to observe the amount of oxygen consumed by tyramine. She discovered that the oxidation of tyramine did take place, with the observation that one atom of oxygen was absorbed per molecule of tyramine present. This observation indicated the presence of an enzyme system within the studied liver extracts, which Bernheim named tyramine oxidase, since it was involved in the oxidation of tyramine.|$|E
500|$|When {{brought into}} service during World War II the guns had a barrel life of roughly 290rounds, limited {{in large part}} by the {{nitrated}} cellulose (NC) propellant. After World War II the Navy switched to smokeless powder <b>diphenylamine</b> (SPD), a cooler-burning propellant, which increased the barrel life from 290 to about 350rounds. This was increased further by the introduction of a titanium dioxide and wax compound known as [...] "Swedish Additive" [...] on [...] for her tour in Vietnam, and later used on all four Iowas when they were reactivated in the 1980s. These measures were further augmented by the addition of polyurethane jackets, which were placed over the powder bags to reduce gaseous erosion during the firing of the guns. These measures greatly prolonged barrel life, and ultimately resulted in a shift from measuring barrel life in equivalent service rounds (ESR) to measuring barrel life in fatigue equivalent rounds (FER).|$|E

40|$|Abstractα-Tocopherol {{concentrations}} were determined at {{low and high}} light intensities and compared with the rate of photosynthesis, photosystem II (PS II) and its reaction center D 1 protein. Blocking of tocopherol biosynthesis at the 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase by the herbicide pyrazolynate led to a quick disappearance of α-tocopherol in high light, {{as well as of}} PS II activity and the D 1 protein. Homogentisic acid rescued all activities. It is concluded that α-tocopherol has a continuous turnover as a scavenger of the singlet oxygen that arises from the quenching by oxygen of the triplet of the PS II reaction center and triggers the degradation of the D 1 protein. Thus tocopherols are essential to keep photosynthesis active. We suggest that this is why plants make and need tocopherols. Chemical quenchers of singlet oxygen, notably <b>diphenylamines,</b> completely protect PS II, prevent D 1 protein degradation and keep tocopherol levels even at very high light intensities.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} rapid {{separation}} and detection method for analyzing organic compounds in smokeless powders and then test its applicability on gunshot residue (GSR) samples. In this project, a total of 20 common smokeless powder additives and their decomposition products were separated by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Some of the targeted compounds included <b>diphenylamines,</b> centralites, nitrotoluenes, nitroglycerin, and various phthalates. The compounds were ionized in the MS source using simultaneous positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) with negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in order to detect all compounds in a single analysis. The developed UPLC/MS/MS method was applied to commercially available smokeless powders and gunshot residue samples recovered from the hands of shooters, spent cartridges, and smokeless powder retrieved from unfired cartridges. Distinct compositions were identified for smokeless powders from different manufacturers and from separate manufacturing lots. The procedure also produced specific chemical profiles when tested on gunshot residues from different manufacturers. Overall, this thesis represents the development of a rapid and reproducible procedure capable of simultaneously detecting the widest possible range of components present in organic gunshot residue. ...|$|R
40|$|Kirkhill Rubber Company (KRC) has {{informed}} Thiokol Corporation {{that two}} raw {{materials used in}} the asbestos and silica filled acrylonitrile butadience rubber (NBR) formulation per STW 2621 are no longer available from their vendors.

The effects of Y are small (2 ̆ 2642 kcal/mol for all Y) for Z = CH 2, {{but they are}} large for Z = O, where good correlations with 3 ̆c 3 p+(Y) yield 3 ̆c 1 + = 6. 5 kcal/mol. For Z = NH, two sets of electrochemically measured N 2 ̆ 212 H 3 ̆ 94 BDEs correlate with 3 ̆c 3 p+(Y), yielding 3 ̆c 1 + = 3. 9 and 3. 0 kcal/mol. However, {{in contrast to the}} situation with phenols, these data indicate that the strengthening effect on N 2 ̆ 212 H BDEs of electron-withdrawing (EW) Y's is greater than the weakening effect of electron-donating (ED) Y's. Attempts to measure N 2 ̆ 212 H 3 ̆ 94 BDEs in anilines using two nonelectrochemical techniques were unsuccessful; therefore, we turned to density functional theory. Calculations on 15 4 -YC 6 H 4 NH 2 gave N 2 ̆ 212 H 3 ̆ 94 BDEs correlating with 3 ̆c 3 p+ (3 ̆c 1 + = 4. 6 kcal/mol) and indicated that EW and ED Y's had comparable strengthening and weakening effects, respectively, on the N 2 ̆ 212 H bonds. To validate theory by connecting it to experiment, the N 2 ̆ 212 H 3 ̆ 94 BDEs of four 4, 42 ̆ 018 -disubstituted <b>diphenylamines</b> and five 3, 7 -disubstituted phenothiazines were both calculated and measured by the radical equilibration EPR technique. For all compounds, theory and experiment agreed to better than 1 kcal/mol. Dissection of N 2 ̆ 212 H 3 ̆ 94 BDEs in 4 -substituted anilines and O 2 ̆ 212 H 3 ̆ 94 BDEs in 4 -substituted phenols into interaction enthalpies between Y and NH 2 /OH (molecule stabilization/destabilization enthalpy, MSE) and NH 2 ̆ 022 /O 2 ̆ 022 (radical stabilization/destabilization enthalpy, RSE) reveals that for both groups of compounds, ED Y's destabilize the molecule and stabilize the radical, while the opposite holds true for EW Y's. However, in the phenols the effects of substituents on the radical are roughly 3 times as great as those in the molecule, whereas in the anilines the two effects are of comparable magnitudes. These differences arise from the stronger ED character of NH 2 vs OH and the weaker EW character of NH 2 ̆ 022 vs O 2 ̆ 022. The relatively large contributions to N 2 ̆ 212 H BDEs in anilines arising from interactions in the molecules suggested that N 2 ̆ 212 X 3 ̆ 94 BDEs in 4 -YC 6 H 4 NH-X would depend on X, in contrast to the lack of effect of X on O 2 ̆ 212 X and CH 2 -X 3 ̆ 94 BDEs in 4 -YC 6 H 4 O-X and 4 -YC 6 H 4 CH 2 -X. This suggestion was confirmed for X = CH 3, H, OH, and F, for which the calculated NH 2 ̆ 212 X 3 ̆ 94 BDEs yielded 3 ̆c 1 + = 5. 0, 4. 6, 4. 0, and 3. 0 kcal/mol, respectively.
