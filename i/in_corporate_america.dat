" This thesis reviews the MIS literature over the last 20 years dealing with measuring information system (IS) effectiveness. In particular it tracks the genesis and evaluation of user satisfaction as a surrogate measure of system effectiveness. tThe concern is whether the surrogate, user satisfaction, an opinion is the same effectiveness, the behavior, an action. It was found that an instrument for measuring user satisfaction developed by Bailey and Pearson (1983) has been widely accepted and used by the MIS community for measuring IT effectiveness. However, it was also found that many studies failed to consider any other methods of measuring effectiveness and many also misapplied the instrument as well. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Diversity {{initiatives}} are commonplace <b>in</b> today’s <b>corporate</b> <b>America.</b> Large and successful firms frequently tout their commitments to diversity, sometimes appointing women and racial minorities to highly visible posts, including seats on their boards of directors. Why would a profit-minded firm engage in such behavior? One frequently voiced {{explanation is that}} by creating such diversity, firms send out a positive signal about their attributes: a firm’s willingness to expend resources on diversity shows its commitment to workplace fairness and equality, which makes it more attractive to potential employees, customers and financiers. This claim has considerable surface appeal not only as an explanatory thesis, but as a rationale that conveniently bridges the normative gap between corporate self interest {{and the promotion of}} social justice. In this article, we raise some difficulties with the theory of diversity-as-signal in terms of both its explanatory adequacy and its normative implications...|$|R

40|$|While Stata {{has gained}} wide {{acceptance}} in academia, its use <b>in</b> <b>corporate</b> environments lags far behind. For academic Stata users, the product's inability to penetrate business has important consequences. Students trained in Stata have fewer opportunities than those trained in other tools, particularly SAS, that {{are widely used}} by businesses. Academic statisticians have fewer opportunities to collaborate and consult with colleagues in business. For the past five years, ProfSoft has been developing and marketing a medical claims analysis system that builds on the data management and data analysis capabilities in Stata. Our experience has shown that Stata can greatly enhance the analytic capabilities of health plans, provider organizations, and purchaser coalitia and that Stata {{is a very powerful}} tool for working with large <b>corporate</b> databases, sometimes <b>in</b> excess of 100 million records.

40|$|The views {{expressed}} herein {{are those of}} Commissioner Cox {{and do not necessarily}} represent those of the Commission, other Commissioners or the staff. American corporations are schizophrenic. Anyone who's reviewed detailed financial or business information knows that. Anyone who's compared the bUlky, unromantic Form 10 -K filed at the SEC with the skillfully marketed annual report to shareholders knows that. Why, even the Securities and Exchange Commission knows that American corporations are schizophrenic. I use this term loosely, of course. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by, among other things, a disintegration of personality. Now I don't mean to suggest that there are psychotic disorders abounding <b>in</b> <b>America's</b> <b>corporate</b> boardrooms [...] although some may dispute that point [...] but I would posit to you that American corporations do indeed suffer from a disintegration of personality. A major cause of "personality disintegration " {{on the part of the}} American corporation is that most corporations attempt to be all things to all people when communicating with the outside world. Or at least, they attempt to be many different things to many different people. There are distinct audiences who listen when <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> talks. The major question is: should all these audiences be given the same speech when they really want to hear different things? This is the question I would like to examine with you today. In this discussion, I will consider three different "audiences" listening when <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> speaks...|$|R

40|$|In partial {{fulfillment}} of my undergraduate Honors College requirements, I have conducted the research study {{described in this}} paper investigating the motivational factors that influence the likelihood of fraud. <b>In</b> recent past, <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> has {{seen some of the}} largest fraud scandals in history. This research study examined motivational factors, used as independent variables, money, ideology, and coercion to see how participants responded to hypothetical scenarios in which they {{had to make a decision}} on revenue recognition. By distributing online surveys, I collected data supporting the idea that ideology potentially is a stronger motivational than money or coercion. By analyzing and running tests through SAS Analytical Software, the data directionally supported my hypotheses. After conducting further analysis, interesting facts show that those employees who have been working for six months or more are more likely to fraudulently recognize more revenue than those who have been working less than six months. This information could lead to serious insights on how companies and auditors should address different scenarios...|$|R

Prior to joining Boston and after graduating from the University of Maine at Farmington with a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education, Neal (who is originally from Maine) performed for over 15 years {{in a wide variety of}} bands touring throughout New England, primarily playing small clubs and venues. In late 2002, while Boston leader Tom Scholz was vacationing in Maine, he would see Neal play at Sunday River Ski Resort with his then current band- Punchbug. After introducing himself between sets, Scholz offered Neal an audition. Soon after, Neal was offered the position as the group's touring drummer/background vocalist and would participate <b>in</b> 2003's <b>Corporate</b> <b>America</b> tour, 2004's Boston Returns tour and the 2008 tour alongside fellow classic rockers Styx. Other appearances with the band include various one-offs performing Boston's version of the National Anthem; at Fenway Park in Boston prior to the 2003 ALDS Game 3 matchup between the Red Sox and Oakland A's and in January 2004 at Gillette Stadium prior to the subzero wind chill playoff game between the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans.

Blended learning happens when some course meetings or training events are conducted virtually rather than face-to-face. Such classes or training experiences can blend students located at various remote regions or perhaps instructors collaboratively teaching a class at two or more locations. Blended learning might simply supplement course readings and activities with online articles, simulations, events, and other resources...|$|R

40|$|In late 2006, Fleishman-Hillard Inc. and the National Consumers League {{prepared}} for the second annual survey of Americans' perceptions of corporate social responsibility {{against the backdrop of}} sweeping national political change following the 2006 midterm elections. Democrats had captured both chambers of Congress as well as many governorships across the country. For {{the first time in more}} than six years, a greater percentage of Independents voted with Democrats, helping to turn the tide against incumbent Republicans. In the wake of the November 2006 elections, we wondered whether Americans were viewing corporate social responsibility from a fourth perspective — as a voter.   This year's survey, therefore, investigates Americans' perception of corporate social responsibility based on political party affiliations. We also used the survey findings to determine whether Americans expect government to play a role <b>in</b> realigning <b>corporate</b> <b>America's</b> priorities and values with their own.   We identified several compelling themes that appeared throughout the data. In particular, a substantial majority of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents believe that: 1. The American public's priorities appear to be out of alignment with corporate practices. 2. U. S. corporations do not act responsibly. 3. Government should be involved. Our survey findings lead us to believe that Americans have reached a tipping point with their expectations of — and frustrations with — business. So much so, that they are now willing to have government step in to help realign corporate behavior with the values and priorities that they value...|$|R
