In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E

You <b>know,</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You ever heard of emotional release?" [...] Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, [...] "Instead of putting joysticks, I {{would have liked to have}} seen dynamite put in their orifices", and that [...] "we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less."

Do you <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are the magnates of the section? They were spoken of to-night in the saloon; their wealth must amount to many millions of dollars in real estate alone; their house is one of the sights of the locality, and you offer me a bribe of a few hundred!" ...|$|E

The cold-blooded insolence of the work almost saves it; but he mustn't go on with this. Hasn't he been praised and cockered up too much?

It was a house I owned, which I saved from the wrecks, and as I look back upon what the world would call a misfortune, sir, I {{can see that it}} was a propitious event, for me. The street 'ran down,' as the saying goes. I grew gradually to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> my new neighbours, largely through their children, and I perceived many things I had not dreamed of--before then. I saw how the Church was hampered, fettered; I saw why they disliked and distrusted it." ...|$|E

Anything can be done with money in Spain. There are many upright and honourable Spaniards, but very few of them take any part in public affairs, and would not associate with such men as those who are in the ascendant in all the provincial juntas, and even in the central body in Madrid.|$|E

Not that I think any quarter ought to be shown to her after joining those atrocious Whigs, but to be sure she was {{corrupted}} by her husband, whom I remember the most thorough Tory going. To be sure, I was a Whig myself in those days, so one must not say too much about it, but the Whigs then were gentlemen. I will tell you what I will do. I will receive both on Saturdays and Wednesdays. It is an effort, and I am not as young as I was, but it will only be for a season or less, for I <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> cannot stand. It will be all over by May." ...|$|E
60|$|Now it was {{impossible}} to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> nor did they sometimes, as I have said, know themselves to be infected. These were the people that so often dropped down and fainted in the streets; for oftentimes they would go about the streets to the last, till on a sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit down at a door and die. It is true, finding themselves thus, they would struggle hard to get home to their own doors, or at other times would be just able to go into their houses and die instantly; other times they would go about till they had the very tokens come out upon them, and yet not know it, and would die in an hour or two after they came home, but be well {{as long as they were}} abroad. These were the dangerous people; these were the people of whom the well people ought to have been afraid; but then, on the other side, it {{was impossible}} to know them.|$|E

50|$|Wartena's work is narrative, {{based on}} {{himself and his}} surroundings.

The drawings are made as accurately as possible {{in the sense that they}} include every detail of people's everyday existence, such as clutter, rubbish and graffiti: features of the present environment. Like the genre works from the Dutch Masters, he too shares their passion of portraying people engaged in common activities. The difference is that Wartena <b>knows</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> personally.|$|R

He and his wife and family are wretchedly poor, but they are kind, good souls, and for a consideration and a minimum of risk to themselves they will always render service to the English milors, whom they believe to be a band of inveterate smugglers. Ffoulkes and all the others <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> and know the house; Armand by the same token knows it too. Marie de Marmontel and her brother are there, and several others; the old Comte de Lezardiere, the Abbe de Firmont; their names spell suffering, loyalty, and hopelessness. I was lucky enough to convey them safely to that hidden shelter. They trust me implicitly, dear heart. They are waiting for me there, trusting in my promise to them. Dear heart, you will go, will you not?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} granary in a {{thoughtful}} mood, {{and on the}} following evening drove over to the Grant homestead. Its owner was busy somewhere outside when he reached it, but Flora received him and he sat down with satisfaction to talk to her. It had become a pleasure to visit the Grants; he felt at home in their house. The absence of all ceremony, the simple Canadian life, had a growing attraction for him. One could get to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> which was a different thing from merely meeting them, and George thought this was to some extent the effect of their surroundings. He had always been conscious of a closer and more intimate contact with his friends upon the mountain-side or the banks of some salmon river {{than he had ever}} experienced in a club or drawing-room. For all that, Flora sometimes slightly puzzled him. She was free from the affectations and restraints of artificial conventionality, but there was a reserve about her which he failed to penetrate. He wondered what lay behind it and had a curious feeling that Edgar either guessed or knew.|$|E
60|$|He was prolix, {{it may be}} admitted, but {{who could}} bear to have him cut? He loved {{to sit down and}} tell you just all about it. His use of letters for his {{narratives}} made this gossipy style more easy. First he writes and he tells all that passed. You have his letter. She at the same time writes to her friend, and also states her views. This also you see. The friends in each case reply, and you have the advantage of their comments and advice. You really do know all about it before you finish. It may be a little wearisome at first, if you have been accustomed to a more hustling style with fireworks in every chapter. But gradually it creates an atmosphere in which you live, and you come to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> with their characters and their troubles, as you know no others of the dream-folk of fiction. Three times as long as an ordinary book, no doubt, but why grudge the time? What is the hurry? Surely it is better to read one masterpiece than three books which will leave no permanent impression on the mind.|$|E

Yes, I know I made a fuss {{when that}} beast {{of a cat}} lunched off those two, but that was simply the {{principle}} of the thing. I'm not going to pay large sums for chickens purely in order that a cat which I've never liked can lunch well. Still, we've plenty left, and the eggs are coming in better now, though we've still a deal of leeway to make up yet in that line. I got a letter from Whiteley's this morning asking when my first consignment was going to arrive. You <b>know,</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> make a mistake in hurrying a man. It annoys him. It irritates him. When we really get going, Garny, my boy, I shall drop Whiteley's. I shall cut them out of my list and send my eggs to their trade rivals. They shall have a sharp lesson. It's a little hard. Here am I, worked to death looking after things down here, and these men have the impertinence to bother me about their wretched business. Come in and have a drink, laddie, and let's talk it over." ...|$|E

Sparkler {{is a very good}} fellow on the whole, though rather a bore on one subject, in consequence of being tremendously smitten with a certain young lady.' Here Edward Dorrit, Esquire, eyed Miss Fanny through his glass across the table. 'We happened last night to compare notes about our travels, and I had the information I have given you from Sparkler himself.' Here he ceased; continuing to eye Miss Fanny through his glass, with a face much twisted, and not ornamentally so, in part by the action of keeping his glass in his eye, and in part by the great subtlety of his smile. 'Under these circumstances,' said Mr Dorrit, 'I believe I express the sentiments of--ha--Mrs General, no less than my own, when I say that there is no objection, but--ha hum--quite the contrary--to your gratifying your desire, Amy. I trust I may--ha--hail--this desire,' said Mr Dorrit, in an encouraging and forgiving manner, 'as an auspicious omen.
