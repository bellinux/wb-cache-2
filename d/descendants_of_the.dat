5|$|<b>Descendants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biblical Ishmaelites, <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are <b>descendants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E
