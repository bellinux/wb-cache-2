40|$|Reviewed by {{the editor}} of NORML News prior to inclusion, but not peer reviewed.  While the social costs of drug use are real, they are not well-measured by {{instruments}} such as BERL's Drug Harm Index. The DHI conflates the real costs of drug use {{with a host of}} costs borne by drug users, like the cost of buying their marijuana, and the costs of enforcing a prohibition regime. Consequently, it is nonsensical to use the DHI as the basis for evaluating the harms avoided by police <b>drug</b> <b>seizures,</b> especially since the costs of police <b>drug</b> <b>seizures</b> can hardly be avoided by police <b>drug</b> <b>seizures...</b>|$|R

50|$|Panama {{continues}} {{to fight against}} the illegal narcotics and arms trade. The country's proximity to major cocaine-producing nations and its role as a commercial and financial crossroads make it a country of special importance in this regard. The Panamanian Government has concluded agreements with the U.S. on maritime law enforcement, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and stolen vehicles. A three-year investigation by the Drug Prosecutors Office (DPO), the PTJ, and several other law enforcement agencies in the region culminated in the May 2006 arrest in Brazil of Pablo Rayo Montano, a Colombian-born drug crime boss. Assets located in Panama belonging to his drug cartel were among those seized by the Government of Panama following his indictment by a U.S. federal court in Miami. In March 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard, in cooperation with the Government of Panama seized over 38,000 lbs. of cocaine off the coast of Panama, the largest <b>drug</b> <b>seizure</b> in the eastern Pacific.|$|E

In October 1976, Sherman seized the 275-foot Panamanian freighter Don Emilio and confiscated 82 tons of marijuana, the largest <b>drug</b> <b>seizure</b> in history at the time. Responding to a need for greater operational resources in the Pacific, Sherman was transferred to her next homeport in Alameda, California in May 1979. Sherman’s primary missions shifted to Alaskan Patrols (ALPAT) involving fisheries law enforcement (LE), drug interdiction, search and rescue (SAR), and military readiness in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Sherman was decommissioned from May 1986 until July 1989 to complete a 3-year Fleet Renovation and Modernization (FRAM) project at Todd Shipyard in Seattle, Washington. The project upgraded Sherman’s weapons, communications, aviation and other operating systems and completely renovated crew living and berthing spaces.

40|$|Introduction: Clinical {{and outcome}} {{profiles}} of childhood seizures can {{be different in}} resource limited settings where neurologists face lots of challenges in diagnosis and management of seizure. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the clinical profile, causes and outcome of afebrile seizures in children in resource limited settings. &# 13; Methods: This was a prospective hospital based study. Children with afebrile seizures were followed up with exclusion of febrile and acute provoked seizures. Clinical, investigation, treatment and outcome parameters were analyzed. &# 13; Results: Study included 308 (age one month to 20 years) children. Median age at first seizure was 39 (inter quartile range 12 - 96) months. History of status epilepticus was present in 26. 0 %. Cause of seizure was known in 44. 2 %. Seizure was generalized in 79. 2 %, partial in 14. 0 % and unclassified in 6. 8 %. Common causes of seizure were – birth asphyxia (12. 3 %), neurocysticercosis (8. 8 %), sequel of nervous system infection (6. 5 %) and structural brain abnormalities (7. 1 %). Neurological examination, electroencephalography and computed tomography (CT) were abnormal in 24. 4 %, 70. 5 % and 27. 9 % cases respectively. Seizure control was achieved in 79. 3 % and by monotherapy in 85. 0 % cases. Seizure control with single <b>drug,</b> <b>seizure</b> without recurrence and idiopathic seizure were associated with favourable outcome. &# 13; Conclusions: Prevention and control of birth asphyxia, neurocysticercosis and nervous system infections are needed to reduce the burden of afebrile seizures in this area. CT is a valuable diagnostic tool and response to monotherapy is good. Seizure control with single <b>drug,</b> <b>seizure</b> without recurrence and idiopathic seizure are favourable prognostic factors. &# 13; Keywords: afebrile seizure; children; clinical profile; outcome...|$|E
