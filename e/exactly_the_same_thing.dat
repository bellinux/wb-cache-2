In 1961, Harry and the Cavern Club's DJ, Bob Wooler, compiled a list of groups that they had personally heard of, which had almost 300 names. In 1962, Mersey Beat held a poll to find out who was the most popular Merseyside group. When the votes were counted, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes were in first place, but after looking through the postal votes again, Harry noticed that forty votes were all written in green ink, in the same handwriting, and from the same area of Liverpool, so the dubious votes were declared void. This was suspected to have been Storm himself, but Harry had no idea that the Beatles had done <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

500|$|English is {{an immensely}} rich {{language}} {{in terms of}} vocabulary, containing more synonyms than any other language.

It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate {{is based on the}} last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989. Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million wordsbut that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use and technical acronyms.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{accompanying}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] features a man (Jason Adelman) {{and a woman}} (Samaire Armstrong) going about their daily routines over a three-day period. Parts of the video are shown in split screen as they do <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> at different times, sometimes in the same location. The central point of the video occurs when they paint separately on the same billboard. Armstrong character shows her negativeness by adding rain and a car running through puddle of water while Adelman adds an umbrella and {{a man with a}} coat to protect the woman in the billboard. At some point, he draws a question mark and she completes it with a heart. At the end of the video, they finally meet when the man offers the woman an umbrella during a rain shower as a taxi cab stops for them. Throughout the video, Powter is shown playing a piano while wearing a tuque—a type of knitted hat.|$|E
500|$|As {{the serial}} progressed, Pauline contends with {{a plethora of}} family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, {{attracting}} 19million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: [...] "To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment." [...] The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles {{to come to terms}} with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: [...] "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are not <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "enhanced" [...] video {{states that}} there are 724 {{references}} to Twin Peaks in the episode's closing scene. Among them, Jack Smith wears an eye patch and a red suit and dances funny, referencing not only the aforementioned [...] "One Eyes Jacks" [...] brothel and Nadine Hurley, but a dream sequence in Peaks, where a character known as the Man from Another Place wore a similar suit and danced in a bizarre fashion. In the final scene Carlton is seen holding his hand up and stating [...] "that is a damn fine cup of cider". In the Twin Peaks pilot Agent Cooper holds his hand {{the same way and}} states [...] "that is a damn fine cup of coffee." [...] Additionally, Carlton is later holding a cup of coffee on its side, displaying that the coffee is now solid in a fashion mimicking the same action by Agent Cooper in the final episode. A seven-foot tall man (John DeSantis) wearing a bow tie looks much like the giant from Agent Cooper's dream. Randy is seen at the end barking out the window like Bobby Briggs did to James Hurley in the holding cells. Bob Barker is seen dancing with a picture just as Leland Palmer did in Twin Peaks. The episode's end credits are accompanied by soap opera-type music and a shot of Paula's prom picture; Twin Peaks credits did <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> with Laura's photo.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{reception}} was mixed, review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} rating of 55%, based on a sample of 221 reviews; the site's consensus reading [...] "It's more entertaining than many sequels, but with Oliver Stone directing, a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should be better," [...] for comparison, Wall Street (1987) had achieved a 78% positive rating. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News awarded it five out of five stars {{saying that it is}} a sharp sequel that is worthy of its investment. He also saluted the cast's performance and noted that Douglas gives Gekko [...] "uncounted layers as he fakes, deals and fuels fire". Matthew Toomey of Australia's 612 ABC Radio Brisbane gave it a B-rating and said that Douglas is the film's [...] "biggest positive", finding LaBeouf to be unconvincing in his role. Christy Lemire, in The Canadian Press, claimed that the film ultimately [...] "goes soft and loses its way" [...] and described the contrast in its final scenes as being [...] "laughable". Furthermore, the subplot between LaBeouf and Mulligan's characters as unneeded and pointed out that their relationship leads viewers to wonder why Winnie, who despises Gekko, would be involved with a man who does <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as him, which she condemns; however, Lemire acknowledged that the movie is an uncommon sequel that seems to be both relevant and necessary and said that it proves that [...] "greed can still be good". Film critic Colin Newton of the Brisbane Sunday Mail felt that the plot lacked the enthusiasm of the first film. Along the same lines, Village Voice contributor Nick Pinkerton pointed out that the Wall Street sequel did not have the [...] "clean, fable-like arc" [...] formula of its predecessor.|$|E

To determine these distances, also called depths, from a pair of images is called the stereo problem. Figure 1 : Stereo pair. As is almost always the case in this area, the human vision excels at the task of depth estimation. Stereo is not the only cue to do this, however.

50|$|Similarly to the Lego study, Clark {{examined}} {{the differences in}} understanding and compliance between addressees and overhearers. In an experiment where one person told another person how to arrange 12 complex figures and a third person listened in, and all began the conversation as strangers with equal background information. Nevertheless, addressees were more accurate at following the directions and arranging the figures than the overhearers even though they heard <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things.</b> From this, Clark concluded that the social process of interacting in conversation plays {{a central role in}} the cognitive process of understanding. If hearing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> words were enough to understand the directions, addresses and overhearers would have performed similarly. Since they did not, there is cause to conclude that understanding is part of a collaborative process. The process of grounding in a conversation happens at the point where both A and B find a perspective they can agree on. If C, the overhearer, understands this perspective then he keeps up; if he does not, then he is left behind. Since he’s an overhearer, his understanding does not affect whether A and B continue on, and while they continue to build common ground for the remainder of the conversation, C is not following or understanding them.|$|R
