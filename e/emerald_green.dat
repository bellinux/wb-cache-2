5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was perched atop a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an <b>emerald</b> <b>green</b> dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of the housing community was the development of a 27-hole golf course, the Carrollwood Village Golf and Country Club. This course entertained some Senior PGA tournaments in the 1980s. The club changed names three times - first to the Country Club of Carrollwood in 2001, then to <b>Emerald</b> <b>Greens</b> Golf Resort & Country Club in 2003, then to Carrollwood Country Club in 2013. As <b>Emerald</b> <b>Greens,</b> all holes on the course were renovated or redesigned, a new club house and recreation center were built, along with Condos, Vacation Villas, resurfaced tennis courts and a new pool area. The name changed to Carrollwood Country Club to preserve the original history of the club, opening in the 1970s.|$|R

2500|$|... – Given the {{observations}} {{of a lot of}} <b>green</b> <b>emeralds,</b> someone using a common language will inductively infer that all <b>emeralds</b> are <b>green</b> (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time t).|$|R
5000|$|Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the {{subjective}} notion of similarity. Two <b>green</b> <b>emeralds</b> are usually considered more similar than two grue ones {{if only one}} of them is green. Observing a <b>green</b> <b>emerald</b> makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a <b>green</b> <b>emerald)</b> next time. <b>Green</b> <b>emeralds</b> are a natural kind, but grue emeralds are not. Quine investigates [...] "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind". Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. identity, negation, disjunction. However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to similarity or kind; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.|$|R

25|$|Textile {{fragments}} consisted {{primarily of}} cotton yarns {{that were in}} natural shades, from white to dark brown, but others were colored in deep reds and two shades of blue.

25|$|Most floats are {{shades of}} green {{because that is the}} color of glass from {{recycled}} sake bottles (especially after long exposure to sunlight). However, clear, amber, aquamarine, amethyst, blue and other colors were also produced. The most prized and rare color is a red or cranberry hue. These were expensive to make because gold was used to produce the color. Other brilliant tones such as <b>emerald</b> <b>green,</b> cobalt blue, purple, yellow and orange were primarily made in the 1920s and 30s. The majority of the colored floats available for sale today are replicas.|$|E
5000|$|Hempel's {{confirmation}} theory {{argued that}} {{the solution is to}} differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and evidence statements, which apply to only one thing. Goodman's famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate grue, which applies to all things examined before a certain time t just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time t. If we examine emeralds before time t and find that <b>emerald</b> a is <b>green,</b> <b>emerald</b> b is <b>green,</b> and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all <b>emeralds</b> are <b>green.</b> However, <b>emeralds</b> a, b, c,..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue. Thus, before time t, the apparently law-like statements [...] "All emeralds are green" [...] and [...] "All emeralds are grue" [...] are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously [...] "All emeralds are grue" [...] is not a law-like statement.|$|R

25|$|Tourmalines have a {{very complex}} {{chemistry}} that can be described by a general formula XY3Z6(BO3)3T6O18V3W. The T6O18 is the basic ring structure, where T is usually Si4+, but substitutable by Al3+ or B3+. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al2Be3Si6O18, whose varieties include the gemstones <b>emerald</b> (<b>green)</b> and aquamarine (bluish). Cordierite is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.|$|E
25|$|Elements from Ozma of Oz and the {{previous}} novel, The Marvelous Land of Oz, were incorporated into the 1985 film Return to Oz, featuring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy. Although most of the plot was taken from Ozma, the action was chiefly relocated to the derelict Emerald City, ruled by Princess Mombi (Princess Langwidere in all but name, as well as keeping Ozma as her slave) and her Wheelers. In {{the second half of}} the film, Dorothy, Billina, Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump traveled to the Nome King's mountain, to rescue the Scarecrow from the King's ornament collection, which were <b>emerald</b> <b>green</b> unlike the book’s royal purple. The 1939 film's famous ruby slippers were used in place of the magic belt.|$|E
25|$|When a Parramatta District Club {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1936, the colours put {{forward to the}} New South Wales Rugby League by the District were <b>emerald</b> <b>green</b> and white, as these were the colours worn by the Western Districts President’s Cup side and the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club. However, when the proposal for a Parramatta club was next put to the NSWRL in 1946, the proposed colours for the new District side were blue and gold. These colours {{are said to have}} been selected based on the navy, sky blue and gold colours used by Arthur Phillip High School. These colours were also adopted by the Parramatta District Rugby Union club in 1936 and also suggested in Parramatta City Council’s use of livery of blue and golden-orange in their crest. While this colour scheme has remained consistent throughout the history of the club, the shades of blue and gold have changed several times.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} Roman glass follows Hellenistic {{traditions and}} uses strongly coloured and ‘mosaic’ patterned glass. During the late Republican period new highly coloured striped wares with {{a fusion of}} dozens of monochrome and lace-work strips were introduced. During this period {{there is some evidence}} that styles of glass varied geographically, with the translucent coloured fine wares of the early 1st century notably ‘western’ in origin, whilst the later colourless fine wares are more ‘international’. These objects also represent the first with a distinctly Roman style unrelated to the Hellenistic casting traditions on which they are based, and are characterised by novel rich colours. ‘Emerald’ green, dark or cobalt blue, a deep blue-green and Persian or ‘peacock’ blue are most commonly associated with this period, and other colours are very rare. Of these, <b>Emerald</b> <b>green</b> and peacock blue were new colours introduced by the Romano-Italian industry and almost exclusively associated with the production of fine wares.|$|E
25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them <b>emerald</b> <b>green,</b> then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel {{in front of the fireplace}} and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the city}} limits, {{the density of}} residences {{surrounding}} the highway rapidly increases as the terrain flattens. The highway intersects Mapleward Road, then diverges from the power transmission lines and curves southeast into suburban Thunder Bay. It meets Secondary Highway 589 after passing the <b>Emerald</b> <b>Greens</b> Golf Course. The route then travels through North McIntyre, formerly a separate community which was annexed. It descends through a wide muskeg, after which it is crossed by several power transmission lines. The highway enters urban Thunder Bay immediately thereafter, where it passes {{to the west of}} County Fair Mall before ending at an intersection with the Thunder Bay Expressway.
