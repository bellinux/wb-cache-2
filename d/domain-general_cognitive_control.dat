40|$|What role does <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> play in {{understanding}} linguistic input? Although much evidence {{has suggested that}} <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> and working memory resources are sometimes recruited during language comprehension, many aspects of this relationship remain elusive. For example, how frequently do cognitive control mechanisms get engaged when we understand language? And is this engagement necessary for successful comprehension? I here a) review recent brain imaging evidence for the neural separability of the brain regions that support high-level linguistic processing vs. those that support <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> abilities; b) define the space of possibilities {{for the relationship between}} these sets of brain regions; and c) review the available evidence that constrains these possibilities to some extent. I argue that we should stop asking whether <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms play a role in language comprehension, and instead focus on characterizing the division of labor between the cognitive control brain regions and the more functionally specialized language regions...|$|E

40|$|Controlling {{multiple}} languages during speech {{production is}} believed to rely on functional mechanisms that are (at least partly) shared with <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> in early, highly proficient bilinguals. Recent neuroimaging results have indeed suggested {{a certain degree of}} neural overlap between language control and nonverbal cognitive control in bilinguals. However, this evidence is only indirect. Direct evidence for neural overlap between language control and nonverbal cognitive control can only be provided if two prerequisites are met: language control and nonverbal cognitive control should be compared within the same subjects and the task requirements of both conditions should be closely matched. To provide such direct evidence for the first time, we used fMRI to examine the overlap in brain activation between switch-specific activity in a linguistic switching task and a closely-matched non-linguistic switching task, within participants, in early, high proficient Spanish-Basque bilinguals. The current findings provide direct evidence that in these bilinguals, highly similar brain circuits are involved in language control and <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{literature}} on bilingualism, a lively debate has arisen {{about the long-term}} effects of bilingualism on cognition and the brain. These studies yield inconsistent results, in part because they rely on comparisons between bilingual and monolingual control groups that may also differ on other variables. In the present neuroimaging study, we adopted a longitudinal design, assessing the long-term anatomical and cognitive effects of an extreme form of bilingualism, namely simultaneous interpreting. We compared a group of students starting interpreting training with a closely matched group of translators, before and after nine months of training. We assessed behavioral performance and neural activity during <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> tasks, as well as the structural connectivity between brain regions that are involved in <b>cognitive</b> <b>control.</b> Despite the lack of behavioral {{differences between the two groups}} over time, functional and structural neural differences did arise. At the functional level, interpreters showed an increase of activation in the right angular gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus in two nonverbal <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> tasks (the Simon task and a colour-shape switch task), relative to the translators. At the structural level, we identified a significant increment of the structural connectivity in two different subnetworks specifically for the interpreters. The first network, the frontal-basal ganglia subnetwork, has been related to <b>domain-general</b> and language-specific <b>cognitive</b> <b>control.</b> The second subnetwork, in which the cerebellum and the SMA play a key role, has recently also been proposed as an important language control network. These results suggest that interpreters undergo plastic changes in specific control-related brain networks to handle the extreme language control that takes place during interpreter training...|$|R
40|$|Age {{differences}} in 2 components of task-set switching speed were investigated in 118 adults aged 20 to 80 years using task-set homogeneous (e. g., AAAA [...] .) and task-set heterogeneous (e. g., AABBAABB [...] .) blocks. General switch costs {{were defined as}} latency differences between heteroge-neous and homogeneous blocks, whereas pecific switch costs were defined as differences between switch and nonswitch trials within heterogeneous blocks. Both types of costs generalized over verbal, figural, and numeric stimulus materials; were more highly correlated to fluid than to crystallized abilities; and were not eliminated after 6 sessions of practice, indicating that they reflect basic and <b>domain-general</b> aspects of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control.</b> Most important, age-associated increments in costs were significantly greater for general than for specific switch costs, suggesting {{that the ability to}} efficiently maintain and coordinate 2 alternating task sets in working memory instead of 1 is more negatively affected by advancing age than the ability to execute the task switch itself. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>control</b> processes are generally seen as responsible for the regulation and organization of behavioral activity (Baddeley, 1986; Norman & Shallice, 1986). Influenced by the neuropsycho-logical research tradition, developmental researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> processes for the regulation of behavior and in their relationship to age-related decrements in fluid intelligence or the mechanics of cog-nition (e. g., Baltes, 1993). Theoretical considerations about aging models of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> are dominated by the frontal lobe hypothesis of aging, which assumes that age-related ecline in intellectual functioning is associated with age-based changes in the frontal lobe (Dempster, 1992; Duncan, 1995; Prull, Gabrieli, & Bunge, in press).

40|$|International audienceWhether bilinguals {{perform better}} than monolinguals in non-linguistic {{cognitive}} control tasks {{is a matter}} of current debate. Bilinguals are constantly required to switch and discriminate between their two languages. Such additional discrimination requirements are thought to result in improved <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> abilities compared to monolinguals. This rationale was examined by taking it one step further. A general link between general response selection (i. e., cognitive control mechanisms) and word selection should be apparent within the monolingual population, thus the natural variability present in response discrimination abilities should predict word selection in a population of monolinguals. A large group of young monolingual pupils were tested in the non-linguistic Simon task and in a picture naming word selection task. Selection difficulty was manipulated in both tasks. There were clear effects of response selection difficulty in either task, but there was no relationship between them at the individual level. This null effect provides no support for the hypothesis tested. It prompts a tentative discussion of exactly what process, in bilingual language use, may be capable of promoting cognitive control abilities...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{interpretation}} {{is a complex}} cognitive task that not only demands multilingual language processing, but also requires application of extreme levels of <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control.</b> We used MRI to longitudinally measure cortical thickness in simultaneous interpretation trainees before and after a Master's program in conference interpreting. We compared them to multilingual control participants scanned at the same interval of time. Increases in cortical thickness were specific to trainee interpreters. Increases were observed in regions involved in lower-level, phonetic processing (left posterior superior temporal gyrus, anterior supramarginal gyrus and planum temporale), in the higher-level formulation of propositional speech (right angular gyrus) and in the conversion of items from working memory into a sequence (right dorsal premotor cortex), and finally, in domain-general executive control and attention (right parietal lobule). Findings {{are consistent with the}} linguistic requirements of simultaneous interpretation and also with the more general cognitive demands on attentional control for expert performance in simultaneous interpreting. Our findings may also reflect beneficial, potentially protective effects of simultaneous interpretation training, which has previously been shown to confer enhanced skills in certain executive and attentional domains over and above those conferred by bilingualism...|$|E

Children (n 279, mean age 7. 59 years) were assessed on 7 <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> resources as well as arithmetic calculations and word problems at start of 2 nd grade and on calculations, word problems, and pre-algebraic knowledge at end of 3 rd grade. Multilevel path analysis, controlling for instructional effects associated with the sequence of classrooms in which students were nested across Grades 2 – 3, indicated arithmetic calculations and word problems are foundational to pre-algebraic knowledge. Also, results revealed direct contributions of nonverbal reasoning and oral language to pre-algebraic knowledge, beyond indirect effects that are mediated via arithmetic calculations and word problems. By contrast, attentive behavior, phonological processing, and processing speed contributed to pre-algebraic knowl-edge only indirectly via arithmetic calculations and word problems...|$|R

40|$|Two domain-specific {{quantity}} {{systems have}} been proposed; the “Precise Number System” for small precise numerical representations, and the “Approximate Number System” for imprecise numerical representations (Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004). The efficiency of these systems has been individually associated with numerical competence (Mazzocco, Feigenson, & Halberda, 2011; Schleifer & Landerl, 2011). Phonological awareness and VSSP functioning are <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> skills which {{have been shown to}} contribute to distinct aspects of early numerical competence (Krajewski & Schneider, 2009; LeFevre et al., 2010). Krajewski and Schneider’s model (2009) proposes three distinct developmental levels of early number skills; phonological awareness contributes to basic verbal number skills (Level I) while VSSP functioning and quantitative skills contribute to quantity to number-word linkage (Level II) and to early arithmetic skills (Level III). This thesis examines the longitudinal and independent contributions that domain-specific and <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> skills make to early number skills and to two standardised mathematical attainment measures. Verbal, visuo-spatial and quantitative skills were assessed in 129 children at the start of Reception Year. Precise quantity discrimination skills predicted performance and growth in children’s ability to count objects (Level II), approximate quantity discrimination skills predicted performance and growth in reciting the number-word sequence (Level I) and the two <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> skills predicted performance and growth in performing simple arithmetic skills (Level III) over an eighteen-month period. Also, approximate quantity discrimination skills, phonological awareness and VSSP functioning predicted performance in both mathematical attainment measures over a six-month period. However VSSP functioning predicted performance and growth in a specific mathematical attainment measure over an eighteen-month period. Each cognitive skill seems to have a circumscribed role as a precursor of specific later number skills. This suggests that identifying deficits in these cognitive skills and designing targeted-intervention programmes for children in the very early stages of schooling could prevent later general mathematical deficits...|$|R
40|$|Recent neurofunctional studies {{suggested}} that lateral prefrontal cortex is a <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> area modulating computation of social information. Neuropsychological evidence reported dissociations between {{cognitive and affective}} components of social cog-nition. Here, we tested whether performance on social cognitive and affective tasks can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cor-tex (DLPFC). To this aim, we compared the effects of tDCS on explicit recognition of emo-tional facial expressions (affective task), and on one cognitive task assessing the ability to adopt another person’s visual perspective. In a randomized, cross-over design, male and female healthy participants performed the two experimental tasks after bi-hemispheric tDCS (sham, left anodal/right cathodal, and right anodal/left cathodal) applied over DLPFC. Results showed that only in male participants explicit recognition of fearful facial expres-sions was significantly faster after anodal right/cathodal left stimulation with respect to anod-al left/cathodal right and sham stimulations. In the visual perspective taking task, instead, anodal right/cathodal left stimulation negatively affected {{both male and female}} participants’ tendency to adopt another’s point of view. These findings demonstrated that concurrent fa-cilitation of right and inhibition of left lateral prefrontal cortex can speed-up males ’ responses to threatening faces whereas it interferes with the ability to adopt another’s viewpoint inde-pendently from gender. Thus, stimulation of cognitive control areas can lead to different ef-fects on social cognitive skills depending on the affective vs. cognitive nature of the task, and on the gender-related differences in neural organization of emotion processing...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive control {{mechanisms}} allow {{individuals to}} behave adaptively {{in the face}} of complex and sometimes conflicting information. Although the neural bases of these controlmechanisms have been examined inmany contexts, almost no {{attention has been paid to}} their role in resolving conflicts between competing social cues, which is surprising given that cognitive conflicts are part of many social interactions. Evidence about the neural processing of social information suggests that two systems—the mirror neuron system (MNS) and mental state attribution system (MSAS) —are specialized for processing nonverbal and contextual social cues, respectively. This could support a model of social cognitive conflict resolution in which competition between social cues would recruit <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms, which in turn would bias processing toward the MNS or MSAS. Such biasing could also alter social behaviors, such as inferences made about the internal states of others. We tested this model by scanning participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they drew inferences about the social targets ’ emotional states based on congruent or incongruent nonverbal and contextual social cues. Conflicts between social cues recruited the anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex, brain areas associated with domain-general control processes. This activation was accompanied by biasing of neural activity toward areas in the MNS or MSAS, which tracked, respectively, with perceivers ’ behavioral reliance on nonverbal or contextual cues when drawing inferences about targets ’ emotions. Together, these data provide evidence about both domain-general and domain-specificmechanisms involved in resolving social cognitive conflicts...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Test a {{hierarchical}} model of sequential movement control, which assumes one active chunk {{at a time}} and latencies reflecting the additive contributions of four control levels: (a) switching between chunks, (b) updating and initiating the currently active chunk, (c) resolving ambiguities within active chunks, and (d) implementing unambiguous transitions between successive movements. Determine which processes change with skill level (musical training), which are sensitive to aging, and how age and skill interact. Methods During 8 sessions young and older novices and amateur pianists performed unimanual 4 -finger sequences at their maximum tempos. Within each trial two patterns alternated according to a pre-specified AABB schema requiring preplanned switches between chunks. Degree of ambiguity between alternating patterns and positions at which differences occurred were systematically varied. Results Skill advantages were substantial at the two lowest control levels, within-chunk control and implementation, At the same time differences between novices and amateur pianists were basically absent for the chunk switching component. Although older novices had a higher tapping rate with individual or pairs of fingers, their sequencing speed was lower than that of young novices and, hardly faster than that of older novices after training. Conclusions The model provides a reasonable account of the data. At least at the level of amateur skills, <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> processes remain a critical factor producing age effects that can outweigh acquired skill. In line with extant models of expertise amateur musicians' showed superior sequencing skills at domain-specific levels, some of which are maintained with age. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Earlier work on existential {{agreement}} {{variation in}} British English and Caribbean Spanish {{has made a}} convincing case for the hypothesis that existential agreement variation is constrained by three <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> constraints on language (production) that are assumed in Cognitive Linguistics: markedness of coding, statistical preemption, and structural priming. A corollary of this analysis {{is that the same}} constraints should also be able to account for the behavior of other morphosyntactic alternations. To explore this hypothesis, I perform a case study of a well known, but notoriously hard to model alternation: subject pronoun expression in Cuban Spanish.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that the native {{language}} influences foreign word recognition and that this influence is modulated by the proficiency in the nonnative language. Here we explored how the degree of reliance on cross-language similarity (as measured by the cognate facilitation effect) together with other <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> factors contribute to reading comprehension achievement in a nonnative language at different stages of the learning process. We tested two groups of native speakers of Spanish learning English at elementary and intermediate levels in an academic context. A regression model approach showed that <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> skills are good predictors of second language reading achievement independently of the level of proficiency. Critically, we found that individual differences in the degree of reliance on the native language predicted foreign language reading achievement, showing a markedly different pattern between proficiency groups. At lower levels of proficiency the cognate facilitation effect was positively related with reading achievement, while this relation became negative at intermediate levels of foreign language learning. We conclude that the link between native- and foreign-language lexical representations helps participants at initial stages of the learning process, whereas it is no longer the case at intermediate levels of proficiency, when reliance on cross-language similarity is inversely related to successful nonnative reading achievement. Thus, at intermediate levels of proficiency strong and direct mappings from the nonnative lexical forms to semantic concepts are needed to achieve good nonnative reading comprehension, in line with the premises of current models of bilingual lexico-semantic organization...|$|R
40|$|This review {{considers}} {{speaking in}} a second language {{from the perspective of}} motor-sensory control. Previous studies relating brain function to the prior acquisition of two or more languages (neurobilingualism) have investigated the differential demands made on linguistic representations and processes, and the role of <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> systems when speakers switch between languages. In contrast to the detailed discussions on these higher functions, typically articulation is considered only as an underspecified stage of simple motor output. The present review considers {{speaking in a}} second language in terms of the accompanying foreign accent, which places demands on the integration of motor and sensory discharges not encountered when articulating in the most fluent language. We consider why there has been so little emphasis on this aspect of bilingualism to date, before turning to the motor and sensory complexities involved in learning to speak a second language as an adult. This must involve retuning the neural circuits involved in the motor control of articulation, to enable rapid unfamiliar sequences of movements to be performed with the goal of approximating, as closely as possible, the speech of a native speaker. Accompanying changes in motor networks is experience-dependent plasticity in auditory and somatosensory cortices to integrate auditory memories of the target sounds, copies of feedforward commands from premotor and primary motor cortex and post-articulatory auditory and somatosensory feedback. Finally, we consider the implications of taking a motor-sensory perspective on speaking a second language, both pedagogical regarding non-native learners and clinical regarding speakers with neurological conditions such as dysarthria...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigated}} whether an intensive computerised, home-based therapy programme could improve phonological discrimination ability in 19 {{patients with chronic}} post-stroke aphasia. One skill specifically targeted by the treatment demonstrated an improvement due to the therapy. However, this improvement did not generalise to untreated items, and was only effective for participants without a lesion involving the frontal lobe, indicating a potentially important role for this region in determining outcome of aphasia therapy. Complementary functional imaging studies investigated activity in domain-general and domain-specific networks in both patients and healthy volunteers during listening and repeating simple sentences. One important consideration when comparing a patient group with a healthy population is the difference in task difficulty encountered by the two groups. Increased cognitive effort {{can be expected to}} increase activity in domain-general networks. I minimised the effect of this confound by manipulating task difficulty for the healthy volunteers to reduce their behavioural performance so that it was comparable to that of the patients. By this means I demonstrated that the activation patterns in domain-general regions were very similar in the two groups. Region-of-interest analysis demonstrated that activity within a domain-general network, the salience network, predicted residual language function in the patients with aphasia, even after accounting for lesion volume and their chronological age. I drew two broad conclusions from these studies. First, that computer-based rehabilitation can improve disordered phonological discrimination in chronic aphasia, but that lesion distribution may influence the response to this training. Second, that the ability to activate <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> regions influences outcome in aphasia. This allows me to propose that in future work, therapeutic strategies, pharmacological or behavioural, targeting domain-general brain systems, may benefit aphasic stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|Cognitive control, or {{executive}} function (EF), {{refers to the}} mental ability to regulate and adjust behavior across domains {{in the face of}} interference, conflict, or new rules. Evidence from psycholinguistics suggests a role for cognitive control in a range of language processing tasks including syntactic ambiguity resolution and verbal fluency. Separate work demonstrates that EF abilities are malleable with extensive practice, such that training improvements transfer across domains to novel tasks that rely on the same underlying EF mechanisms (an effect dubbed 'process-specificity'). In uniting these two growing literatures, this dissertation investigated the (causal) role of cognitive control for language processing through two longitudinal training interventions. In one study, I demonstrated that practicing a battery of cognitive tasks conferred selective benefits on untrained reading tasks requiring syntactic ambiguity resolution. Compared to controls, individuals who responded most to an EF training task exhibited (1) higher accuracy to comprehension questions indexing offline reinterpretation, and (2) faster real-time recovery efforts to resolve among conflicting interpretations. A second experiment extended these findings by addressing the degree to which training on a single EF task was necessary and sufficient to confer transfer to untrained, related language measures. Participants were assigned to practice a single training task that was minimally different from other training groups' tasks in terms of EF demands. By and large, participants who practiced a high-EF training task were exclusive in demonstrating a cross-assessment improvement profile consistent with a process-specific account: Pre/post benefits across a range of ostensibly different linguistic (verbal fluency, syntactic ambiguity resolution) and non-linguistic (Stroop, recognition memory) tasks were observed selectively for conditions with high-EF demands; no benefits were seen for cases when the need for cognitive control was minimized. Together, these findings provide support for the malleability of EF skills and suggest a critical (and perhaps causal) role for <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> in language processing. Further, the present studies indicate that within the right framework, and having appropriate linking hypotheses, cognitive training may be a viable way to improve language use...|$|E
40|$|Children {{learn their}} {{earliest}} words through social interaction, {{but it is}} unknown how much they rely on social information. Some theories argue that word learning is fundamentally social from its outset, with even the youngest infants understanding intentions and using them to infer a social partner’s target of reference. In contrast, other theories argue that early word learning is largely a perceptual process in which young children map words onto salient objects. One way of unifying these accounts is to model word learning as weighted cue combination, in which children attend to many potential cues to reference, but only gradually learn the correct weight to assign each cue. We tested four predictions {{of this kind of}} na€ıve cue combination account, using an eye-tracking paradigm that combines social word teaching and two-alternative forced-choice testing. None of the predictions were supported. We thus propose an alternative unifying account: children are sensitive to social information early, but their ability to gather and deploy this information is constrained by <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> processes. Developmental changes in children’s use of social cues emerge not from learning the predictive power of social cues, but from the gradual development of attention, memory, and speed of information processing.

Then, we analyze the geographic distribution of haber pluralization in Peninsular Spanish. The results show that haber is pluralized in 11 % (N= 611 / 5, 500) of the cases. The mixed-effects logistic regression analysis supports that nouns which can easily be imagined as starting points of a series of events, the absence of negation, and verb tenses other than the preterit favor pluralization. To explore the geographic distribution of haber pluralization in Peninsular Spanish, we use a generalized additive mixed model, which generates a line that runs approximately from Lérida in the north of Spain to Almería in the south, crossing Teruel and Albacete. East of that line, the pluralized variant has a higher probability of occurrence, but it is not absent from other areas of the Peninsula.

40|$|Remembering {{previously}} experienced {{events can}} happen {{as a result}} of an effortful retrieval attempt. At other occasions, a memory can enter our minds without any apparent effort – or, indeed, intention - to retrieve. Although it has long been appreciated that retrieval from episodic memory is intertwined with cognitive control, the neural mechanisms of memory-control interactions remain unclear. In this thesis I have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERP) to study the neural basis of episodic retrieval at varying levels of cognitive control. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been suggested to support a cognitive control mechanism (context processing) which is relevant during various situations that demand maintenance of current goals and rules. Although increased dlPFC recruitment with increasing context processing demands has been demonstrated during episodic retrieval, there are relatively few studies directly comparing the engagement of dlPFC during episodic retrieval with that during other task domains. In Study I, context processing demands were amplified in episodic retrieval, auditory attention and emotion regulation tasks. This led to overlapping dlPFC recruitment in the first two domains and a divergent reliance on ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the emotion domain. Thus, when selection between competing representations needs to be carried out in accordance with the currently relevant goals and task rules, the episodic memory system interacts with <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms. Studies II and III explored the reactive nature of retrieval-specific control mechanisms: can we flexibly switch between semantic and episodic retrieval based on the information extracted from a retrieval cue? This was studied using a recognition memory task where the relevant information could with equal probability be supplied by the semantic or the episodic memory system. The fMRI results (Study II) showed that the brain activation during the ‘episodic’ but not the ‘semantic’ trials was expressed in the right prefrontal cortex. As the order of trials was unpredictable, the corresponding changes in brain activation might be evoked by differences in early cue-trace interactions. An event-related potential study (Study III) with the same experimental protocol as in Study II showed that neural processing corresponding to the two trial types diverged as early as in the time window 100 - 140 ms post-cue onset, thus highlighting the importance of early cue-trace matching in the selection of further retrieval processing. Study IV explored incidental episodic retrieval. Although this form of retrieval is a common experience in everyday life and a disturbing symptom in some psychiatric conditions, it is not clear how such spontaneous expressions of memory are initiated and to what extent the prefrontal cortex is engaged. The fMRI results showed, consistent with Study I, that dlPFC is specifically associated with the intention to retrieve, independently of success. Retrieval success engaged similar networks for incidentally as well as intentionally retrieved memories, comprising the hippocampus, precuneus, ventrolateral PFC, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Collectively, the fMRI and ERP results indicated that incidental retrieval was initiated by early (< 200 ms) oldness estimation carried out on the semantic information extracted from the retrieval cues. Taken together, the results of this thesis indicate that episodic retrieval can be initiated via two routes:  a bottom-up input rising early during the cue processing, and a top-down input provided by the cognitive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that anticipation {{is one of the best}} determinants of skill in numerous complex and dynamic domains, such as law enforcement, driving, aviation, surgery, and sport (for a review see Ward, Williams, & Hancock, 2006). Likewise, recognition ability has formed the cornerstone of much of the naturalistic decision making literature for the last 3 decades (e. g., Klein, Calderwood, & Clinton-Cirocco, 1986). In this research, we examined whether skill at anticipating the outcome of a dynamic situation would predict recognition skill, over and above <b>domain-general</b> measures of <b>cognitive</b> ability. We expected that domain-general cognition would account for some of the variance in recognition skill, but that anticipation skill would explain additional, unique variance. Counter to our expectations, anticipation skill did not explain significant unique variance. Instead, only one of the <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> measures—spatial ability—was predictive of recognition skill, suggesting that training for improvement in recognition skill should be skill-specific...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{considerable}} evidence that humans use the same mechanisms for linguistic and nonlinguistic cognition, the thesis of linguistic modularity will remain plausible so long as well-established formal properties of syntax remain unexplained in terms of <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> mechanisms. This paper presents several dualities between the formal structure of syntax and cognitive structures used to represent the physical world. These dualities are used to construct a cognitive model of syntactic parsing that uses only the mechanisms required for infant physical reasoning. The model demonstrates how a formal syntactic constraint, the ccommand condition on binding, {{can be explained by}} a cognitive process used in physical reasoning. Several consequences for language development and the doctrine of linguistic modularity are considered...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Cognitive</b> <b>control</b> {{impairments}} are {{hypothesized to}} underlie {{cognitive and affective}} features of depression, such as mood-congruent processing biases, rumination, and sustained negative affect. Prior research yielded only mixed evidence {{for the presence of}} general <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> impairments in depression and the idea of valence-specific reductions in <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> has been advocated. To date, the precise role of emotional information in determining the magnitude of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> impairments in task-performing is not fully understood. This study examined reduced internal <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> in elation to emotional information and task settings in clinical depression. Methods: Individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder and matched non/never-depressed control participants (N = 40) performed the Internal Shift Task (IST). This task measures internal <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> for both emotional and non-emotional information, here defined as switching between internally held mental representations requiring continuous updating in working memory. Results: Clinically depressed individuals demonstrated general switching impairments. These switching impairments were neither influenced by the task-settings for emotional information (taskrelevant, task-irrelevant) nor by the valence of the stimuli (angry, neutral) in the emotion condition. Moreover, this general switch cost correlated positively with rumination. Discussion: Our findings support the hypothesis that impaired <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is a feature of depression at more severe symptom levels. Interestingly, in the context of prior studies with the IST, the current results suggest that the nature of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> impairments depend on the depression severity. Whereas clinical symptom levels are associated with an overall reduction, specific relations between <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> for emotional information and rumination were observed in subclinical depression. Conclusion: The results of this study provide a better insight in the relation between depression, impaired internal <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> and rumination. Future research should examine <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> as a vulnerability factor underlying the etiology and maintenance of depression and treatment possibilities (e. g. <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> training) could be explored...|$|R
40|$|Performance in <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> tasks deteriorates {{when these}} tasks are {{performed}} {{together with other}} tasks that also require <b>cognitive</b> <b>control,</b> that is, if simultaneous <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is required. Surprisingly, this decrease in performance is also observed if tasks are preceded by other <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> tasks, that is, if sequential <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is required. The common explanation for the latter finding is that previous acts of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> deplete a common resource, just like a muscle becomes fatigued after repeated use. An alternative explanation however has also been put forward, namely that repeated acts of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> reduce the motivation to match allocated resources to required resources. In this paper we formalize these two accounts, the muscle and the motivation account, and show that they yield differential predictions on the interaction between simultaneous and sequential <b>cognitive</b> <b>control.</b> Such an interaction is not predicted by the muscle account, whereas it is predicted by the motivation account. These predictions were tested in a paradigm where participants had to perform a series of stop-signal tasks, these tasks varied both in their demands on simultaneous control and in their demands on sequential control. This paradigm, combined with a multilevel analysis, offered the possibility to test the differential predictions directly. Results of two studies indicate that an interaction between simultaneous and sequential <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is present. Therefore it is concluded that effects of sequential <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> are best explained by the motivation account...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine whether}} the {{variation}} patterns of haber pluralization (e. g., hubo/hubieron fiestas ‘there was/were parties’) in Peninsular Spanish corroborate the hypothesis elaborated in earlier work that the phenomenon constitutes a competition between two variants of the presentational construction with haber that is constrained by <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> constraints on spreading activation. In addition, this paper examines whether haber pluralization is incrementing in frequency in particular Peninsular regions {{and whether or}} not the phenomenon is spreading geographically. To meet these objectives, I analyze a dataset of more than 7, 500 cases of haber + plural NP, which were culled from two publicly available data sources: the Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Español Rural (which represents only rural speakers born before the 1940 s; Fernández-Ordóñez, 2005 -) and Twitter (which represents mainly young and middle-aged speakers). The results of a mixed-effects logistic regression analysis that tests the effects of tense, the absence/presence of negation, typical action- chain position of the noun, the regional origin of the examples, and the data sources support that haber pluralization constitutes a competition between two presentational haber constructions that is constrained by <b>domain-general</b> <b>cognitive</b> constraints on spreading activation. This model also supports that pluralized haber is spreading westward from its epicenters (Valencia, Barcelona, and Murcia), while also incrementing in frequency in northern, eastern and southern Spain. However, its frequency appears to be declining in central Spain. A geographically more detailed, but similar picture is obtained with three generalized additive mixed models that test the effects of geography on the total dataset as well as on each of the two subcorpora. status: accepte...|$|R
30|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>control</b> was {{originally}} developed in neuro-science and psychology (e.g., [14]). Recently, it {{has emerged as}} a new engineering discipline [15]. The application of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> was proposed by Professor Simon Haykin in 2012, and at present, <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is still in an early stage of development [16]. However, the concept of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> has been successfully applied on the cognitive radio and the cognitive radar [17]. For cognitive radio networks, the concept of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is widely used for multiuser sequential channel sensing and access [18]. For cognitive radar systems, the application of <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> shows good environmental interactivity and helps systems perceive the environment in an intelligent way and adaptively reacts [19]. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>control</b> can be adopted to provide intelligent strategies for reconfiguration of wireless networks for wireless systems and its surrounding environment [20]; it can use computational intelligence (CI) to deal with limitations of cross-layer design such as being limited to interactions between two or three layers and having to be completely redesigned if network requirements change. In robot engineering, <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> is proposed to develop more robust and better adapted robots, and it will be treated as a design tool to obtain the appropriate dynamics for bio-inspired real time systems [21]. For intelligent video surveillance systems, the <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> approach is applied to support human decisions through analysis of a huge amount of information which can help to detect densely populated areas [22]. As mentioned above, <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> can be applied in a variety of fields. In this paper, we take a <b>cognitive</b> <b>control</b> approach to interference mitigation considering the co-existence of CBTC systems and PISs.|$|R
