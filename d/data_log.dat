5|$|When {{accessing}} {{a previously}} visited region, the player {{appears in the}} location of their last visit. Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically saved when players enter the Historia Crux, {{as well as at}} key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of accessing stores at save points like in XIII, the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game <b>data</b> <b>log</b> provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII-2. When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not repeatable. The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game.|$|E

The need for accurate, robust and low-cost <b>data</b> <b>logging</b> solutions has become obvious as machine, process and product inspections are becoming critical issues.

Another set of hard drives is used for the index, which maps scores to addresses in the <b>data</b> <b>log.</b> The data structure used for the index is a hash table with fixed-sized buckets. Venti relies on the scores to be randomly distributed so buckets do not fill up. Since each lookup costs one disk seek time, an index usually consists of multiple hard drives with low access time.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to providing volumetric, mass and energy flow data, the gas flow computer also provides date and time, instantaneous, hourly and daily data. The gas flow computer typically stores date/time stamped volume records in RAM for up to 35 days {{in order to provide}} sufficient time for a host system to retrieve the records as well as to allow time for human intervention if this retrieval fails to occur. The flow computer generally tracks modifications to flow parameters (e.g. orifice plate size or gas analysis data) in an [...] "Audit Trail" [...] that identifies the modified parameter, the time and date of the value change, the old and new values, and may identify the person making the change. The <b>data</b> <b>log</b> format and contents vary slightly by flow computer manufacturer, with all manufacturers designing to a specification outlined by the American Petroleum Institute.|$|E
