40|$|Abstract: The {{competition}} is becoming truly global with <b>fragmented</b> <b>markets</b> and customers expecting {{to get the}} best product at the best price with immediate availability. Economic growth and future jobs are dependent on how present and future industry is able to transform new ideas into successful products and improved processes. The product itself is a smaller part of the complete offering to the customer, with branding, design, financing, services, smart products and other aspects becoming increasingly important. <b>Fragmented</b> <b>markets</b> stress the need for abilities to continuously adapt to new demands and to integrate new technologies. It is thus vital that companies develop innovative product development skills. There is a need to help industry to develop and implement new innovative methods and models that will support and strengthen industry to generate new ideas and realize these into successful products and improved processes. The objective of this paper is first to discuss and compare a “traditional ” engineering approach with an “innovation ” approach towards product development and second to combine these two approaches to new multi-scientific approach. 1...|$|R

While the Fox network, the previous destination for teen television (with shows such as Beverly Hills, 90210 and Parker Lewis Can't Lose), began to court older audiences with shows such as Ally McBeal, The WB began to craft its identity with programs targeted at teenagers. The network's breakout hit and, arguably, its signature series was Dawson's Creek, which debuted in January 1998 to what were then the highest ratings in the network's history (and made stars out of its four principal actors, James van der Beek, Michelle Williams, Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes). It quickly became the highest-rated show on television among teenage girls, and the most popular program on The WB. The popularity of Dawson helped boost the network's other shows, such as Buffy, which served as its lead-in on The WB's new night of programming that also launched in January 1998, branded as [...] "New Tuesday," [...] and 7th Heaven, which enjoyed a massive 81% increase in viewership that season.|$|E
