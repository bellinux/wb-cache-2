5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the series in which the production crew was able to use motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the Bounty Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E

5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the <b>few</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E

30|$|The {{first result}} {{emerging}} from Table  3 is that timing matters {{when dealing with}} lump sum schemes.

25|$|The general {{strength}} of the wartime army varied greatly depending {{on a number of}} factors: the authority of the king, the population of the territories he controlled, and the season of year.
