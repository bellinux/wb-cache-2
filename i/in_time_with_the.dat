5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|For example, in the 17th century, {{the solar}} cycle {{appeared}} to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum.

Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero Live is a {{music video}} game {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames {{and published by}} Activision. It was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in October 2015 and to iOS devices including Apple TV in November 2015.

5|$|The girl, near death, {{is being}} ministered to by paramedics, fantasizing and being 'sexually aroused {{by a large}} python and writhing on a bed that lit up <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music, while {{surrounded}} {{by a group of}} bemused, semi-naked dancers'. When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E

5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special game controller that includes a turntable surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the turntable controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions scroll down on screen towards the player <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each mix) to unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to Expert), with higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up {{to a maximum of}} four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to their}} extinction, the Wrangel Island mammoths had {{accumulated}} numerous genetic defects {{due to their}} small population, consistent {{with the concept of}} genomic meltdown; in particular, a number of genes for olfactory receptors and urinary proteins became nonfunctional, possibly because they had lost their selective value on the island environment. It is not clear whether these genetic changes contributed to their extinction. The disappearance coincides roughly <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first evidence for humans on the island. The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia (modern Alaska and Yukon) had similarly died out about 13,300 years ago, soon (roughly 1000 years) after the first appearance of humans in the area, which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene proboscids (mammoths, gomphotheres and mastodons), as well as {{most of the rest of}} the megafauna, of the Americas. In contrast, the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out prior to human arrival due to habitat shrinkage resulting from the post-ice-age sea-level rise, perhaps in large measure as a result of a consequent reduction in the freshwater supply.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E

5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep it <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E

25|$|Gain pumping, where {{a regular}} {{amplitude}} peak (such as a kick drum) causes {{the rest of}} the mix to change in volume due to the compressor, is generally avoided in music production. However, many dance and hip-hop musicians purposefully use this phenomenon, causing the mix to alter in volume rhythmically <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> beat.|$|E
25|$|Scramble bands (also {{referred}} to as 'Scatter' bands) are a variation on show bands.
