The results are then {{compared with a}} <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator</b> R of the magnetic field in the same magnetosheath region. It is shown that during disturbed periods with large transverse variations (low R level), the perturbation Poynting flux and the kinetic energy flux increase, and {{a significant portion of}} the fluxes consistently propagates toward the magnetopause. The Poynting flux of those fluctuations which consist of mainly compressional perturbations does not appear to propagate in any certain direction. The enthalpy flux of the perturbations does not propagate in any certain direction in any of the cases.

Aspect was not found to be a significant variable in predicting damage owing to complexity of topography and the cyclone wind field. Analysis of remotely sensed imagery indicated that only high damage levels could be reliably discerned. Areas of very rapid vegetation growth in severely damaged sites are most easily detected with vegetation indices based on both near infrared and short wave infrared data.

The open-land indicators (OF) in South Korea are F. japonica, C. japonicus, and Tetramorium casepitum (Kwon et al. [2011 b]). When these species were surveyed at seven metropolitan cities in South Korea, their abundance was consistently higher in open lands than in forests (T-SK unpublished data). In the present study, L. japonicus is determined as OF from FVF. Choi and Lee ([1999]) suggested eight species as urbanization indicators including these three species. Zettler et al. ([2004]) reported that after logging, ants of the genus Camponotus decrease. In the present study, C. japonicus responded slowly to the forest disturbance, compared with F. japonica. Terayama ([1997]) classified C. japonicus as an open-land specialist. In South Korea, C. japonicus occurs in forests and open lands {{and is expected to}} replace C. atrox inhabiting high mountains as global warming proceeds (Kwon et al. [2011 a]). Among the four open-land indicator species, F. japonica is the most reliable <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator,</b> because this species quickly and invariably increases after most kinds of forest disturbances such as wind falls, fire, thinning, and logging (Lee et al. [2012]; Kwon et al. [2013 a], [b]).|$|E

Secondary data was collected from surveys of 93 local youth attending community events in 2009 and 2010. Analysis sought to identify potential youth with severe emotional disturbance as measured by inordinate frequencies of heightened emotions and behaviors in response to anger. Mitigating factors such as gender, ethnicity, cultural engagement, substance abuse, {{and the number of}} parents in the home were examined. This study found that tribal affiliation, gender, Native American ethnicity, and cultural engagement were factors associated with differences in severe emotional <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators.</b> The survey measures were unable to be compared with existing normed assessments for severe emotional disturbance.

A total of 1078 individuals belonging to 14 species were captured with pitfall traps from June to September 1996 during 2568 day-trap. Abundance of Synuchus impunctatus Say was significantly higher in clear-cut compared with un-cut control strips. There were no within-species differences between selectively cut and uncut plots. None of these two silvicultural systems had any significant impacts on species diversity and richness 6 – 13 years after treatment. Although we observed an effect of strip clear-cutting on the abundance of S. impunctatus in this northern hardwood forest, {{the discrepancy between the}} response of carabids to forest disturbance in this study compared with other studies in differ-ent ecological regions suggests that the same carabid beetle species cannot be used as an indicator of forest disturbance over a large region. Our results suggest the use of carabid beetles as a <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator</b> at the ecological-type scale (relatively similar soil and forest type) in a given region.

40|$|In the {{tropical}} rain forest of Suriname the occurrence of eight test species, four pioneer and four climax species, was analyzed in a silvicultural field experiment about 20 years old, in three replications of treated forest plots in which 15, 23 and 46 m 3 had been extracted. Extraction levels 23 and 46 m 3 had been followed immediately by a light or heavy refinement. Actual research {{was done in the}} replicated plots of the experiment as well as in primary forest. All measurements were made in the vegetation layer of 3 - 10 m. In addition to this, total tree density, forest class (a classification used as <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator)</b> and palm and liana density were measured. Effects of the extraction and silviculture are still visible after 20 years, but all values of the measurements taken in the present research fall within the same range as that of virgin forest. Climax species are more abundant than pioneers throughout the entire experiment, regardless of treatment. Palm and liana densities, however, show contrasting effects to the severity of treatments in the three replications. It is indicated that natural heterogeneity and the forest's resilience to disturbance are greater than the treatment effects measured in this investigation 20 years later. Conclusion is that {{the tropical}} rain forest in Suriname, when treated with the Celos Silvicultural System, does not tend to regress to a more secondary forest as the original primary rain forest structure, composition and dynamics are largely maintained...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{indicators}} of soil restoration during secondary succession in a heterogeneous valley in the high tropical Andes. A combination of chronosequence and permanent plot methods was used to detect changes in this heterogeneous matrix. Thirty-six plots with different fallow times (1 – 9 years) and four noncultivated plots with natural vegetation (pa´ramo) were sampled twice in a 3 -year interval (1996 and 1999). The following soil properties were determined: total C and N, pH, exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity, and microbial biomass N (MB-N). Using the chronosequence approach, successional increases in soil pH and Mg were detected, pointing to these variables as indicators of soil restoration during the fallow period. Comparing the noncultivated pa´ramo with the fallow plots, a significant decrease in MB-N was found, suggesting that this is a sensitive agricultural <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator.</b> The permanent plot analysis failed to detect successional trends in any of the study variables, probably as a result of a lack of sensitivity of the indicators used within the 3 -year interval. Nevertheless, a strong acidification was detected by the permanent plot method when fallow plots were cultivated. We conclude that the size of important soil components such as total soil organic matter or microbial biomass is not a sensitive soil restoration indicator in these heterogeneous mountain systems but that other integrative variables such as pH could be more sensitive to successional changes in key soil processes (e. g., nitrification or nutrient losses). 619 - 628 lsarmien@ula. vellambi@ula. v...|$|E

40|$|In the Brazilian Amazon, {{multiple}} logging {{activities are}} undergoing, involving different actors and interests. They shape a disturbance gradient {{bound to the}} intensity and frequency of logging, and forest management techniques. However, until now, {{few studies have been}} carried out at the landscape scale taking into account these multiple types of logging and this disturbance gradient. Here we address this issue of how to account for the multiple logging activities shaping the current forest landscape. We developed an inexpensive and efficient remote sensing methodology based on Landsat imagery to detect and track logging activity based on the monitoring of canopy openings. Then, we implemented a set of remote sensing indicators to follow the different trajectories of forest disturbance through time. Using these indicators, we emphasized five major spatial and temporal disturbance patterns occurring in the municipality of Paragominas (State of Pará, Brazilian Amazon), from well-managed forests to highly over-logged forests. Our <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators</b> provide observable evidence for the difference between legal and illegal patterns, with some illegal areas having suffered more than three explorations in fifteen years. They also clearly underlined the efficiency of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) techniques applied under Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) guidelines to reduce the logging impacts in terms of canopy openings. For these reasons, we argue the need to promote legal certified logging to conserve forests, as without them, many actors mine the forest resources without any concerns for future stocks. Finally, our remote tracking methodology, which produces easy to interpret <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators,</b> could be a real boon to forest managers, including for conservationists working in protected areas and stakeholders dealing with international trade rules such as RBUE (Wood regulation of European Union) or FLEGT (Forest Law for Enforcement, Governance and Trade) ...|$|R

40|$|Tropical {{seagrass}} {{ecosystems are}} highly productive and important for sustaining marine life and associated coastal societies. In this study, {{the diversity and}} role of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria associated with five common seagrass genera in coastal regions of the western Indian Ocean (WIO; Tanzania) were examined, {{as well as the}} impact of anthropogenic activities. Cyanobacteria were characterized morphologically and genetically (16 S rRNA and nifH gene phylogeny), as were diel variations in nifH gene expression, NifH protein levels and nitrogenase activity. The results revealed that WIO seagrass beds supported rich cyanobacterial diversity and that these represented approx. 83 % of total clones obtained (DNA and RNA nifH clone libraries). Non-heterocystous genera, such as Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Leptolyngbya, Phormidium and Microcoleus dominated, while heterocystous morphotypes such as Calothrix were less frequent and unicellular morphotypes (e. g. Gloeocapsa, Chroococcus and Chroococcidiopsis) were few. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis revealed several novel uncharacterized cyanobacterial clades. Cyanobacterial composition and nitrogenase activity varied over seasons and between the seagrass species. Day time nitrogenase activity originated primarily from heterocystous phylotypes, while non-heterocystous filamentous phylotypes fixed nitrogen at night. The highest activity in the diel cycle was 358 ± 232 nmol C 2 H 4 g- 1 h- 1 at 09. 00 associated with epiphytes of the seagrass Cymodocea. Nitrogenase activity was consistently lower in anthropogenically disturbed (eutrophication) seagrass sites. Such data suggest that diazotrophic cyanobacteria may be a significant source of ‘new’ nitrogen in the often oligotrophic coastal regions of tropical oceans. It is also proposed that the rapid shifts in the cyanobacterial population and function found may also be used as early <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator</b> in coastal management practices.

Grazing is a disturbance that removes plant biomass through herbivory, while overgrazing {{is a more}} severe disturbance that can deplete plant propagule pools and inhibit plant community recovery. We tested the hypothesis that riparian vegetation communities can shift quickly from ruderal grasslands to hydrophytic shrubs and graminoids when grazing is largely eliminated from riparian areas. We used a before-after-control study design to collect vegetation community data at six restored reaches and two grazed control reaches prior to and immediately following {{the construction of a}} cattle exclosure. We identified trends in Carex and Salix species abundance and quantified shifts in riparian vegetation community composition across time at each reach using PERMANOVA, multi-level pattern analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Vegetation composition changed rapidly in the four years following removal of grazing <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Indicator</b> species for all impact reaches shifted away from grazing tolerant graminoids and forbs, and toward hydrophytic graminoid and shrub species. Over the same timespan control reach indicator species remained grazing-tolerant graminoids and forbs. There was little change in Salix abundance over time at control or impact reaches but Carex abundance increased at restored reaches. We conclude that herbaceous plant communities may recover rapidly following the removal of grazing disturbance, but that woody species may lag in recovery without active vegetation manipulation. We postulate that low woody-species recruitment may affect the potential of the riparian zone to quickly shade stream channels and facilitate undercut bank formation, common riparian restoration objectives. To prevent halted riparian succession, designers should proactively identify potential limitations to woody vegetation colonization. We close discussing active approaches to overcome stalled riparian ecosystem development and suggest metrics for assessing woody species recovery. Includes supplemental file...|$|E

We recorded the vegetation composition and measured biotic and abiotic soil characteristics of the sites.

The successfully restored fields were intermediate. The composition of the nematode community tended to follow the same pattern. In the pot experiment, addition of soilorganisms increased the biomass of A. dioica, N. stricta and D. flexuosa, but decreased the biomass of A. capillaris.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} describes investigations {{carried out}} from September 2005 to August 2006 to assess forest ecosystem health {{in relation to}} human disturbance in the South-western Mau forest reserve Kenya. The study involved the determination and comparison of tree species composition and structure, regeneration potential and capacity, litter production and nutrient fluxes between disturbed and undisturbed sites. A socioeconomic appraisal of the inhabitants was also carried out. Forest cover change analysis of the greater Mau forest was done for the period between 1984 and 2003 using Landsat satellite images. A total of 24 families, 34 genera and 37 woody species comprising mainly trees were enumerated. There were 20 families in the undisturbed sites while 21 {{were present in the}} disturbed sites. In undisturbed sites, 30 species belonging to 29 genera were recorded while 29 species from 27 genera were tallied in the disturbed sites. The mean species richness was higher in the disturbed sites. Undisturbed sites had a lower proportion of shrubs and under storey trees with a higher frequency of over storey trees. Both sites had high number of seedlings and wildings. Regarding survival and recruitment from seasonal seed rain, disturbed sites had significantly higher mean species richness. Germinations from seasonal seed rain indicated higher mean seedling species richness in disturbed plots while seedling density was significantly higher in undisturbed plots. No significant mean differences in species composition were recorded from the seed bank trials. A higher amount of fine litter was collected in disturbed plots with insignificant mean differences with regard to K, C and N content between the sites. There were no significant mean differences in the C: P, ratios whereas undisturbed plots had significantly lower mean C: N ratios. Within stand mean nutrient use efficiency for C, N, P, K, and Ca were lower in the undisturbed plots. Survey results indicated that several tree species that were once common or dominant in the area were increasingly becoming rare. Increase in human population, firewood collection, agricultural expansion, land subdivision among others were ranked as important causes of forest degradation. Positive significant correlations were reported between the definition of provision of services, forest condition, provision of goods, the adequacy of goods provided and ecosystem health. However, a significant negative correlation was reported for the values attached to the current land use. The presence of <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator</b> species like Neoboutonia macrocalyx, Croton megalocarpus and Vernonia auriculifera in the vegetation community indicates considerable levels of human disturbance in the reserve representing retrogression in the vegetation succession.

The potential for natural regeneration of trees after natural or anthropogenic disturbance exists despite a poor soil seed bank. High litter annual turn over in disturbed sites, coupled with lower nutrient content and nutrient use efficiency as well as higher fine litter C: N and C: P ratios defines them as poorer sites.

In Indonesia, mining activities have increasingly become one of major drivers of land cover change. The majority of remote sensing research projects on mining environments have exploited optical data which are frequently complicated by tmospheric disturbance, especially in tropical territories. Active remote sensors such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are invaluable in this case. Monitoring by Independent SAR data has been limited due to single polarisation. Dual-polarised data have been employed considerably, although for some forestry applications the data were found insufficient to retrieve basic information. This Masters thesis is devoted to assess fully polarimetric SAR data for environmental monitoring of the tailings deposition zone of the PT Freeport Indonesia Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia. The main data were two granules of the AIRSAR datasets acquired during the PACRIM-II campaign. To support the interpretation and analysis, a scene of Landsat ETM February 2001) was used, juxtaposed with classified aerial photographs and a series of SPOT VEGETATION images. Both backscattering information and complex coherence matrices, as common representations of polarimetric data, were studied. Primary applications of this research were on degraded forest and environmental rehabilitation. Most parts of Indonesian forests have experienced abrupt changes as an impact of clear-cut deforestation. Gradual changes such as those due to fire or flooded tailings, however, are least studied. It was shown that the Cloude-Pottier polarimetric decomposition provided a convenient way to interpret various stages of forest disturbance. The result suggested that the Entropy parameter of the Cloude-Pottier decomposition {{could be used as a}} <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicator.</b> Using the fully polarimetric dataset combined with Support Vector Machine learning, the outcomes were generally acceptable. It was possible to improve classification accuracy by incorporating decomposition parameters, although it seemed insignificant. Land rehabilitation on tailings deposits has been a central concern of the government and the mining operator. Indigenous plant pioneers such as reeds (Phragmites) can naturally grow on dry tailings where soil structure is fairly well developed. To assist such efforts, a part of this research involved identification of dry tailings. On the first assessment, interpretation of surface scatterers was aided by polarimetric signatures. Apparently, longer wavelengths such as L- and P-band were overpenetrated; hence, growing reeds on dry tailings were less detectable. In this case, the use of C-band data was found fairly robust. Employing Mahalanobis statistics, the combination of HH and VV performed well on classification, having similar accuracy with quad polarimetric data. Extension on previous results was made through the Freeman-Durden decomposition. Interpretation using a three-component image of odd, even bounce and volume scattering showed that dry and wet tailings could be well distinguished. The application was benefited from unique responses of dielectric materials in the tailings deposit on SAR signals; hence it is possible to discriminate tailings with different moisture levels. However, further assessment of tailings moisture was not possible due to security reasons and access limitations at the study site. Fully polarimetric data were also employed to support rehabilitation of stressed mangrove forest on the southern coast. In this case, the Cloude-Pottier decomposition was employed along with textural parameters. Inclusion of textural properties was found invaluable for the classification using various statistical trees, and more important than decomposition parameters. It was concluded that incorporating polarimetric decompositions and textural parameters into coherence matrix leads to profound accuracy...|$|E

We compared paleoecological profiles (primarily from ostracodes) fromwatersheds spanning a range of sizes and present-day deforestation disturbance levels to understand the timing and magnitude of faunal changes, and their relationship in time to terrestrially-derived <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Profiles from the Lubulungu and Nyasanga/Kahama Rivers (Tanzania) provide a record of faunal variability in watersheds that are currently undisturbed with respect to deforestation. These records indicate continuous faunal turnover through time. However, this pattern of turnover is accompanied by relatively high levels of diversity throughout the record, with no wholesale extinction events. Ostracode taphonomic data and other fossil abundance data from the Lubulunguarea provide strong {{evidence in support of}} at least two episodes of lower lake levels, associatedwith episodes of Late Holocene aridity. Records from deltas of disturbed watersheds at the Kabesi River (Tanzania) and those ofNorthernBurundi all showa combination of profound and abrupt faunal turnover, in some cases accompanied by local extinction and establishment of a few dominant taxa. At the Mwamgongo River delta, fed from a very small, disturbed watershed, species turnover was subtler. In disturbed watershe...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of anthropogenic {{pressures on the}} marine environment together with {{the necessity of a}} sustainable management of marine living resources have underlined the need to map and model coastal environments, particularly for the purposes of spatial planning and for the implementation of integrated ecosystem-based management approach. The present study compares outputs of a process-driven benthic habitat sensitivity (PDS) model to the structure, composition and distribution of benthic invertebrates in the Eastern English Channel and southern part of the North Sea. Trawl <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators</b> (TDI) computed from species biological traits and benthic community composition were produced from samples collected with a bottom trawl. The TDI was found to be highly correlated to the PDS further validating the latter’s purpose to identify natural process-driven pattern of sensitivity. PDS was found to reflect an environmental potential that may no longer be fully observable in the field and difference with in situ biological observations could be partially explained by the spatial distribution of fishery pressure on the seafloor. The management implication of these findings are discussed and we suggest that, used in conjunction with TDI approaches, PDS may help monitor management effort by evaluating the difference between the current state and the presumed optimal environmental status of marine benthic habitats...|$|R

We compared three hy-drological compartments of the alluvial plain, consisting of the regularly flooded land between the river and low summer dykes (functional flood-plain), the occasionally flooded land between summer dykes and high winter dykes (hybrid flood-plain) and the land behind the winter dykes, which is now only submerged by ascending groundwater (fossil flood-plain). Due to their different flooding regime, the three compartments should differ {{with respect to the}} prevailing conditions of diaspore input. The seed density of soil samples increased with the dura-tion of flooding in the three compartments, while species richness and the proportion of species not occurring in the vegetation was constant. The increase in seed density can be largely attributed to an increase of <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators,</b> which are present in the above-ground vegetation and capable of forming a long-term persistent seed bank. No effects of flooding on the composition of seed banks in the three flood-plain compartments were found. The differ-ences in seed bank composition can be largely explained by corresponding differences in above-ground vegetation and former and present-day meadow management. Seeds of spe-cies absent from above-ground vegetation {{can be attributed to the}} local species pool present in the immediate vicinity of the study plots. We discuss consequences of the results for the restoration of species-rich flood-plain meadows...|$|R
40|$|Northern {{white cedar}} (Thuja occidentalis L.) (NWC) swamps are {{valuable}} both commercially and ecologically. Unfortunately, many NWC swamps are degraded {{and information about}} them is not abundant. Especially {{there have been no}} definitive studies about mosses in northern white cedar swamps and how they react to disturbances. Mosses are sensitive to changes in their environment and thus they could be used to assess ecosystem conditions of NWC swamps. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if mosses could be used to asses conditions in NWC swamps and if there are differences between moss communities in disturbed and undisturbed sites. Seventeen sample plots were taken from 12 disturbed and undisturbed sites around upper Michigan and northern Minnesota in the summer of 2012. All mosses occurring on the plots were identified and several associated environmental parameters were measured. The main environmental conditions affecting moss communities were identified with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). Multiple response permutation procedures (MRPP) were run to ascertain if there were significant differences in community composition between <b>disturbances.</b> <b>Indicator</b> species analysis was then done to identify species that are related to different types of disturbances. A one-way ANOVA was used to check for significant differences between species richness and moss cover of undisturbed and disturbed sites. Over all sixty-two moss species were identified. The results indicate that there was no significant difference in species richness or moss cover between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However, moss community composition was affected by disturbance and strongly divided by a wetness gradient. Dicranum fuscescens was found to indicate undisturbed conditions. Calliergon cordifolium and Climacium dendroides indicated disturbed sites with wet conditions. Brotherella recurvans and Eurhynchium pulchellum indicated swamps with other disturbances...|$|R

The primary goal {{of this study is to}} explain the discrepancy between Saddam Hussein's rigid behavior during the Gulf crisis, in contrast to the pragmatic style of decision making he has demonstrated in the past. It is suggested here that crisis-induced stress impaired Saddam's ability to process information, allowed his personality traits more influence on his choices, and activated a number of coping mechanisms that made Saddam less responsive to crisis-relevant information. Stress has been long assumed as a characteristic of international crises. This study goes beyond this to test the hypothesis that crisis situations are stressful for decision makers. Three types of nonverbal behavior indicators are used to test whether the Gulf crisis was stressful for Saddam: facial expression and eye blinking, acoustic <b>indicators,</b> and speech <b>disturbance.</b> While facial expression did not show signs of stress, acoustic and speech <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators</b> showed that the crisis was stressful for Saddam. The impact of stress on Saddam's thought structure was tested by applying the method of integrative complexity. This analysis showed that Saddam's integrative complexity significantly dropped during the crisis. A number of alternative interpretations of the crisis-related information were excluded from Saddam's during-crisis simple thought structure. Saddam's personality is suggested to be the variable that set the parameters of the accepted range of interpretations. A profile of Saddam's personality was drawn by applying a thematic apperception analysis to a sample of Saddam's interviews and press conferences. Five personality traits were investigated: the power motive, the affiliation motive, the belief in one's ability to control events, nationalism, and conceptual complexity. This analysis showed that Saddam's personality traits are more likely to dispose him to act in an aggressive and nonconciliatory manner when under crisis-induced stress...|$|R
40|$|Cattle {{breeding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} demanding branches of the agricultural production. Prerequisite for successful breeding is the economical effective milk production which only be achieved with good health of animals, good fertility, adequate replacement herd, longevity of cows and appropriate management. Breeders must always think about the way of the keeping and about the breed of the animals. This thesis aims to evaluate selected indicators of milk and meat production, fertility, longevity and economy of the milk production in the dairy herd of Holstein and Czech Pied cattle in the same stalling and at the same nutrition in the company VOD Kámen. It was chosen sixty Holstein and sixty Czech Pied breeding dams from the herd for monitoring. Monitored groups of cows were sorted out according to the genotype, origin of father and the order of lactation. The reproductive performance were used to evaluate (insemination interval, service period, meantime, insemination index), indicators of milk yield (amount of milk in kilograms, fat content, protein content), longevity and the reasons for decommissioning of cows. To evaluate meat yield twenty-five Holstein and twenty-five Czech Pied bulls were chosen. Differences of milk yield and fertility among both breeds were evaluated as very important (P < 0, 001). Reproductive performance of Holstein cows was evaluated as inconvenient (insemination interval 82, 06 days, service period 135, 87 days, meantime 412 days and insemination index 2, 4), and of Czech Pied cows as convenient (insemination interval 64, 8 days, service period 98, 84 days and insemination index 2, 0). The milk yield was higher the Czech average in both breeds. Holstein cows producted 9 123 kilograms of milk for lactation with 3, 87 % of fat and 3, 42 % of proteins; the Czech Pied cows producted 8100 kilograms of milk with 4, 08 % of fat and 3, 59 % of proteins. The most common reason for removal of cows was fertility <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of meat yield were better for the Czech Pied bulls. Those bulls had higher slaughter weight at lower age and better inclusion in the classification classes against the Holstein bulls...|$|R

ThienRange and Training Land Assessment (RTLA) and Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM) are key {{components}} of The United States Army's Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Program, which outlines its commitment to support the sustainable use of military training lands. The {{primary purpose of the}} RTLA Program is to provide information and recommendations regarding the condition of training lands to range managers for scheduling of training areas and monitoring the effectiveness of rehabilitation projects. The goal of the LRAM component of ITAM is to reduce the long-term impacts of training on installations through the implementation of improvements to vegetation cover and repairs to landscape damage in disturbed areas. Fort Riley Military Installation, located in the largest remaining expanse of tallgrass prairie in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas, is a major training reservation, with seventy percent of its 40, 434 ha used for mechanized maneuvers. A randomized complete block design composed of M 1 A 1 tank traffic in a figure-eight pattern during wet and dry soil conditions was established in each of two soil types, a silty clay loam and a silt loam, and recovery of physical, chemical, and biological indicator variables was monitored from 2005 through 2007. In a second study, the effectiveness of LRAM procedures, including leveling, mulching, and reseeding, was evaluated following wheeled vehicle disturbance. The goals of this study were to identify <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators</b> appropriate for assessing soil quality and, based on the status of these indicators, develop a method for modeling the stage and rate of ecological degradation and potential response to remediation. Disturbance increased significantly during wet compared to dry soil conditions, for increased traffic intensity, and for curve compared to straight-a-way areas in both soil types. The greatest impacts were on above and below ground community structure, providing an effective bioindicator of ecosystem health for military training land managers. Remediation of wheeled vehicle disturbance with leveling and mulching, but not reseeding, increased total vegetation production. The tallgrass prairie typically is considered to be among the most resilient of military training lands, but resiliency is dependent upon soil type and training conditions, and may require longer periods of recovery than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|This multiproxy study {{explores the}} palaeoenvironmental record of two cores, H 2 and H 7, from the Namaqualand Mudbelt {{representing}} an arid and highly variable landscape. As bulk organic radiocarbon ages previously proved problematic, with anomalous reversals, {{the primary objective}} was to improve chronology and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions through high resolution 813 C, 81 SN and pollen analysis, {{with the aid of}} principal component analysis. Bulk organic radiocarbon dating of the surface sediment had previously yielded older than expected ages. New 210 Pb analysis has established that these surface sediments are modem and radiocarbon ages are now recalibrated to yield an adjusted age of Â± 3 470 cal yr BP {{at the base of the}} more distal core, H 7. Pollen spectra correlate well with stable isotopes and include recent <b>disturbance</b> <b>indicators</b> in the Succulent Karoo, Grassland, Karoo expansion, stock farming, impoundment, saltmarsh degradation and increase in domestic cereal cultivation. The proximal and distal mudbelt sites are, however, isotopically distinct, with 813 C, inverse nitrogen and C/N ratios characterising H 2 as more terrestrial. The excursion towards C 3 -rich values at around 6 m depth in the proximal mudbelt suggests an increase in marine sources and C 3 vegetation, while associated pollen aridity indicators implicate reduced inland flooding. This is contrasted against more humid conditions at 420 cm. Stronger upwelling occurred in near-surface distal mudbelt sediment and an influx of the Buffels River sediment flooded the region at Â± 3470 yr BP, indicating cooler, less arid conditions. 813 C studies reveal the Lower Xobies palaeoflood deposit to be less C 4 -rich than expected, possibly due to sediment source, and is strikingly isotopically similar to the distal mudbelt. The palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the pollen assemblage, isotopes and chronology presents an improved understanding of the region represented in the mudbelt sediments. This corresponds well with established records of the last Â± 3 500 years and human induced land use change within the Orange River Catchment. Results also highlight the dynamics of the Orange River, which, combined with a highly variable climate, suggest that caution should be exercised to avoid over-interpreting the level at which environmental changes can meaningfully be reconstructed in arid landscapes, particularly those which are subject to sporadic and catastrophic flooding events...|$|R
