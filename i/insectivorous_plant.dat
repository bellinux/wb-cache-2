500|$|Due to its size, unusual {{morphology}} {{and striking}} colouration, N. rajah {{has always been}} a very popular and highly sought-after <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plant.</b> [...] However, despite its popularity amongst pitcher plant enthusiasts, N. rajah remains a little-known species outside the field of carnivorous plants. [...] Due to its specialised growing requirements, it is not a suitable candidate for a houseplant and, as such, is only cultivated by {{a relatively small number of}} hobbyists and professional growers worldwide. This being the case, N. rajah is nonetheless probably the most famous of all pitcher plants. [...] Its reputation for producing some of the most magnificent pitchers in the genus dates back to the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{national}} poll in 2002 conducted by Plantlife International, the round-leaved sundew (drosera rotundifolia) {{was chosen as}} Shropshire's county flower. The round-leaved sundew is a crimson-coloured <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plant</b> that requires a boggy habitat. Due to habitat loss its range is now dramatically reduced [...] and Shropshire's Longmynd {{is one of the}} few areas in England where it can now be found.|$|E
2500|$|Byblis aquatica is an <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plant</b> {{belonging}} to the genus Byblis, {{commonly known as the}} rainbow plants. It was described by Allen Lowrie and John Godfrey Conran in 1998, assigned to a group of annual north Australian species known as the [...] "Byblis liniflora complex". It grows in semi-aquatic conditions and uses stalked mucilagenous glands (similar to those employed by the unrelated sundews and Drosophyllum) covering its leaf surfaces to attract, catch, and digest insect prey to supplement the poor environmental nutrient supply.|$|E
