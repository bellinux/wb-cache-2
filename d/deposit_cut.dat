40|$|Milna Crater, Mars (23. 4 S, 12. 3 W) {{exhibits}} {{signs of}} fluvial modification early in Mars history, including a large multi-lobed fan <b>deposit</b> <b>cut</b> by several sinuous valleys. We describe the past hydrologic conditions in Milna {{and the surrounding}} area, including a potential lake with a volume of 50 km^ 3. We also introduce new methods (i) to calculate the timescale of sediment deposition by considering fluvial sediment input into the entire crater while accounting for non-fluvial input, and (ii) to place improved constraints on the channel dimensions through which sediment was delivered to Milna by comparing to the dimensions of inner channels found in valleys in the region surrounding Milna. By calculating the flux of fluid and sediment into the crater, {{we find that the}} crater cavity was flooded for at least months and that the time of active fluvial sediment transport without hiatus is on the order of decades to centuries, with a preferred timescale of centuries. We also calculate the total amount of water required to transport the volume of sediment we measure in Milna and conclude that impacts alone are likely insufficient to deliver enough water to Milna to allow the sedimentary fill we see. Combining the timescales of fluvial activity in the adjacent Paraná Valles with estimates for global Noachian erosion rates, we calculate an intermittency factor for fluvial activity of ∼ 0. 01 – 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|The fossil {{calvaria}} {{known as}} the Mojokerto child’s skull was discovered in 1936, but uncertainties have persisted about its paleoenvironmen-tal context and geological age because of difficulties in relocating the discovery site. Past relocation efforts were hindered by inaccuracies in old base maps, intensive post- 1930 s agricultural terracing, and new tree and brush growth. Fortunately geologic cross sections and site photographs from 1936 - 1938 dnot fully utilized in past relocation fieldworkdclosely circumscribe site geography and geology. These documents match the conditions at just one sandstone outcrop. It is situated on the southern margin of a topographic nose at {{the upper end of}} a w 18 m-wide gully (w 0663760 m E, 9183430 m N, UTM Zone 49 M), w 15 m southeast of the Kumai et al.

The calvaria is well-preserved and taphonomically similar to large and fragile specimens found among several hundred vertebrate fossils excavated from the sandstone in 2001 - 2002. Since no well-preserved fossils were found intact at the surface of the sandstone, the good condition of the Mojokerto skull suggests that it was buried fully when discovered.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the modern morphology, acoustic facies and architecture of the eastern Magdalena Turbidite System has been based on multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data, In {{spite of the fact that}} the Magdalena Turbidite System developed in a tectonically active setting, its present architecture model is comprised of two tecto-sedimentary provinces: deformed-constructional and undeformed-erosive. The deformed province occurs where the deformed prism developed. This prism is characterised by structural highs and associated small-scale ridges and scarps. In this province, the Magdalena Turbidite System is constructional because sediment coming from the Colombian hinterland (via the Magdalena River and from coastal erosion) and sediment remobilised from the walls of the structural highs are transported trough canyons and gullies, and emplaced as gravity deposits into the deformed prism. In the undeformed province, by contrast, the Magdalena Turbidite System displays an architecture model similar to a passive continental margin, and is characterised by large-scale mass-flow deposits, leveed channel complexes, scars of stumps, and sediment waves. This province is presently erosive because the existing leveed channels are partially or totally destroyed and cannibalised by mass-flow <b>deposits,</b> <b>cut</b> by small-scale scars of slumps, and their morphology is subdued or modified by the formation of a sediment wave field.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{hydraulic conductivity}} of basalt and interbedded sediment that compose the Snake River Plain aquifer at {{and near the}} Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) ranges from about 1. 0 x 10 - 2 to 3. 2 x 10 4 feet per day (ft/d). This six-order-of-magnitude range of hydraulic conductivity was estimated from single-well aquifer tests in 114 wells, and is attributed mainly to the physical characteristics and distribution of basalt flows and dikes. Hydraulic conductivity is greatest in thin pahoehoe flows and near-vent volcanic deposits. Hydraulic conductivity is least in flows and <b>deposits</b> <b>cut</b> by dikes. Estimates of hydraulic conductivity at and near the INEEL {{are similar to those}} measured in similar volcanic settings in Hawaii. The largest variety of rock types and the greatest range of hydraulic conductivity are in volcanic rift zones, which are characterized by numerous aligned volcanic vents and fissures related to underlying dikes. Three broad categories of hydraulic conductivity corresponding to six general types of geologic controls can be inferred from the distribution of wells and vent corridors. Hydraulic conductivity of basalt flows probably is increased by localized fissures and coarse mixtures of interbedded sediment, scoria, and basalt rubble. Hydraulic conductivity of basalt flows is decreased locally by abundant alteration minerals of probable hydrothermal origin. Hydraulic conductivity varies as much as six orders of magnitude in a single vent corridor and varies from three to five orders of magnitude within distances of 500 to 1, 000 feet. Abrupt changes in hydraulic conductivity over short distances suggest the presence of preferential pathways and local barriers that may greatly affect the movement of ground water and the dispersion of radioactive and chemical wastes downgradient from points of waste disposal...|$|R

40|$|The North Sea Basin {{is shaped}} by {{multiple}} glacial advances and retreats that left complex sequences of glacio-fluvial and sub-glacial <b>deposits,</b> <b>cut</b> by sub-glacial tunnel valleys. Today, the submerged valley of the Elbe forms {{one of the most}} prominent structures of the southern North Sea. Flanked by huge moraine deposits of older glacials, the valley developed to its present form during the Weichselian sea-level lowstand (- 130 m below present). Melt waters that discharged in north-westerly directions along the Scandinavian Ice Sheet fed the paleo Elbe at that time. During the Holocene the valley drowned in the rising sea. Here we present an area-wide high-resolution map of the seafloor and high-resolution shallow seismic data covering 1, 600 km 2 of the paleo Elbe valley (PEV) including its eastern levee. The data allow to shed new light on the PEV development including the historical process of sedimentary infill with the successive Holocene sea level rise in detail. Shallow seismic data with transect distances of 400 m and several cross sections allow 3 -D visualization. The eastern flank of the valley is characterized by a relatively steep slope with one or more terraces. At its levee a significant sediment change is present on the modern sea floor, representing moraine and marine deposits. High resolution sidescan sonar data of this area show a much higher heterogeneity and complexity in sediment and habitat distribution as assumed before. Holocene marine sediments form a patchy and thin drape east of the valley floor. The western slip-off slope of the valley slope is much smoother than the eastern undercut slope. As yet, significant sedimentological changes at the present seafloor are not known for the western side of the PEV. Shallow seismic data show the base of the PEV. There are conspicuous internal seismic reflectors above the base, inclined in northeastern direction. They indicate a sedimentary infill of the valley from the southwest when the southern part of the Dogger Bank was flooded during the early Holocene sea-level rise. In this process the steeper eastern slope acted as a natural barrier towards the northeast and averted sediment transport beyond the eastern boundary of the PEV...|$|R

This depression, blanketed with alluvial and lacustrine <b>deposits,</b> is <b>cut</b> along its entire length by the Dead Sea fault. In many places the fault is well defined by scarps, and evidence for left-lateral strike-slip faulting is abundant. The slip rate on the fault can be constrained from dated geomorphic features displaced by the fault. A large fan at the mouth of Wadi Dahal has been displaced by about 500 m since the bulk of the fanglomerates were deposited 77 – 140 kyr ago, as dated from cosmogenic isotope analysis (^(10) Be in chert) of pebbles collected on the fan surface and from the age of transgressive lacustrine sediments capping the fan. Holocene alluvial surfaces are also clearly offset. By correlation with similar surfaces along the Dead Sea lake margin, we propose a chronology for their emplacement. Taken together, our observations suggest an average slip rate over the Late Pleistocene of between 2 and 6 mm yr^(− 1), with a preferred value of 4 mm yr^(− 1). This slip rate is shown to be consistent with other constraints on the kinematics of the Arabian plate, assuming a rotation rate of about 0. 396 ° Myr^(− 1) around a pole at 31. 1 °N, 26. 7 °E relative to Africa...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{mountain building}} in the Altai range of western Mongolia, focusing on Baatar Hyarhan, a NW-trending massif bounded by active thrust faults. Our primary aims are to describe how thrusting has evolved over time, to calculate late Quaternary slip rates by dating offset alluvial markers with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and to compare these late Quaternary rates with measurements of deformation on decadal and geological timescales. Patterns of topography and drainage suggest that Baatar Hyarhan has grown in length and has propagated laterally from the SE towards the NW over time. On the NE side of the massif, the range-bounding Zereg fault appears active only along younger parts of Baatar Hyarhan; next to the oldest, SE part of the massif faulting has migrated into the adjacent Zereg Basin, where it has uplifted low, linear ridges of folded sediment, known locally as forebergs. On the SW side of the massif, only the range-bounding Tsetseg fault appears active. Using OSL, we establish ages of ∼ 15, ∼ 20 and ∼ 85 kyr for alluvial <b>deposits</b> <b>cut</b> by these faults. These ages are close to those of alluvial markers in the separate Gobi Altai range, suggesting that periods of fan and terrace formation may correlate over wide tracts of Mongolia, presumably under the primary control of climate. Combining our OSL ages with offsets measured with differential GPS, we calculate Late Quaternary slip rates across forebergs in the Zereg Basin and across the range-bounding Zereg and Tsetseg faults. Uncertainties in fault dip (due to lack of clear fault exposures) and burial ages (due to incomplete resetting of the luminescence clock) mean that the exact slip rates are poorly constrained. Nevertheless, the vertical displacement rates we calculate across the Zereg and Tsetseg range-front faults- 0. 2 - 0. 6 and 0. 1 - 0. 4 mm yr - 1, respectively-are {{at the lower end}} of long-term (∼ 5 Myr) estimates of 0. 4 - 0. 8 and 0. 3 - 0. 7 mm yr - 1, respectively. Vertical rates of deformation may, therefore, have remained constant over the past ∼ 5 Myr, but equally the late Quaternary rates might be lower than the geological ones. This possible discrepancy could be accounted for if some of the shortening has shifted away from the range-front faults onto other nearby structures. The forebergs in the eastern Zereg Basin are an obvious candidate, but they show at least 10 km cumulative shortening (which would take a few Ma to accumulate at late Quaternary rates) and cannot simply be regarded as the latest stage of outward mountain growth. The total Late Quaternary shortening rate across all three areas of faulting is 0. 7 - 2. 4 mm yr - 1, making up between one tenth and one third of the ∼ 7 mm yr - 1 convergence across the whole Altai range. © Journal compilation © 2009 RAS...|$|R

Bayo de la Alumbrera was originally buried beneath a 2500 m high volcanic pile. Around the Alto de la Blenda monzonite a number of stocks (0.1 - 1 km wide) and dikes originate, which indicates {{it may be a}} remnant of the conduit. In some stocks magma mixing appears to have occurred during formation; in Alto de la Alumbrera first felsic and at the end mafic rocks were formed. Several dykes and stocks were injected into andesite during the formation of Bajo de la Alumbrera. Many of these stocks have suffered hydrothermal alteration extending into surrounding rocks shortly after their formation including propylitic alteration, but the later stocks show no evidence of alteration. This pattern probably occurred because strong volcanic activity during the earliest intrusions did leak away fluids before they could trigger alteration. When volcanic activity dropped, trapped fluids could then initiate hydrothermal alteration. This probably coincided with a change in the local stress regime that reduced volcanic activity. Faults and fractures have influenced the alteration. In Bajo de la Alumbrera, this alteration has given place to magnetite and anhydrite inclusions which indicated the rocks were highly oxidized. Phyllic (pyrite-quartz-sericite) and potassic (biotite-orthoclase) alteration is noticeable in satellite images of Bajo de la Alumbrera.

60|$|The {{evidence}} that the Jordan-Arabah valley really was once filled with water, the surface of which reached within 160 feet {{of the level of}} the pass of Jezrael, and possibly stood higher, is this: Remains of alluvial strata, containing shells of the freshwater mollusks which still inhabit the valley, worn down into terraces by waves which long rippled at the same level, and furrowed by the channels excavated by modern rainfalls, have been found at the former height; and they are repeated, at intervals, lower down, until the Ghor, or plain of the Jordan, itself an alluvial deposit, is reached. These strata attain a considerable thickness; and they indicate that the epoch at which the freshwater mere of Palestine reached its highest level is extremely remote; that its diminution has taken place very slowly, and with periods of rest, during which the first formed <b>deposits</b> were <b>cut</b> down into terraces. This conclusion is strikingly borne out by other facts. A volcanic region stretches from Galilee to Gilead and the Hauran, {{on each side of the}} northern end of the valley. Some of the streams of basaltic lava which have been thrown out from its craters and clefts in times of which history has no record, have run athwart the course of the Jordan itself, or of that of some of its tributary streams. The lava streams, therefore, must be of later date than the depressions they fill. And yet, where they have thus temporarily dammed the Jordan and the Jermuk, these streams have had time to cut through the hard basalts and lay bare the beds, over which, before the lava streams invaded them, they flowed.|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{intact and}} 12 docked Najdi lambs of {{equal numbers of}} males and females were {{utilized}} in the experiment. Upon attaining 40 kg fasted and shorn body weight the lambs were slaughtered and their carcasses were dissected into wholesale cuts. Each cut was then dissected into lean, fat and bone, which were weighed separately. The data showed that docked lambs were 19 days earlier in attaining the designated slaughter body weight and produced carcasses with 1. 33 and 0. 20 kg more weights in primal and rough cuts, respectively, compared to intact lambs. Also, the total separable lean weigh in primal cuts was heavier for the docked lambs in comparison to intact lambs which reflected significant differences (P< 0. 05) in lean weight from wholesale loin and rack cuts. Non-significant differences were observed for the amounts of separable fat <b>deposited</b> in each <b>cut</b> between docked and intacy lambs except for wholesale leg cut. No significant differences were detected between the docked and intact groups for bone weight in each cut...|$|R
