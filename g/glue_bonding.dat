40|$|Tenon joints {{are widely}} used in constructions of {{skeletal}} furniture and numerous laboratory experiments were conducted {{with the aim of}} determining the rigidity and strength of such joints. In industrial practice, the sloppily applied glue often covers only flat, rectangular planes of the tenon. In this situation, it can be intuitively predicted that such joints are characterised by low strength but the precise assessment of this difference, requires carrying out appropriate experiments and numerical calculations. Therefore, the aim of the performed investigations was: to define the strength of a tenon joint in the construction of a chair with a connecting piece, to determine the distribution of shear and normal stresses in the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> and to ascertain the infl uence of the glueline on this strength. The finite element mesh for the tenon joint was developed by using orthotropic, 20 -node block elements, whereas the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> was modelled using isotropic elements 0. 1 mm thick. The performed investigations showed that the shape of the glueline exerts a strong influence on the strength of the tenon joint. The pressure of the tenon on the mortise via the layer of the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> changes the form of deformations. Non-dilatational deformations, which generate shear stresses of values exceeding the ultimate strength, develop in rectangular bonds, whereas in superellipse bonds non-dilatational deformations clearly restrict the pressure of the tenon on the mortise and, by doing so, decrease considerably the level of dangerous shear stresses...|$|R

30|$|The {{optical and}} {{electrical}} {{measurements of the}} transferred LEDs have revealed that the electrical degradation in thin-film LEDs can be avoided by utilizing the wafer bonding process proposed here. This considerable improvement should be mainly attributed to the effective suppression of residual stress at bonding interface using the low temperature and pressure-free <b>glue</b> <b>bonding.</b> It {{is well known that}} the LED epilayers and bonding metal always have a high thermal mismatch because of their difference in thermal expansion coefficient. As a result, the high temperature and pressure procedures during mental bonding would lead to a large residual stress at the bonding interface. After the sapphire removal, the thin LED epilayers are very brittle and favorable to generation of defects, thereby, increasing reverse leakage current. Moreover, the thickness of p-GaN cladding top layer is considerably thin, only about 0.4 [*]μm. The requisite treatment for mental bonding would result in damage to the MQWs active region and the consequent electrical deterioration. Therefore, the <b>glue</b> <b>bonding</b> with low temperature and pressure-free processes is highly beneficial to avoid these negative influences. In addition, the relative lower temperature and pressure during Sn fusion bonding, the thick n-GaN and u-GaN layers, and the bottom mental reflector could effectively prevent damage of the MQWs active region during the second wafer bonding after LLO, which also play important roles in eliminating the electrical degradation of thin-film LEDs.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} research project, carried {{out during the}} years 2006 - 2008, the possibility to manufacture wet glued laminated beams using ungraded laminations of Norway spruce side boards was investigated with very promising results. In the project presented in this report, {{the performance of the}} wet glued beams has been further investigated and developed as regards grading of side board laminations, bond line properties and lamination finger jointing. The possibility to use scanning equipment for measurement of fibre angles and prediction of strength and stiffness of boards and beams has been studied and the procedures for technical approval and CE marking have been probed into. Studies concerning market and economy for the beams and layouts for a pilot plant and a full capacity plant, respectively, for production of such beams have also been carried out. The possibility to grade side boards in the wet state using axial dynamic excitation was investigated with a positive result. From such excitation, a board’s stiffness (modulus of elasticity) could be determined. Accordingly, grading criteria regarding axial stiffness, and knot size, was applied to grade side board laminations into two classes; outer and inner laminations. Strength and stiffness tests of beams manufactured from such graded laminations showed that the beams actually could challenge first rate glulam and LVL products available on the market. Regarding beam shape and shape stability, cross section cupping may need further attention. Even if this deformation was small, it was still visible to the naked eye. The problem could probably be overcome if the beams are dried to a moisture content of 12 - 14 % before planing. Results of shear tests show that green <b>glued</b> <b>bond</b> lines can fulfil strength requirements for glulam. However, delamination requirements for service class 3 (outdoors) were not fully met. From small scale tensile testing of <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> it was concluded that green <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> with high density wood have the same tensile strength and fracture energy as dry <b>glued</b> <b>bonds.</b> For bonds with low density wood and/or small amount of adhesive, the tensile strength could be lower than for dry <b>glued</b> <b>bonds,</b> whereas the fracture energy was on a similar level. Strength testing of wet and dry glued finger joints demonstrated that joints glued from high density wood was significantly stronger than low density joints {{and that there was no}} significant difference between the strength of green glued joints and joints glued after drying. From X-ray measurement it was shown that the glue penetration into the wood fibres is much deeper in a green glued joint than in a joint that is glued in the dried state. From scanning algorithms developed within the scope of this project it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of grain-angle distributions on board surfaces as well as rather accurate descriptions of knot locations and of fibre-angle disturbances around knots. From scanning of board ends, cross section characteristics with respect to radial and tangential directions and of annual ring widths could also be determined. Finally, both board and beam stiffness were predicted from this data, with an accuracy that is comparable with the one obtained from well-reputed commercial grading systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: New {{technologies}} for wood building construction continue to employ various profile-adhesive joints, with {{mortise and tenon}} joints being the most popular. Their strength depends both on the wood species and type of the applied glue, {{as well as the}} execution accuracy of individual elements. The aim of the performed experiments was to determine the size of normal stresses in places of mutual pressures of the tenon and mortise and the impact of the change of wood species and the type of glue (or lack of glue) applied to the joint on the value of those stresses. It was established, on the basis of numerical calculations, that the phenomena of the tenon and mortise contact are caused both by the bending of the tenon {{as well as by the}} torsion of the <b>glue</b> <b>bond.</b> Stresses in the direction perpendicular to the fibre course generating pressures exceeding wood compression strength turned out to be the most dangerous for the tenon and mortise joint.

However, some problems, like hypersensitivity reactions, corrosion and mechanical failure, have been reported. Therefore, the combining of both materials {{to take advantage}} of their pros, while eliminating their respective cons, would be desirable. Hence, we introduced a new technique to bond titanium and ceramic materials by means of a silica-based glass ceramic solder. Cylindrical compound samples (Ø 10 mm × 56 mm) made of alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ), as well as titanium grade 5, were bonded by glass solder on their end faces. As a control, a two-component adhesive glue was utilized. The samples were investigated without further treatment, after 30 and 90 days of storage in distilled water at room temperature, and after aging. All samples were subjected to quasi-static four-point-bending tests. We found that the glass solder bonding provided significantly higher bending strength than adhesive <b>glue</b> <b>bonding.</b> In contrast to the glued samples, the bending strength of the soldered samples remained unaltered by the storage and aging treatments.

30|$|In general, wood is {{stronger}} under short-term loads and is weaker under sustained loads. This phenomenon is called duration of load; and, the primary {{relationship between the}} stress ratio (i.e., the ratio between the applied stress and the short-term strength) and the time to failure is {{commonly referred to as}} the duration-of-load (DOL) effect. In fact, the DOL effect is not introduced by material deterioration or decaying; rather, it is a distinctive characteristic of wood. Previous researches to study the DOL effect on wood strength properties were mainly focused on bending properties of solid sawn materials [11 – 15]. No research has been reported on studying the DOL effect on the rolling shear strength in wood, since CLT is a relatively new engineered wood product, and before its emergence rolling shear in wood was not considered a technical characteristic of primary importance.

In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon.

The present study evaluates green <b>glued</b> adhesive <b>bonds</b> in flatwise <b>glued</b> beams and finger joints. The main part of this work deals with green gluing using a moisture curing polyurethane adhesive (PUR). Standardised test methods and specially designed, small scale, specimens were used for the determination of the strength, fracture energy and the ductility of both dry- and green <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> in tension and in shear. Using the small scale specimens it was possible to capture the complete stress versus deformation curves, including also their unloading part. An optical system for deformation measurement was used for the analysis of bond behaviour. The influence of moisture content during curing and temperature after curing on the adhesive chemical composition and on the mechanical properties was investigated. Furthermore, the moisture transport through the adhesive bond during curing was tested. Finally, microscopy studies were performed for analysis of bond morphology and fracture. The results show that two significant factors influence the shear strength of green glued bonds: wood density and adhesive spread rate. Bonds which fulfil the requirements according to EN  386 could be obtained within a wide range of process parameters. The small specimen tests showed that green <b>glued</b> PUR <b>bonds</b> can reach the same strength and fracture energy, both in shear and in tension, as dry <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> with the same adhesive amount.

Some parts and components have been replaced and reorganized to reduce the size of the dispenser. The choice of a steep motor, which makes the rotation when a dosage is performed, is the largest contribution to shrink the size of the equipment. Also the new designed circuit board makes it possible to reduce the size of the dispensing equipment. A LCD is used to show the current dose time. The LCD is a part of a LCD module. To change the dosing time two push buttons are being used. A microcontroller is controlling the steep motor. The microcontroller is a PIC 16 F 877 A from Microchip. The microcontroller in the dispensing equipment is controlling all the functions. The program code is designed to function in an interrupt routine.

Which make the dispensing equipment ready to be implemented in production...|$|E
5000|$|Geofoam shares {{principles}} with geocombs (previously called ultralight cellular structures) {{which has}} been defined as [...] "any manufactured material created by an extrusion process that results in a final product that consists of numerous open-ended tubes that are <b>glued,</b> <b>bonded,</b> fused or otherwise bundled together." [...] The cross-sectional geometry of an individual tube typically has a simple geometric shape (circle, ellipse, hexagon, octagon, etc.) and is on the order of 25 mm across. The overall cross-section of the assemblage of bundled tubes resembles a honeycomb that gives it its name. Presently, only rigid polymers (polypropylene and PVC) have been used as geocomb material.|$|R

In the course of the research we apply acrylic base and cyanoacrylate adhesives. For qualifying the <b>glued</b> <b>bonding</b> we used specimens with lapped bonding made according to standard DIN EN 1465 and by breaking then we used tensile-test machine according to standard ISO 527 - 1. We make a proposal based on the results, onto the bandage forming coming close to the strength of the base material relating to the examined polymers...|$|R

Povečan upor zlepljenih preskušancev je posledica lepila v spoju in tudisprememb v lastnostih lesa, zlasti povečane gostote ter lokalno manjše higroskopičnosti, ki sta posledici izpostavitve lesa pogojem lepljenja. Primerjali smo kinetike navlaževanja masivnih bukovih preskušancev in zlepljenih preskušancev (uporabili smo tekoča PVAc, UF, MUF, FRF in epoksidna lepila ter FF lepilni film) ter vzporednih preskušancev, ki so bili brez lepilnih spojev, so pa bili izpostavljeni pogojem lepljenja. Difuzijske koeficiente smo določili z uporabo nestacionarne metode. Ugotovili smo, da tanki lepilni spoji, izdelani s tekočimi lepili, niso bariera, ki bi učinkovito zadržala prodiranje vezane vode v lepljenec. Večji upor ustvarjajo le spoji s FF lepilnim filmom. Med difuzijskimi koeficienti, izračunanimi iz analitičnih rešitev in rešitve enačbe prvega reda, obstajajo statistično značilne razlike. Prečno difuzijo vodne pare in vezane vode v lesu lahko opišemo kot sistem prvega reda. In the wood-glue-wood system, the glue-bond {{presents}} an additional resistance,hindering the water transition. The increased {{resistance of the}} glued test pieces is the consequence of adhesive being present in the bond, soas of altered wood properties, mainly the increased density and locally decreased wood hygroscopicity, resulting {{as a consequence of}} wood exposed to the gluing conditions. Using an unsteady-state method, the diffusion coefficients were defined. The kinetics of absorption of the massive beech test pieces, glued test pieces (PVAc, UF, MUF, PRF and epoxy liquid adhesives and PF film were used), and parallel ones with no <b>glue</b> <b>bonds</b> but exposed to the gluing conditions, were compared. It was established that the thin <b>glue</b> <b>bonds</b> made by using liquid glues do not present a barrier, which could effectively hinder the transition of bound water into the glued piece. A higher resistance was presented just by FF <b>glue</b> film <b>bonds.</b> There exist statistically significant differences among diffusion coefficients, calculatedby analytical solutions and solutions of an equation of the first order model. Transverse diffusion of water vapour and bound water can be described as the first order system...|$|R
