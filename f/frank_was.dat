5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before <b>Frank</b> <b>was</b> officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial.

Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
