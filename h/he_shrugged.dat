On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> off their suggestion of retreat.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Hamilton was booed by the crowd. In the podium interview, conducted by Spanish TV presenter Noemi de Miguel, <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> off the reaction, saying: [...] "That's not my problem, it's theirs." [...] Both Hamilton and Verstappen expressed delight at their result, while Räikkönen {{said that it}} had not been an easy day for the team, stressing that Ferrari had not achieved what they could have, since he felt that he could have overtaken Verstappen towards the end. Hamilton's win was the 250th victory by a British driver in Formula One and his first at the Spielberg circuit.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{would later}} comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later [...] "told {{me that he}} ... knew it [...] had been partly {{inspired}} by him ... reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> off my apology, {{saying that he was}} flattered." [...] With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew ("Victoria", [...] "Young and Innocent Days"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons ("Australia"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home ("Shangri-La"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War ("Mr. Churchill Says"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war ("She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina"), and the death of his brother in World War I ("Yes Sir, No Sir", [...] "Some Mother's Son").|$|E

500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she {{realized}} it when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. <b>He</b> <b>shrugged</b> and replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Tolliver played college {{football}} at Texas Tech University {{and was a member}} of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. His hard throwing style led Texas Tech head coach David McWilliams to say, [...] "He throws the ball harder, and with more velocity, than anyone I've ever seen." [...] He redshirted his freshman season in 1984 and became the starting quarterback in 1985. On November 9, 1985, Tolliver had his first breakout performance at Texas Tech as he threw for a record-setting 422 yards and five touchdowns in a 63–7 win over Texas Christian University (TCU), a feat that helped him become a household name in Texas. As he began his sophomore season, he was considered the lone bright spot on Texas Tech's offense. Tolliver struggled at the start of the year; by the end of September he had only completed 54 of 123 passes. After throwing five interceptions in a game against Baylor, <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> off the bad game, saying, [...] "even Betty Crocker burns a cake every now and then." [...] His fortunes continued to sink when in a game in late October against the Rice Owls, he was benched and backup quarterback Monte McGuire rallied the team to a victory. However, Tolliver regained his starting job and brought his team to the 1986 Independence Bowl as Texas Tech won six games for the first time since 1978. He finished the season with 1,802 passing yards and seven touchdowns.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2014 Cotchin {{signed a}} 5-year {{contract}} extension with Richmond, tying {{him to the}} club {{until the end of}} the 2020 season. In doing so <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> off a reportedly lucrative offer from [...]|$|E

2500|$|Beauclerk {{wore a white}} beaver hat when playing, the {{remainder}} of his outfit being a white shirt, nankeen breeches, a scarlet sash and white stockings. He once threw his hat down on the pitch in frustration at his inability to dismiss the obdurate batsman Tom Walker, known as [...] "Old Everlasting". Beauclerk called Walker a [...] "confounded old beast" [...] but, when Walker was asked about it afterwards, <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> and said: [...] "I don't care what he says".|$|E
2500|$|Gein's {{house and}} {{property}} {{were scheduled to}} be auctioned March 30, 1958, amid rumors the house {{was to become a}} tourist attraction. On March 27, the house was destroyed by fire. Arson was suspected, but the cause was never officially determined. When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> and said, [...] "Just as well." [...] Gein's car, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 to carnival sideshow operator Bunny Gibbons. Gibbons later charged carnival goers 25¢ admission to see it.|$|E
2500|$|Stegall has {{continued}} his excellence throughout the {{seasons with the}} Blue Bombers. [...] Throughout his career, Stegall has led the CFL in receptions once, he twice {{led the league in}} receiving yards and he led the league in touchdown receptions 5 times. [...] In 2005 at age 35, some thought Stegall's play would be on the decline, but <b>he</b> <b>shrugged</b> off critics by capping off the season with his 5th All-Star selection. Amidst endless offensive coordinator changes, as well as many head coach changes, Stegall still has remained a reliable, and at times unstoppable force for the Blue Bombers. Arguably {{one of the most popular}} Bombers of all time he was named to the All-Time 75th Anniversary Team. With the 2005 season over, there was speculation that Stegall would retire, but he soon announced that he would in fact be returning for, at least, one more year. In the 5th game of the Bombers' 2007 season, July 27, 2007, Milt Stegall became the all-time CFL touchdown leader on a 1-yard pass originally designed as a running play for the occasion, surpassing running backs Mike Pringle and George Reed, and went on to score another major before the end of the game to bring his total up to that point to 139 touchdowns.|$|E
