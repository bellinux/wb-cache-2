He had been acquainted with the seizure of the Coquette's barge, the {{preceding}} night, and of the confinement of the crew. Its appearance in that place, therefore, occasioned no new surprise. But the time which past while the men were rowing up to the sloop-of-war, was filled with minutes of increasing interest. The black abandoned his hoe, and took {{a position on the}} side of the mountain, that gave him a view of the whole bay. So long as the mysteries of the Lust in Rust had been confined to the ordinary combinations of a secret trade, he had been fully able to comprehend them; but now that there apparently existed an alliance so unnatural as one between his master and the cruiser of the crown, he felt the necessity of <b>double</b> <b>observation</b> and of greater thought.|$|E

60|$|These {{things being}} premised, {{it will be}} readily {{understood}} that outline forms sufficient for an entire series of lunars will extend over many pages--they will, in fact, require eighteen pages. There are four sets of observations for time:--one E. and one W., both at beginning and close of the whole; one for latitudes N. and S.; six for six sets of lunars, as described above; six for the corresponding altitudes of the stars, which have to be computed; and, finally, one page for taking means, and recording the observations for adjustment, etc. Each <b>double</b> <b>observation</b> for latitude would take one page; each single time observation one page; and each single compass variation one page. An occulation would require three pages in all; one {{of which would be}} for time. At this rate, and taking the observations mentioned above, a book of 500 pages would last half a year. Of course where the means of transport is limited, travellers must content themselves with less. Thus Captain Speke, who started on his great journey amply equipped with log-books and calculation-books, such as I have described, found them too great an incumbrance, and was compelled to abandon them. The result was, that though he brought back {{a very large number of}} laborious observations, there was a want of method in them, which made a considerable part of his work of little or no use, while the rest required very careful treatment, in order to give results commensurate with their high intrinsic value.|$|E

40|$|The {{resolution}} {{along the}} optical axis {{is much less}} than the lateral resolution in both confocal and conventional fluorescence light microscopy. To correct for the anisotropy in resolution one may generate tilted views from the same object and subsequently merge these tilted views into one image with improved isotropic resolution. It has been suggested to obtain tilted views in confocal theta microscopy with <b>double</b> <b>observation</b> by illuminating the object from one side and simultaneously detecting the emitted light in the direction parallel to the illumination direction and in a direction with an angle theta to the illumination direction. Alternatively, one might use the usual optical set-up of a light microscope together with a tilting device to rotate the object under the microscope. With this method the object can be viewed from all directions (axial tomography). In this paper we investigate two methods for merging tilted views. If the image sets obtained from the different tilt angles are interpreted as statistic samples of one and the same object, a gain in resolution along the optical axis is accompanied by a significant trade-off in lateral resolution. An optical interpretation of the image formation in each single object point by retaining the frequencies with the highest amplitudes in the different tilted views provides a gain in axial resolution without significant decrease in lateral resolution. We will describe a quantitative method to determine the gain in resolution dependent on the number and geometry of the tilted views. It will be demonstrated that a previously suggested reconstruction method implying a multiplication of tilted views in the spatial domain does not improve resolution. Simulated reconstructions based on measured point spread functions in axial tomography and confocal theta microscopy with <b>double</b> <b>observation</b> will demonstrate the validity of our reconstruction methods...|$|E

For this reason, a micro-motion recognition method based on the distinguishing characteristics extracted from the Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) sequences is proposed in this paper. The projection trajectory formula of cone node strong scattering source and cone bottom slip-type strong scattering sources, which are located on the spatial cone target, are deduced under three micro-motion types including nutation, precession, and spinning, and the correctness is verified by the electromagnetic simulation. By comparison, differences are found among the projection of the scattering sources with different micro-motions, the coordinate information of the scattering sources in the Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar sequences is extracted by the CLEAN algorithm, and the spinning is recognized by setting the threshold value of Doppler. The <b>double</b> <b>observation</b> points Interacting Multiple Model Kalman Filter is used to separate the scattering sources projection of the nutation target or precession target, and the cross point number of each scattering source’s projection track is used to classify the nutation or precession.

The upper sections had an intact SMZ, while the lower sections were thinned according to Georgia best management practices (BMP) guidelines.
