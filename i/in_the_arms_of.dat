5|$|The Canadian pale, a pale {{division}} {{amounting to}} half the entire field, derived from the Canadian flag, is widely used in Canadian heraldry, while the Canadian fess, a similar horizontal division, has been used once. The term érablé, referring to maple leaves, is often used in Canadian arms. For example, as a tressure érablé <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Monarchist League of Canada, coronets érablé <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Sudbury and Canada's National History Society, and as a partition much like engrailed or dancetty.

In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant. Her arms {{from that point on}} are duplicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Legend relates that in January 1297 François Grimaldi, {{disguised}} as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of François Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the House of Grimaldi where François is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).|$|E

5|$|Notable arms {{attributed}} to biblical figures include {{the arms of}} Jesus based on the instruments of the Passion, and the shield of the Trinity. Medieval literature attributed coats of arms to the Nine Worthies, including Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and King Arthur. Arms were given to many kings predating heraldry, including Edward the Confessor and William I of England. These attributed arms were sometimes used in practice as quarterings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> their descendants.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, the Hardys {{announced}} their departure from TNA, after contract talks broke down {{between the two}} parties. Though the two sides were reportedly close to a contract agreement, talks began to break down and changes in management prompted their departure from the company. The TNA World Tag Team Championships were vacated due to the Hardys' departure and was explained on TNA television in a segment where The Hardys would teleport to their next Expedition of Gold destination, but a technicality resulted in them disappearing and the belts appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Decay.|$|E
5|$|The undifferenced {{arms of the}} Kingdom were {{eventually}} granted to Essex County Council in 1932. Seaxes were also used in the insignia {{of many of the}} boroughs and urban districts in the county, while the Saxon crown came to be a common heraldic charge in English civic arms. On the creation of the Greater London Council in 1965 a Saxon crown was introduced in its coat of arms. Seaxes appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> several London borough councils and of Spelthorne Borough Council, whose area was in Middlesex.|$|E

Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, {{as well as the}} Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of dirt and sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{character}} underwent {{a dramatic change}} in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon and Phyllis.

5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita {{is in the}} clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as {{he was telling the}} truth and plunges into the sky.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 2008, the House of Commons {{was granted}} its own heraldic symbol {{following}} {{a request by}} Commons Speaker Peter Milliken to the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The new symbol for Parliament is a badge of the escutcheon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> Canada superimposed on the mace used by the House of Commons {{as a symbol of}} its authority derived from the Crown. The Senate was granted a similar badge on 15 April 2008, using its own mace. Parliament as a whole has been granted the right to use the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada, superimposed over the maces of the Commons and Senate in saltire.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, Hardy {{announced}} that {{both he and}} Jeff had finally left TNA, following years of speculation, with their contracts expiring that week. Though the two sides were reportedly close to a contract agreement, talks began to break down and changes in management prompted their departure from the company. The TNA World Tag Team Championships were vacated due to the Hardys' departure and was explained on TNA television in a segment where The Hardys would teleport to their next Expedition of Gold destination, but a technicality resulted in them disappearing and the belts appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Decay.|$|E
5|$|Several ancient English towns {{displayed}} the Royal Arms of England upon their seals and, when {{it occurred to}} them to adopt insignia of their own, used the Royal Arms, albeit with modification, as their inspiration. For instance, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> New Romney, the field is changed from red to blue. Hereford changes the lions from gold to silver, and in the 17th century was granted a blue border charged with silver saltires in allusion to its siege by a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The town council of Faversham changes only the hindquarters of the three lions to silver. Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions in reference to its royal patronage and the Norman kings' influence upon {{the early history of}} Berkshire.|$|E
