40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a {{model in}} which individuals care about both consumption (intrinsic utility) and social status. Status depends on public perceptions about an <b>individual's</b> <b>predispositions</b> {{rather than on the}} individual's actions. However, since predispositions are unobservable, actions signal predispositions and therefore affect status. When status is sufficiently important relative to intrinsic utility, many individuals conform to a rigid standard of behavior, despite heterogeneous intrinsic preferences. When status is relatively unimportant, no conformity emerges. The model produces both customs and fads, and it suggests an explanation for the development of multiple subcultures with distinct norms.

40|$|Numerous {{analyses}} {{have found}} that people infected with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) are predisposed to harbor either many or few worms. Members of the same household also tend to harbor similar numbers of worms. These phenomena are called <b>individual</b> <b>predisposition</b> and household clustering respectively. In this article, we use Bayesian methods to fit a statistical model to worm count data collected from a cohort of participants at baseline and after two rounds of re-infection following curative treatment. We show that <b>individual</b> <b>predisposition</b> is extremely weak once the clustering effect of the household has been accounted for. This suggests that predisposition is of limited importance to the epidemiology of roundworm infection. Further, we show that {{over half of the}} variability in average worm counts among households is explained by household risk factors. This implies that exposures to infectious roundworm eggs shared by household members are important determinants of household clustering. We argue that these results support the hypothesis proposed in the literature that the household is a key focus of roundworm transmission...|$|E

40|$|Various {{follow-up}} {{studies of}} children hospitalized with bronchiolitis caused by {{respiratory syncytial virus}} have demonstrated that {{a significant proportion of}} infants (50 %) have recurrent wheezing during childhood. Nevertheless, the relationship between these two entities, if any, has not been established. In order to explain this observation, several hypotheses have been proposed. The first suggests that some children could have an <b>individual</b> <b>predisposition</b> to bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus and recurrent wheezing. The virus could be a marker of this condition, and the <b>individual</b> <b>predisposition</b> could in turn be related to an individual hypersensitivity to common allergens (atopy), airway hyperreactivity, or to some disorder related to pulmonary anatomy or physiology that was present before the acute episode of bronchiolitis. Another hypothesis proposes that respiratory syncytial virus could be directly responsible for recurrent wheezing. During an episode of bronchiolitis, the damage in the airway mucosa caused by the vital inflammatory response to infection contributes to sensitivity to other allergens or exposes irritant receptors, resulting in recurrent wheezing. For this review, we analyzed the studies that discuss these hypotheses with the purpose of clarifying the mechanisms for the important issue of recurrent wheezing in childhood...|$|E

A detailed clinical assessment, a definite etiologic diagnosis, as well as the presence/absence of known risk factors for ischemic stroke were obtained for each patient.

40|$|Emotionally {{traumatic}} {{experiences can}} lead to debilitating anxiety disorders, such as phobias and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Exposure to such experiences, however, {{is not sufficient to}} induce pathology, as only up to one quarter of people exposed to such events develop PTSD. These statistics, combined with findings that smaller hippocampal size prior to the trauma is associated with higher risk of developing PTSD, suggest that there are pre-disposing factors for such pathology. Because prospective studies in humans are limited and costly, investigating such pre-dispositions, and thus advancing understanding of the genesis of such pathologies, requires the use of animal models where predispositions are identified before the emotional trauma. Most existing animal models are retrospective: they classify subjects as those with or without a PTSD-like phenotype long after experiencing a traumatic event. Attempts to create prospective animal models have been largely unsuccessful. Here we report that <b>individual</b> <b>predispositions</b> to a PTSD-like phenotype, consisting of impaired rate and magnitude of extinction of an emotionally traumatic event coupled with long-lasting elevation of acoustic startle responses, can be revealed following exposure to a mild stressor, but before experiencing emotional trauma. We compare, in rats, the utility of several classification criteria and report that a combination of criteria based on acoustic startle responses and behavior in an anxiogenic environment is a reliable predictor of a PTSD-like phenotype. There are <b>individual</b> <b>predispositions</b> to developing impaired extinction and elevated acoustic startle that can be identified after exposure to a mildly stressful event, which by itself does not induce such a behavioral phenotype.
