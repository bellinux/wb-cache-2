2500|$|Side Note: This joke is {{a play on}} {{the fact}} that in Russia it is {{believed}} that three is the optimal number of people for drinking. This in turn goes back to when in the Soviet Union a bottle of vodka cost 2.87 Soviet rubles, 3 rubles being a convenient price for three men to buy a bottle and have 13 kopecks left <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>snack.</b> The classic for the latter was a rectangular pack of soft processed cheese [...] "Druzhba" [...] (Friendship), with that exact price.
