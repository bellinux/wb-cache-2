5|$|When United States agents {{discovered}} that the German merchant ship Ypiranga was carrying illegal arms to Mexico, President Wilson ordered the Navy to stop the ship from docking {{at the port of}} Veracruz. On 21 April 1914, a naval brigade of marines and sailors occupied Veracruz. A total of 55 Medals of Honor were awarded for acts of heroism at Veracruz, the largest number ever <b>granted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>action.</b>|$|R

50|$|During {{its first}} 6 months in office, the First Labour Government issued a {{circular}} that removed restrictions on <b>grants</b> <b>for</b> health services, <b>an</b> <b>action</b> {{which led to}} the extension of welfare schemes for childhood and maternity. About 70 new infant welfare centres had been opened, more health visitors had been appointed, many more beds had been provided in homes for mothers and babies, and the milk supply was extended in 16 cases. As a result of the new circular, for TB, about 1,500 new beds had been arranged by the local authorities. In May 1924, a grant of £1 million was made from a Road Fund to assist the rural areas in England and Wales to improve their roads.|$|R
40|$|The {{judicial}} discretion to <b>grant</b> leave <b>for</b> <b>a</b> derivative <b>action,</b> {{in terms of}} s 165 (5) (b) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, involves a tension between two equally important policy objectives. On the one hand is {{the benefit of a}} right of redress, where a stakeholder may seek redress on the company’s behalf; on the other hand is the indisputable need to protect companies and their directors from nuisance actions by stakeholders. The guiding criteria <b>for</b> the <b>granting</b> of leave attempt to draw a proper balance between these two objectives. They serve as checks and balances to curtail the abuse of the derivative action, by weeding out claims that are frivolous, vexatious or meritless. Much depends on the application by the courts of the open-textured criteria for leave to institute derivative proceedings. The legislature has left it to the courts to flesh out the interpretation, application and contours of the guiding criteria and, thereby, to determine effectively {{the success or failure of}} this remedy in South African law. This article focuses on two leading criteria, namely that the proposed action must involve the ‘trial of a serious question of material consequence to the company’, and that it must be ‘in the best interests of the company’. Guidelines are suggested for the proper judicial approach to these preconditions <b>for</b> <b>a</b> derivative <b>action,</b> based on the jurisprudence developed in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, all of which have influenced the relevant provisions of the Companies Act.
