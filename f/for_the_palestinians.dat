5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples.

Initially, many Shi'a had sympathy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> and a few had been drawn to the Lebanese Communist Party, but after 1970s Black September, {{there was a sudden}} influx of armed Palestinians to the Shi'a areas. South Lebanon's {{population}} is mainly Shi'a and the Palestinians soon set up base there for their attacks against the Israelis. The Palestinian movement quickly squandered its influence with the Shi'ite, as radical factions ruled by the gun in much of Shi'ite-inhabited southern Lebanon, where the refugee camps happened to be concentrated, and the mainstream PLO proved either unwilling or unable to rein them in.|$|E

25|$|In September 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter invited President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin to {{meet with}} him at Camp David, and on 11 September they agreed on a {{framework}} for peace between Israel and Egypt, and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It set out broad principles to guide negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. It also established guidelines for a West Bank–Gaza transitional regime of full autonomy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> residing in these territories, and for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with President Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The final piece of territory to be repatriated was Taba, adjacent to Eilat, returned in 1989. The Arab League reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic fundamentalist members of the Egyptian army who opposed peace with Israel. Following the agreement Israel and Egypt became the two largest recipients of U.S. military and financial aid (Iraq and Afghanistan have now overtaken them).|$|E

2500|$|According to Nathan Thrall, from [...] Elliott Abrams's inside {{accounts}} of negotiations between 2001 and 2005, {{it would appear}} to be an inescapable conclusion that violence [...] played an effective role in shaking Israeli complacency and furthering Palestinian goals: the U.S. endorsed the idea of a Palestinian State, Ariel Sharon became the first Israeli Prime Minister to affirm the same idea, and even spoke of Israel's [...] "occupation", and [...] the bloodshed was such that Sharon also decided to withdraw from Gaza, an area he long imagined Israel keeping.

2500|$|Through soul-searching in the {{aftermath}} of the Holocaust, [...] "there was a revolution in Christian theology in America. [...] The greatest shift in Christian attitudes toward the Jewish people since Constantine converted the Roman Empire." [...] The rise of Christian Zionism—that is, religiously motivated Christian interest and support for the state of Israel—along with a growth of philo-Semitism (love of the Jewish people) has increased interest among American Evangelicals in Judaism, especially areas of commonality with their own beliefs (see also Jerusalem in Christianity). During the late 1940s, Evangelical proponents of the new Judeo-Christian approach lobbied Washington for diplomatic support of the new state of Israel. [...] The Evangelicals have never wavered in their support for Israel. On the other hand, by the late 1960s Mainline Protestant denominations and the National Council of Churches were showing more support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> than for the Israelis. Interest in and a positive attitude towards America's Judeo-Christian tradition has become mainstream among Evangelicals.|$|E
