The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the text.|$|E
25|$|Ornamental uses: Today, palms are {{valuable}} as ornamental plants {{and are often}} grown along streets in tropical and subtropical cities. Farther north, palms are a common feature in botanical gardens or as <b>indoor</b> <b>plants.</b> Few palms tolerate severe cold {{and the majority of}} the species are tropical or subtropical. The three most cold-tolerant species are Trachycarpus fortunei, native to eastern Asia, and Rhapidophyllum hystrix and Sabal minor, both native to the southeastern United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (b√©ton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside the feeling of being connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow people down and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings to give people a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted <b>indoor</b> <b>plants.</b> The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E

2500|$|Philodendron {{is a large}} genus of {{flowering}} plants in the Araceae family. , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepted 489 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the Araceae family. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and <b>indoor</b> <b>plants.</b> The name derives from the Greek words philo- or [...] "love, affection" [...] and dendron or [...] "tree". [...] They are commonly called by their generic name.|$|E
2500|$|The citrus {{mealybug}} can live [...] "on almost any flowering plant".

2500|$|The Festival architects {{tried to}} show by the design and layout of the South Bank Festival what could be {{achieved}} by applying modern town planning ideas. [...] The Festival Style, (also called [...] "Contemporary") combining modernism with whimsy and Englishness, influenced architecture, interior design, product design and typography in the 1950s. William Feaver describes the Festival Style as [...] "Braced legs, <b>indoor</b> <b>plants,</b> lily-of-the valley sprays of lightbulbs, aluminium lattices, Costswold-type walling with picture windows, flying staircases, blond wood, the thorn, the spike, the molecule." [...] The influence of the Festival Style was felt in the new towns, [...] and office blocks of the fifties. Harlow new town and the rebuilding of Coventry city centre are said to show {{the influence of the}} Festival Style [...] "in their light structures, picturesque layout and incorporation of works of art", and Coventry Cathedral (1962), designed by Basil Spence, one of the Festival architects, was dubbed [...] "The Festival of Britain at Prayer".|$|E
