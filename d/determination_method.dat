40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of various parameters such as <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> and step height and length of incremental flux on critical flux values were investigated. Experiments were carried out on a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treated municipal wastewater. Three of the five critical flux <b>determination</b> <b>methods,</b> such as flux linearity, 90 % permeability and flux cycling conducted in this study, indicated a decline in critical flux values as the step height of incremental flux increased. However, the hysteresis method and the two-third (2 / 3) flux limitation method showed an increase and independence of critical flux to the step height of incremental flux, respectively. On the other hand, the step length of incremental flux had no obvious effect on critical flux values evaluated by all critical flux <b>determination</b> <b>methods.</b> Like critical flux, sustainable flux has negative relationship {{with the increase of}} step height but no influence of step length was found in this study...|$|R

50|$|In protein structure, STRIDE (Structural identification) is an {{algorithm}} for {{the assignment}} of protein secondary structure elements given the atomic coordinates of the protein, as defined by X-ray crystallography, protein NMR, or another protein structure <b>determination</b> <b>method.</b> In addition to the hydrogen bond criteria used by the more common DSSP algorithm, the STRIDE assignment criteria also include dihedral angle potentials. As such, its criteria for defining individual secondary structures are more complex than those of DSSP. The STRIDE energy function contains a hydrogen-bond term containing a Lennard-Jones-like 8-6 distance-dependent potential and two angular dependence factors reflecting the planarity of the optimized hydrogen bond geometry. The criteria for individual secondary structural elements, which are divided into the same groups as those reported by DSSP, also contain statistical probability factors derived from empirical examinations of solved structures with visually assigned secondary structure elements extracted from the Protein Data Bank.|$|E
50|$|Attitude {{control for}} CubeSats relies on miniaturizing {{technology}} without significant performance degradation. Tumbling typically occurs {{as soon as}} a CubeSat is deployed, due to asymmetric deployment forces and bumping with other CubeSats. Some CubeSats operate normally while tumbling, but those that require pointing in a certain direction or cannot operate safely while spinning, must be detumbled. Systems that perform attitude determination and control include reaction wheels, magnetorquers, thrusters, star trackers, Sun sensors, Earth sensors, angular rate sensors, and GPS receivers and antennas. Combinations of these systems are typically seen in order to take each method's advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. Reaction wheels are commonly utilized for their ability to impart relatively large moments for any given energy input, but reaction wheel's utility is limited due to saturation, the point at which a wheel cannot spin faster. Examples of CubeSat reaction wheels include the Maryland Aerospace MAI-101 and the Sinclair Interplanetary RW-0.03-4. Reaction wheels can be desaturated with the use of thrusters or magnetorquers. Thrusters can provide large moments by imparting a couple on the spacecraft but inefficiencies in small propulsion systems cause thrusters to run out of fuel rapidly. Commonly found on nearly all CubeSats are magnetorquers which run electricity through a solenoid to take advantage of Earth's magnetic field to produce a turning moment. Attitude-control modules and solar panels typically feature built-in magnetorquers. For CubeSats that only need to detumble, no attitude <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> beyond an angular rate sensor or electronic gyroscope is necessary.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccurate {{numerical}} homogenization necessitates the thorough {{determination of}} the Representative Volume Element (RVE). There exists several seminal works {{on the notion of}} the RVE in homogenization, its definitions and <b>methods</b> of <b>determination</b> for efficient computation of composite effective properties. The objective of the current work is to assess the ability of numerical RVE <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> to deliver accurate effective properties of composite materials. This paper demonstrates that common and well-established RVE <b>determination</b> <b>methods,</b> based on studying the convergence rate of the effective properties with respect to the volume element size, are invalid for the case of composites reinforced by randomly oriented fibers and yield erroneous estimates of their effective properties. Following the failure of traditional RVE <b>determination</b> <b>methods,</b> we proposed a new RVE determination criterion that is not based on the average property stability, but its statistical variations. Our new proposed criterion {{has been shown to be}} more accurate than other criteria in computing the effective properties of composites for aspect ratios up to 60. Moreover, the proposed criterion does not necessitate a convergence study over the volume element size, hence reducing considerably the RVE determination cost. Finally, our work questions the validity of many published works dealing with composites including heterogeneities of high aspect ratios...|$|R
