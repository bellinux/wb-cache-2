5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was <b>engendered</b> <b>by</b> the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House {{asserted}} that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast, toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance {{along the road to}} Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously, although not knowing it at the time, alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather <b>engendered</b> <b>by</b> tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, <b>engendered</b> <b>by</b> a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E

Encroachment from rising sea levels: This is a more dramatic and permanent example of encroachment from flooding whose major effects are predicted to become evident over the coming decades.

40|$|Ricoeur {{advances}} {{a theory}} of metaphor as discourse. The notion of metaphor as event and as meaning {{is complicated by the}} form of written discourse and the distanciation which inscription <b>engenders.</b> <b>By</b> specifying the autonomy of the text in relation to the author's intention, the original audience, and the original context, Ricoeur argues that metaphor refers to its own world. Suggesting that the metaphorical arises from a "seeing-as" which contains a non-verbal element, he contends metaphors indicate a extra-linguistic mode of existence. The possibility of conceptualization lies for Ricoeur, {{at the core of the}} dynamism of the metaphorical.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{conjecture}} concerning the scope ambiguities {{that arise in}} sentences including multiple nonreferential quantifiers. We claim that many existing theories of the phenomenon fail to correctly limit the set of readings that such sentences <b>engender</b> <b>by</b> failing to distinguish between referential and non-referential quantifiers. Once the distinction is correctly drawn, we show that surface syntax can be made, via an extended notion of surface constituency, to identify the set of available differently-scoped readings for such sentences. We examine various English constructions {{to show that the}} scopings predicted by the conjecture are the only ones that are available to human language understanders. We show how to incorporate this conjecture into a theory of quantifier scope, by couching it in a unification-based Combinatory Categorial Grammar framework and implementing it in SICStus Prolog. Finally, we compare the proposal with related approaches to quantifier scope ambiguity...|$|R
40|$|Though [Pollard and Sag 1994] {{assumes that}} an {{unspecified}} {{variant of the}} formal logic of [Carpenter 1992] will provide a formalism for HPSG, a precise formulation of the envisaged formalism is not immediately obvious, primarily because a principal tenet of [Carpenter 1992], that feature structures represent partial information, seems to conflict with a principal tenet of [Pollard and Sag 1994], that feature structures represent abstract linguistic entities. This has caused many HPSGians to be mistakenly concerned with partial-information specific notions, such as subsumption, that are appropriate for the [Carpenter 1992] logic but inappropriate for the formalism [Pollard and Sag 1994] envisages. This paper hopes to allay this concern and the confusion it <b>engenders</b> <b>by</b> substituting [King 1989] for [Carpenter 1992] {{as the basis of}} the envisaged formalism.
