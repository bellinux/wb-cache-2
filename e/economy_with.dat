Of the country's total labor force of around 40.813 Million, the agricultural sector employs 30% of the labor force, and accounts for 14% of GDP. The industrial sector employs around 14% of the workforce and accounts for 30% of GDP. Meanwhile, the 47% of workers involved in the services sector are responsible for 56% of GDP.|$|E

For frictional markets {{that give rise to}} a convex-cone traded-payoff span and a sublinear payoff cost functional, the following three conditions are equivalent: viability, the extension property, and the absence of free lunches. Special cases in this class of markets include perfect-markets economies [Harrison and Kreps (1979) ], <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> proportional transaction costs [Jouini and Kallal (1992, 1995) ], <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> solvency constraints [Hindy (1995) ], <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> no-short-selling, and <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> any combination of these frictions.

50|$|The Friedman {{rule has}} been shown to be the welfare maximizing {{monetary}} policy in many economic models of money. It {{has been shown}} to be optimal in monetary <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> monopolistic competition (Ireland, 1996) and, under certain circumstances, in a variety of monetary economies where the government levies other distorting taxes. However, there do exist several notable cases where deviation from the Friedman Rule becomes optimal. These include <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> decreasing returns to scale; <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> imperfect competition where the government does not either fully tax monopoly profits or set the tax equal to the labor income tax; <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> tax evasion; <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> sticky prices; and <b>economies</b> <b>with</b> downward nominal wage rigidity. While normally deviations from the Friedman Rule are typically small, if there is a significant foreign demand for a nation's currency, such as in the United States, the optimal rate of inflation is found to deviate significantly from what is called for by Friedman Rule in order to extract seigniorage revenue from foreign residents. In the case of the United States, where over half of all U.S. dollars are held overseas, the optimal rate of inflation is found to be anywhere from 2 to 10%, whereas the Friedman Rule would call for deflation of almost 4%.|$|R
