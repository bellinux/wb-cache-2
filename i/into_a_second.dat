5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack.

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, the SS had consolidated into its final form, which comprised three main organizations: the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände, and the Waffen-SS, {{which was founded in}} 1934 as the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) and renamed in 1940. The Waffen-SS evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> German army alongside the Wehrmacht and operated in tandem with them, especially with the Heer (German Army). Although SS ranks generally had equivalents in the other services, the SS rank system did not copy the terms and ranks used by the Wehrmacht's branches. Instead it used the ranks established by the post-World War I Freikorps and the SA. This was primarily done to emphasize the SS as being independent from the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|During the War in Defence of the Constitution in 1792, Piattoli {{found himself}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission to Dresden, where he stayed after the Commonwealth's defeat {{at the hands of}} Imperial Russia resulted in the Second Partition of Poland. In Dresden and nearby Leipzig, Piattoli was active in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Kolłątaj. In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service. In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, and in negotiations with the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> republic in Europe. At the same time, he was involved in much more conservative negotiations with Russians.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many {{opposition}} figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe {{was sentenced to death}} in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings have dark grey {{or brown}} down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The plumage of {{juvenile}} birds {{in their first}} moult resembles that of the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker.

Birds in their second year moult <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> immature phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more immature brown plumage. Determining the age and sex of birds in brown plumage can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.|$|E

Piquet benefited from his late stop by moving ahead into eighth after everyone had pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of the}} race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both Loïc Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running Piquet, who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E
5|$|The second assault proved no more successful. The red-coated English and the blue-coated Dutch {{advanced}} {{side by side}} {{in perfect}} order for a second attempt.

Again the Allies left many dead and wounded at the enemy palisade including Marshal Count von Limburg Styrum who had led the second assault. With broken ranks, and in confusion, the attacking troops fell once more back down the hill. With the Allies repulsed for a second time the exultant Bavarian grenadiers, with bayonets fixed, poured over their breastworks to pursue the attackers and drive them to defeat. But English guardsmen, aided by Lumley's dismounted cavalrymen, prevented a total rout, compelling the Bavarians back behind their defences.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{unsuccessful}} searches {{were carried out}} in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germán. On May 23, 1824, the Mayagüez military commander prepared two vessels {{and sent them to}} Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofresí. Rivas and the military captain of Mayagüez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebastián Bausá. Sailor Pedro Alacán, best known as the grandfather of Ramón Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofresí, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fernández de Córdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fernández was connected to Cofresí through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in Bonne Sophie incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofresí docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan José Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for a mission of that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns.|$|E
5|$|Bellevue's {{history of}} skyscrapers {{began with the}} {{completion}} of the Paccar Tower in 1970; this structure is regarded as the city's first high-rise. High-rise building construction remained slow until 1982, when the city's first skyscraper building boom took shape. Eight of the city's 24 tallest buildings were completed within the next seven years, including City Center Bellevue, which was the tallest building in Bellevue for almost two decades. The skyscraper construction boom ended in 1989, and subsequently only one high-rise which ranked among the city's tallest structures was completed in the 1990s. Beginning in 2000, Bellevue entered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> much larger building boom that continued to 2010. More than half of Bellevue's twenty tallest buildings were completed after 2000; nine projects were completed in 2008 alone, including Bellevue Towers. Overall, Bellevue's skyline is ranked third in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, after Seattle and Portland.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, eight German-built Orjen-class MTBs were added. Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was {{established}} {{under the command}} of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at Selce, Šibenik and Đenovići. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht Lada had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper D2. The training ship Sitnica had been converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> submarine depot ship, and the Galeb-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht Dragor, two patrol boats—Graničar and Stražar, and three river tugs; Cer, Triglav and Avala. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were Dubrovnik and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attaché observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very good. He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding. During 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited Corfu, and Zmaj and three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.|$|E
5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to summon the Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E
