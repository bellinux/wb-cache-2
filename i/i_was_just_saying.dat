500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|By coincidence, Olympic team {{training}} {{took place}} in Tarwater's hometown of Knoxville. At the Olympics, Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men's 4×200-meter relay. His time of 1:46.33 was a personal best, and the second-fastest leg for Team USA, which turned in the fastest preliminary swim, and third-fastest among all 64 swimmers. He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games. Of his Olympic experience, Tarwater said, [...] "Even at 28, {{with a lot of}} international experience, nothing matches the Olympics. [...] My heart was pumping so intensely that I was just trying to calm myself down. [...] Standing on the blocks, waiting to take the exchange, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Breathe. [...] Breathe. [...] Breathe.'... It's such a rush." [...] Typically, the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries. In 2012, however, the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve, as Phelps would swim the relay final despite dropping the individual 200-meter freestyle from his program. [...] After Tarwater's fast preliminary swim, the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals, before electing to go with Berens due to Berens' greater experience. In the finals, the U.S. relay team beat the second-place French team by three seconds, winning Tarwater a gold medal.|$|E

5000|$|Manager Eamon O'Shea {{speaking}} {{after the}} match {{said that people}} should reassess their estimation of the team since the defeat to Galway {{in the league in}} March, saying [...] "We have played eight times, won six, and my belief is that we should have won the league final and we lost the game against Limerick in the last minute.I just think {{there needs to be a}} reassessment of that from commentators. When you win six games, surely it can't all be bad. The loss to Limerick was not a good result but there was a cycle where we were playing games within a range of playing well. I didn't feel we went outside of that range. We didn't play that well against Limerick - we certainly didn't finish it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not saying that the assessment <b>is</b> completely wrong. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> that you need to look at the whole thing in totality because there may be a different view there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were talking}} of you," [...] {{observed}} the last, [...] "at {{the very moment}} you appeared. Ravensnest is now becoming a valuable property; and its income, added to the products of this large and very excellent farm {{that you have in}} your own hands, should keep a country house, not only in abundance, but with something more. You will naturally think of marrying ere long, and your mother and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> that you ought to build a good, substantial stone dwelling on this very spot, and settle down on your own property. Nothing contributes so much to the civilization of a country, as to dot it with a gentry, and you will both give and receive advantages by adopting such a course. It is impossible for those who have never been witnesses of the result, to appreciate the effect produced by one gentleman's family in a neighborhood, in the way of manners, tastes, general intelligence, and civilization at large." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am delighted," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{am afraid}} that I am a little awed, too, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> to father before you came that I felt an {{efficiency}} expert must be a very superior sort of person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he's {{discovered}} the telephone," [...] she said. [...] "He's spending the morning ringing up {{people all over}} the country. He was talking to his bankers when we came out. Oh, here come the rest of them. How tired they look, poor things--especially the Baron! Nature never meant him to tramp over ploughed fields, I am sure. Baron, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> how warm you look." ...|$|E
6000|$|FANNY. Yes, that's what I feel--that you are {{worrying}} yourselves {{too much}} about me. You're too conscientious, all of you. You, in particular, Jane, because you know you're not strong.

6000|$|... "About that tent business," [...] said Kennedy. [...] "Of {{course that}} was all rot what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>just</b> now. <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} remembered that I didn't particularly want anybody but you to hear what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to say, so I had to invent any rot that I could think of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As your {{commanding}} officer," [...] O'Connor said gravely, [...] "I cannot {{permit the}} exchange to be made, Mr. Conway.

6000|$|With skilful haste he {{administered}} a little sal volatile and nux vomica to the swooning patient; while Hilda set about remedying the damage. [...] "That's better," [...] Sebastian said, in a mollified tone, {{when she had}} brought another basin. There was a singular note of cloaked triumph in his voice. [...] "Now, we'll begin again.... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying,</b> gentlemen, before this accident, that I had seen only ONE case of this peculiar form of the tendency before; and that case was the notorious"--he kept his glittering eyes fixed harder on Hilda than ever--"the notorious Dr. Yorke-Bannerman." ...|$|E
5000|$|There was no {{physical}} evidence linking Jovanovic to the crime, and, in fact, while his accuser claimed she had been brutally attacked and left bleeding, {{there were only a}} few fading bruises later found.

60|$|The heavenly {{gentleness}} of {{his smile}} made his apologies irresistible.

In truth, we were almost TOO nicely off for Trousers; we were quite overwhelmed by them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> about to <b>say</b> so, {{when the door opened}} again, and an element of worldly disturbance entered the room, in the person of Miss Verinder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, as I hadn't {{time to read}} them, and as I {{knew you}} would not like them to <b>be</b> wasted, <b>I</b> sold them to a bloke who peruses them from morning till night.

60|$|ANDERSON. That's well said. On those terms, sir, I {{will accept}} your enmity or any man's. Judith: Mr. Dudgeon will stay to tea. Sit down: {{it will take}} a few minutes to draw by the fire. (Richard glances at him with a troubled face; then sits down with his head bent, to hide a convulsive {{swelling}} of his throat.) <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> to my wife, Mr. Dudgeon, that enmity-- (she grasps his hand and looks imploringly at him, doing both with an intensity that checks him at once) Well, well, I mustn't tell you, I see; but it was nothing that need leave us worse friend--enemies, I mean. Judith is a great enemy of yours.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} think so, Billy ?" [...] asked the lawyer, with cool derision. [...] "Well, we all abuse our {{privileges}} at every opportunity, of course; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> that I abused mine; and I suppose those fellows would abuse theirs if you happened to hurt their wives' and daughters' feelings. And {{how are you going}} to manage? Aren't you afraid that they will hang around, after the show, indefinitely, unless you ask all those who have not received invitations to the dance and supper to clear the grounds, as they do in the circus when the minstrels are going to give a performance not included in the price of admission? Mind, I don't care anything about your Social Union." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were quarrelling {{about the}} Universe, Captain Fort," [...] {{said the man}} in khaki; [...] "delighted to have your help. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> that this {{particular}} world has no particular importance, {{no more than a}} newspaper-seller would accord to it if it were completely destroyed tomorrow--''Orrible catastrophe, total destruction of the world--six o'clock edition-pyper!' I say that it will become again the nebula out of which it was formed, and by friction with other nebula re-form into a fresh shape and so on ad infinitum--but I can't explain why. My wife wonders if it exists at all except in the human mind--but she can't explain what the human mind is. My father-in-law thinks that it is God's hobby--but he can't explain who or what God is. Nollie is silent. And Monsieur Lavendie hasn't yet told us what he thinks. What do you think, monsieur?" [...] The thin-faced, big-eyed man put up his hand to his high, veined brow as if he had a headache, reddened, and began to speak in French, which Fort followed with difficulty.|$|E
6000|$|Mother leaped up, furious, and snapped, [...] "I'm simply {{ashamed of}} you, {{the way you}} act, like you never would grow up and get a little common sense, what with scaring me into conniption fits, and as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to <b>say,</b> and I only say it for your own good, if you haven't got enough sense to know how little sense you have got, you at your time of life, why, well, all I can say is--you ought to know better." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ethel did {{not like}} {{anything}} to {{be said to be}} too hard for her, and was very near pleading she only wanted time, but some recollection came across her, and presently she said, [...] "I suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to want to learn more, in one's own way, when one is told it is not good for one. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> hated being a woman, and having these tiresome little trifles--my duty--instead of learning, which is yours, Norman." ...|$|R

But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wanting <b>just</b> to <b>say</b> {{a word to}} {{you about}} that poor young ooman there." [...] This he said in a slow, half-hesitating voice, as though he could hardly bring himself to speak of the unfortunate one to whom he alluded. The Vicar muttered some word of assent, and then the miller went on. [...] "You knows, of course, as how she be back here at the mill?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Now I {{come to the}} {{incident}} that drew from Jimmy his extraordinary statement. I was smoking {{with him in his}} rooms one evening, when a clatter at his door was followed by a thud on the floor. I knew as well as Jimmy what had happened. In his pre-Saturday days he had no letter-box, only a slit in the door; and through this we used to denounce him on certain occasions when we called and he would not let us in. Lately, however, he had fitted up a letter-box himself, which kept together if you opened the door gently, but came clattering to the floor under the weight of heavy letters. The letter to which it had succumbed this evening was quite a package, and could even have been used as a missile. Jimmy snatched it up quickly, evidently knowing the contents by their bulk; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> to myself, [...] "More proofs from the Saturday," [...] when the letter burst at the bottom, and in a moment a score of smaller letters were tumbling about my feet. In vain did Jimmy entreat me to let him gather them up. I helped, and saw, to my bewilderment, that all the letters were addressed in childish hands to [...] "Uncle Jim, care of Editor of Mothers Pets." [...] It was impossible that Jimmy could have so many nephews and nieces.|$|E
