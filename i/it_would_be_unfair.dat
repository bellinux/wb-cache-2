25|$|Police {{disciplinary}} {{charges were}} abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and, {{because he was}} unavailable, it was decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to proceed with disciplinary charges against Bernard Murray. Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension.|$|E
60|$|You say, {{that you}} also have {{something}} to complain of; then state it to me immediately: <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very <b>unfair,</b> and very contrary to my disposition, not to hear {{both sides of the}} question.|$|R

25|$|In 1984, Guste {{announced}} that his office {{would no longer}} enforce blue laws after a federal judge, Charles Schwartz of New Orleans, ruled that three particular department stores could open on Sundays. Guste said that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give some businesses an advantage over their competitors by allowing only those given court permission to open on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Passenger fare {{subsidies}} are unpopular outside Metro Manila, with subsidy opponents claiming that their taxes {{are being used}} to subsidize Metro Manila commuters without any benefit to the countryside, and that the fare subsidies should be used for infrastructure improvements {{in the rest of the}} country. In his 2013 State of the Nation Address, President Benigno Aquino III claimed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> for non-Metro Manila residents to use their taxes to subsidize the LRT and MRT. However, supporters of the subsidies claimed that the rest of the country benefits economically from efficient transportation in Metro Manila.|$|E
25|$|Failure to enjoin the unconstitutional statute {{would require}} the person subject to a {{potential}} violation to either pay the increased rate or face the threat of prosecution. Therefore, the Court determined that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to require challengers of a law to wait until they faced a harsh sanction before they could bring any kind of action questioning the validity of that law. The Court also noted that, although {{a number of cases}} had held that the state itself could not be sued, those cases did not prohibit enjoining a state official, as an individual, from carrying out some task on behalf of the state.|$|E
50|$|The closure was {{subsequently}} brought forward {{and the channel}} closed down on Friday 23 December 2005 at 18:00 (GMT).

Of course I'm very grateful, particularly as I have no claim on you." ...|$|R
25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the June 1915 King's Birthday Honours, {{having been}} {{passed over for}} the honour in February. He was invited to speak at a Cabinet meeting in summer 1915. In the summer of 1915 Wilson {{believed}} that the French government might fall, or France herself seek peace, unless the British committed to the mooted Loos offensive. He declined French’s offer of a corps command (20 August) claiming <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to divisional commanders who deserved promotion. His efforts {{to be the main}} go-between of French and Joffre ended in September 1915, when it was decided that these contacts should go through Sidney Clive, the British liaison officer at GQG.|$|E
25|$|In 260, {{the fourth}} Wei emperor, Cao Mao, {{attempted}} a coup to seize back {{power from the}} regent, Sima Zhao, who had been monopolising state power since 255. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan (司馬幹), heard of the coup and tried to enter the palace to help his brother. However, he was denied entry by Sun You (孫佑), an officer guarding the main gate, {{so he had to}} enter the palace through another gate. When Sima Zhao found out why Sima Gan showed up late, he wanted to execute Sun You and his family. However, Xun Xu advised him against it by pointing out that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> and unjust to punish Sun You's family as well. Sima Zhao heeded Xun Xu's advice and punished Sun You only, by demoting him to the status of a commoner.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a public}} {{authority}} so conducts itself as {{to create a}} legitimate expectation that a certain course will <b>be</b> followed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> often <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> if the authority were permitted to follow a different course {{to the detriment of}} one who entertained the expectation, particularly if he acted on it. ... The doctrine of legitimate expectation is rooted in fairness.|$|R

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
500|$|Branson also later thanked local {{residents}} {{for their help}} at the accident site, describing how he [...] "was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round, opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress". Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There {{are so many people}} who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E

"You {{have acted}} rightly, Miles," [...] said the mother, [...] "for <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unfair</b> and selfish to have induced the poor girl to accept {{you until you}} had some {{prospect}} of a home to give her. God will bless you for doing the right, and trusting to Him. And now, dear boy, are you prepared for bad news?" ...|$|R
50|$|On September 3, 2013, Hernandez's lawyers filed a {{postponement}} request {{in federal}} court until his murder charges were resolved. They said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> legally <b>unfair</b> to Hernandez to permit the lawsuit to continue {{while he was on}} trial in the shooting death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd. In February 2016, Hernandez reached a settlement with Bradley over the lawsuit. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{courts have}} applied the doctrine. In Hanrahan v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme (Ireland) Ltd. 1988 ILRM 629 {{the supreme court}} held that in cases of {{nuisance}} {{the burden of proof}} could be shifted to the defendant where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> palpably <b>unfair</b> for the plaintiff to have to prove something beyond their reach. The facts concerned positioning of farm animals downwind of a chemical plant.|$|R
500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he can do at this time." ...|$|E
500|$|The acting {{was also}} praised by many critics; Lejeune {{wrote that the}} actors portray [...] "real people doing real things under real conditions", while the {{reviewer}} for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "a talented cast sees to it that no island character study shall go unnoticed", while the lead roles [...] "make {{the most of their}} opportunities". The reviewer for the Manchester Guardian considered Radford to have played his part [...] "with unusual subtlety", and thought that among the remainder of the cast [...] "there are so many excellent performances that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to pick out two or three names for special praise". The critic Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, thought that Radford and Watson were the stand-out actors of the film, although he also considered the rest of the cast strong.|$|E
500|$|The album {{did receive}} some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of [...] "slid past notes and draw out the final syllables of lines are {{signatures}} indistinguishable from tics". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's [...] "delicate upper range is nicely attuned {{to some of}} the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss". Mark Edwards of The Times called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his [...] "trademark delivery" [...] is [...] "lazy and somewhat slurred". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's [...] "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either. Hughes appropriately notes, [...] "Ain't nobody perfect".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't say that, Aunt Nesbit,' said Theodora. 'I shall act as, I hope, may deserve regard; but I don't want anybody's fortune, and if {{you left}} me yours <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very <b>unfair,</b> and I {{certainly}} should give {{at least half of}} it to Arthur. I give you fair warning; but I did not come to talk of such hateful things, but to read to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gregory {{must keep}} those men," [...] she said. [...] "There's {{no doubt that}} Harry meant to do <b>it,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> horribly <b>unfair</b> to turn them loose now when there is {{absolutely}} nothing going on. Besides, Tom Moran is a man I'm specially sorry for. As I told you, he left a young wife and a very little child behind him {{when he came out}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see, dear, {{both for}} his sake {{and your own}} it must be {{publicly}} known that the engagement is broken by you, and not by him. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very <b>unfair</b> on him {{for it to be}} supposed that he has taken advantage of these rumours to break off his engagement, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> greatly injure you, as people would say that he must have become convinced of their truth.' ...|$|R
500|$|Her media {{appearances}} were criticised {{for their}} awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she [...] "fluffed her lines" [...] {{during an interview}} with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating." [...] The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as [...] "Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television".|$|E
500|$|A {{personal}} {{priority of}} Rutherford {{had been the}} establishment of a university. Though the Edmonton Bulletin opined that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> [...] "that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that {{they may be able to}} attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it", Rutherford proceeded quickly. [...] He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high quality non-sectarian system of post-secondary education. A bill establishing the University was passed by the legislature, but left the government to decide the location. Calgary felt that, having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there, and was not pleased a year later when the government announced the founding of the University of Alberta in Rutherford's hometown of Strathcona.|$|E
500|$|Asser's {{response}} to Alfred's request {{was to ask}} for time to consider the offer, as he felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St David's and half with Alfred. Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred with an answer in six months. On his return to Wales, however, Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of Caerwent for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote {{to find out the}} cause of the delay, and Asser responded that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred's court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St David's supported this, since they hoped Asser's influence with Alfred would avoid [...] "damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St David)".|$|E
5000|$|The Scottish Football Association's annual report, {{issued in}} May 1979, stated that, [...] "regardless of the {{depressing}} aspects of Mr MacLeod's latter {{days in the}} Association's employ, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>unfair</b> not to comment that he was largely responsible for kindling an enthusiasm for the Scottish team that far exceeded anything which had gone before. The Association benefited considerably from that enthusiasm and should not forget it".|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of duress, the {{defendant}} has committed the act {{in response to a}} threat of death or serious personal injury to himself or a loved one, or someone towards whom he feels responsible. Therefore he is removed of fault as his actions were done to prevent such harm being done. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>unfair</b> to place the defendant at fault of a criminal action which he committed under duress.|$|R
25|$|For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, {{thinking}} {{they would have}} 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> clearly <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.|$|R
