40|$|For the {{lightweight}} <b>design</b> of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> of motorcycles, {{the knowledge of}} the way in which contact forces are transmitted by the tire is of crucial importance. In this paper, an analytical model of the tire is developed and explicit formulae giving the distribution of the radial and axial forces acting on the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> for a given vertical load are derived. The analytical model is validated by means of a finite element method (FEM) model and experimental tests. The proposed analytical model is able to predict the radial deflection of both a front and a rear tire for a racing motorbike with very good accuracy over a wide range of inflating pressures and vertical loads. The force distributions are in very good agreement with the results of the FEM model. Experimental tests show that the force distribution at the interface between the tire and rim can be used to predict the stress distribution in the rim with a good accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model of crack path for two-dimensional p rimary crack {{situated in a}} railway <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> is <b>designed.</b> The railway <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> {{is placed on the}} wheel disc of railway wheel with interference fit. Crack behaviour is analysed in the case of rectilinear ride of a train under rolling cont act fatigue. Plank and Kuhn criterion is used to decide whether crack will either kink and follow mode I controlled (tensile mode) path, or it will propagate coplanar mode II controlled (shear mode). If mode I controlled crack growth is more probable then a direction of crack propagation is predicted using the maximum tensile stress range criterion. In this way a relationship between stress intensity factors and crack geometry is obtained. For comparison, crack behaviour in a solid railway wheel which is not subjected to pre-stress loading is also analysed. In the latter case the contact forces in the wheel-rail contact are considered to have i) only normal part ii) both the normal part and tangential part...|$|R

This article summarized and analyzed force of the forklift's <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> according to the typical working conditions of forklift, and calculated the load of various working conditions.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} detect leaks {{on the surface of}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufactured by aluminum die casting and forging. Leaks in the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> may be caused by temperature gradient differences during the cooling period, impurities, or flowing air bubbles in the die casting process. We developed a new low-cost approach to detect leaks that only required a short inspection time by observing the movement of soap bubbles on the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. We <b>designed</b> new light sources to minimize mirror image effects and irregular luminance distributions on the curved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. A preprocessing procedure for image processing was also developed to determine the bubble configurations using threshold and morphology techniques. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the inspection system. The results demonstrated that leaks generated during the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufacturing process could be accurately detected even under various environmental lighting conditions...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{standards}} for the manufacturing inspection of railroad wheels using ultrasound, such as UIC 812, {{have been replaced by}} new standards, for example EN 13262 and RD 32. 144 - 2000, both requiring ultrasonic testing in immersion technique. These new standards require the development of an ultrasonic technique for 100 % coverage of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> and <b>wheel</b> hub, and in special cases for both straight and curved wheel disks. In order to encompass a large variety of railroad <b>wheel</b> <b>designs,</b> inspection and handling techniques should be capable of dealing with wheel diameters ranging from 600 mm to 1300 mm (23 " to 51 ") at testing cycles from 1 to 4 minutes per wheel. The current requirement for the minimum detectable flaw size is DSR 1 mm (disc shape reflector, DSR, 1 mm diameter) for high-speed train <b>wheels</b> <b>rims</b> and DSR 2 mm for all other <b>wheel</b> <b>rims.</b> The minimum detectable flaw size for all other wheel areas (hub and disk areas) is DSR 3 mm. To meet all these criteria, the Rail Wheel Inspection (RWI) System was developed by IZFP and their partners. The system consists of an ultrasonic testing sub-system, immersion tank and transportation/handling sub-systems. Test cycles of 1 minute per wheel require two immersion tanks and two transportation/handling subsystems. The ultrasonic sub-system features modular computer-aided 6 to 16 - channel UT electronics (PCUS 11) to employ 6 to 16 ultrasonic transducers (the precise number is determined by the testing procedure). This presentation paper offers descriptions of, and results from three of these systems that have been integrated into manufacturing processes at German and Russian wheel manufacturers, and provides details on the following topics: <b>Wheel</b> <b>rim</b> inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 4 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Bochum, Germany) <b>Wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> hub and disc inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 2 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Ilsenburg, Germany) <b>Wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> hub and disc inspection, dual-tank immersion technique, 1 minute inspection cycle per wheel (Nishny-Tagil, Russia...|$|R
