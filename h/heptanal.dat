30|$|<b>Heptanal</b> {{content was}} {{observed}} significantly {{more in the}} scented rice cultivars than non-scented one (Fig.  2). This confirms the contribution of <b>heptanal</b> towards rice aroma. Among the developmental stages, maximum <b>heptanal</b> was recorded at S 1 stage and decreased to its minimum at S 7 stage in both the scented rice cultivars. In many previous studies <b>heptanal</b> {{has been identified as}} a key odorant which gives floral tone to rice scent (Buttery et al. 1988; Yang et al. 2008; Mathure et al. 2014; Nadaf et al. 2016). <b>Heptanal</b> is a fatty acid derived volatile compound associated with green grassy aroma in plants. It is formed by auto-oxidation of palmitoleic acid (Wang et al. 2001). The significantly higher levels of <b>heptanal</b> at S 1 stage in both the scented rice cultivars might be due to higher level of fatty acid content during vegetative development. It is also a herbivore induced volatile and more active at early stages of development (Zhou et al. 2003; Aziz et al. 2015; Desurmont et al. 2015). In young leaves of coriander significantly higher level of <b>heptanal</b> was found which decreased further with maturation (Koharai et al. 2006). Moreover, higher level of <b>heptanal</b> was found during vegetative development in tomato (Wang et al. 2001) and early fruit developmental stages of cucumber (Chen et al. 2015).|$|E

Plant odors have been shown to affect responses to pheromone at various levels but how does pheromone affects plant odor perception? We recorded responses from neurons within the non-pheromonal "ordinary glome ruli" of the primary olfactory center, the antennal lobe (AL), to single and pulsed stimulations with the plant odorant <b>heptanal,</b> the pheromone, and their mixture in the male moth Agrotis ipsilon. We identified 3 physiological types of neurons according to their activity patterns combining excitatory and inhibitory phases. Both local and projection neurons were identified in each physiological type. Neurons with excitatory responses to <b>heptanal</b> responded also frequently to the pheromone and showed additive responses to the mixture. Moreover, the neuron 2 ̆ 7 s ability of resolving successive pulses generally improved with the mixture. Only some neurons with combined excitatory/inhibitory, or purely inhibitory responses to <b>heptanal,</b> also responded to the pheromone. Although individual mixture responses were not significantly different from <b>heptanal</b> responses in these neurons, pulse resolution was improved with the mixture as compared with <b>heptanal</b> alone.

30|$|In the {{correlation}} analysis of 14 OACs, 35 significant correlations were observed at seven developmental stages in three rice cultivars (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). Aldehydes showed significant positive correlations {{with each other}} and with alcohols and ketones (except hexanal and <b>heptanal).</b> Hexanal, <b>heptanal</b> and pentanal showed significant positive correlation with each other. Octanal, nonanal, decanal, phenylacetaldehyde, 1 -octanol and 2 -pentlyfuran were positively correlated with each other. 1 -octanol levels correlated positively with octanal, nonanal, decanal and phenylacetaldehyde and negatively with hexanal. 2 -Pentlyfuran correlated negatively with hexanal, <b>heptanal</b> and (E)- 3 -octen- 2 -one. (E)- 3 -Octen- 2 -one was positively correlated with <b>heptanal</b> and (E)- 2 -octenal. 1 -Octen- 3 -ol level was correlated positively with octanal. There was no significant correlation recorded between 2 AP and any OAC in both the scented rice cultivars. This indicated that 2 AP expression pattern was unique and specific throughout rice plant development. Mathure et al. (2014) observed positive correlation of 2 AP with 1 -tetradecene and indole and negative correlation with benzyl alcohol in correlation analysis of 23 headspace volatile compounds in mature grains of 91 rice cultivars. But in the present study among developmental stages in three rice cultivars no any positive or negative correlation was observed for 2 AP with other OAC. The correlations among the aliphatic aldehydes (<b>heptanal,</b> octanal, nonanal and decanal) recorded in the present study are in agreement with Mathure et al. (2014). These results revealed that 2 AP alone has different accumulation behavior and the remaining OACs have similar accumulation trend through out rice plant development.|$|E

Whereas synergistic effects of sex pheromones and plant odours have been observed at the behavioural level, most investigations at the peripheral level have shown an inhibition of pheromone responses by plant volatiles, suggesting a potential role of {{the central nervous system}} in reshaping the peripheral information. We thus investigated the interactions between sex pheromone and a behaviourally active plant volatile, <b>heptanal,</b> and their effects on responses of neurons in the pheromone-processing centre of the antennal lobe, the macroglomerular complex, in the moth Agrotis ipsilon. Our results show that most of these pheromone-sensitive neurons responded to the plant odour. Most neurons responded to the pheromone with a multiphasic pattern and were anatomically identified as projection neurons. They responded either with excitation or pure inhibition to <b>heptanal,</b> and the response to the mixture pheromone + <b>heptanal</b> was generally weaker than to the pheromone alone, showing a suppressive effect of <b>heptanal.</b> However, these neurons responded with a better resolution to pulsed stimuli. The other neurons with either purely excitatory or inhibitory responses to all three stimuli did not exhibit significant differences in responses between stimuli. Although the suppression of the pheromone responses in AL neurons by the plant odour is counter-intuitive at first glance, the observed better resolution of pulsed stimuli is probably more important than high sensitivity to the localization of a calling female...|$|E

In the present work, the solgel hybrid material was held in the pores of HF by in situ gelation and was used to extract the two test aldehydes using direct immersion sampling mode. Several solgel parameters affecting the extraction performance of the in-house sol-gel hybrid material were optimized.

A further aim was to develop a behavioral paradigm for testing suppression of com-ponents in mixtures using rodent subjects. Thirsty rats were initially trained to discriminate between the 2 aldehydes butanal and <b>heptanal</b> in an olfactometer using a go/no-go discrimination task. This involved rats learning to place their noses in a sniff port where odors were presented and to lick a tube for water reward when one of the aldehydes was presented (S+) while with-holding licking at the tube to the other, unrewarded, aldehyde (S). A mixture condition was then introduced into the task, whereby a proportion of trials involved presentation of a combination of the 2 aldehydes as an additional unrewarded condition. Rats readily learned to withhold licking on trials when the mixture was presented. The concentration of the nonrewarded (S) aldehyde in the mixture was then systematically decreased, whereas the concentration of the S+ component was held constant. This eventually caused the S+ component in the mixture to suppress detection of the S, as shown by an increasing number of lick responses (false alarms) on trials when the mixture was presented. These suppressing effects occurred well above the detection threshold for the S aldehyde presented alone. Results showed asymmetric suppression in the mixture condition such that butanal suppressed detection of <b>heptanal</b> at much lower concentrations than vice versa.

Intact oil samples and pure triacylglycerols obtained following elimination of tocopherols and minor compounds were oxidised at 60 °C, and volatile oxidation compounds were analysed by solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector and mass spectrometer. Results showed that while, as expected, hexanal was the major volatile oxidation compound found in oil and triacylglycerols rich in LA, both hexanal and <b>heptanal</b> equally were the most abundant compounds in oil and triacylglycerols rich in CLA. Besides, samples rich in CLA also showed significantly high quantities of trans- 2 -octenal and trans- 2 -nonenal and the latter, along with <b>heptanal,</b> were absent in samples rich in LA. Results for CLA samples were not easy to interpret since major volatiles found are not expected from theoretically stable hydroperoxides formed in CLA and could in part derive from dioxetanes coming from 1, 2 -cycloadditions of CLA with oxygen. Overall, results obtained support evidence that oxidation mechanisms of CLA may differ than those of LA.

40|$|Determination of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) in various matrices is often accomplished using solid phase microextraction (SPME) as a superior mode of extraction. Alternatively, another configuration of solid phase microextraction (SPME) namely hollow fiber-solid phase microextraction (HF-SPME) is a great approach to redress some limitations of the ordinary SPME fibers including fiber breakage, coating stripping and sample carry over. The HF-SPME technique highlights the use of hollow polypropylene (PP) membrane to hold and protect the adsorbent inside its lumen. Unlike the conventional SPME, the inexpensive HF device can be disposed after single use. Introducing extracting phase via sol-gel technology has gained great interest owing to its simple preparation method and promising way to obtain materials with good characteristics. In the present work, a new hybrid silica material based on methyltrimethoxysilane-(3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MTMOS-MPTMOS) was introduced as a new extractant of HF-SPME {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed method was tested for analysis of hexanal and <b>heptanal</b> as the target VOC analytes. Preparation of the HF-SPME MTMOS-MPTMOS was simple in which the hybrid material was synthesized via sol-gel method and was self-polymerized in small segments of HF. Parameters affecting the efficiency of the HF-SPME MTMOS-MPTMOS in extracting both aldehydes were thoroughly investigated and analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). It was found that the highest efficiency was achieved as the extraction was conducted in 30 min at a stirring rate of 1000 rpm in a 10 mL of sample solution whereby the back-extraction was performed via vortex for 3 min using 100 µL methanol as desorption solvent.

40|$|Following {{an initial}} {{screening}} of six common imidazolium, imidazolinium, and dithiolium salts {{in the presence}} of a base, 1, 3 -bis(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene (IDip) and 1, 3 -dimesitylimidazolin- 2 -ylidene (SIMes) were identified as promising organocatalysts for the microwave-assisted synthesis of hydroxymethyl ketones from aldehydes and paraformaldehyde. The azolium- 2 -carboxylate zwitterions IDip·CO 2 and SIMes·CO 2 were then tested as single-component N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors in the hydroxymethylation of <b>heptanal</b> and benzaldehyde. The latter adduct was an efficient precatalyst for the two reactions. It was successfully applied to a broad range of aliphatic and aromatic substrates (14 examples, 10 – 97 % yields).

40|$|The {{adulteration}} of {{the product}} Ilex paraguariensis with other Ilex species is a mAjor problem for maté tea producers. In this work, three species of Ilex were evaluated for their volatile composition by headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrum detector (HS-SPME/GC-MS). The adulterating species I. dumnosa and I. theizans Mart. ex Reissek presented a different profile of volatile organic compounds when compared to I. paraguariensis. Aldehydes methyl-butanal, pentanal, hexanal, <b>heptanal</b> and nonanal were detected only in the adulterating species. This result suggests that such compounds are potential chemical markers for identification of adulteration and quality analysis of products based on Ilex paraguariensis...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{fermentation}} {{results in}} production of metabolites such as ammonia, amines and indolic, phenolic and sulfur-containing compounds. In vitro {{studies suggest that}} these metabolites might be toxic. However, human and animal studies do not consistently support these findings. We modified protein fermentation in healthy subjects to assess the effects on colonic metabolism and parameters of gut health, and to identify metabolites associated with toxicity. After a 2 -week run-in period with normal protein intake (NP), 20 healthy subjects followed an isocaloric high protein (HP) and low protein (LP) diet for 2 weeks in a cross-over design. Protein fermentation was estimated from urinary p-cresol excretion. Fecal metabolite profiles were analyzed using GC-MS and compared using cluster analysis. DGGE was used to analyze microbiota composition. Fecal water genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were determined using the Comet assay and the WST- 1 -assay, respectively, and {{were related to the}} metabolite profiles. Dietary protein intake was significantly higher during the HP diet compared to the NP and LP diet. Urinary p-cresol excretion correlated positively with protein intake. Fecal water cytotoxicity correlated negatively with protein fermentation, while fecal water genotoxicity was not correlated with protein fermentation. <b>Heptanal,</b> 3 -methyl- 2 -butanone, dimethyl disulfide and 2 -propenyl ester of acetic acid are associated with genotoxicity and indole, 1 -octanol, <b>heptanal,</b> 2, 4 -dithiapentane, allyl-isothiocyanate, 1 -methyl- 4 -(1 -methylethenyl) -benzene, propionic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid and decanoic acid with cytotoxicity. This study does not support a role of protein fermentation in gut toxicity. The identified metabolites can provide new insight into colonic health. ClinicalTrial. gov NCT 01280513...|$|E
40|$|Most animals rely on {{olfaction}} to find sexual partners, food or a habitat. The {{olfactory system}} faces {{the challenge of}} extracting meaningful information from a noisy odorous environment. In most moth species, males respond to sex pheromone emitted by females in an environment with abundant plant volatiles. Plant odours could either facilitate the localization of females (females calling on host plants), mask the female pheromone or they could be neutral without any effect on the pheromone. Here we studied how mixtures of a behaviourally-attractive floral odour, <b>heptanal,</b> and the sex pheromone are encoded {{at different levels of}} the olfactory pathway in males of the noctuid moth Agrotis ipsilon. In addition, we asked how interactions between the two odorants change {{as a function of the}} males ’ mating status. We investigated mixture detection in both the pheromone-specific and in the general odorant pathway. We used a) recordings from individual sensilla to study responses of olfactory receptor neurons, b) in vivo calcium imaging with a bath-applied dye to characterize the global input response in the primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe and c) intracellular recordings of antennal lobe output neurons, projection neurons, in virgin and newly-mated males. Our results show that <b>heptanal</b> reduces pheromone sensitivity at the peripheral and central olfactory level independently of the mating status. Contrarily, heptanal-responding olfactory receptor neurons are not influenced by pheromone in a mixture, although some post-mating modulation occurs at the input of the sexually isomorphic ordinary glomeruli, where general odours are processed withi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Lipid {{oxidation}} {{products are}} primary contributors to whey ingredient off-flavors. The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate the impact of antioxidant addition in prevention of flavor deterioration of fluid whey and spray-dried whey protein. Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses were manufactured in triplicate. Fresh whey was collected, pasteurized, and defatted by centrifugal separation. Subsequently, 0. 05 % (w/w) ascorbic acid or 0. 5 % (w/w) whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) were added to the pasteurized whey. A control with no antioxidant addition was also evaluated. Wheys were stored at 3 ◦C and evaluated after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 d. In a subsequent experiment, selected treatments were then incorporated into liquid Cheddar whey and processed into whey protein concentrate (WPC). Whey and WPC flavors were documented by descriptive sensory analysis, and volatile components were evaluated by solid phase micro-extraction with gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Cardboard flavors increased in fluid wheys with storage. Liquid wheys with ascorbic acid or WPH had lower cardboard flavor across storage compared to control whey. Lipid oxidation products, hexanal, <b>heptanal,</b> octanal, and nonanal increased in liquid whey during storage, but liquid whey with added ascorbic acid or WPH had lower concentrations of these products compared to untreated controls. Mozzarella liquid whey had lower flavor intensities than Cheddar whey initially and after refrigerated storage. WPC with added ascorbic acid or WPH had lower cardboard flavor and lower concentrations of pentanal, <b>heptanal,</b> and nonanal compared to control WPC. These results suggest that addition of an antioxidant to liquid whey prior to further processing may be beneficial to flavor o...|$|E
