To ensure optimum cognitive performance, suited crewmembers must maintain their core body temperature within acceptable limits. There are currently several options for thermal maintenance in the post-landing phase. These include the current baseline, which uses an ammonia boiler, purge flow using oxygen in the suit, accessing sea water for liquid cooling garment (LCG) cooling and/or relying on the <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>capacity</b> of the suit. These options vary significantly in mass, power, engineering and safety factors, with relying on the <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>capacity</b> of the suit being the least difficult to implement.

We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) using open flow-through respirometry, and core body temperature (Tb) using passive integrated transponder tags. Sparrow-weavers were exposed to a ramped profile of progressively higher Ta between 30 and 52 °C to elicit maximum <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>capacity</b> (N= 10 per site per season); the maximum Ta birds tolerated {{before the onset of}} severe hyperthermia (Tb ≈ 44 °C) was considered to be their hyperthermia threshold Ta (Ta,HT). Our data reveal significant seasonal acclimatisation of heat tolerance, with a desert population of sparrow-weavers reaching significantly higher Ta in summer (49. 5 ± 1. 4 °C, i. e. higher Ta,HT) than in winter (46. 8 ± 0. 9 °C), reflecting enhanced evaporative cooling during summer. Moreover, desert sparrow-weavers had significantly higher heat tolerance and <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>capacity</b> during summer compared with populations from more mesic sites (Ta,HT= 47. 3 ± 1. 5 and 47. 6 ± 1. 3 °C).

5000|$|Whichever {{the form}} of the crystallizer, to achieve an {{effective}} process control it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth. This is achieved by a separation - to put it simply - of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity settling to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (Draft Tube and Baffle) crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) {{at the end of the}} 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer - yellow - pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle - and return to the main circulation - while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics. This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the <b>evaporative</b> <b>capacity,</b> due to the limited diameter of the vapour head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.|$|E

Thermophysiological models are able to predict human thermal response {{in a wide range}} of environmental conditions, but their use is limited due to lack of validation. The aim of this work was to validate the thermophysiological model by Fiala for prediction of local skin temperatures against a dedicated database containing 43 different human experiments representing a wide range of conditions. The validation was conducted based on root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) and bias. The thermophysiological model by Fiala showed a good precision when predicting core and mean skin temperature (rmsd 0. 26 and 0. 92 °C, respectively) and also local skin temperatures for most body sites (average rmsd for local skin temperatures 1. 32 °C). However, an increased deviation of the predictions was observed for the forehead skin temperature (rmsd of 1. 63 °C) and for the thigh during exercising exposures (rmsd of 1. 41 °C).

Birds were exposed to a ramped profile of progressively increasing Ta, with continuous monitoring of behaviour and Tb used to identify the onset of severe hyperthermia. The maximum Ta birds tolerated ranged from 48 °C to 54 °C, and was positively related to Mb. Values of Tb associated with severe heat stress were in the range of 44 to 45 °C. Rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) increased rapidly when Ta exceeded Tb, and maximum evaporative heat dissipation was equivalent to 141 – 222 % of metabolic heat production. Fractional increases in EWL between Ta< 40 °C and the highest Ta reached by each species were 10. 8 (S. squamifrons), 18. 4 (P. socius) and 16. 0 (P. mahali).

There was no clear relationship between body mass and maximum Ta tolerated during acute heat exposure. Maximum Tb at very high Ta was 43. 1 ± 1. 0, 43. 7 ± 0. 8, 44. 7 ± 0. 3 and 44. 3 ± 0. 8 °C in Namaqua doves, laughing doves, Cape turtle doves and crested pigeons, respectively. In all four species, RMR increased significantly at Ta above thermoneutrality, but the increases were relatively modest with RMR at Ta= 56 °C being 32, 60, 99 and 11 % higher, respectively, than at Ta= 35 °C.

We measured body temperature (Tb), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) at Ta between 25 °C and ~ 58 °C in birds exposed to successive increments in Ta. Normothermic Tb averaged 39. 0 °C, lower than typical avian values. At Ta > 34. 5 °C, Tb increased linearly to a maximum of 43. 6 °C at Ta = 56 °C. The upper critical limit of thermoneutrality (Tuc) was Ta = 43. 8 °C, closely coinciding with the onset of panting and gular flutter. Above the Tuc, RMR increased 2. 5 -fold to 2. 89 W at Ta = 56 °C, a fractional increase far exceeding that of many other species under comparable conditions. Rates of EWL increased rapidly at Ta > 42. 9 °C to 7. 84 ± 0. 90 g h- 1 at Ta = 56 °C, an 11 -fold increase above minimal levels. Maximum evaporative cooling efficiency (ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production) was 2. 03, but could be as high as 2. 70 if our assumption that the birds were metabolising lipids is incorrect.

We observed that record-low snow cover during the winter 2012 / 2013 resulted in a strong response of the heath ecosystem towards low <b>evaporative</b> <b>capacity</b> and substantial surface heat loss by sensible heat fluxes (H) during the subsequent snowmelt period and growing season.

At the fen ecosystem a more muted response of LE, H and G was observed in response to the variability in snow accumulation. Overall, the differences in flux partitioning and in the length of the snowmelt periods and growing seasons during the 2 years had a strong impact on the total accumulation of the surface energy balance components.

With natural circulation, temperature level and difference had a pronounced influence, especially at lower values of these parameters (e. g. boiling temperature 40 °C, temperature difference 15 °C). The heat transmission coefficient k increased for increasing temperature level {{as well as for}} increasing temperature difference. The influence of the apparent liquid level was very important and was more pronounced for lower temperature levels and smaller differences. For each set of operating temperatures an apparent liquid level existed, for which k was maximum. The apparent liquid level had a very big influence on circulation rate. Forced circulation induced higher values of k only if the forced circulation rate was much higher than the natural one. Because natural circulation was slow for low temperatures and small differences forced circulation was found to be advantageous in these conditions. With forced circulation the influence of temperature difference on k was small and sometimes reversed. Due to decreased viscosity, k was higher at higher temperatures. The most important influence on k was exerted by forced circulation rate. With flash evaporation k was generally slightly smaller than with forced circulation, except at high circulation rates, where k became equal for both systems...|$|E

Comparatively, in out-of-doors match-play, soccer players are exposed to environmental conditions that increase the capacity to lose heat; particularly through convective cooling whereby the <b>evaporative</b> <b>capacity</b> of the environment is increased with higher air velocities than those experienced in laboratories with near windstill conditions. Also, the competitive element of match-play presents an intensity of physical challenge and psychological stress that is difficult to replicate in a laboratory and, therefore, the comparison between settings is problematic. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the application of an intestinal pill system to measure core temperature during dynamic, field-based, soccer matches where technological limitations have previously limited match-play observations. The procedure was assessed in both a recreational level match and also in a pre-season professional game between an English Premier League team and an English Championship team. Methodology: Core temperature (TC) was assessed via the intestinal pill system (CorTemp 2000) and changes in plasma volume (PV) were calculated using the values for haemoglobin and haematocrit obtained before and after both recreational (n= 8) and the professional soccer (n= 7; English Championship team) matches. Match-play heart rates were measured at 5 -s intervals using the Polar Team heart rate system. Baseline maximal aerobic power for all subjects was assessed using an online gas analyser and an incremental exercise protocol on a treadmill. Results and Discussion: In the recreational match, significant post-match reductions were observed in body mass (BM) (- 1. 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of evaporative ponds and wetlands for {{the disposal of}} waste water high in ionic concentrations is a waste disposal strategy currently considered by many industries. However, the design, construction and management of these ponds and wetlands are not straightforward as complex chemical interactions result in both spatial and temporal changes in water quality. The effects of evaporation and drainage on the water quality in two constructed ponds, an adjacent man-made wetland and local groundwater at Portland Aluminium were investigated. The minimum volume of water entering the ponds {{during the study period}} was 0. 96 ± 0. 16 ML per month. The predicted theoretical <b>evaporative</b> <b>capacity</b> of the two ponds was calculated to be 0. 30 ± 0. 07 ML per month. More water enters the ponds than it is theoretically possible to evaporate under the ambient weather conditions at Portland, yet the ponds do not overflow, suggesting percolation through the pond lining. No spatial differences in solute concentrations (fluoride, sulphate, bicarbonate, carbonate, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium ions) were found within the waters of either pond, although temporal differences were apparent. The results support the conclusion that the ponds are not impermeable, and that much of the waste water entering the ponds is being lost through seepage. The impacts on local groundwater chemistry of this seepage are addressed. Significant correlations exist between solute presence within and between the ponds, wetland and groundwater. Fluoride and sulphate concentrations were significantly higher in pond waters throughout the duration of the experiment. Pond sediments revealed a high degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the concentration of all monitored ions resulting from the chemical heterogeneity of the material making up the pond linings. Adsorption isotherms for fluoride indicate that the adsorption capacity of the pond linings remains high for this ion. Implications for the management of waste water by this strategy are discussed. <br /...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of colonial living in insect societies is the ability to build a nest which enables the maintenance of a homeostatic microenvironment. The detrimental and uncertain effects of fluctuating ambient conditions are thus avoided. An extensive amount of work has documented the regulation of respiratory gases and temperature by honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies but relatively little is known of their water relations. Nest humidity influences the fitness of the honeybee colony by affecting adult and brood mortality, microbial and parasitic growth, nectar concentration and thermoregulation. This study aims at determining whether honeybee colonies are able to actively regulate humidity within their nest or whether humidity is stabilised merely as consequence of other socially regulated parameters. As a first step in understanding water relations in a hive, the daily, seasonal and two-dimensional humidity patterns are described in diverse contexts: various subspecies, nest architectures, ambient climates and colony conditions. The humidity in the brood nest of a healthy honeybee colony does not show a daily pattern: mean hourly RH remains between 50 and 60 % and high vapour pressure deficit results in a large <b>evaporative</b> <b>capacity.</b> Two-dimensional humidity patterns show that a vapour pressure gradient exists from the central brood area to the periphery of a hive. This finding suggests possible active regulation by workers and to test this idea we determined the behavioural response of a group of workers to a humidity gradient. Young honeybee workers in the absence of brood exhibit a weak hygropreference for approximately 75 % RH. When brood is present the expression of this preference is further weakened, suggesting that workers tend to the brood by distributing evenly in the gradient. In addition, fanning behaviour is shown to be triggered by increasing humidity adding to our understanding of this behaviour. Although these results suggest that humidity in honeybee colonies is actively controlled by workers, passive mechanisms are also involved in the observed patterns. Cocoons that are spun by the larvae accumulate in cells and these hygroscopic cocoons contribute to passive stabilisation of humidity. Old comb containing cocoons absorb 11 % of its own mass in water when placed in high humidity and this water can readily evaporate into the atmosphere when humidity decreases. This buffering effect may increase brood survivorship by maintaining a high and stable humidity in the brood cells. This study contributes {{to our understanding of the}} complex mechanisms that govern microclimatic regulation in social insect nests and specifically the active and passive mechanisms that ensure homeostasis of honeybee nest humidity.
