25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

It is only when <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E

He went on to state, however, [...] "No matter how much I win, it ain't a lot. It's only a lot when <b>I</b> <b>lose.</b> And you always lose. I think it's fun, I think it's exciting.

The taping came after deciding [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] would be released as the third single from the album, with Roberts saying, [...] "I absolutely love performing Yo-Yo, it's my favourite one to do [...] So I feel really close to Yo-Yo. I feel like <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> myself when I'm performing it". After {{the release of the}} single, Roberts performed on The Album Chart Show during a special dedicated to her, performing three tracks: [...] "Yo-Yo", [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Sticks + Stones". Roberts also performed the song on British chat show Loose Women and on the Digital Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Cher {{collaborated with}} several musicians {{including}} Stargate, Chicane and previous collaborator Mark Taylor. She {{said she felt}} lucky for having {{a chance to have}} [...] "great songs and great producers" [...] for the album. Cher said her favorite song slated for the album was a cover version of [...] "When the Money's Gone", written by Bruce Roberts, stating it was [...] "so perfect" [...] for her. [...] "It's about this person who's , 'If <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> all my money, will you still love me if we have to eat fast food out of a beat up car?'. It's so dance. It's so gay. It's so good", she said. The album cover, photographed by Michael Lavine, was revealed through Cher official website on October 8, 2001. It depicts Cher wearing a [...] "flowing" [...] blond wig in contrast to her all-black, medieval-like outfit. The Dallas Morning News commented that [...] "even with a pensive look on her exquisitely snipped and tucked face, she commands attention".|$|E

500|$|The ways {{in which}} St Vincent chose to {{communicate}} the rejections often depended {{on the number of}} letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: [...] "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime." [...] A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: [...] "Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) , there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> no time in acknowledging;" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way <b>I</b> <b>lose.</b> I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, {{authors of}} Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), noted {{the lyrics of}} the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing {{for the return of}} an ex-boyfriend." [...] Spears said [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is a song [...] "every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back." [...] The lyrics, however, caused {{controversy}} in the United States, because the line [...] "Hit me baby one more time" [...] supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line [...] "doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant." [...] Contemporary author Ben Shapiro deemed the song's lyrics as suggestive, mostly [...] "Oh baby, baby / The reason I breathe is you / Boy, you got me blinded / Oh pretty baby / There's nothing that I wouldn't do" [...] and [...] "When I'm not with you <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> my mind / Give me a sign / Hit me baby one more time".|$|E

500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent. Moon adopted a phrase, [...] "If I win, I win. If <b>I</b> <b>lose,</b> I lose," [...] which reflected his casual approach to the game. Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make the other guy pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump. Moon has also been nicknamed the [...] "Luddite Logger" [...] because of his distaste for anything technological, including credit cards and online poker. Moon refused to sign a sponsorship deal with an Internet poker company during the 2009 tournament because {{he said he did not}} want to answer to anybody. Moon wore a New Orleans Saints hat throughout the tournament because, [...] "I like cheering for the underdog." [...] Moon was invited to guest at the Saints games for their entire playoff run in 2010, and watched them win Super Bowl XLIV against the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's first {{competitive}} {{run in the}} Quattro in Monte Carlo ended {{before it}} had even begun. She withdrew from the event before the start due to apparent engine problems. The team later discovered that dirt had got into the fuel system. At the Rally Portugal, she started her long partnership with the Italian co-driver Fabrizia Pons. Mouton won seven stages and took a career-best fourth place, despite suffering from electronic problems. This ended criticism of Audi for signing a female driver. After a retirement due to a broken camshaft in the Tour de Corse, Mouton set several fastest times at the Acropolis Rally in Greece. While Mikkola was leading and Mouton fifth, the stewards excluded the Quattros citing homologation infractions. Although Audi protested, the stewards upheld the decision. In her debut in the high-speed 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, Mouton {{found it hard to}} get used to the rhythm changes. She recorded a few top-ten stage times and finished 13th. She was satisfied with her performance, and the local newspaper Keskisuomalainen described her debut as successful. At the Rallye Sanremo in Italy, a mixed surface event with tarmac and gravel, Mouton took the lead when the local star Michele Cinotto crashed and held off Henri Toivonen and Ari Vatanen to take the victory. This marked the first time a female driver had won a world championship event in rallying. Mouton's male rivals were left speechless. Earlier during the weekend, Vatanen had been confident: [...] "Never can nor will <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> to a woman." [...] Mouton recalled her debut win in a 2008 interview for RallySport Magazine: ...|$|E
500|$|The fifth song, [...] "Illuminati", was {{inspired}} after Madonna learnt {{that she was}} considered {{as one of the}} Illuminati's members. She decided to research about the real Illuminati and then wrote the song. Lyrically it refers to the Illuminati conspiracy theory, the Egyptian pyramids, the Phoenix, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Eye of Providence among others, with the chorus lyrics: [...] "It's like everybody in this party is shining like Illuminati". According to Madonna, Kanye West, who produced the track, loved the melody and changed the composition adding his own spin to it. Minaj appears on the sixth track, [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where she raps, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like: [...] "I just want to have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight". Produced by Diplo and Sophie, the track has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning dubstep" [...] composition. During the writing sessions, Minaj had to rewrite the lyrics until she could get the correct sentiment Madonna wanted. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] consists of an [...] "arresting" [...] chorus and a drum beat sound, described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as: [...] "innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a gospelized stomp". Track eight, [...] "Joan of Arc", is a ballad in which Madonna sings about the media scrutiny of her life, singing: [...] "Each time they take a photograph, <b>I</b> <b>lose</b> a part of me I can't get back". It also references the Roman Catholic saint of the same name. Madonna's hushed, vibrato-tinged vocals, and confessional lyrics in [...] "Joan of Arc", are enhanced by a new beat instrumentation that utilizes strings and acoustic guitars in the bridge.|$|E
