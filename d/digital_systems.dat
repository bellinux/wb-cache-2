40|$|Abstract. Green {{manufacturing}} (GM) is {{a sustainable}} manufacturing mode which comprehensive considers {{the environmental impact}} and resource consumption. Based on the analysis of state-of-the-art of digital technologies application in GM, this paper provides a green manufacturing-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> framework from the integration point of GM and digital manufacturing. The green manufacturing-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> framework is consists of five components which include the basic database for green manufacturing, software supporting layer for green manufacturing oriented <b>digital</b> <b>system,</b> <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> layer for green manufacturing, enterprise integration framework and product lifecycle based operation process layer. Furthermore, some key operation technologies for green manufacturing-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> is studied, which include product lifecycle based green design technology, and semantic framework model based information integration technology. Finally, the system is applied in an automobile manufacturing enterprise and achieves well application effects...|$|R

25|$|Feedback is used {{extensively}} in <b>digital</b> <b>systems.</b> For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where {{the current state}} and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{switching}} systems gradually evolved in stages from electromechanical hybrids with {{stored program control}} to the fully <b>digital</b> <b>systems.</b> Early systems used reed relay-switched metallic paths under digital control.

25|$|The rapid {{replacement}} of electromechanical switching {{systems in the}} 1980s with electronic or <b>digital</b> <b>systems</b> eliminated the problem of older switches that would not recognize 911.
