2500|$|Mr. President, {{what do you}} say {{to someone}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> has lost his job to someone {{overseas}} who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I knew, as a boy, some devout and earnest black preachers of the Word of God. [...] There were many. Today I know of {{very few}} and am {{personally}} acquainted {{with only two}} or three black preachers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> emphasize the Scripture, stress the necessity of the new birth, and are in any degree biblical in their convictions or their preaching. [...] It is small wonder then that we are seeing a whole new generation of blacks come up in America who have little moral conviction." [...] (1985) ...|$|E
2500|$|Forth was {{in favour}} of capital punishment, but opposed {{corporal}} punishment in schools. After William Hague announced his support for an [...] "election compact" [...] promoted by the Commission for Racial Equality in 2001, Forth {{was quoted as saying}} at a private dinner: [...] "All this sucking up to minorities is ridiculous; there are millions of people <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> are white, Anglo-Saxon and bigoted {{and they need to be}} represented." [...] He opposed the BBC's spending money on a Nelson Mandela concert in 1988, saying [...] "those who want the arts and who support them should pay for them themselves". He also opposed the government spending on AIDS treatment, saying that the disease was [...] "largely self-inflicted". He was a fan of Elvis Presley and treasurer of the all-party Music Appreciation Group, and a couple of Presley's songs were played at Forth's memorial service in October 2006.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's been botherin' me some. I tracked him an' part of {{the trail}} was the hardest I ever tackled. Mebbe there's a rustler or {{somebody}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who's</b> as good at trackin' as I am. If that's so Venters ain't safe." ...|$|R
5000|$|Am I {{the only}} guy <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who's</b> fed up with what's happening? Where the hell is our outrage? We should be {{screaming}} bloody murder. We've got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff, we've got corporate gangsters stealing us blind, and we can't even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car. But instead of getting mad, everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say, [...] "Stay the course." [...] Stay the course? You've got to be kidding. This is America, not the damned Titanic. I'll give you a sound bite: Throw the bums out! ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{novel is}} {{dedicated}} [...] "to the many readers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and other <b>countries</b> <b>who</b> {{write to me}} asking: What has happened to Tommy and Tuppence? What are they doing now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Grandfather," [...] asked Laurence, [...] "were {{there no}} able and eloquent men <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> took {{the part of}} King George?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Church of England. Every man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> has not dissented {{belongs to}} the Church of England. It'll be hard enough to get you {{anything}} without that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, {{is a man}} deeply {{painful to}} contemplate. I suppose {{there is not a}} clergyman <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> has greater talents." [...] Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Mill {{uses the}} term “speculative” in a {{different}} sense from [...] that which is customary <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Merchants <b>who</b> buy [...] outright and store up grain are not speculators in the sense in [...] which the word is used with us; but those gamblers who purchase, [...] “for future delivery,” grain which they never see, and which they [...] sell in the same way, are here known as speculators.|$|R
50|$|For {{many people}} Jane Manning {{is simply the}} voice of {{contemporary}} classical music <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Anyone <b>who</b> took an interest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> burgeoning area of music in the 1970s and '80s {{grew up with the}} sound of her astonishing voice in their ears. It’s instantly recognisable, but it’s also a chameleon. Whether she’s faced with the pure angular leaps of Anton Webern, the throaty suggestiveness of Schoenberg or the black, crazed humour of Gyorgy Ligeti, Jane Manning is always equal to the task.|$|R
25|$|He {{was part}} of a forward-looking group of {{entrepreneurs}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and abroad <b>who</b> believed that providing better living conditions for their workers resulted in better workers…Milton Hershey conceived of building a community that would support and nurture his workers. Developing the community became a lifelong passion for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] quoth Sir Tristram, [...] "and {{is there}} then no good knight-champion <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> will rid {{the world of}} such an evil being as that Sir Nabon of whom you speak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It cannot be, lady," [...] said Du Guesclin. [...] "This night hath over wrought you, {{and your}} senses play you false. What men ere there <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would sing {{in a strange}} tongue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know first for certain that they had ventured so far," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "I believe that I am only the second person <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> {{has been so much}} honoured." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{letter from}} 50 Republican {{national}} security officials was published on August 8. The senior officials, who included former White House officials and Cabinet secretaries, said Trump [...] "lacks the character, values, and experience" [...] to be President. Trump responded the same day, saying [...] "The names on this letter {{are the ones}} the American people should look to for answers on why {{the world is a}} mess, and we thank them for coming forward so everyone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> knows <b>who</b> deserves the blame for making the world such a dangerous place." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Awareness of God, Trethowan writes [...] The most {{influential}} Christian philosophers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> are Wittgensteinians <b>who</b> reject, for philosophical purposes, any {{talk about a}} spiritual principle in man. I am {{not the only person}} to disagree with them, but those who share my point of view have not, as yet, written books about it.|$|R
60|$|Of {{all these}} characters, {{the one that}} on the whole made the largest {{fortunes}} in the most rapid manner,--and we do not forget the marvels of the Waterloo loan, or the miracles of Manchester during the continental blockade--was the Anglo-East Indian {{about the time that}} Hastings was first appointed to the great viceroyalty. It was not unusual for men in positions so obscure that their names had never reached the public <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> and <b>who</b> yet had not been absent from their native land for a longer period than the siege of Troy, to return with their million.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he remarked, [...] "we play {{these games}} rather well; and, after all, {{is there any}} reason why we shouldn't? There are a good many people <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> don't {{consider}} them as of the first importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|A faint colour {{crept into}} Clavering's face. [...] "I know {{a good many}} which would make the bargain unfair to her," [...] he said, [...] "but {{there are very few}} men <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would be good enough for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are only}} two persons <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> know {{anything}} of me,' replied the prisoner. 'One is a plain Liddesdale sheep-farmer, called Dinmont of Charlie's Hope; but he knows nothing more of me than what I told him, and what I now tell you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you stayed}} here," [...] she added, [...] "perhaps some new quarrel would arise {{between you and}} my father which might make {{bitterness}} afterwards. Also, dear, {{it would be foolish}} for you to offend the Commandant Retief, who will be the great man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> and <b>who</b> is very fond of you. After all, Allan, we shall only be separated for a little while, and when that is done we have {{the rest of our lives}} to spend together. As for me, do not be afraid, for you know I will never marry anyone but you--no, not to save myself from death." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robinson {{was one of}} {{the nine}} eminent {{engravers}} who, in 1836, petitioned the House of Commons on the state engraving <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> and <b>who</b> with others in 1837, addressed a petition to the king asking for the admission of engravers to the highest rank in the Royal Academy: which was not conceded until some years later. In 1856, Robinson was elected an [...] "associate engraver of the new class", and in the following year missed election as a full member only by the casting vote of Sir Charles Eastlake, which was given to George Thomas Doo; on the retirement of the latter in 1867 he was elected a royal academician.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards said [...] "The {{bottom line}} is we're asking {{everybody}} {{to share in the}} responsibility of making health care work <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Employers, those <b>who</b> are in the medical insurance business, employees, the American people — everyone will have to contribute in order to make this work." [...] The plan includes methods for cutting costs in the health care system and creation of revenue sources.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon so; but at {{the same}} time I'm bound to be with him, for if there is a man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> can steer clear of trouble he is the one, and I don't care to be pulled on a charge of counterfeiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are, I think, {{very few}} men <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would {{have spoken to}} that man or Dom Clemente as you have done," [...] he said. Then he grinned in a very suggestive fashion. [...] "It is {{probably}} fortunate {{that he seemed to}} believe you, though if he had been any other man I would have called him very foolish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{price is}} not too heavy, but I don't accept your terms," [...] Savine said. [...] "Hold on until I have {{finished}} and then begin your talking. I'll offer you a minor partnership in my business instead. Take time, and keep your answer until I explain things in my offices, in case you find the terms onerous; {{but there are many}} men <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> would be glad of the chance you're getting." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{there are}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> men <b>who,</b> {{more than any}} other, need repose, we should say they are the miners of Cornwall, for their week's work is {{exhausting}} far beyond that of most other labourers in the kingdom. Perhaps the herculean men employed in malleable-iron works toil as severely, but, besides the cheering consciousness of being well paid for their labour, these men exert their powers {{in the midst of}} sunlight and fresh air, while the miners toil in bad air, and get little pay in hard times. Sunday is indeed to them the Sabbath-day--it is literally what that word signifies, a day of much-required rest for body, soul, and spirit.|$|R
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{interest}} brought to bear on the Government was very considerable, for not only had they to deal with their own supporters, and with the shadowy caucus that was ready to let the lash of its displeasure descend even on the august person of Mr. Gladstone, should he show signs of letting slip so rich an opportunity for the vindication of the holiest principles of advanced Radicalism, but also with the hydra-headed crowd of visionaries and professional sentimentalists <b>who</b> swarm <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> and <b>who</b> are always ready to take up any cause, from that of Jumbo, or of a murderer, to that of oppressed peoples, such as the Bulgarians, or the Transvaal Boers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Abbott {{controversially}} opposed {{access to}} the abortion drug RU486, and the Parliament voted to strip Health Ministers of the power to regulate this area of policy. During this time, Abbott likened the act of having an abortion to committing a murder, saying [...] "... we have a bizarre double standard, a bizarre double standard <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> where someone <b>who</b> kills a pregnant woman's baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply exercising choice".|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I pray you, do {{not waste}} these few {{valuable}} minutes in vain protestations, which I'll not believe. [...] . . . There's not a sane man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> thinks you guilty. [...] . . . Yet on this confession your judges and peers will condemn {{you to death}} [...] . . . must condemn you, so that the law of England is satisfied--and you, my lord, will suffer death with a lie upon your lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{convinced}} of it," [...] was the earnest reply. [...] "I {{do not know}} what the exact nature of your work over here is to be, but I am glad to have an opportunity of putting before you my convictions. I believe that in Berlin the character of some of the leading statesmen here has been misunderstood and misrepresented. I find on all sides of me an earnest and sincere desire for peace. I have convinced myself {{that there is not a}} single statesman <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> is desirous of war with Germany." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] he said. [...] "There are men <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>who</b> seem {{to enjoy}} {{scattering}} sparks, {{and they are}} rather busy just now. It is, perhaps, not very hazardous when it is done judiciously and one knows {{there is only a}} little tinder here and there, but when one flings them broadcast it is possible that two or three may fall on powder." [...] He turned and stretched out a dainty, olive-tinted hand towards the forest. [...] "After all, we do not know much about what goes on there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Torrance made {{a little}} gesture of impatience. [...] "That's not what I mean. There is very little use in being sorry now. Before the other fools you joined started there talking there was {{quietness}} and prosperity <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> The men <b>who</b> had made it what it is got all, but nothing more than they were entitled to, and one could enjoy what he had worked for and sleep at night. This was {{not good enough for}} you--and this is what you have made of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... :"Gentlemen::I am {{returning}} herewith the six Juno awards that I once felt honoured to {{have received}} and which, I am no longer proud to have in my possession. As far as I am concerned you can give them to the border jumpers who didn't receive an award this year and maybe you can have them presented by Charley Pride. I feel that the Junos should be {{for people who are}} living in Canada, whose main base of business operations is in Canada, who are working toward the recognition of Canadian talent <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and <b>who</b> are trying to further the export of such talent from <b>this</b> <b>country</b> to the world with a view to proudly showing off what <b>this</b> <b>country</b> can contribute to the world market.:Until the academy appears to comply more closely with aspirations of this kind, I will no longer stand for any nominations, nor will I accept any award given.:Yours very truly,:Stompin' Tom Connors ...|$|R
60|$|Very heart-breaking are the {{statistics}} now to hand from America about the increase <b>in</b> smoking. That <b>this</b> fatal habit is also growing <b>in</b> favor <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> every man <b>who</b> uses his eyes must see. What {{will be the}} end of it we shudder to think, but we warn those in high places that if tobacco smoking is not checked, it will sap the very vitals of <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Why is it that nearly every young man one meets in the streets is haggard and pale? No one will deny that it is due to tobacco. As for the miserable wretch himself, his troubles will soon be over.|$|R
