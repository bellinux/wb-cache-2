40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the Portuguese population {{is at risk}} of exceeding ADI levels for acesulfame-K, saccharin, aspartame, caffeine, benzoic and sorbic acid through an assessment of dietary intake of additives and specific consumption of four types of beverages, traditional soft drinks and soft drinks based on mineral waters, <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks,</b> and nectars. The highest mean levels of additives were found for caffeine in <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks,</b> 293. 5 mg/L, for saccharin in traditional soft drinks, 18. 4 mg/L, for acesulfame-K and aspartame in nectars, with 88. 2 and 97. 8 mg/L, respectively, for benzoic acid in traditional soft drinks, 125. 7 mg/L, and for sorbic acid in soft drinks based on mineral water, 166. 5 mg/L. Traditional soft drinks presented the highest acceptable daily intake percentages (ADIs%) for acesulfame-K, aspartame, benzoic and sorbic acid and similar value for saccharin (0. 5 %) when compared with soft drinks based on mineral water, 0. 7 %, 0. 08 %, 7. 3 %, and 1. 92 % versus 0. 2 %, 0. 053 %, 0. 6 %, and 0. 28 %, respectively. However for saccharin {{the highest percentage of}} ADI was obtained for nectars, 0. 9 %, in comparison with both types of soft drinks, 0. 5 %. Therefore, it is concluded that the Portuguese population is not at risk of exceeding the established ADIs for the studied additives...|$|R
40|$|The use of drugs, in Honduras, {{involves}} 25 % {{of college}} students. The most used substances include legal and recreational drugs, such as alcohol. This study aimed {{to identify the}} use of drugs and socio-demographic factors in a sample of 260 medical students. RESULTS: Average age of 20 years old, unemployed and religious women, single, with no children. Alcohol was the most consumed drug {{in the last six months}} for recreational purposes. The following stimulants were frequently consumed: caffeine, mate herb tea, <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks</b> and Coke. Drugs like marijuana, cocaine, valium and sedatives were used in smaller proportions. The reasons reported by women were: to alleviate tiredness and improve their academic performance. The men's reasons were recreation and to alleviate psychological tension. This research has implications for the development of drugs prevention programs in universities...|$|R
40|$|A {{biosensor}} {{was developed}} for spectrophotometric determination of glucose concentrations in real samples of orange juice <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks,</b> and sport drinks. The biosensor consisted of glucose oxidase (GOD) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilized onto polyaniline activated with glutaraldehyde (PANIG). Immobilization parameters were optimized for GOD, and maximum immobilization yield was 16 % when 5. 0 mg of PANIG and 8. 9 U prepared in 0. 1 mol. L- 1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0) reacted for 60 minutes at 4 °C with gentle stirring. The linear operational range for glucose determination using optimized operational parameters was between 0. 05 and 6. 0 mg. mL- 1 with a very good reproducibility of response. The results obtained in the biosensor were compared with those obtained using free enzymes (commercial kits) and then validated through statistical analysis using the Tukey test (95 % confidence interval) ...|$|R
40|$|Title: Consumption of stimulative and <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks</b> among {{secondary}} school pupils Author: Tereza Flanderová Department: Special Pedagogy Supervisor: PaedDr. Eva Marádová, CSc. Abstract: The {{aim of this}} bachelor thesis {{is to find out}} whether high school students are sufficiently informed about the possible risks of consuming energy drinks, and to what extent their knowledge is associated with their personal consumption of these beverages. The theoretical part is concerned with the actual concept of an energy drink, its ingredients and the drinking regime in general. Furthermore, it also informs about the potential dangers of energy drinks, already executed studies and available measures. The practical part is focused on the questionnaire survey, conducted among the high school students, which tries to find out what their experience with energy drinks is, and whether their knowledge of the effects and dangers of energy drinks is sufficient. The conclusion shows the possible preventive recommendations. Key words: Energy drink, risk, young, legislation, health, tren...|$|R

40|$|The MTSP is a {{generalization}} of the traveling salesman problem {{where there are}} multiple vehicles and a single depot. In this problem, instead of determining a route for a single vehicle, we wish to construct tours for all M vehicles. The characteristics of the tours are that they begin and end at the depot node. Solution procedures begin by “copying” the depot node M times. The problem is thus reduced to M single-vehicle TSPs, {{and it can be}} solved using either the nearest neighbor or Clark and Wright heuristics. The classic VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) expands the multiple traveling salesman problem to include different service requirements at each node and different capacities for vehicles in the fleet. The objective of these problems is to minimize total cost or distance across all routes. Examples of services that show the characteristics of vehicle routing problems include different Services deliveries, public transportation “pickups” for the handicapped, and the newspaper delivery problem etc. In this paper will be present using of the principles of MTSP and VRP for optimal solution of vehicle routing for domestic <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks</b> and sparkling water in PET bottles in the different parts of the Republic of Macedoni...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} nutritional predilections for various alcohol-free and alcoholic drinks among the youth from secondary schools in Konin. The studies were carried out using the questionnaire method. The preference degree of the evaluated drinks depended on the sex of the respondents. Both girls and boys pointed out fruit juices as the most preferred alcohol-free drinks, while as the least preferred the drink called “Dynamic ” was indicated among girls, and natural coffee – among boys. Relatively high similarity of drink consumption was found between boys and girls. Tea, fruit drinks and fruit juices scored the highest ranks in the consumption frequency series, while the lowest ranks were observed for <b>energetic</b> <b>drinks,</b> and – among boys – also for natural coffee. Not all of the most preferred drinks belonged to the most frequently consumed ones. Alcoholic drinks were consumed rarely by the respondents, while beer was the most preferred and most often consumed drink of this type, independently from sex. The results obtained show that the selection of drinks consumed by youth corresponded in general to the rational nutri-tion recommendations...|$|R
