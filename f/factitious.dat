5|$|Feldman {{reports that}} most of the cases of Munchausen by Internet communicated to him come from the United States, {{although}} he has corresponded with forum members making inquiries from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Feldman reports parallel manifestations of <b>factitious</b> disorder, peaking between a person's 20s and 30s.|$|E
5|$|A man on new year's day, {{dressing}} {{himself in}} blankets and other trappings, with a <b>factitious</b> {{head like a}} horse, and a party attending him, knocking for admittance, this obtained, he runs about the room with an uncommon frightful noise, which the company quit in real or pretended fright; they soon recover, and by reciting a verse of some cowydd, or, in default, paying a small gratuity, they gain admission.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of <b>factitious</b> disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
25|$|The {{motives of}} the patient can vary: for a patient with <b>factitious</b> disorder, the primary aim is to obtain sympathy, nurturance, and {{attention}} accompanying the sick role. This {{is in contrast to}} malingering, in which the patient wishes to obtain external gains such as disability payments or to avoid an unpleasant situation, such as military duty. <b>Factitious</b> disorder and malingering cannot be diagnosed in the same patient, and the diagnosis of <b>factitious</b> disorder depends on the absence of any other psychiatric disorder. While they are both listed in the DSM-IV-TR, <b>factitious</b> disorder is considered a mental disorder, while malingering is not.|$|E
25|$|Münchausen syndrome, or <b>factitious</b> {{disorder}} with predominantly physical {{signs and}} symptoms has specified symptoms. <b>Factitious</b> disorder symptoms may seem exaggerated; individuals undergo major surgery repeatedly, and they 'hospital jump' or migrate to avoid detection.|$|E

25|$|No true {{psychiatric}} medications are {{prescribed for}} <b>factitious</b> disorder. However, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help manage underlying problems. Medicines such as SSRIs {{that are used}} to treat mood disorders can be used to treat FD, as a mood disorder may be the underlying cause of FD. Some authors (such as Prior and Gordon 1997) also report good responses to antipsychotic drugs such as Pimozide. Family therapy can also help. In such therapy, families are helped to better understand patients (the individual in the family with FD) and that person's need for attention.|$|E
25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (<b>factitious</b> ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury). Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Munchausen by Internet" [...] {{was first}} used in an article {{published}} in the Southern Medical Journal written by Marc Feldman in 2000. Feldman, a clinical {{professor of psychiatry at the}} University of Alabama at Birmingham, gave a name to the phenomenon in 2000, but he co-authored an article on the topic two years earlier in the Western Journal of Medicine, using the description [...] "virtual <b>factitious</b> disorder". <b>Factitious</b> disorders are described in the [...] (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of <b>factitious</b> disorder is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called <b>factitious</b> disorder by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E
500|$|Munchausen by Internet is {{a pattern}} of {{behavior}} akin to the Munchausen syndrome (a psychiatric <b>factitious</b> disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves) in which Internet users seek attention by feigning illnesses in online venues such as chat rooms, message boards, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It has been described in medical literature {{as a manifestation of}} <b>factitious</b> disorder or <b>factitious</b> disorder by proxy. Reports of users who deceive Internet forum participants by portraying themselves as gravely ill or as victims of violence first appeared in the 1990s due to the relative newness of Internet communications. The pattern was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist Marc Feldman, who created the term [...] "Münchausen by Internet" [...] in 2000. It is not included in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).|$|E
500|$|People who {{demonstrate}} <b>factitious</b> disorders often {{claim to have}} physical ailments or be recovering {{from the consequences of}} stalking, victimization, harassment, and sexual abuse. Several behaviors present themselves to suggest factors beyond genuine problems. After studying 21cases of deception, Feldman listed the following common behavior patterns in people who exhibited Munchausen by Internet: ...|$|E
500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present <b>factitious</b> disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from <b>factitious</b> disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1951, the British {{physician}} Richard Asher {{published an}} article in The Lancet describing patients whose <b>factitious</b> disorders led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder [...] "Munchausen's syndrome", commenting: [...] "Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him". The disease is now usually referred to as Munchausen syndrome. The name has spawned two other coinages: Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients, and Munchausen by Internet, in which illness is feigned online.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>factitious</b> {{disorder}} {{is a condition}} in which a person, without a malingering motive, acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms, purely to attain a patient's role. [...] <b>Factitious</b> disorder imposed on another ("factitious disorder by proxy", also called Munchausen's syndrome by proxy) is {{a condition in which}} a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in their care. [...] In either case, the perpetrator's motive is to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient's role. [...] <b>Factitious</b> disorder differs fundamentally from malingering in that the malingerer simulates illness with a view to obtaining a material benefit or avoiding an obligation or responsibility.|$|E

2500|$|Ganser {{syndrome}} {{was once}} considered a separate <b>factitious</b> disorder. It is a disorder of extreme stress or an organic condition. The patient suffers from approximation or giving absurd answers to simple questions. The syndrome is sometimes diagnosed as merely malingering—however, {{it is more}} often defined as a <b>factitious</b> disorder. [...] This has been seen in prisoners following solitary confinement, and the symptoms are consistent in different prisons, though the patients do not know one another.|$|E

2500|$|They are {{motivated}} to perpetrate <b>factitious</b> disorders, either as a patient or by proxy as a caregiver, in order to attain a patient's role.

2500|$|Henry Cavendish FRS ( [...] ; 10 October 1731 – 24 February 1810) was a British natural philosopher, scientist, and an {{important}} experimental and theoretical chemist and physicist. Cavendish is noted for his discovery of hydrogen or what he called [...] "inflammable air". He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper [...] "On <b>Factitious</b> Airs". Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{individuals}} experience {{only a few}} {{outbreaks of}} the disorder. However, in most cases, <b>factitious</b> disorder is a chronic and long-term condition {{that is difficult to}} treat. There are relatively few positive outcomes for this disorder; in fact, treatment provided a lower percentage of positive outcomes than did treatment of individuals with obvious psychotic symptoms such as people with schizophrenia. In addition, many individuals with <b>factitious</b> disorder do not present for treatment, often insisting their symptoms are genuine. Some degree of recovery, however, is possible. [...] The passage of time seems to help the disorder greatly. There are many possible explanations for this occurrence, although none are currently considered definitive. It may be that an FD individual has mastered the art of feigning sickness over so many years of practice that the disorder can no longer be discerned. Another hypothesis is that many times an FD individual is placed in a home, or experiences health issues that are not self-induced or feigned. [...] In this way, the problem with obtaining the 'patient' status is resolved because symptoms arise without any {{effort on the part of}} the individual.|$|E
2500|$|Before his trial, George was {{diagnosed}} with Asperger syndrome. Prosecution psychologists studying George since his arrest for the Dando murder claimed that {{he was suffering from}} several different personality disorders: antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic and possibly paranoid, as well as somatization and <b>factitious</b> disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He was said to suffer from epilepsy and have an IQ of 75; however, a prior assessment found George to be of average intelligence. George has also been likened to a [...] "lone obsessive, Walter Mitty-type figure" [...] for his desire to impersonate famous figures.|$|E
2500|$|This new alliance—I say new, because {{until now}} scenery and costumes were linked only by <b>factitious</b> bonds—has given rise, in Parade, {{to a kind}} of surrealism, which I {{consider}} to be the point of departure for a whole series of manifestations of the New Spirit that is making itself felt today and that will certainly appeal to our best minds. We may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness, for it is only natural, after all, that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress.

2500|$|The first {{important}} use of {{nitrous oxide}} {{was made possible}} by Thomas Beddoes and James Watt, who worked together to publish the book Considerations on the Medical Use and on the Production of <b>Factitious</b> Airs (1794). This book was important for two reasons. First, James Watt had invented a novel machine to produce [...] "Factitious Airs" [...] (i.e. nitrous oxide) and a novel [...] "breathing apparatus" [...] to inhale the gas. Second, the book also presented the new medical theories by Thomas Beddoes, that tuberculosis and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of [...] "Factitious Airs".|$|E
2500|$|Dissociative {{disorders}} {{have been}} attributed to disruptions in memory caused by trauma or other forms of stress. Research into this hypothesis has been characterized by poor methodology. An alternative hypothesis {{is that it is a}} by-product of techniques employed by some therapists, especially those using hypnosis, and disagreement between the two positions is characterized by intense debate. DID is one of the most controversial psychiatric disorders, with no clear consensus on [...] diagnostic criteria or treatment. No clear definition of [...] "dissociation" [...] exists. Diagnosis is often difficult, as the illness is frequently associated with other mental disorders. [...] Differential diagnosis should consider malingering if the individual's principal concern is with financial or forensic gain or with the avoidance of obligations; and <b>factitious</b> disorder, if the individual's principal concern is with assuming a patient role.|$|E
2500|$|The word '' means 'substitute'. It is coded in the DSM-IV under <b>Factitious</b> Disorder NOS (not {{otherwise}} specified). Münchausen {{by proxy}} is the involuntary use of another individual {{to play the}} patient role. For example, false symptoms are produced [...] in children by the caregivers or parents, to produce the appearance of [...] illness, or they may give misleading medical histories about their children. The parent may falsify the child's medical history or tamper with laboratory tests to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, in Münchausen by proxy, the caregiver actually injures the child or makes it sick {{to ensure that the}} child is treated. For instance, a father whose son is coeliac might knowingly introduce gluten into the diet. Such parents may be validated by the attention that they receive from having a sick child.|$|E
2500|$|The {{past and}} present are {{constantly}} intertwined in The House in Paris, and the middle section, [...] "The Past," [...] is an imagined history. Characters in the past already have in mind future characters and events. For example, hours after conceiving Leopold, Karen thinks about her son as if he already exists: [...] "the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." [...] This thought of Karen's is, in the end, Leopold's, since he imagines these events; the reader learns Leopold's past while he does, [...] "simultaneously gaining information from disconnected fragments derived {{from a combination of}} hints and opinions filtered through all he experiences in the house in Paris." [...] Bowen herself discussed the [...] "bendability" [...] of time in an essay published in 1951, in which she discusses [...] "factitious memory": [...] "one route to the past (or the idea of the past) is <b>factitious</b> memory. That is to say, by art we are made to seem to remember that which we have not actually known." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{orthodox}} scholars often {{cite the}} poems in the First Folio as evidence for Shakespeare, such as Jonson's introductory poem describing the engraved portrait as having [...] "hit his face" [...] well, his eulogy that calls Shakespeare [...] "sweet Swan of Avon", and Digges's line {{that refers to}} when [...] "Time dissolves thy Stratford monument". Yet Marlovians say those can each be interpreted in quite different ways. The [...] "face", according to the Oxford English Dictionary (10.a) could mean an [...] "outward show; assumed or <b>factitious</b> appearance; disguise, pretence". When he writes of [...] "Swan of Avon" [...] we may choose to take it as meaning the Avon that runs through Stratford, or we may think of Daniel's Delia, addressed to {{the mother of the}} First Folio's two dedicatees, in which he refers to the Wiltshire one where they all lived:But Avon rich in fame, though poor in waters,Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat.And when Digges writes [...] "And Time dissolves thy Stratford monument", one Marlovian argument says that it is quite reasonable to assume that he is really saying that Time will eventually [...] "solve, resolve or explain" [...] it (O.E.D. 12), which becomes very relevant when we see that—whether the author intended it or not—it is possible to re-interpret the whole poem on Shakespeare's monument ("Stay Passenger...") as in fact inviting us to solve a puzzle revealing who is [...] "in" [...] the monument [...] "with" [...] Shakespeare. The apparent answer turns out to be [...] "Christofer Marley"—as Marlowe is known to have spelt his own name—who, it says, with Shakespeare's death no longer has a [...] "page" [...] to dish up his wit.|$|E
