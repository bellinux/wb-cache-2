40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of key factors on the powertrain loading dynamic characteristics and fatigue damage. First, the engine and the transmission output shaft torque of a multi-axle vehicle powertrain system were measured by proving grounds (PG) testing and analyzed with a conclusion that the powertrain loading changes were mainly related to three key factors: the mean engine torque, the harmonic engine torque, and the vibration properties of the system. Subsequently, a dynamic model considering the three factors was built and validated by the test data. Finally, fatigue damage of shaft <b>parts</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>parts</b> were calculated to investigate the influence degrees of the three factors. The results show that, the harmonic engine torque and the vibration properties of the powertrain system have a great influence on the fatigue damage of shaft parts, and the mean engine torque is the main factor causing the fatigue damage of <b>gear</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Austin v. Loral, 29 N. Y. 2 d 124 (1971), is a {{favorite}} among Contracts casebooks because the New York Court of Appeals held {{that it was a}} 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 example of economic duress. It involved Austin, a small <b>gear</b> <b>part</b> manufacturer, who had entered into a subcontract to provide <b>gear</b> <b>parts</b> to Loral, a publicly-traded defense industry supplier. Loral had a contract with the U. S. government to supply radar sets, {{to be used in the}} U. S. efforts in Vietnam. Midway through performance of the subcontract, Austin apparently refused to continue to deliver the <b>gear</b> <b>parts</b> unless Loral acceded to certain demands, which included a price increase on the <b>gear</b> <b>parts.</b> In a 4 -to- 3 decision, the New York Court of Appeals held that Loral had agreed to Austin 2 ̆ 7 s price demands under economic duress. The first part of this article reconstructs and retells the rich and intricate story of Austin v. Loral. A theme emerges: with the escalation of the conflict in Vietnam came a market shift in the defense industry. The demand for radar caused the price of Austin 2 ̆ 7 s <b>gear</b> <b>parts</b> to see a substantial market increase. But, Austin 2 ̆ 7 s materials and labor costs also rose, causing Austin significant losses under the subcontract with Loral. Using the reconstructed story of the case, and the theme that emerges from the trial testimony, this article then discusses the concept of framing in a legal sense and draws parallels to theories of framing in the field of cognitive linguistics. Applying these theories, the article presents the frames of contract modification and economic duress and discusses the doctrinal differences between them at the time of Austin v. Loral. Even though the contract involved a sale of goods, the courts made no reference to U. C. C. § 2 - 209, which addresses contract modifications and appears to apply squarely to the situation. The absence of reference to the U. C. C. is probably because the parties did not frame the litigation as a question of modification but, rather, solely as an issue of economic duress. Had Austin reframed the dispute as one of modification, the Court of Appeals might well have asked a different question, dictated by the comments to U. C. C. § 2 - 209 : whether Austin acted in good faith in requesting modification of the subcontract. In assessing whether Austin was acting in good faith, the market changes and Austin 2 ̆ 7 s significant losses under the subcontract would have been doctrinally relevant. Finally, while Austin could have reframed the legal dispute, it also could have argued for a more sensible doctrine of economic duress, one that did not solely focus on Loral 2 ̆ 7 s lack of choices. The doctrinal thesis of the article posits that, in the context of contract modification, duress jurisprudence seems to be (and should be) subsumed by solely a good faith inquiry. Using the context of Austin v. Loral as an example, the article discusses refocusing the duress doctrine in the modification context to ask solely whether the threat was made in good faith...|$|R

50|$|Berkuts used a {{retractable}} main (rear) {{landing gear}} system designed by Shirl Dickey for his E-Racer homebuilt. Originally Berkut used <b>gear</b> <b>parts</b> produced by Dickey, {{but over time}} they were repeatedly re-engineered and strengthened. Later kits had gear components produced entirely in-house. Like the earlier Vari-Eze and Long EZ, the Berkut parks with its nose gear retracted to prevent the plane from tipping over backwards when parked without a pilot in the front seat. Some early Berkuts utilized hydraulic nose-gear extension systems, but most have used an electro-mechanical jack-screw. With the electric system the pilot can climb into the cockpit with the nose down, then extend the nose gear, raising the airplane with him inside.|$|R
