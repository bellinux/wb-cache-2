50|$|Eugene Suter was a Swiss {{immigrant}} {{who set up}} a fashionable ladies' salon in London's West End. He claimed {{to have come from}} Paris, which in those days was the center of fashion and style. He became aware of the possibilities of <b>electrical</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>waving</b> particularly when shorter hair allowed the design of smaller equipment. The system had two parts; one was the electric heater and the other was the system of winding and holding the hair on a form which was inserted into a heater. Sutter tried to design a heater, but was unsuccessful.|$|R

50|$|Thio {{relaxers}} use ATG, or ammonium thioglycolate, {{which is}} also used in <b>permanent</b> <b>waving,</b> but {{at a much higher}} pH and concentration than used in <b>permanent</b> <b>waves.</b> It is usually higher than a pH of 10. These relaxers are also thicker with a higher viscosity, or thickness, which makes for an easier relaxer application. Thio relaxers break the disulfide bonds in hair, similar to the <b>permanent</b> <b>waving</b> process. When enough of the disulfide bonds in the hair are broken, the relaxer is rinsed from the hair and the hair is towel dried. After towel drying, a neutralizer of some sort is applied to the hair.|$|R

25|$|<b>Permanent</b> <b>Waves</b> is {{the seventh}} studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, {{released}} in January 1980 on Anthem Records. After touring {{to support their}} previous album Hemispheres (1978) ended, the band took a short break before they regrouped to work on new material. The album marked a departure in their musical style towards tighter song structures and songs more suitable for radio airplay. <b>Permanent</b> <b>Waves</b> was recorded in late 1979 at Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec and with co-producer Terry Brown and mixed at Trident Studios in London.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Permanent</b> <b>Waves</b> (1980) shifted Rush's {{style of}} music with the {{introduction}} of reggae and new wave elements. Although a hard rock style was still evident, more synthesizers were introduced. Moreover, because of the limited airplay Rush's previous extended-length songs received, <b>Permanent</b> <b>Waves</b> included shorter, more radio-friendly songs such as [...] "The Spirit of Radio" [...] and [...] "Freewill", two songs that helped <b>Permanent</b> <b>Waves</b> become Rush's first US Top 5 album. Meanwhile, Peart's lyrics shifted toward an expository tone with subject matter that dwelled less on fantastical or allegorical story-telling and more heavily on topics that explored humanistic, social, and emotional elements. Rush joined with fellow Toronto-based rock band Max Webster on July 28, 1980, to record [...] "Battle Scar" [...] for their 1980 release, Universal Juveniles. Max Webster lyricist Pye Dubois offered the band lyrics to a song he had written. The band accepted; the song went on, after reworking by Peart, to become [...] "Tom Sawyer".|$|R
