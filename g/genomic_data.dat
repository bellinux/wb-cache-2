5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteinsâ€”though it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in <b>genomic</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this <b>genomic</b> <b>data</b> to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{biological}} {{information in}} <b>genomic</b> expression <b>data</b> can be understood, and computationally extracted, {{in the context}} of systems of interacting molecules. The automation of this information extraction requires high throughput management and analysis of <b>genomic</b> expression <b>data,</b> and integration of these data with other data types. Results SBEAMS-Microarray, a module of the open-source Systems Biology Experiment Analysis Management System (SBEAMS), enables MIAME-compliant storage, management, analysis, and integration of high-throughput <b>genomic</b> expression <b>data.</b> It is interoperable with the Cytoscape network integration, visualization, analysis, and modeling software platform.

The simplest means to identify duplications in <b>genomic</b> resequencing <b>data</b> is through the use of paired-end sequencing reads.

25|$|Conservationists {{can use the}} {{information}} gathered by genomic sequencing {{in order to better}} evaluate genetic factors key to species conservation, such as the genetic diversity of a population or whether an individual is heterozygous for a recessive inherited genetic disorder.

25|$|Currently, RNA-Seq {{relies on}} copying of RNA {{molecules}} into cDNA molecules prior to sequencing, hence the subsequent platforms {{are the same}} for transcriptomic and <b>genomic</b> <b>data.</b> Consequently, the development of DNA sequencing technologies has been {{a defining feature of}} RNA-Seq. Direct sequencing of RNA using nanopore sequencing represents a current state-of-the-art RNA-Seq technique in its infancy (in pre-release beta testing as of 2016). However, nanopore sequencing of RNA can detect modified bases that would be otherwise masked when sequencing cDNA and also eliminates amplification steps that can otherwise introduce bias.|$|E
25|$|Although phylogenetic trees {{produced}} {{on the basis}} of sequenced genes or <b>genomic</b> <b>data</b> in different species can provide evolutionary insight, they have important limitations. Most importantly, they do not necessarily accurately represent the evolutionary history of the included taxa. In fact, they are literally scientific hypotheses, subject to falsification by further study (e.g., gathering of additional data, analyzing the existing data with improved methods). The data on which they are based is noisy; the analysis can be confounded by genetic recombination, horizontal gene transfer, hybridisation between species that were not nearest neighbors on the tree before hybridisation takes place, convergent evolution, and conserved sequences.|$|E

In 2013, spurred by concerns over the publication of the genome of the widely used HeLa cell line derived from the late Henrietta Lacks, Collins and other NIH leaders worked with the Lacks family to reach an agreement to protect their privacy, while giving researchers controlled access to the <b>genomic</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
25|$|Importantly, diatom {{genomics}} brought {{much information}} about the extent and dynamics of the endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) process. Comparison of the T. pseudonana proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards diatom genomes can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} the T. pseudonana genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the Guillardia theta (cryptomonad) nucleomorph genome. Four of these genes are also found in red algal plastid genomes, thus demonstrating successive EGT from red algal plastid to red algal nucleus (nucleomorph) to heterokont host nucleus. More recent phylogenomic analyses of diatom proteomes provided evidence for a prasinophyte-like endosymbiont in the common ancestor of chromalveolates as supported by the fact the 70% of diatom genes of Plantae origin are of green lineage provenance and that such genes are also found in the genome of other stramenopiles. Therefore, it was proposed that chromalveolates are the product of serial secondary endosymbiosis first with a green algae, followed by a second one with a red algae that conserved the genomic footprints of the previous but displaced the green plastid. However, phylogenomic analyses of diatom proteomes and chromalveolate evolutionary history will likely take advantage of complementary <b>genomic</b> <b>data</b> from under-sequenced lineages such as red algae.|$|E
