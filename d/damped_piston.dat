In this study, a linear variable differential sensor (LVDS) based on the electromagnetic induction mechanism was integrated with a conventional MRD. The structure of the displacement differential self-induced magnetorheological damper (DDSMRD) was developed, and the theory of displacement differential self-induced performance was deduced. The static experiments of the DDSMRD under different displacement positions were carried out by applying sine excitation signals to the excitation coils, and the experimental results show that the self-induced voltage is proportional to the <b>damper</b> <b>piston</b> displacement. Meanwhile, the dynamic experiments were also carried out using the fatigue test machine to investigate the change of the self-induced voltage under the typical direct current inputs and the different piston rod displacements; the experimental results also show that the self-induced voltage is proportional to the <b>damper</b> <b>piston</b> displacements. Additionally, the dynamic mechanical performance of the DDSMRD was evaluated.

These devices have found varied applications like control of vibrations in seat suspension systems, rotary braking systems, prosthetics, seismic systems etc. The performance of MR damper depends on its magnetic and hydraulic circuit design. This paper deals with a design of MR damper for which mathematical model is developed. A finite element model is built to examine and investigate the 2 - D axisymmetric MR damper.

"For an {{efficient}} damper design, a design engineer always faces {{the challenge of}} providing the largest forces in the most compact and efficient envelope. It is important to identify {{the nature of the}} force required at the output in order to configure the damper to produce more force in less space. This thesis takes into consideration the role of MagnetoRheological (MR) fluids played when used in conjunction with dampers. In order to achieve this purpose, a finite element model is constructed to analyze and examine a 2 -D axisymmetric MR damper. The results obtained in this thesis will help designers to create more efficient and reliable MR dampers. With the help of finite element tools, some design analyses are created to change the shape of the <b>piston</b> in the <b>damper</b> or other parameters in the model. The main benefit of this research is to show a 2 -D MR damper and generate the magnetic flux density along the MR Fluid gap. The magnetic saturation is detected by looking at the nodal solution for the magnetic flux density. Increasing the current in the model, results in an increase in magnetic induction. Three different configurations of an MR <b>damper</b> <b>piston</b> were studied in order to determine how changing the shape of the piston affects the maximum force which the damper provides. The variations provided in the MR fluid gap were plotted for magnetic flux density contour before and after reaching the rheological saturation. By increasing the current, the color spectrum of the magnetic flux density will shift from the MR fluid gap to the piston centerline. As the current provided to a reasonably good amount, the force obtained was to a good extent. But it reaches saturation at around 2 amps. Thus for constraint or heat build up limitations, the second model could work the best among the three designs that we considered. For cases where higher electrical currents can be tolerated, model 2 would be the most advantageous design, since it provides the largest force among the three models...|$|R

In addition to spool valve, a needle valve is {{also included in the}} hydraulic system so as to create oil leakage across the piston. The leakage flow across the piston is considered so as to produce <b>damping</b> to <b>piston</b> motion.

The applied voltage on the spool and needle valves is considered the single input, while the load position and the leakage flow across the piston are considered as the multiple out-puts. Minimum effort is obtained by optimizing the pole locations of the single input – multiple output system.

A piston is modelled on a three-degree-of-freedom system to represent its planar motion. When slap occurs, the impact point between piston skirt and cylinder inner wall is modelled on a two-degree-of-freedom vibratory system.

The damper performance (damping force) {{is dependent on the}} magnetic flux density induced at the annular gap. Magnetic flux density developed at fluid flow gap of MR damper due to external applied current is also dependent on materials properties of components of MR <b>damper</b> (such as <b>piston</b> head, outer cylinder and piston rod). The present paper discus about the influence of different materials selected for components of the MR damper on magnetic effect using magnetostatic analysis. Different materials such as magnetic and low carbon steels are considered for piston head of the MR damper and magnetic flux density induced at fluid flow gap (filled with MR fluid) is computed for different DC current applied to the electromagnetic coil. Developed magnetic flux is used for calculating the damper force using analytical method for each case. The low carbon steel has higher magnetic permeability hence maximum magnetic flux could pass through the piston head, which leads to higher value of magnetic effect induction at the annular gap. From the analysis results it is observed that the magnetic steel and low carbon steel piston head provided maximum magnetic flux density. Eventually the higher damping force can be observed for same case...|$|R

The proposed MR <b>damper</b> used the <b>piston</b> rod as the sharing component between the energy harvesting and velocity self-sensing mechanism and the MR damper part, and this shared component could isolate the magnetic field between two function areas.

40|$|Hypervelocity impact {{experiments}} that reproduce on-orbit collisions between micrometeoroids or orbital debris and space structures are commonly performed {{by means of}} propellant-driven twostage light-gas guns. Such devices accelerate projectiles using the thrust of a light propellant gas that is compressed to {{high pressure and temperature}} by a piston running in a pump tube. Though these guns have the unique capability of accelerating particles up to 9 km/s, many components of the gun must be checked and/or substituted after each shot making test sessions long and expensive. In order {{to have a lot of}} and many different types of hypervelocity impact data, the Center of Studies and activities for Space CISAS ”G. Colombo” of Padua University developed a high-shot-frequency two-stage light-gas gun that can increase the shot repetition rate of standard facilities by a factor of 5 or more and at the same time reduce the shot cost by a factor of 2 or more. This is made possible through the use of special mechanical and diagnostic solutions that were designed to operate the gun for more than 50 shots in sequence without having to carry out maintenance operations. This article presents the design and operation of the CISAS two-stage light-gas gun damping system, which is one of the subsystems that makes it possible to achieve high-shot frequency. The damping system is in charge of controlling the piston oscillations in the pump tube, making it possible for the piston to withstand more than 100 shots without any damage. In particular, the <b>damping</b> system avoids <b>piston</b> strikes onto the gun head at the end of each compression stroke and allows the piston to be positioned at the base of the pump tube after each shot. The sensitivity of the piston oscillations to the damping operations and main subsystem design parameters were identified using numerical simulations, carried out according to a model that describes every working phase of the gun. Moreover, in this paper, the technical solutions for the damping system implementation are presented and the numerical predictions are compared with experimental results. For the CISAS high-shot-frequency gas gun, an efficient damping system proved to be a fundamental requirement to reliably accelerate 100 mg projectiles above 5 km/s and 70 mg projectiles at 5. 5 km/s with a shot frequency of 10 shots per day at least, including the time needed for replacing the target and pumping down the target vacuum chamber...|$|R
40|$|Availability and {{sustainability}} of fuels for road and air transport {{is essential for}} economic development and growth of any nation. New alternative fuels {{provide an opportunity to}} limit the use of ever declining conventional petroleum oil reserves as well as offsetting CO 2 generation from their use. Liquid fuels have the highest energy density for transportation applications and synthetic liquid fuels, which can be produced from renewable non-food bio feedstock offer an exciting opportunity for partial or even total substitution of remaining fossil fuel supplies. It is therefore of great interest to study the fundamental combustion characteristics of these fuels {{if they are to be}} used commercially. This work is aiming at characterising the auto-ignition properties of individual fuel components representative of the chemical families present in the synthetic fuels which in this case are toluene, iso-octane, n-heptane, and bio-alcohols; ethanol and n-butanol. The auto-ignition characterisation was made by measurements of ignition delay times, τ. The time τ for these fuels and their blends were measured after rapidly compressed to an elevated pressure and temperature using a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). RCM provides good platform to study the fuel auto-ignition process without complicated physical effects in engines which are continually changing. However, they are not without problems, practical applications are usually not within the ideal conditions. Different machines have different extent of deviation from ideal conditions, making comparison of results between rigs difficult. In the present study, a dedicated work was conducted to study the difference between the measurements originated from these rigs and were characterised against their deviations from ideal conditions. These cover chemical reaction during the finite compression time, the effects of heat loss during the ignition delay period, the effects of piston displacement (piston bounce), and non-homogeneous auto-ignition. An interesting aspect of the study is that a plot of the measured different delay times at a given temperature, on the separate machines, against the corresponding degrees of reaction during compression, when extrapolated to zero reaction, yield a more accurate delay time for that condition. As the temperature is increased, so also are the oscillatory pressure amplitudes generated at the auto-igniting hot spots. This is in line with other studies of hot spot auto-ignition. Measurements of ignition delay times of different chemical groups separately and when blended with each other were made. They provided an understanding of how their interaction influences the overall ignition delay times. When blended the change of their τ values do not vary linearly especially when the blended components have large difference in reactivities. Toluene for example, which is commonly known for its long ignition delay times, was made extremely reactive when blended with n-butanol. Comparison of addition of bio-alcohols (ethanol and n-butanol) on gasoline surrogate fuel (TRF) showed that at lower temperatures, they both increased the ignition delay times of TRF, while at high temperatures they reduced TRF delay times to almost the same value. n-butanol started to reduce TRF delay times at lower temperatures compared to ethanol. Development of auto-ignition blending laws offers an opportunity to enable quick methods for choosing an appropriate blend for a particular application. In this work, a Linear by Mole (LbM) auto-ignition blending law was proposed, it uses the measured ignition delay times of individual components in the blend and varies them linearly with the fractional concentration of each component. This was found to be satisfactory only for blends of chemical families without NTC behaviour such as CH 4 /H 2, for fuels with NTC behaviour an empirical based law was generated for the conditions studied. Overall, this study has broadened our understanding in auto-ignition behaviour of selected individual fuel components and their blends at varying conditions of pressure, temperature and concentration. It has also enabled substantial development of Leeds RCM to achieve fast compression with good <b>piston</b> <b>damping.</b> ...|$|R
