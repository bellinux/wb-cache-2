5|$|After the war Helm {{identified}} with the Democratic Party, and {{he returned to the}} state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the United States Congress during the Civil War. It denounced the Reconstruction Amendments {{on the grounds that they}} granted powers to the federal government that were reserved <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the Freedmen's Bureau. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President Andrew Johnson and his efforts to restore the Union.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} in whether the depression would attain tropical storm status or not, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Punta San Telmo, Michoacán to Acapulco, Guerrero. Prior to affecting the coastline, the Mexican meteorological agency issued a heavy rainfall advisory, also mentioning the potential for flooding and mudslides, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Officials prepared 21shelters in the region.|$|E
5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden of Eden in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a Garden of Eden because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E

5|$|None of the {{fourteen}} stations east of Cincinnati had seen Amtrak service before. Tri-State Station (named <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia) in Catlettsburg, Kentucky replaced an existing stop at Ashland. Amtrak built new stations at Roanoke and Bluefield. The remaining stops all used existing Norfolk & Western stations, {{with varying degrees}} of refurbishment and renovation. Two cities, Petersburg and Lynchburg, Virginia, had additional rail service at different stations. Amtrak's Florida-bound trains used the ex-Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Petersburg station, while the Southern Railway's remaining trains used Kemper Street station in Lynchburg.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>States.</b> Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The 13 {{states are}} based on {{historical}} Malay kingdoms, and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states, known as the Malay states, retain their royal families. The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five-year term. This King appoints governors serving a four-year term <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> without monarchies, after consultations with the chief minister of that state. Each state has a unicameral legislature known as the State Legislative Assembly, and its own written constitution. Sabah and Sarawak have considerably more autonomy than the other states, most notably having separate immigration policies and controls, and a unique residency status. Federal intervention in state affairs, lack of development, and disputes over oil royalties have occasionally led to statements about secession from leaders in several states such as Johor, Kelantan, Sabah and Sarawak, although these have not been followed up and no serious independence movements exist.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E

25|$|After Norfolk, Wilson then {{proceeded}} westward to Kansas, Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington; he favored voting reforms which empowered the populace, {{such as the}} initiative, the referendum and the recall (excepting judges).

25|$|Quinlan was {{regarded}} as an effective soapbox orator and formal public speaker, a person capable of winning audiences over with a sarcastic and intense delivery style.

25|$|The Riparian {{water system}} is the system {{controlling}} water use in the eastern states where water {{is found to be}} more plentiful.

50|$|Classical human rights, such as {{the right}} to life or freedom of expression, are {{formulated}} or understood as prohibitions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> to act {{in a way that would}} violate these rights. Thus, they would imply an obligation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> not to kill, or an obligation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> not to impose press censorship. Modern or social rights, on the other hand, imply an obligation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> to become active, such as to secure individuals' rights to education or employment by building schools and maintaining a healthy economy. Such social rights are generally more difficult to enforce.|$|R

25|$|Chinese pistols are {{in demand}} in the illegal small arms market in India because they are easily {{available}} and cheaper.

25|$|Another {{important}} {{result of}} this election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the McGovern–Fraser Commission adopted {{a set of rules}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.|$|E
25|$|By October 28, the Senate {{had already}} been {{discussing}} the designation amendment. Republican DeWitt Clinton expected that the Senate, with a 24-9 Republican majority would quickly passing the amendment.

On the other side, Wilson Cary Nicholas was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> to ratify it before the 1804 election. Despite Nicholas’ concern, the Senate would not seriously deal with the amendment again until November 23.|$|E
