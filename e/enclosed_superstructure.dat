5000|$|Jagdpanzer 38(t) (unofficially {{known as}} the Hetzer) - German tank {{destroyer}} carrying a 75 mm L/48 anti-tank gun in <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b>|$|E
50|$|M-50 155 mm - An M4 Sherman chassis based {{self-propelled}} artillery piece mounting the Obusier de 155 mm Modèle 50 155 mm L/30 howitzer in large <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b>|$|E
50|$|L-39 - An M4 Sherman chassis based {{self-propelled}} artillery piece mounting the Soltam M-71 155 mm L/39 howitzer in large <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure,</b> design of vehicle did not progress beyond the drawing board.|$|E
2500|$|Baltic Ace {{was a car}} carrier, a roll-on/roll-off ship {{designed}} to transport vehicles in a large, fully <b>enclosed</b> garage-like <b>superstructure</b> running the entire length and width of the vessel. She had eight cargo decks with a minimum free height of [...] Two decks (3 and 5) could be hoisted up to increase the clearance of the decks below to [...] for large vehicles. Her car capacity, measured in RT43 units, was 2,132. For loading and unloading cargo, Baltic Ace had a stern ramp for normal ro-ro berths and a stern quarter ramp for harbours with no specialized cargo handling facilities.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} an open-topped variant with {{a central}} parapet was developed. The intended usage of this variant {{was to be a}} mortar portee, but a total of five machine gun mounts could also be fitted. There were 2 in front, one in the rear all three M2 Browning or Mk 19 capable and one folding pintle point on each side M1919 Browning machine gun or M60 capable. An <b>enclosed</b> raised <b>superstructure</b> [...] "pod" [...] was also developed for converting the V-100 into either a command vehicle or for police use. The variants for police work featured special elongated firing ports for better angles of fire for tear gas grenade launchers.|$|R
5000|$|The antitank {{units of}} German divisions, {{originally}} called Panzer-Abwehr-Abteilungen ("anti-tank battalions"), began in 1940 to be resignated as Panzerjäger-Abteilungen, (literally [...] "tank hunter battalions"). These were equipped with towed or self-propelled guns (often {{the ad hoc}} mounting of an antitank gun on a captured or obsolete tank chassis). As the war progressed, some Panzerjäger-Abteilungen were fully equipped with specialized tank destroyers, initially known as Panzerjäger (tank hunters), and later by 1943 as Jagdpanzer ("hunting tank") with <b>enclosed,</b> armored casemate <b>superstructures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Soviet SU-76i {{self-propelled}} gun {{was based on}} captured StuG III and Panzer III vehicles. In total, Factory #37 in Sverdlovsk manufactured 181 SU-76i plus 20 commander SU-76i for Red Army service by adding an <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure</b> and the 76.2 mm S-1 tank gun.|$|E
50|$|Ro'em (colloquially {{known as}} L-33) - A {{self-propelled}} artillery piece mounting Soltam M-68 155 mm L/33 howitzer in large <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b> Uses Sherman chassis with Cummins VT-8-460Bi diesel engine and HVSS. Probably about 200 units were produced. The gun saw combat in the Yom-Kippur War and the 1982 Lebanon War. Currently out of active service.|$|E
50|$|The Type 1 Ho-Ni II was one variant. It {{mounted a}} Type 91 105 mm {{howitzer}} {{and had a}} slightly changed superstructure {{as far as the}} side armor with re-positioned observation visors. A total of 54 units were built. The other variant was the Type 3 Ho-Ni III which mounted a Type 3 75 mm tank gun in a completely <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Electron was {{designed}} to be very sparse, with a sizable reduction of living space that was intentionally designed to reduce wind and water resistance. They featured a high <b>enclosed</b> wheelhouse <b>superstructure</b> that Crowhurst abandoned for a flush deck that only allowed for a small rounded “doghouse” for the wheel. Aboard the ship was a table with a screw on vice for small repair work, a Marconi Kestrel radio-telephone, a small built-in table with a red cushioned seat that would have hidden the main computer but instead obscured a tangle of carefully color-coded, but unconnected, wires that hung throughout the cabin. He also had a Racal RA 6217 communications receiver, a Shannon Mar 3 transmitter/receiver, headsets, morse keys, switch panels, and gross amounts of radio spares. Powering the existing electronics on the boat was an Onan petrol-driven generator that was seated under the cockpit where it would be at risk of continuous exposure to water in rough weather, but which was again, done in line with Crowhurst’s fear of capsize. The typical “Victress” cabin also featured built in shelving and cabinetry that Crowhurst replaced with Tupperware plastic containers for storing food, electronic components, a second-hand Bell and Howell 16mm camera and Uher tape recorder that had been provided by the BBC for documenting the journey. The boat also housed a Hasler self-steering system and a Hengist-Horsa wind speed and direction indicator.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Type 3 Gun tank Ho-Ni III (San-shiki hōsensha) gun {{tank was}} a tank {{destroyer}} and self-propelled artillery of Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. The Type 3 Ho-Ni III superseded the Type 1 Ho-Ni I and its variant the Type 1 Ho-Ni II in production, and gave better protection {{to the crew}} due to having a completely <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Type 3 Ho-Ni III (San-shiki hōsensha) gun {{tank was}} a tank {{destroyer}} and self-propelled artillery of Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. The Type 3 No-Ni II superseded the Type 1 Ho-Ni I in production, and was much safer {{for the crew}} due to its having a completely <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b> The Type 3 Ho-Ni III utilized the chassis of the earlier Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank.|$|E
50|$|The {{unrelated}} SU-76i (1943) {{was based}} on the German Panzer III and StuG III chassis, armed with a ZiS-5 76.2 mm gun. About 200 of these captured vehicles, many from Stalingrad, were converted at Factory No. 38 by adding a new <b>enclosed</b> <b>superstructure.</b> They were issued to tank and self-propelled gun units starting in autumn 1943. They were withdrawn from the front in early 1944, and used for training until the end of 1945.|$|E
