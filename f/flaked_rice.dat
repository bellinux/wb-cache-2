40|$|AbstractPaddy (Oryza sativa L.) {{is among}} major staple food cereal crops of the world. The whole grain has higher {{percentage}} of vitamins, minerals and fiber as compared to milled rice grain. The present study was undertaken to study the physicochemical, functional, pasting and morphological characteristics of paddy (Gurjari variety) and its processed products were obtained during flaking. The major dimensions were highest for extra thin <b>flaked</b> <b>rice</b> (ETFR) with 17. 08 mm length and 8. 50 mm breadth {{at the expense of}} thickness found to be lowest 1. 16. Thousand kernel weight (TKW), bulk density (BD), true density (TD) and porosity (POR) of ETFR were lowest as compared to other products. Frictional properties did not show any significant difference (p< 0. 05 %) except for angle of repose. Significant difference was observed in chemical and functional properties of ETFR with exception to water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI). Optical parameters L∗, a∗ and b∗ values of EFTR were found to be 73. 72, 0. 39 and 9. 60, respectively significantly different from brown and roasted paddy. Peak and final viscosity was highest for brown rice (4419 cP, 6351 cP) and lowest for roasted rice (1058 cP, 1525 cP). Morphological changes occurring due to disintegration of starch granules within ETFR were clearly visible within its matrix caused by high mechanical force and temperature...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective to analyze nutritional compn. and in vitro digestibility of starch and protein in <b>rice</b> <b>flakes</b> of different thickness. The av. protein content of <b>rice</b> <b>flakes</b> (of all thickness) was found to be 5. 6 %, whereas dietary fiber was 8. 3 %. Ash and fat contents were very low with 0. 67 % and 0. 87 %, resp.

The percent protein digested ranged from 38 % to 78 % among different samples. Total starch digested was higher with a range of 73 - 86 %.

The influence of the <b>rice</b> <b>flakes,</b> corn <b>flakes,</b> and roasted <b>rice</b> bran levels on the physical and chemical characteristics of the cereal bars was studied. The overall acceptability of three selected formulations was also evaluated. An increase in the roasted rice bran level in the formulation reduced the force of rupture and water activity, resulted in intermediate density, and caused darkening of the bars. The contents of lipid and total dietary fiber were higher in the formulation with the highest rice bran content, which was therefore classified as functional food. The formulation containing 0. 34; 0. 32; and 0. 34 roasted <b>rice</b> bran, <b>rice</b> <b>flakes,</b> and corn flakes, respectively, seemed to be the best outcome.

5000|$|It is {{now known}} that {{flavonoid}} and anthocyanin compounds {{are closely related to}} the antioxidation properties of black rice (Zhanget al[...], 2005). Oki et al. (2005) found that the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity is higher in red rices than in black and white rices, and that this activity is correlated with polyphenols and proanthocyanidin content. Considering that the highest scavenging activity due to the presence of polyphenols is in red rices than in black and white rices (Oki et al[...], 2005), red rices could once again find favour with health-conscious consumers. It is high time that people in India took a fresh look at similar properties in the vast pool of indigenous red rices. There is also a dire need for clinical validation of the medicinal value of red rices reported in ancient literature, and for research on food preparations such as poha (<b>flake</b> <b>rice),</b> noodles, and sewai (vermicelli) from red rices.|$|R

40|$|Rice and rice-based products, such as rice cakes or <b>rice</b> <b>flakes</b> for creamed <b>rice,</b> {{can contain}} {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} inorganic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic is classified as carcinogenic for humans by international panels and no intake quantity {{can be defined as}} safe for human health with regard to its carcinogenic effect (cf. BfR opinion 018 / 2015). In the European Union, the introduction of maximum levels for inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products is being discussed {{on the basis of the}} health assessment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) […]. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the proposed maximum levels for rice and rice products from a health point of view and comes to the conclusion that the maximum level of 0. 2 milligrams of inorganic arsenic per kilogram recommended for white rice is only suitable to avoid particularly high levels in rice. The proposal to introduce lower maximum levels for products used in the manufacture and preparation of baby food such as <b>rice</b> <b>flakes</b> for the production of creamed rice is endorsed by the BfR. The Institute does point out, however, that even under the assumption of concentrations of inorganic arsenic at the level of the recommended maximum limit of 0. 1 milligrams per kilogram, the exposure of infants and toddlers to inorganic arsenic in rice flakes/creamed rice can still be high due to the fact that children consume comparatively large quantities of food in relation to their body weight. The BfR considers accompanying measures to be necessary for this reason. […] recommended that parents do not feed children and infants exclusively on the basis of rice […].
