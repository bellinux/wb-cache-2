40|$|In Mauritius, the endemic blue-tailed day-gecko Phelsuma cepediana is {{currently}} the sole pollinator and seed disperser of the critically endangered endemic plant Roussea simplex (Rousseaceae). The <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits are often visited by the invasive ant Technomyrmex albipes, which forages on the nectar and fruit pulp, and tends honeydew-producing mealybugs on the fruits. Here, we experimentally explore how {{the presence of this}} alien ant species influences geckos foraging at <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits of R. simplex by removing and excluding ants from <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits. Gecko visitation rates to ant-free control <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits, <b>and</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits where ants had been removed and excluded, were higher than those to ant-infested <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits. The resulting seed set of ant-infested flowers was greatly reduced, compared to ant-free control flowers. Similarly, for fruits with ants, very few seeds were likely to be ingested and dispersed by the geckos. Thus, T. albipes monopolizes <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruits of R. simplex, and prevents access of pollinating and seed-dispersing P. cepediana geckos by aggressive interference competition. For a critically endangered plant like R. simplex, this double-disruption of two vital mutualistic interactions is of urgent conservation concern...|$|R

Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites.

5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E

5|$|B. coccinea {{is killed}} by fire and regenerates {{afterwards}} from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is {{some degree of}} serotiny, that is, it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers of seed are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger. Plants <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Figs <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} {{throughout the}} population. This fact {{is important for}} fig waspsâ€”female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
