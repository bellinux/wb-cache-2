25|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>multimeters</b> {{generally}} {{take measurements}} with accuracy superior to their analog counterparts. Standard analog multimeters measure with typically ±3% accuracy, though instruments of higher accuracy are made. Standard portable <b>digital</b> <b>multimeters</b> are specified {{to have an}} accuracy of typically ±0.5% on the DC voltage ranges. Mainstream bench-top multimeters are available with specified accuracy of better than ±0.01%. Laboratory grade instruments can have accuracies of a few parts per million.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} a {{resistor}} can be measured with an ohmmeter, which may be one function of a multimeter. Usually, probes {{on the ends of}} test leads connect to the resistor. A simple ohmmeter may apply a voltage from a battery across the unknown resistor (with an internal resistor of a known value in series) producing a current which drives a meter movement. The current, in accordance with Ohm's law, is inversely proportional to the sum of the internal resistance and the resistor being tested, resulting in an analog meter scale which is very non-linear, calibrated from infinity to 0 ohms. A <b>digital</b> <b>multimeter,</b> using active electronics, may instead pass a specified current through the test resistance. The voltage generated across the test resistance in that case is linearly proportional to its resistance, which is measured and displayed. In either case the low-resistance ranges of the meter pass much more current through the test leads than do high-resistance ranges, in order for the voltages present to be at reasonable levels (generally below 10 volts) but still measurable.|$|E

25|$|A {{multimeter}} or a multitester, {{also known}} as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Analog multimeters use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings. <b>Digital</b> <b>multimeters</b> (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. <b>Digital</b> <b>multimeters</b> are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.|$|R
2500|$|Analog meters {{are older}} designs, but still {{preferred}} by many engineers. One {{reason for this}} is that analog meters are more sensitive to changes in the circuit that is being measured. A <b>digital</b> <b>multimeter</b> samples the quantity being measured and then displays it. Analog multimeters continuously read the test value. If there are slight changes in readings, the needle of an analog multimeter will track them while digital multimeters may miss them or be difficult to read. This continuous tracking feature becomes important when testing capacitors or coils. A properly functioning capacitor should allow current to flow when voltage is applied, then the current slowly decreases to zero and this [...] "signature" [...] is easy to see on an analog multimeter but not on a <b>digital</b> <b>multimeter.</b> This is similar when testing a coil, except the current starts low and increases.|$|E

2500|$|For {{general-purpose}} <b>digital</b> <b>multimeters,</b> {{the lowest}} voltage range is typically several hundred millivolts AC or DC, but the lowest current range may be several hundred microamperes, although instruments with greater current sensitivity are available.

50|$|Crest {{factor is}} an {{important}} parameter to understand when trying to take accurate measurements of low frequency signals. For example, given a certain <b>digital</b> <b>multimeter</b> with an AC accuracy of 0.03% (always specified for sine waves) with an additional error of 0.2% for crest factors between 1.414 and 5, then the total error for measuring a triangular wave (crest factor = 1.73) is 0.03% + 0.2% = 0.23%.|$|E
