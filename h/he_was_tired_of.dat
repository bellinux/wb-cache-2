5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had {{made it impossible for}} one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was old enough to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|The Demi-Virgin, {{like most}} of Hopwood's farces, was commercially successful, but had no lasting {{literary}} significance. Even as a popular entertainment, the play's appeal was limited by cultural context. Before World War I, in a time with more conservative sexual mores, the production {{would have been more}} likely to be suppressed. A decade later, the sexual attitudes conveyed in the play would be considered too unsophisticated for Broadway. As early as the end of 1921, Woods was suggesting a seven-year hiatus in the production of bedroom farces, saying the genre had become stale. In 1925, Hopwood confessed to the audience at another play that he thought The Demi-Virgin was boring and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> writing faddish entertainment. The play's script was never published and no movie adaptation was made.|$|E
5|$|The seventh season {{saw another}} format change, as fighters had to compete to be {{official}} castmembers. Instead {{of the usual}} 16 fighters, the season had 32 fighters after Dana White claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> fighters coming onto the show for airtime. This season was coached by UFC Light Heavyweight champion Quinton Jackson and challenger Forrest Griffin, the first season's winner. The season's final was due to be competed between Amir Sadollah, who hadn't competed in a professional fight before the show, and Jesse Taylor. However, Taylor was kicked off the show after filming had completed, when he kicked the window out of a limosine in Las Vegas. His slot was taken by C.B. Dollaway who defeated Tim Credeur for the right, but Sadollah won in the final to become The Ultimate Fighter.|$|E

5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference from Big Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> people like Cena and Rock overshadowing {{him when the}} WWE Champion should {{be the focus of}} the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell in a Cell opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at Hell in a Cell, and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E

Ultimately, Michelle was saved by her better track record and her more convincing argument.|$|E

25|$|Siringo {{continued}} to pursue Bogan, a trek which {{led him into}} Utah, then to New Mexico Territory, where he {{came into contact with}} Lem Woodruff, an old Panhandle friend to Bogan. According to Woodruff, Bogan was last known to be heading for New Orleans, Louisiana, intending on taking a ships passage to South America, stating <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> living on the run. The last he was heard of, Bogan sent a letter addressed to Tom Hall in Cheyenne, from New Orleans, indicating he was heading to Argentina.|$|E

Lindsey Buckingham joined them in 1972 and toured with them. They said their final performance would be on July 14, 1973, at Knott's Berry Farm, in California, but tensions between the two surfaced, and Don told a reporter <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being an Everly Brother. During the show, Phil smashed his guitar and walked off while Don finished the show, ending their collaboration. The two would not rejoin forces musically for just over ten more years.|$|E

25|$|In the Spring of 1791, Jefferson and Congressman James Madison took a {{vacation}} to Vermont. Jefferson had {{been suffering from}} migraines and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton in-fighting. In May 1792, Jefferson was alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, urging him to run for re-election that year as a unifying influence. He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic-Republican Party principles. Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored states' rights and local control and opposed federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} attempts {{to convince him}} to start a serious rehab, in early 2005 Doherty's father decided <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> broken promises and vowed not to see his son again until he was clean of drugs. The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in the BBC Two Arena documentary about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of him talking about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty explained {{in an interview with}} the BBC Radio 4 show Front Row that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs.|$|E
25|$|At around 2:30a.m. (CST) on 4 November 2014, {{an elite}} {{squadron}} of the Federal Police arrested former Iguala mayor Abarca {{and his wife}} Pineda at {{a house in the}} Tenorios neighborhood in Iztapalapa, Mexico City. Neither of them resisted arrest. Abarca confessed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> hiding and that the pressure was too much for him. His wife, on the other hand, showed her disdain for law enforcement. The arrest was confirmed through Twitter by the Federal Police spokesperson José Ramón Salinas early that morning. Once in custody, they were taken by law enforcement to the federal installations of SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigation agency, for their legal declaration. At the time of their arrest, Abarca and Pineda were among Mexico's most-wanted.|$|E

25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other. She {{wanted to be a}} singer, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> people who just wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director. Her guiding principle was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 Larramendi seemed already {{overwhelmed}} by mounting problems; another one were rumors about negotiations related {{to some sort}} of dynastic accord, allegedly conducted by Don Jaime with the Alfonsist branch; Larramendi has always been fiercely hostile to any compromise with the despised Liberal dynasty. He arranged for another grand meeting; it took place in Lourdes, though due to lower attendance and minor scale of discussions taking place it was rather an operational session than a milestone comparable to the Biarritz amassment; it provided Larramendi with little assistance. Soon afterwards the claimant left for Colombia with hardly any guidance or information passed to his delegate in Spain; upon his return, in the summer of 1921, Larramendi handed his resignation. When discussing its background, some scholars claim <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> uphill struggle; others point to talks with the Alfonsists and general Don Jaime’s detachment or Larramendi’s remorse about the 1920 electoral disaster.|$|E
25|$|On 23 January 2008, {{the board}} of Coast Air filed for bankruptcy. High costs made the owner Seglem lose faith in future profits. The company had lost more than NOK100 million since 2001. It was Norway's fourth largest airline at the time. The company lost NOK30 million in 2007, and Seglem was stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> {{covering}} the losses of the company. He also felt that the agreement the company had with the pilots gave less working hours compared to the competitors Norwegian Air Shuttle and Danish Air Transport, {{and the lack of}} understanding from the pilots made him give up. Half the 95employees in the company were pilots. All the aircraft were owned by the mother company Kystfly, and there were no values in the estate.
