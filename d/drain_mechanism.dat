40|$|Surface acting (i. e., faking and suppressing {{emotions}} at work) is repeatedly {{linked to}} employee negative moods and emotional exhaustion, but the consequences may also go beyond work boundaries. We provide a unique theoretical integration of these 2 emotional labor consequences with 2 work-to-family conflict mechanisms, mood spillover and resource drain, {{to explain why}} surface acting is likely to create marital partner discontent (i. e., partner's perceived work-to-family conflict and desire for the employee to quit). A survey of 197 hotel managers and their marital partners supported that managers' surface acting was directly related to their partner wanting them to quit, and indirectly to partner's perception of work-to-family conflict via exhaustion consistent with the resource <b>drain</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Anxiety from surface acting had an indirect mediating effect on marital partner discontent through exhaustion. Importantly, controlling for dispositional negativity and job demands did not weaken these effects. Implications for theory and future research integrating work-family and emotional labor are discussed.

40|$|A long-standing and {{fascinating}} puzzle in economics is {{the understanding of}} the determinants that make some countries poor while other rich. This question can be summarized by the following quote, taken from the Lucas' essay On the Mechanics of Economic Development, which reads as follows Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia's or Egypt's? This thesis, from a macroeconomic perspective, has not the ambition to provide a full and clear answer to the above mentioned issues. Rather, it attempts to give a partial but sensible contribution dealing with two dierent but deeply intertwined topics. The first chapter studies the interplay between infrastructure, informality and high skilled migration through a macroeconomic model which aims to de- pict a developing stylized country. In fact, infrastructure and human capital are two widely recognized key ingredients to achieve development. Large informal sector and substantial high skilled migration ows characterize developing countries eventually preventing both infrastructure and human capital accumulation. Two dierent frameworks are considered. In the rst one high skilled migration ows are left exogenous to the model while in the second one the brain drain phenomena is fully accounted by the model. Theoretical results are derived along with dynamical properties of the model. Subsequently, the model is calibrated for 60 countries. Numerical experiments show that the informal sector slows down the infrastructure accumulation process while helping low skilled to escape from extreme poverty. A quantitative assessment of a bench- mark restrictive scal policy suggests that, in the long run, an increase in the tax rate would be benecial for high skilled individuals without worsening the welfare of low skilled individuals. The results are robust to the brain <b>drain</b> <b>mechanism</b> accounted. In the second chapter sovereign debt crisis are the object of the study. Initially, a brief review of the literature on sovereign debt crisis is provided, in light of the OLG model developed in the second part. I assume that the government default choice leads to a permanent drop in productivity and as a result, the government's choice is driven by a cost-benet analysis. It has been proved that when the economy starts with an initial level of capital lower than a threshold, the government nds it protable to bankrupt. As a consequence, the model predicts that economies with the same level of outstanding debt but dierent initial capital levels can have dierent default behaviors suggesting that developing countries may be credit constrained. </br...|$|E
40|$|Supraglacial lake {{drainage}} on the Greenland {{ice sheet}} opens surface-to-bed connections, reduces basal friction, and temporarily increases ice flow velocities {{by up to}} an order of magnitude. Existing field-based observations of lake drainages {{and their impact on}} ice dynamics are limited, and focus on one specific <b>draining</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Here, we report and analyse global positioning system measurements of ice velocity and elevation made at five locations surrounding two lakes that <b>drained</b> by different <b>mechanisms</b> and produced different dynamic responses. For the lake that drained slowly (> 24 h) by overtopping its basin, delivering water via a channel to a pre-existing moulin, speedup and uplift were less than half those associated with a lake that drained rapidly (~ 2 h) through hydrofracturing and the creation of new moulins in the lake bottom. Our results suggest that the mode and associated rate of lake drainage govern the impact on ice dynamics...|$|R
50|$|Banská Štiavnica was an {{important}} medieval mining center, producing mostly silver. The first water reservoirs were founded by the local miners in the 15th century. However, the most significant development of tajchy was precipitated by {{a crisis in the}} mining industry in the 17th century. The depth of the mines' shafts started to reach below the level of the drainage tunnels. As a result, mines were flooded by ground water. The <b>draining</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of that period were powered by human or animal power, which was too expensive. Due to the prohibitive costs, the Royal Court Chamber in Vienna decided to close the mines in Banská Štiavnica and its surroundings. A mining expert and inventor Jozef Karol Hell challenged the decision, submitting a courageous proposal to rescue mining in his home town. An innovative plan based on the use of tajchy was finally endorsed by Emperor Charles VI.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{comparative}} study on off-state breakdown characteristics in nanowire JL and IM multiple gate MOSFETs has been performed for different gate bias voltages and fin widths. In {{order to understand}} the <b>drain</b> breakdown <b>mechanism</b> with different transistor structures, the device was simulated using the 3 -dimensional ATLAS software. The band-to-band tunneling current and the gate-induced-drain-leakage current trigger the off-state breakdown in JL transistor and IM transistor, respectively. From experiment and simulation, the off-state breakdown voltage is lower in JL transistor than in IM transistor. As the gate is biased more negatively, the off-state breakdown voltages are increased in JL and IM transistors...|$|R
40|$|Submarine mass {{movements}} and their consequences are of major concern for coastal communities and infrastructures {{but also for}} the exploitation and the development of seafloor resources. Elevated awareness of the need for better understanding of the underwater mass movement is coupled with great advances in underwater mapping technologies over the past two decades. The seafloor in the Nahr Ibrahim and Saida regions (Lebanon) is characterized by deep canyons, reaching one thousand meters depths in proximity of the coast. Signs of submarine mass movement instability related to these canyons create a connection between shallow and deep water. The presence of these canyons in a tectonically active area generates a particular <b>drained</b> <b>mechanism</b> to the sediment in form of mass movement and slumping. Identification of potential areas where slope movements could be triggered requires data with high spatial resolution. Since this area is poorly explored, in the framework of an international project between Lebanese Navy, Lebanese National Center for Marine Sciences, University of Ferrara and Italian Hydrographic Institute, we analyse the morpho-bathymetric and sedimentological characters of the coastal and shelf sectors. Multibeam echosounder and sub-bottom profiler acoustic systems calibrated with ground truths (sediment grab and core samples) allow us to characterize the nature of seafloor and sub-seafloor with particular detail to the geotechnical properties of sediments and high resolution seismic stratigraphy of the shallow layers. The detection of particular undersea features provides detail maps which are in support to littoral morpho-dynamics, coastal transport and sediment budget. Multilayer hydro-oceanographic map, referring to the seafloor dynamics in connection with deep water environment and drainage system, in accordance to the International Hydrographic Standards and nautical supports, are produced. This high resolution multibeam bathymetry dataset, integrated by the sedimentological characters, will provide useful constraints to the potential natural hazards that may be caused by active tectonics in the offshore and a high coastal risk in a most populated region of Lebanon...|$|R

This paper expands on such previous findings by showing: (i) simulation results of HFETs with different recess geometries, and their implications on breakdown voltage and reliability; (ii) a detailed experimental and numerical investigation of surface trapping effects such as gate lag, transconductance frequency dispersion, and drain current kink, and their relationship with device degradation...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{stability of}} AlGaAs/GaAs and InAlAs/InGaAs high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), tested under high drain voltage and/or high temperature operation is reported. HEMTs with high In {{content in the}} active channel, alternatively fabricated an InP substrates and on GaAs substrates covered by a metamorphic buffer (MHEMT), are compared. Despite the high dislocation density in the buffer layer MHEMTs and InP based HEMTs exhibit comparable reliability. AlGaAs/GaAs HEMTs are more reliable than their InAlAs/InGaAs counterparts, especially when operated at high <b>drain</b> voltage.

40|$|Mobile ad hoc networks' (MANETs) {{inherent}} power limitation makes power-awareness {{a critical}} requirement for MANET protocols. In this paper, we propose a new routing metric, the drain rate, which predicts {{the lifetime of}} a node {{as a function of}} current traffic conditions. We describe the Minimum <b>Drain</b> Rate (MDR) <b>mechanism</b> which uses a combination of the drain rate with remaining battery capacity to establish routes. MDR can be employed by any existing MANET routing protocol to achieve a dual goal: extend both nodal battery life and connection lifetime. Using the ns- 2 simulator and the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, we compared MDR to the Minimum Total Transmission Power Routing (MTPR) scheme and the Min-Max Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR) scheme and proved that MDR is the best approach to achieve the dual goal...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of creating new cross-campus educational opportunities in entrepreneurship at the University of North Dakota (UND) {{is to help}} plug rural brain <b>drain.</b> Developing a <b>mechanism</b> for non-business graduate stu-dents to learn core entrepreneurship principles and receive course credit for their degree programs {{is the focus of}} this initiative. The first phase involves creating an undergraduate certificate program from the current entrepreneur-ship curriculum. Modification of the existing curriculum leads to the second phase, a nine-credit graduate cognate in New Product Development, which will provide an opportunity for graduate students and faculty to transfer tech-nological innovations. The new cognate is the catalyst for creating fully-inte-grated joint programs in entrepreneurship. Additionally, UND will sponsor a region-wide New Product Competition, in which student teams are invited to present novel product prototypes with business plans. This initiative will move UND into a stronger leadership position in rural economic development...|$|R
40|$|Aphids are {{considered}} major pests of crops, {{as they are}} sap sucking insects that can inducegreat damage by nutrient <b>drain</b> or other <b>mechanisms,</b> includine virus transmission. Of the organisms proposed for biocontrol of pest insects, fungi producine biactive metabolites {{are considered}} promising candidates, and aphids are considered a very good organism for testing their insecticidal properties. Aphids have parthenogenetic reproduction and short generation times that allow rapid increase in population size, and their colonies have numerous individuals that are closely related genetically. Moreover, due to heteromorphism, with wingless and winged morphs, they represent pest insects with different ecological value. Some fungal species produce toxins, and aphids present characteristics that make them excellent test organisms for verifying the toxic activity against target and non-target organisms. The sap sucking behaviour allows them {{to be used to}} evacuate crops contaminated by toxigenic fungi. Furthermore, due to the peculiar feature of “telescopic generations” it is possibile to treat and observe the effects of mycotoxins on twoor three generations at a time...|$|R
40|$|We {{look at the}} {{decision}} of the government or "central planner" in the allocation of scarce governmental resources for tertiary education, as well as that for the individual. We provide estimates of the net present values, or cost and benefits. These include costs of tertiary education; the benefits of improved skills of those who remain in the country; and also takes into account the flows of the skilled out of the country (the brain drain) as well as the remittances they bring into the country. Our results are positive for the net benefits relative to costs. Our results suggest that (i) there may be room for creative thinking about the possibility that the brain <b>drain</b> could provide <b>mechanisms</b> for dramatic increases in education levels within African nations; and (ii) by at least one metric, spending by African nations on higher education in this period yielded positive returns on the investment. Our results on the individual decision problem resolve a paradox in the returns to education literature which finds low returns to tertiary education. ...|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} soot-in-oil can cause an {{increase}} in engine wear and oil viscosity, thus reducing oil <b>drain</b> intervals. The <b>mechanisms</b> by which soot particles are entrained into the bulk oil are not well understood. The research reported in this thesis addresses questions on the mechanisms of soot transfer to the lubricating oil in light-duty diesel engines with high pressure EGR systems. Deposition {{as a result of}} blow-by gas passing the piston ring pack and by absorption to the oil film on the cylinder liner via thermophoresis are soot transfer mechanisms that have been considered in detail. The investigations are based on analytical and simulation studies, and results based on complementary experimental studies are used to validate these. The experimental investigations aimed at evaluating the typical rate of accumulation and size distribution of soot agglomerates in oil. The oil samples analysed were collected during regular services from light-duty diesel engine vehicles. These were representative of vehicles meeting Euro IV and V emission regulation standards driven under real-world conditions. The rate of soot-in-oil was determined by thermogravimetric analysis and results showed a concentration of approximately 1 wt...|$|R
40|$|Well-performing {{subsurface}} drainage systems form {{an important aspect}} of pavement design by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). The recently completed Iowa Highway Research Board (IHRB) project TR- 643 provided extensive insights into Iowa {{subsurface drainage}} practices and pavement subdrain outlet performance. However, the project TR- 643 (Phase I) forensic testing and evaluation were carried out in a drought year and during the fall season in 2012. Based on the findings of IHRB Project TR- 643, the Iowa DOT requested an expanded Phase II study to address several additional research needs: evaluate the seasonal variation effects (dry fall 2012 versus wet spring/summer 2013, etc.) on subdrain outlet condition and performance; investigate the characteristics of tufa formation in Iowa subdrain outlets; investigate the condition of composite pavement subdrain outlets; examine the effect of resurfacing/widening/rehabilitation on subdrain outlets (e. g., the effects of patching on subdrain outlet performance); and identify a suitable <b>drain</b> outlet protection <b>mechanism</b> (like a headwall) and design for Iowa subdrain outlets based on a review of practices adopted by nearby states. A detailed forensic test plan was developed and executed for inspecting the Iowa pavement subdrains in pursuit of fulfilling the Phase II study objectives. The observed outlets with blockage and the associated surface distresses in newly constructed jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCPs) were slightly higher during summer 2013 compared to fall 2012. However, these differences are not significant. Less tufa formation due to the recycled portland cement concrete (RPCC) base was observed with (a) the use of plastic outlet pipe without the gate screen–type rodent guard and (b) the use of blended RPCC and virgin aggregate materials. In hot-mix asphalt (HMA) over JPCP, moisture-related distress types (e. g., reflection cracking) were observed more near blocked drainage outlet locations than near “no blockage” outlet locations. This finding indicates that compromised drainage outlet performance could accelerate the development of moisture-related distresses in Iowa composite pavement systems. ****** Note: This report follows on work report in "Evaluating Roadway Subsurface Drainage Practices, 2013 " [URL] Note: This record contains links to the 210 page full report as well as the 3 page tech transfer summary.
