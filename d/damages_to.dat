5|$|After {{exiting the}} Fijian {{archipelago}} of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted {{to affect the}} archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey found that more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.|$|E

This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia. The Fijian Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone Daman was located near Rotuma.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E

The owner of the Thruway Mall sued the AM's chain, claiming breach of contract; the chain would later be declared liable for <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> the Thruway Mall, which was subsequently torn down and rebuilt as a strip mall in the early 1990s.

Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and the relatives of those killed.

50|$|The primary {{complications}} of diabetes due <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> in small blood vessels include <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the eyes, known as diabetic retinopathy, {{is caused by}} <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the {{blood vessels in the}} retina of the eye, and can result in gradual vision loss and blindness. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the kidneys, known as diabetic nephropathy, can lead to tissue scarring, urine protein loss, and eventually chronic kidney disease, sometimes requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the nerves of the body, known as diabetic neuropathy, is the most common complication of diabetes. The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the skin. Diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers) may occur, and can be difficult to treat, occasionally requiring amputation.

However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> the fuel line. Moments later, the third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E
