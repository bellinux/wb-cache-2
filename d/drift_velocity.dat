5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which {{electric}} current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies {{with that of the}} charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.|$|E
25|$|For a pure {{wave motion}} in fluid dynamics, the Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>{{velocity}}</b> {{is the average}} velocity when following a specific fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow. For instance, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves, experiences a net Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> {{in the direction of}} wave propagation.|$|E
40|$|The {{high-speed}} {{correction factor}} to the O + -O collision frequency, resulting from <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> between ions and neutrals, is calculated by solving the integral expression in this factor both numerically and analytically.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out on the {{properties}} of a hollow cathode as an ion-source. The measured electron density, ion and neutral temperatures and <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> have been compared with predictions from the conservation laws for matter, momentum and energy. Very large exit <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> of ions and neutrals are observed. The magnitude and direction, against the electric field, can be explained {{on the basis of the}} momentum balance. At weak magnetic field strengths even supersonic <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> are found. The charge flux carried by the ions is about five percent of the net arc current. For small flows, the ionized fraction of the gas supply approaches 100...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> of {{electrons}} and holes as functions of electric field and temperature in high-purity n- and p-type silicon with orientation are presented. The measurements cover electric field values between 2. 5 and 50 kV/cm and temperatures between 233 and 333 K. For both electrons and holes differences {{of more than}} 15 % are found between our results and the <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> from literature, which are frequently also used for simulating sensors. For electrons, the results agree with previous measurements, however, for holes differences between 5 to 15 % are observed for fields above 10 kV/cm. Combining our results with published data of low-field mobilities, we derive parametrizations of the <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> in high-ohmic silicon for electrons and holes for fields between 0 and 50 kV/cm, and temperatures between 233 and 333 K. In addition, new parametrizations for the <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> for electrons and holes are introduced, which provide somewhat better descriptions of existing data for silicon, than the standard parametrization...|$|R
25|$|As can be seen, the Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> ūS is a {{nonlinear}} quantity {{in terms}} of the wave amplitude a. Further, the Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> decays exponentially with depth: at a depth of a quart wavelength, z = -¼ λ, it is about 4% of its value at the mean free surface, z = 0.|$|E
25|$|Often, the Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> is loosely {{referred}} to as Stokes drift.|$|E

40|$|When a {{solution}} of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation is disturbed by a harmonic function of the space variable, the solution pattern may drift in space as time evolves. The value and {{the direction of the}} <b>drifting</b> <b>velocity</b> vary with time. To understand this phenomenon, a perturbation analysis is performed.

25|$|Beware that, in {{the common}} and {{important}} case of metallic wires, {{the direction of the}} conventional current is opposite to the <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> of the actual charge carriers; i.e., the electrons. This is a source of confusion for beginners.|$|E
25|$|More generally, the Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> is the {{difference}} between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel, and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid at a fixed position. This nonlinear phenomenon is named after George Gabriel Stokes, who derived expressions for this drift in his 1847 study of water waves.|$|E
25|$|In the Lagrangian description, fluid parcels may drift {{far from}} their initial positions. As a result, the {{unambiguous}} definition of an average Lagrangian velocity and Stokes <b>drift</b> <b>velocity,</b> which {{can be attributed to}} a certain fixed position, {{is by no means a}} trivial task. However, such an unambiguous description is provided by the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory of Andrews and McIntyre in 1978.|$|E
50|$|In a {{semiconductor}} the two charge carriers, {{electrons and}} holes, will typically have different <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> {{for the same}} electric field.|$|R
40|$|Drift {{measurements}} {{perpendicular to}} the magnetic field are examined, taking into account also some nighttime measurements. Nighttime measurements of <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> are more difficult because densities are lower. However, the uncertainty in the <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> can be optimized by making use of an approach reported by Kirchhoff (1973). The approach involves a careful selection of the elevation angle of the radar antenna. Measured velocities are discussed along with the magnetospheric perturbation effect. The measurements are compared with conclusions of the dynamo theories...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the seasonal and longitude {{dependence of the}} daytime, vertical E × B <b>drift</b> <b>velocities,</b> on a day-to-day basis, using a recently-developed technique for inferring realistic E × B drifts from ground-based magnetometer observations. We have chosen only quiet days, A p < 10, from January 2001 through December 2002, so that the main contribution to the variability {{is due to the}} variability in the tidal forcing from below. In order to study the longitude dependence in daytime E × B <b>drift</b> <b>velocities,</b> we use appropriately-placed magnetometers in the Peruvian, Philippine, Indonesian and Indian longitude sectors. Since we are particularly interested in quantifying the E × B <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> associated with the 4 -cell, non-migrating tidal structure, we compare the seasonal and longitude E × B drift structure with TOPEX satellite observations of Total Electron Content (TEC). We outline a plan to establish the magnitude of the longitude gradients that exist in the daytime, vertical E × B <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> at the boundaries of the observed 4 -cell patterns and to theoretically identify the physical mechanisms that account for these sharp gradients. The paper demonstrates that sharp gradients in E × B <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> exist at one of the 4 -cell boundaries and outlines how the C/NOFS IVM and VEFI sensor observations could be used to establish the E × B drift longitude gradients at the boundaries of each of the 4 cells. In addition, the paper identifies one of the theoretical, atmosphere/ionosphere models that could be employed to identify the physical mechanisms that might explain these observations...|$|R

50|$|When autowave lacet was discovered, {{the first}} {{question}} arose: Does the meander exist ever or the halt of the reverberator drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> of reverberator in the regimes of meander and lacet revealed a clear {{difference between these two}} types of evolution of the reverberator: while the <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> quickly goes to a stationary value during meander, a steady decrease in the <b>drift</b> <b>velocity</b> of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the <b>drift</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E

Owing to the very flat shapes of the bands along the growth direction, very low <b>drift</b> <b>velocities</b> are obtained for vertical transport.
