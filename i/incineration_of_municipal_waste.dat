A number of measurements on emissions of dioxins has been carried out with respect to <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> and processes in the metal industry. The estimates of the emissions of dioxins at most sources have been based on literature, information about industrial processes in the Netherlands and sometimes on one or two measurements in the Netherlands. The total emission of dioxins in the Netherlands is about 950 g TEQ per year. About 800 g of this quantity is due to the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incinerator}} (MSWI) bottom ash is the slag-like material {{produced by the}} <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> and is predominantly composed of glassy constituents, which include inherited manufactured glasses and glasses formed during incineration. Previous results indicate vidence of neoformation of well-ordered clay (illite) from glasses in MSWI bottom ash after 12 y of natural weathering. We investigated the mechanism and conditions of clay formation from glasses during natural weathering using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), experimental leaching experiments and am-monium oxalate extractions. It was concluded that the high surface area and initially high "active " A 1 and associated Si content predispose the ash to form clay minerals on {{a relatively short time}} scale. This work provides evidence that the composition of secondary amorphous aluminosilicate and thus, the type of clay mineral which may form, is determined by the pH of the pore solution rather than by the glass composition. Presumably alternate wetting and drying of the ash during disposal greatly accelerates the formation of well-ordered clays.

40|$|The <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> under {{existing}} {{legislative and}} operational boundary conditions {{is a very}} complex process. An optimisation in the emissions is possible by a splitting up of the combustion air into primary and secondary air.

The physical and chemical processes, which are occurring in the fixed bed of the furnace (e. g. the heterogeneous combustion of the solid waste, the drying of the waste or the turbulent combustion of the gas species), are very complicated because of the large range of the waste composition.

40|$|Aimed {{to give a}} {{preliminary}} image of dioxin pollution in China, chemometric analysis was performed to determine background dioxin levels during the period 1994 - 2002 and potential emission sources. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the congener profiles of 71 sediment samples from rivers, lakes, and sea bays around China were compared with the congener profiles of various known or suspected industrial, residential, and municipal dioxin sources {{to determine whether the}} dioxin residues typically found in a broad range of potential environmental sources could explain the presence of these chemicals in China. It was found that the background dioxin levels of China were similar to those of lightly polluted samples from other countries during the period 1994 - 2002. Primary ferrous ore sintering and secondary lead and aluminum smelters were the major sources of dioxin emission in China. Chloranil and wastewater from chemical plants, sodium pentachlorophenate, and pulp bleaching were also important sources of dioxin emission. Open burning of e-waste as well as diesel-fueled and leaded gas-fueled vehicles were additional possible sources of dioxin. In contrast to other countries, in China, flue gases from <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste,</b> hazardous waste, and medical waste might be minor sources of dioxin emission.

Animals require 0. 05 to 0. 1 mg Se/kg in their diets to prevent Se deficiency but suffer Se toxicosis when dietary levels exceed 5 to 15 mg Se/kg. The earth's crustal materials generally con-tain 50 mg Se/kg and more often contain < 5 mg Se/kg. Soils and plants may discharge volatile forms of Se into the atmosphere.

40|$|The <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> {{involves}} {{the generation of}} climate-relevant emissions. These are mainly emissions of CO 2 (carbon dioxide) as well as N 2 O (nitrous oxide), NOx (oxides of nitrogen) NH 3 (ammonia) and organic C, measured as total carbon. CH 4 (methane) is not generated in waste incineration during normal operation. It only arises in particular, exceptional, cases and to a small extent (from waste remaining in the waste bunker), so that in quantitative terms CH 4 {{is not to be}} regarded as climate-relevant. CO 2 constitutes the chief climate-relevant emission of waste incineration and is considerably higher, by not less than 10 2, than the other emissions. Formulas (1) and (2) are to be used for the purpose of compiling an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, taking the following into account: The incineration of 1 Mg of municipal waste in MSW incinerators is associated with the production/release of about 0. 7 to 1. 2 Mg of carbon dioxide (CO 2 output). The proportion of carbon of biogenic origin is usually in the range of 33 to 50 percent. The climate-relevant CO 2 emissions from waste incineration are determined by the proportion of waste whose carbon compounds are assumed to be of fossil origin. The allocation to fossil or biogenic carbon has a crucial influence on the calculated amounts of climate-relevant CO 2 emissions.

40|$|Elevated dioxin {{concentrations}} in Dutch cow's milk originating from areas near {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) incinerators triggered an extensive research programme in the Netherlands, including (1) emission measurements of all Dutch municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators, (2) compliance of MSW incinerators with licences and directives, (3) dispersion and occurrence of dioxins in air, soil and cow's milk, and (4) dioxin exposure of the Dutch population. These investigations resulted in {{a large number of}} reports. This report provides a comprehensive overview of research results and associated policy implications. Seven out of the twelve incinerators did not comply with the licenses, whereas nine of them did not satisfy the Incineration Directive 1985. Technical management and process control were found to be unsatisfactory in several cases. Dioxin emissions varied between 2, 2 to 360 ng TEQ/m 3 flue gas. Four installations were closed down in 1990. Near several MSW incinerators dioxin {{concentrations in}} milk were found exceeding the milk standard of 6 pg/g fat. Milk and related products from these areas were banned from consumption. The milk standard was based on the result of an exposure analysis that at this value less than 1 % of the Dutch population would exceed the TDI of 10 pg TEQ/kg body weight. At background dioxin concentrations in milk and related products (2 pg TEQ/g fat), the TDI is exceeded by a small fraction of children below 7 years of age. A mathematical chain model was developed that succeeded in quantitatively relating dioxin emissions with amounts in cow's milk. In addition, this model showed that emissions below the required level of 0. 1 ng/m 3 (to be satisfied at 30 November 1993) will make a negligible contribution to levels in cow's milk. Great efforts are presently made to reduce the emissions to this required level. Therefore, it may be expected that in the near future exceedance of the milk standard will not occur anymore in the Netherlands. At some sited levels of 3 - 4 pg TEQ/g fat will endure because of dioxins that have accumulated in soil from high emissions in the past. Although the dioxin problem in the Netherlands has triggered drastic improvements in emissions, it has at the same time aroused opposition from the Dutch population against <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste.</b> Therefore a delay in growth in incineration capacity may be expected. ...|$|E

40|$|As an {{introduction}} of the continuing study on the heavy metal contamination in urban soils, zinc accumulation phenomenon observed in urban areas in south Osaka was reported. The survey of zinc concentration in soybean leaves taken in urban and suburban arable lands indicated its accumulation in a wide area. And a correlation between easy soluble zinc level in soils and leaf zinc content were shown. Zinc concentrations in suspended particles in air, falling dust and some water samples were checked, and {{the high levels of}} zinc were found also in them. In several city parks, significant higher concentrations of zinc and lead in surface than subsurface soils were found. The ratios of easily soluble to total zinc were markedly high in urban soils than rural soils. In Sakai, at sandy fields near the coast of Osaka Bay, where the rotation culture of vegetables prevailed, zinc accumulation in soils was notable among heavy metals. Where the renewal of sand as the vegetable field had been made at intervals, there was a significant increase in zinc contents from new sand to older sand materials. From the above data, it was considered that the zinc accumulation observed in the urban areas was a wide phenomenon through atmospheric pollution caused by zinc emission from various sources.
