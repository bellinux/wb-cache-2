40|$|The {{effect on}} ceramic {{products}} of <b>firing</b> <b>conditions</b> {{in the presence}} of abundant organic matter is assessed here experimentally by reproducing two ancient firing techniques: pit firing, characterised by a high heating rate and short residence time in a reducing atmosphere; kiln firing, with a low heating rate and long residence time in an oxidising atmosphere. As expected, pit <b>firing</b> <b>conditions</b> produced uniformly reduced ceramics, and gehlenite, diopside and spinet occurred at suitable temperatures (above 900 degrees C). Interestingly, in kiln <b>firing</b> <b>conditions,</b> sandwich structures formed in the ceramics, in which mineral assemblages and Fe oxidation state turned out to be different in the black core with respect to the margin. Spinel, cordierite and metallic Fe formed in the core, whereas hematite and spinel, in addition to gehlenite and diopside, crystallised in the margin at suitable temperatures (above 800 degrees C). Therefore, despite the oxidising atmosphere of the <b>firing,</b> reducing <b>conditions</b> occurred in the core, suggesting sluggish oxygen diffusion within the pottery. In addition, decomposition of reactant mineral phases and crystallisation of new mineral products in pit <b>firing</b> <b>conditions</b> occurred at temperatures about 50 degrees C higher than in kiln <b>firing</b> <b>conditions,</b> indicating that residence time strongly controlled reaction kinetics, as higher temperatures (i. e., a higher degree of reaction overstepping) are required when residence time is lower.

Particle packing, microstructure, porosity, as well as morphology of ceramic matrix are correlated to native material composition and firing temperature [1, 2]. These physical properties have been considered and investigated comparing the results obtained by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray micro Computed Tomography (X-ray µCT). Recent measurements on archaeological and art materials by the innovative and nondestructive X-ray µCT method show promising results in Cultural Heritage field. This technique offers the advantages to provide information by images of the inner part of the object and to preserve its integrity [3, 4, 5]. In this preliminary study home-made ceramic samples obtained from calcite-rich clay and subjected to different firing temperatures (in the 400 °C- 1000 °Crange) have been analyzed. SEM, MIP and X-ray µCT have provided complementary information regarding the effects of <b>firing</b> <b>condition</b> on physical properties and microstructure of ceramic mixture.

30|$|There is no {{question}} that settlement patterns in highly flammable vegetation, with heavy fuel loads and extreme <b>fire</b> <b>conditions,</b> were major contributory factors in the recent Victorian bushfires. Indeed, the <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> on 7 February 2009 were unprecedented, reflecting the combined effects of a sustained heatwave, prolonged drought, and strong winds. To place this event into context, consider that the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI: Luke and McArthur 1978) was created such that values > 50 indicate extreme fire weather, and Black Friday, on 13 January 1937, had an FFDI of 100; yet on Black Saturday, 7 February 2009, the FFDI reached as high as 180, the worst <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> ever recorded. So severe were the <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> that a new category of fire danger rating, catastrophic, was created (Country Fire Authority 2010).

In this paper, the restoring force surface (RFS) method and the nonlinear identification through feedback of outputs (NIFO) method are first combined for parameter identification in a simplified barrel-cradle structure. With the RFS method, clearance value {{can be obtained by}} analyzing the restoring force plot. Then the contact stiffness can be identified by using NIFO method. This identification process is verified in a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with clearance. To adapt to the rigid-flexible coupled beam system with clearances which is simplified from the barrel-cradle structure, a modification for the combined method mentioned above is proposed. The core idea of the modification is reducing the continuous system to multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system to reserve the nonlinear characteristics through modal transformation matrix. The advantage of this transformation is that the linear parts of the MDOF systems are decoupled, which greatly reduces the difficulty of identification.

Neuronal networks are studied {{in this paper}} through a discrete dynamical systems approach. A neuronal network is modeled by a loop-free digraph together with two vectors representing the refractory period and the threshold of each neuron, respectively. A vertex of the digraph corresponds to a neuron, each arc is interpreted as a synaptic connection between two neurons and the network itself is randomly drawn with given probability of connections between any two neurons. The (finite-state) discrete dynamical system is built {{on a set of}} rules that define the <b>firing</b> <b>condition</b> for a neuron and then determine how this event affects the states of the other neurons. The central question addressed in the paper is how the connectivity of the network influences the type and number of possible attractors. The authors identify two phase transitions for the probability of connections that have important consequences on the type of minimal attractors of the associated dynamical system. The existence of these phase transitions is also tested in numerical experiments. As a consequence it results that if the connectivity of the network is sufficiently high then the system is in the ordered regime with high probability...|$|E

40|$|Concrete structures, {{contrary}} to steel or timber structures, {{have not been}} traditionally considered as significantly sensitive to <b>fire</b> <b>conditions.</b> As a consequence, their performance in <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> has generally been assessed {{on the basis of}} quite simplified rules provided in codes of practice, mostly dealing with minimum geometric requirements in terms of thickness and concrete cover. Accidents under <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> have nevertheless revealed a certain level of vulnerability of concrete structures in fire and have thus shown that code regulations are potentially insufficient to cover this aspect of design. As a reaction to this level of simplicity, some codes are currently available with specific and very detailed provisions with reference to fire design in concrete structures, such as EN 1992 - 1 - 2, covering a wide number of simplified and advanced design procedures. Unfortunately, the hierarchy of these procedures and which one is most suitable for a given situation is sometimes unclear for designers. In addition, it is probably not necessary to perform rather complex and detailed analyses for all types of structures, but the level of refinement can be adapted to the sensitivity of the structure to <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> and to its significance for the society. In this paper, a possible approach for consistent design of concrete structures under <b>fire</b> <b>conditions</b> is proposed based on the Levels-of-Approximation philosophy.
