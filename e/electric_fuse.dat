It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas. The other end of the hose went to a retort that {{was filled with}} chlorinate of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide. The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner. Oxygen gas, generated at 600 cubic feet per hour, went through a lime-water wash and from there to fill the balloon.

The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloon. Each gas had an <b>electric</b> <b>fuse</b> detonator inside, which made it a type of [...] "bomb" [...] when triggered electrically.

This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react, creating water (H2O). This man-made water then acted as a nucleus for making rain out of the atmosphere.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{government}} funding provided of $9,000 then {{with support from}} Senators Charles B. Farwell and Leland Stanford for a full-scale test experiment in northern Texas. There was to be completed a scientific analysis of the results. The man-made rain project was to take place {{near the town of}} Midland. The equipment involved in this test was 100 [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloons, dozens of kites six to twelve feet high, miles of copper wire, nitroglycerine, dynamite, and gunpowder. Myers provided all the balloons and the gases. Electric batteries and generators were also part of the on-site equipment. The design of the rain experiment project was to have explosions stir up particle aggregation. Myers' balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were the start of many such explosions that were to take place in the rain producing experiment. His balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were one part oxygen gas combined with two parts of hydrogen gas, which would make a huge explosion upon detonation. The side effect of this balloon explosion was that water was produced. This water would drop from the sky at some high altitude and the idea was that all of this action would stimulate the atmosphere to make rain. The balloons made by Myers for the government at his [...] "balloon farm" [...] would hold 500 to 5000 cubic feet of gas. Myers had complete charge of the government rain producing experiments for years.Each ten foot diameter balloon was filled with one-third oxygen and two-thirds hydrogen. To do this, the empty balloon was spread out on the ground with plenty of room around it. It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas. The other end of the hose went to a retort that was filled with chlorinate of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide. The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner. Oxygen gas, generated at 600 cubic feet per hour, went through a lime-water wash and from there to fill the balloon. The balloon was filled up one third of the way. The hose was then connected to the hydrogen gas generator and filled up the remaining two-thirds of the way. The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloon. Each gas had an <b>electric</b> <b>fuse</b> detonator inside, which made it a type of [...] "bomb" [...] when triggered electrically. Wires were used that led from the ground to the balloon and when an electrical charge was made by a dynamo, it passed through the wires to set off the detonator causing an explosion that was brighter than the sun. This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react, creating water (H2O). This man-made water then acted as a nucleus for making rain out of the atmosphere.Myers made one hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the government to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{essentially}} {{presents the}} experimental {{investigation of the}} fundamental phenomena of <b>electric</b> <b>fuse</b> element disintegration and its causation and influence on the subsequent fragmentation of the fuse elements when subjected to excessive fault currents. The basis of the study involved experimental observation of disintegration of fuse elements and {{the analysis of the}} dynamic responses of current-carrying conductors, which precipitate disintegration. The experimental techniques employed utilised commercially available video cameras to capture images of element disruptions during disintegration of fuse elements subjected to low short-circuit and high overload currents. Specialist experimental image capturing techniques and hardware implementations were developed to enable investigation of element disintegration caused by high short-circuit fault currents. Disintegration phenomena of fuse elements for all fault cases were compared within different time domains, which included specialist techniques to investigate disintegration of elements in sand and against glass substrates. Disintegration phenomena of elements in unconfined media such as air and water also constituted the studies. The studies diverged, finally, into experimental observations of the temporal development of arc initiation and extinction phenomena of fault current limiting of HBC fuses using spectroscopic analysis of the arc light radiation. The range of studies covered have led to new understandings of fundamental current limiting behaviour of HBC and open type fuses which contribute, in a small way, to the knowledge base of the subject and hopefully will be an aid to improved designs and development of new types of <b>electric</b> <b>fuse...</b>|$|E

The energy brought by the fault current is withdrawn by means of the interaction between the electric arc and the arc quenching material (usually silica sand) whose morphometric properties influence the properties of the plasma column: composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients of the plasma column depend on the porosity (and other morphometric properties) of the filler. The fuse element erosion also known as burn-back is responsible for the lengthening of the plasma column and the variations of the electric field.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the working}} of {{electrical}} fuses, inside the fuse element the silver ribbon first begins to melt, to vaporize {{and then a}} fuse arc appears between the two separated parts of the element. Second, the electrodes are struck and the burn-back phenomenon takes place. Usually, the silver ribbon is enclosed inside a cavity filled with silica sand. During the vaporization of the fuse element, one can consider that the volume is fixed so that the pressure increase appears to reach pressures higher than atmospheric pressure. Thus, in this paper two pressures, 1 atm and 10 atm, are considered. The electrical field inside the plasma can reach high values since {{the distance between the}} cathode surface and the anode surface varies with time. That is to say from zero cm to one cm order. So we consider various electrical fields: 102 V/m, 103 V/m, 5 × 103 V/m, 104 V/m at atmospheric pressure and 105 V/m at a pressure of 10 atm.

50|$|Renard {{series are}} {{a system of}} {{preferred}} numbers dividing an interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps. This set of preferred numbers was proposed in the 1870s by French army engineer Colonel Charles Renard. His system was adopted in 1952 as international standard ISO 3. Renard's system of preferred numbers divides the interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps.

During the failure process of such materials under external stress (load or voltage), avalanches consisting of simultaneous rupture of several elements occur, with a distribution D(Δ) {{of the magnitude}} Δ of such avalanches. The distribution is typically a power law D(Δ) ∝Δ^-ξ. For the systems we study here, a crossover behavior is seen between two power laws, with a small exponent ξ {{in the vicinity of}} complete breakdown and a larger exponent ξ for failures away from the breakdown point. We demonstrate this analytically for bundles of many fibers where the load is uniformly distributed among the surviving fibers. In this case ξ= 3 / 2 near the breakdown point and ξ= 5 / 2 away from it. The latter is known to be the generic behavior. This crossover is a signal of imminent catastrophic failure of the material.

But fuses never carry current neither operate under standardized conditions. For example, rated current is evaluated under specified ambient temperature, without cooling air-flow, and with 1 meter-long connection-cables on both sides. In the field, temperature can reach up 80 ∘C, with or without air-flow and connection-parts are much more shorter. An issue is that current is never constant, often being cyclingly applied; equipments are frequently in use during the day and stopped in the night. ON-time and OFF-time generate alternative heating, then alternative stresses leading to thermal fatigue.
