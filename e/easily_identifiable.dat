5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a {{deterrent}} to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|While the eze Nri lived {{relatively}} secluded {{from his}} followers, he employed {{a group of}} Jesuit-like officials called ndi Nri. These were ritual specialists, <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> by facial scarifications or ichi, who traveled with ritual staffs of peace in order to purify the earth from human crimes. The ndi Nri exercised authority over wide areas of Igboland and {{had the power to}} install the next eze Nri.|$|E
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, {{but they are the}} largest members of the colony. The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The hairs on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E

50|$|Deep Space Nine drew {{praise from}} African-American, Latino and other {{minority}} viewers for its {{handling of the}} minority characters, particularly the Sisko family members. In addition, actor Alexander Siddig (who portrayed Dr. Bashir) expressed his enthusiasm {{for the fact that}} he, with his English accent, unusual screen name at time of casting (Siddig El Fadil), and North African heritage was a main character on a prominent television show despite being not as <b>easily</b> racially <b>identifiable</b> to audiences as many other actors and characters were on TV at the time.|$|R
500|$|Because humpbacks are {{typically}} <b>easily</b> approachable, curious, <b>identifiable</b> {{as individuals and}} display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale tourism around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of [...] "ecotourism" [...] {{to benefit from the}} species without killing them. This business brings in revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.|$|R
5|$|This sparrow is {{distinctive}} {{even within}} its genus {{in that it}} has no plumage differences between the sexes; the juvenile also resembles the adult, although the colours tend to be duller. Its contrasting face pattern makes this species <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> in all plumages; the smaller size and brown, not grey, crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow. Adult and juvenile Eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete moult in the autumn, and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat. The change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth, and a generally higher water content in the body.|$|E
5|$|While not {{a bright}} constellation, Corona Australis is {{nonetheless}} distinctive {{due to its}} <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> pattern of stars, which {{has been described as}} horseshoe- or oval-shaped. Though it has no stars brighter than 4th magnitude, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (brighter than magnitude 5.5). Nicolas Louis de Lacaille used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether. Mu Coronae Australis, a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III and apparent magnitude 5.21, was labelled by Johann Elert Bode and retained by Benjamin Gould, who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics Advance {{uses the}} {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain {{changes such as}} a customizable map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advances graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> and many motion frames {{have been given to}} create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a Game Cube for this to work.|$|E

5000|$|Armstrong {{also notes}} that North Korea has {{actually}} transferred the [...] "filial piety of nationalism in {{the family of the}} leader himself" [...] by positioning Kim Il Sung as the universal patriarch. He argues that while the official pursuit of the Juche ideology in the 1960s signaled North Korea's desire to separate from the [...] "fraternity of international socialism," [...] the ideology also replaced Stalin as the father figure with Kim Il Sung. In effect, North Korea's familial nationalism has supplanted the [...] "rather abstract, class-oriented language of socialism with a more <b>easily</b> understandable and <b>identifiable</b> language of familial connections, love and obligations." ...|$|R
5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans is {{a social}} wasp and {{is part of the}} family Vespidae of the order Hymenoptera. It is found {{throughout}} the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas and parts of Canada. Due to solitary nest founding by queens, P. exclamans has extended its range {{in the past few decades}} and now covers the eastern half of the United States, as well as part of the north. This expansion is typically attributed to changing global climate and temperatures. P. exclamans has three specific castes, including males, workers, and queens, but the dominance hierarchy is further distinguished by age. The older the wasp is, the higher it is in ranking within the colony. In most P. exclamans nests, there is one queen who lays all the eggs in the colony. The physiological similarities between the worker and queen castes have led to experiments attempting to distinguish the characteristics of these two castes and how they are determined, though males have <b>easily</b> <b>identifiable</b> physiological characteristics. Since P. exclamans live in relatively small, open combed nests, they are often subject to predators and parasites, such as Chalcoela iphitalis, Elasmus polistis, and birds. P. exclamans have defense and recognition strategies that help protect against these predators and parasites.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the analysis of data that contains (multiple) structural changes in a linear regression setup. We implement various strategies which have been suggested in the literature for testing against structural changes as well as a dynamic programming algorithm for the dating of the breakpoints in the R statistical software package. Using historical data on Nile river discharges, road casualties in Great Britain and oil prices in Germany it is shown that changes in the mean of a time series {{as well as in the}} coefficients of a linear regression are <b>easily</b> matched with <b>identifiable</b> historical, political or economic events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree {{scenarios}} of dismantling and shredding operations of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) were compared {{in this study}} with respect to technical and sustainability criteria, according {{to the level of}} dismantling applied to the vehicles. The scenarios differed from each other in the extent of the dismantling operations. They were implemented experimentally at the industrial scale on representative samples of 120 vehicles. The data collected from the monitoring of the experimental campaigns were used as feed data for the multi-criteria analysis of the scenarios using the PROMETHEE method. Nine criteria of evaluation were selected, namely global warming, local environmental impacts, tropospheric ozone production, ecotoxicity, operational costs, investment costs, occupational risks, employability, and technical performance. The medium-level dismantling scenario was identified as the best scenario with respect to the criteria of evaluation. This scenario included the steps of depollution, followed by the removal of <b>easily</b> accessible and <b>identifiable</b> plastics and glasses. Reasonable changes in the ponderation of the evaluation criteria did not significantly affect the ranking...|$|R

40|$|Searching {{databases}} for distant homologues using alignments {{instead of}} individual sequences increases {{the power of}} detection. However, most methods assume that protein evolution proceeds in a regular fashion, with the inferred tree of sequences providing a good estimation of the evolutionary process. We investigated the combined HMMER search results from random alignment subsets (with three sequences each) drawn from the parent alignment (Rand-shuffle algorithm), using the SCOP structural classification to determine true similarities. At false-positive rates of 5 %, the Rand-shuffle algorithm improved HMMER's sensitivity, with a 37. 5 % greater sensitivity compared with HMMER alone, when <b>easily</b> identified similarities (<b>identifiable</b> by BLAST) were excluded from consideration. An extension of the Rand-shuffle algorithm (Ali-shuffle) weighted towards more informative sequence subsets. This approach improved the performance over HMMER alone and PSI-BLAST, particularly at higher false-positive rates. The improvements in performance of these sequence sub-sampling methods may reflect lower sensitivity to alignment error and irregular evolutionary patterns. The Ali-shuffle and Rand-shuffle sequence homology search programs are available by request from the authors...|$|R
