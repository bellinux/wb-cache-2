50|$|The Nice 2 model {{addresses}} some {{weaknesses of}} the original Nice model. The first weakness is the artificial selection of the initial orbits of the outer planets to produce an instability that matches {{the timing of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment. The second weakness is the sensitivity of the timing of the instability to the location of the inner edge of the planetesimal disk. The Nice 2 model uses particular initial conditions, derived from the examination of the orbital evolution of giant planets orbiting in a gas disk, which may occur under appropriate circumstances. An <b>instability</b> <b>trigger</b> with no apparent correlation between the timing of the instability and the position of the inner edge of the planetesimal disk {{is the result of the}} incorporation of the interactions between planetesimals into the Nice 2 model.|$|E
40|$|We analyze a {{two-dimensional}} Pomeranchuk-Nematic <b>instability,</b> <b>trigger</b> by the Landau parameter F_ 2 < 0, {{in the presence}} of a small magnetic field. Using Landau Fermi liquid theory in the isotropic phase, we analyze the collective modes near the quantum critical point F_ 2 =- 1,ω_c= 0 (where ω_c is the cyclotron frequency). We focus on the effects of parity symmetry breaking on the Fermi surface deformation. We show that, for studying the critical regime, the linear response approximation of the Landau-Silin equation is not sufficient and it is necessary to compute corrections at least of order ω_c^ 2. Identifying the slowest oscillation mode in the disordered phase, we compute the phase diagram for the isotropic/nematic phase transition in terms of F_ 2 and ω_c.

40|$|Reliable {{detection}} of developing transverse instabilities in the Large Hadron Collider {{is one of}} the main operational challenges of the LHC's high intensity proton run. A full machine snapshot provided from the moment of instability is a crucial input to develop and fine tune instability models. The transverse feedback system (ADT) is the only instrument in LHC, where a full rate bunch by bunch transverse position information is available. Together with a sub-micron resolution it makes it a perfect place to detect transverse beam motion. Very large amounts of data, at very high data rates (8 Gb/s) need to be processed on the fly to detect onset of transverse instability. A very powerful computer system (so called ADTObsBox) was developed and put into operation by the CERN RF group, which is capable of processing the full rate data streams from ADT and perform an on the fly instability detection. The output of this system is a timing event with a list of all bunches developing instability, which is then sent to the LHC-wide <b>instability</b> <b>trigger</b> network to freeze other observation instruments. The device also provides buffers with raw position data for offline analysis...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiorespiratory {{instability}} (CRI) in noninvasively monitored step-down unit (SDU) patients has {{a variety}} of etiologies, and therefore likely manifests in different patterns of vital signs (VS) changes. Objective: We sought to describe differences in admission characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without CRI. We explored use of clustering techniques to identify VS patterns within initial CRI epoch (CRI 1) and assessed inter-cluster differences in admission characteristics, outcomes and medications. Methods: Admission characteristics and continuous monitoring data (frequency 1 / 20 Hz) were recorded in 307 patients. Vital sign (VS) deviations beyond local <b>instability</b> <b>trigger</b> criteria for 3 consecutive minutes or for 4 out of a 5 minute moving window were classified as CRI events. We identified CRI 1 in 133 patients, derived statistical features of CRI 1 epoch and employed hierarchical and k-means clustering techniques. We tested several clustering solutions and used 10 -fold cross validation and ANOVA to establish best solution. Inter-cluster differences in admission characteristics, outcomes and medications were assessed. Main Results: Patients transferred to the SDU from units with higher monitoring capability were more likely to develop CRI (n= 133, CRI 44...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{models of}} the solar {{chromosphere}} show intense electron heating immediately above its temperature minimum. Mechanisms such as resistive dissipation and shock waves appear insufficient {{to account for the}} persistence and uniformity of this heating as inferred from both UV lines and continuum measurements. This paper further develops the theory of the Farley-Buneman Instability (FBI) which could contribute substantially to this heating. It expands upon the single ion theory presented by Fontenla (2005) by developing a multiple ion species approach that better models the diverse, metal-dominated ion plasma of the solar chromosphere. This analysis generates a linear dispersion relationship that predicts the critical electron drift velocity needed to trigger the instability. Using careful estimates of collision frequencies and a one-dimensional, semi-empirical model of the chromosphere, this new theory predicts that the instability may be triggered by velocities as low as 4 km s^- 1, well below the neutral acoustic speed. In the Earth's ionosphere, the FBI occurs frequently in situations where the <b>instability</b> <b>trigger</b> speed significantly exceeds the neutral acoustic speed. From this, we expect neutral flows rising from the photosphere to have enough energy to easily create electric fields and electron Hall drifts with sufficient amplitude to make the FBI common in the chromosphere. If so, this process will provide a mechanism to convert neutral flow and turbulence energy into electron thermal energy in the quiet Sun.

40|$|Landslide {{triggering}} {{induced by}} high-intensity rainfall infiltration in hillslopes {{is a complex}} phenomenon that involves hydrological processes operating at different spatio-temporal scales. Empirical methods give rough information about landslide-prone areas, without investigating the theoretical framework needed to achieve an in-depth understanding of the involved physical processes. In this study, we tackle this issue through physical experiments developed in an artificial hillslope realized in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering of the University of Padua. The structure consists of a reinforced concrete box containing a soil prism with the following maximum dimensions: 3. 5 m high, 6 m long, and 2 m wide. In order to analyze and examine the triggered failure state, the experiments are carried out with intensive monitoring of pore water pressure and moisture content response. Subsurface monitoring instruments are installed at several locations and depths to measure downward infiltration and/or a rising groundwater table. We measure the unsaturated soil water pressure as well as positive pore pressures preceding failure in each experiments with six tensiometers. The volumetric water content is determined through six Time Domain Reflectometry probes. Two pressure transducers are located in observation wells to determine {{the position of the}} water table in time. Two stream gauges are positioned at the toeslope, for measuring both runoff and subsurface outflow. All data are collected and recorded by an acquisition data system from Campbell Scientific. The artificial hillslope is characterized by well-known and controlled conditions, which are designed to reproduce an ideal set-up susceptible to heavy rainfall landslide. The hydrologic forcing is generated by a rainfall simulator realized with nozzles from Sprying System and. specifically designed to produce a spatially uniform rainfall of intensity ranging from 50 to 150 mm/h. The aim of our experiments is to reproduce the <b>instability</b> <b>trigger</b> that occurs in saturated or partially unsaturated conditions depending on the specific characteristics of the soil and its initial conditions; the retention curve of fine sand and the initial porosity are taken into account to highlight the hydrological condition of the surface layer during the trigger occurrence. Through our experimental setup we can investigate the succession of phases and their magnitude that cause the landslide trigger, {{in order to understand the}} instability mechanism that heavy rainfall can induce in fine sandy hillslopes. Particular attention is given on the role of water pressure head, not only with respect to the violation of Coulomb failure within a sloping soil, but also with respect to the subsequent deformation that involves the upper hillslope layers. In particular, we report here on the characterization of the sandy terrain used in the experiments and the preliminary results, together with a first discussion of the observed data...|$|E

Further, even if the expected flows by magnetic reconnection are narrow and short-lived, such as those observed BBFs, they do not have enough energy (1021  ergs or less).
