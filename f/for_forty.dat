5|$|The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth.

Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, Barbarians plundered the region around Klis.

The name of Klis (Kleisa or Kleisoura) was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio.

5|$|From there, the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea, {{the chief}} city of Bithynia and {{capital of the}} {{powerful}} Opsician Theme. The Arabs arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably {{under the command of}} the Count of the Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. The Arabs assaulted the city <b>for</b> <b>forty</b> days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed to take it. In late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking along many captives and much booty. The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea, but this is clearly an error.|$|E

Boris explains that it's actually a story about how an aunt and uncle of his met at Passover Seder back in Russia.|$|E
