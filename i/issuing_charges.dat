50|$|Detective Jimmy McNulty {{meets with}} Major William Rawls and Sergeant Jay Landsman. Rawls tells McNulty he expects him {{to finish up}} the detail and {{be back in the}} {{homicide}} division in a week's time, which McNulty has no intention of doing. Rawls goes through the ballistics link to the old cases McNulty and Bunk had been investigating. Pressured by Rawls, Landsman orders Bunk to charge the cases. McNulty, Greggs and Freamon meet with Bunk to discuss the impact on the Barksdale investigation. They expect <b>issuing</b> <b>charges</b> will prompt Avon Barksdale to change his operations structure and negate all their work. Rawls refuses to shift his position even when Daniels asks him to do it as a favor, but Daniels convinces Deputy Commissioner Burrell to overrule Rawls. Rawls responds by asking Detective Santangelo to keep him informed of anything that McNulty does that might be used against him.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on acceptability of road pricing schemes is reviewed, {{and a number}} of limitations of that research are identified. In particular, little evidence is found of the differences between users and non-users and the effects of scheme design and level of charge. A stated preference survey was conducted in two UK cities to provide evidence on these <b>issues.</b> <b>Charging</b> was found to be more acceptable to non-users, those who perceived pollution and congestion to be very serious, those who considered current conditions unacceptable, and those who judged road pricing to be effective. It proved possible to identify design combinations, for both cities, which would be voted for by a majority. © 2005 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R
