5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex impedance) laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>impedance,</b> that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E

40|$|The extra element theorem (EET) {{states that}} any {{transfer}} {{function of a}} linear system can be {{expressed in terms of}} its value when a given “extra” element is absent, and a correction factor involving the extra element and two <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> <b>impedances</b> seen by the element. One class of applications is when a system has already been analyzed and later an extra element is {{to be added to the}} model: the EET avoids the analysis having to be restarted from scratch. Another class of applications is when a system is to be analyzed for the first time: if one element is designated as “extra,” the analysis can be performed on the simpler model in the absence of the designated element, and the result modified by the EET correction factor upon restoration of the “extra” element. Although the EET itself is not new, its interpretation and application appear to be little known. In this paper, the EET is derived and applied to several examples in a manner that has been developed and refined in the classroom over a number of years.

40|$|Building {{structures}} and spacecraft in orbit will require technologies for positioning, docking/berthing, and joining orbital structures. A fundamental problem underlying {{the operation of}} docking and berthing is that of controlling the contact dynamics of mechanical structures actuated by active mechanisms such as robotic devices. Control systems must be designed to control these active mechanisms so that both the free space motions and contact motions are stable and satisfy specifications on position accuracy and bounds on contact forces. For the large orbital structures of the future, the problem of interactive dynamics and control is fundamentally different in several ways {{than it was for}} spacecraft docking in the past. First, future space structures must be treated as flexible structures - the operations of docking, berthing, and assembly will need to respect the vibrations of the structures. Second, the assembly of these structures will require multiple-point contact, rather than the essentially single-point positioning of conventional spacecraft docking. Third, some assembly operations require the subassemblies to be brought and held in contact so that successful joining can be accomplished. A preliminary study of contact stability and compliance control design has resulted in the development of an analytical method and a design method to analyze stability. The analytical method analyzes the problem of stability when an actively-controlled structure contacts a passive structure. This method makes it possible to accurately estimate the stiffness of the passive structures with which the contact motion will become unstable. The analytic results suggest that passivity is neither achievable in practice, nor necessary as a design concept. A contact control system need only be passive up to a certain frequency; beyond that frequency the system can be stabilized with sufficiently small gains. With this concept the Center developed a design methodology for achieving desired compliant contact motions. This design method is based on H-infinity norm optimization, which makes it possible to consider both <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> and systems robustness to modeling uncertainty.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the results of}} an experimental campaign whose aim was the identification of the hand-arm <b>driving</b> <b>point</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> (DPMI) in presence of a stimulus having an unknown direction. This situation is relevant in case of cylindrical handles, where the tool can be gripped in different ways independently from the vibration direction. In this case, xh and zh ISO 10068 curves can be conveniently substituted by a unique parameter, here referred to as " radial impedance" Radial impedance values have been determined with an experimental campaign based on the classical setup in which the vibration is generated by an electrodynamic shaker and the force component parallel to the vibration is measured by an instrumented handle. The vibration direction was always vertical, while the different postures entailed a different stimulus orientation with respect to the hand, forearm and shoulder. The hand-arm posture was monitored using a purposely designed measurement system. The push forces transmitted by the operator to the handle were measured using load cells, while the grip force was measured before the tests using a pressure matrix. A statistical analysis on the radial DPMI data was performed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques. Results showed that the uncertainty deriving from the adoption of the radial impedance in presence of cylindrical handles does not always lead to a larger uncertainty with respect to the ISO 10068 data. Coherently with the existing literature studies, also the radial DPMI depends on the forces transmitted to the handle and on the wrist, elbow and shoulder postures. The opportunity of adopting (in specific cases) the radial impedance instead of the xh and zh is discussed. Relevance to industry: Hand-transmitted vibration may cause a variety of vascular and musculoskeletal disorders that often result in loss of work capacity and compromised quality of life. The concept of radial impedance described in this paper can be used in the design of devices meant to reduce the vibration transmitted to the workers, thus reducing the above mentioned risks...|$|R
