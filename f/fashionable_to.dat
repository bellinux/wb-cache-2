5|$|In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable {{again in}} the middle of the 18th century. They were {{considered}} an interesting counterpoint to Palladian classical architecture, and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the Norman style of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on the Diary, {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote {{a large number of}} songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> imitate.|$|E

5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E
25|$|Loose gowns, {{sometimes}} with a wrapped or surplice front closure, were worn over the shift (chemise), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, {{and it was}} <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the late}} 2010s, {{platform}} boots became <b>fashionable</b> due <b>to</b> {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1970s fashion. These included so-called [...] "nothing shoes" [...] with clear Perspex soles, and mule sandals.|$|R
25|$|Just as groups {{often appear}} as symmetries, quantum groups act on many other {{mathematical}} objects.. It has become <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> introduce the adjective quantum {{in cases where}} quantum groups act on objects. For example, there are quantum planes and quantum Grassmannians.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> pluck or shave the {{forehead}} {{to raise the}} hairlines. The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of the}} veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled through the hole {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|E
25|$|Recently, Australian Shiraz {{producers}} {{have started to}} add up to 4% Viognier to their Shiraz to add apricot tones to the wine's nose and palate. With such a small percentage added, the producer wasn't obliged to declare the blend on the label. In the past 5 years however, it's becoming increasingly <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> label the wine Shiraz Viognier as Viognier gains consumer acceptance in the market place. The practise of blending Viognier with Syrah has actually been common for years in the Northern Rhône Valley region of Cote-Rotie.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|E
25|$|The British nobility {{had been}} {{demolishing}} their country houses since the 15th century, when comfort replaced fortification {{as an essential}} need. For many, demolishing and rebuilding their country homes became a lifelong hobby, in particular during the 18th century when it became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> take the Grand Tour and return home with art treasures, supposedly brought from classical civilizations. During the 19th century, many houses were enlarged to accommodate the increasing armies of servants needed to create the famed country house lifestyle. Less than a century later, this often meant they were of an unmanageable size.|$|E
25|$|Although it is <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> blame all of Asia's present {{problems}} on corruption {{and the failure}} of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, of too many imprudent lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E

25|$|Planometria, or, The Whole Art of Surveying of Land was a {{pamphlet}} written in 1650 by Leybourn and published under the pseudonym Oliver Wallinby. Leybourn expanded {{this into a}} full book, The Compleat Surveyor which {{was first published in}} 1653, by his own press. This was the first book published on the subject that did not contain an extensive argument justifying surveying. The book outlined the various instruments used in surveying, and how they were employed. This book was one of the standard references in the field {{for the remainder of the}} 17th century and into the 18th century. The book instructed property surveyors on the construction of property maps, and how to make the appropriate coloured inks for the maps. At this time, the use of private estates maps was starting to become <b>fashionable,</b> <b>to</b> the extent that some very pleased clients would display the coloured maps for their guests to view. The book also contains instructions on mathematical measures. The section on the use of Gunter's chains as a unit of length shows early use of decimals in surveying. Leybourn would later expand and clairify this in his 1657 work Arithmetick, Vulgar, Decimal and Instramental.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his racial stereotyping, from his early years, Hergé was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of United States society in a prelude comment to Tintin in America published in Le Petit Vingtième on 20 August 1931, and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in The Blue Lotus. Peeters asserted that [...] "Hergé was no more racist than the next man", an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Hergé in the 1980s commented that [...] "you couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist". In contrast, President of the International Bande Dessinée Society Laurence Grove opined that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that [...] "When it was <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> be a Nazi, he was a Nazi. When it was <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> be a colonial racist, that's what he was." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Lobdell {{claims that}} it is more often the fans, rather than editors, that have {{stronger}} negative reaction to LGBT issues. Moore notes however, that [...] "it's probably quite <b>fashionable...</b> <b>to</b> have the odd gay character," [...] and that the inclusion of LGBT people continues to improve in mainstream comics, but that the characters continue to be limited by stereotypes and do not represent a varied cross-section of LGBT people. Greg Rucka says that some scenes of same-sex interactions are rejected by editors due to unease with sexual content in general rather than the LGBT content.|$|E
500|$|It became <b>fashionable</b> <b>to</b> restore castles {{as private}} homes, {{and the future}} George II may have {{considered}} making Ludlow habitable again, but was deterred by the estimated costs of £30,000. Henry Herbert, the Earl of Powis, later became interested in acquiring the castle and in 1771 approached the Crown about leasing it. It is uncertain if he intended to further strip the castle of its materials or, more likely, if he intended {{to turn it into}} a private home, but the castle was, according to Powis' surveyor's report later that year, already [...] "extremely ruinous", the walls [...] "mostly rubble and the battlements greatly decayed". The Crown offered a 31-year lease at £20 a year, which Powis accepted in 1772, only to die shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Southampton {{became a}} Spa Town in 1740, {{thanks to the}} {{discovery}} of a spring of Chalybeate water. The area was laid out as Spa gardens and earned Royal Patronage. That further encouraged <b>fashionable</b> society <b>to</b> Southampton and aided its prosperity and development.|$|R
