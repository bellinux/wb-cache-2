5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place {{in the lobby of the}} hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with a sledgehammer and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Phorce is a remix {{album of}} Super Furry Animals' 2003 record Phantom Power. The remixes had {{previously}} {{appeared on the}} DVD version of Phantom Power—they were re-released as Phantom Phorce on the band's own Placid Casual label {{as a way of}} ensuring the remixers would receive royalties for the tracks. The album features a commentary from the fictional 'Kurt Stern' who appears between songs to discuss the re-recording of Phantom Power under his guidance after being unhappy with the original. First editions of the album came packaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> doubled as a paper model of a video game arcade cabinet, and included a bonus CD; the Slow Life EP. Critical reaction to Phantom Phorce was generally positive.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in January 1999, he {{immediately}} replaced two top officials, and {{one-third of the}} remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials. In his first year, he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, {{in an effort to}} reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit. In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, and it was fully established the following year. Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001. In 2002, his office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> lacked a victim's body.|$|E

25|$|The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) {{declared}} Abubakar ineligible to run due to fraud charges. A High Court {{had ruled}} that the commission could not disqualify candidates, but INEC claimed that the constitution barred candidates from running if indicted. Another superior court, the Court of Appeal, ruled in favour of the Electoral Commission by saying that it has powers to disqualify candidates. Abubakar attempted {{to get on the}} ballot via court challenge. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> came before the apex court, the court ruled that INEC has no constitutional powers to disqualify any candidates for the election, clearing the way for Abubakar to run. The Supreme Court, the country's highest judicial body, confirmed this ruling and reaffirmed Abubakar's candidacy.|$|E
25|$|Combs rose to {{national}} prominence by successfully defending Appalachian Volunteers Margaret and Alan McSurely against charges of sedition <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> took 15 years to fully adjudicate. After a long legal career, Combs unseated incumbent Elijah M. Hogge {{for a seat}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1989, he challenged incumbent James B. Stephenson for his seat on the Kentucky Supreme Court. During the campaign, he attacked some of Stephenson's previous opinions in violation of a state judicial code that forbade judicial candidates from stating opinions related to cases they might later be asked to rule on. After the election, which Combs won, he was suspended for three months for violating the code, but the suspension was not carried out because Combs appealed the constitutionality of the code and eventually succeeded in overturning it.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, Marcus Neff hired {{attorney}} John H. Mitchell {{to complete}} some legal business, {{but failed to}} pay Mitchell's bill. Mitchell sued and received a default judgment against Neff, with Neff's property sold at auction to pay the bill. Pennoyer purchased the land from Mitchell, who had purchased the land at the sheriff's auction, and later Neff {{became aware of the}} forced sale. Neff then sued Pennoyer to regain the property <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> became the U.S. Supreme Court case of Pennoyer v. Neff that defined legal jurisdiction for citizens residing in different states. At the trial, federal judge and Pennoyer adversary Matthew Deady ruled in favor of Neff, with the Supreme Court affirming the decision in 1877. Pennoyer was compelled to give the land back to Neff, and the property became a part of the Willamette Heights neighborhood in later years.|$|E

25|$|Over time ECJ {{developed}} two essential {{rules on}} which the legal order rests: direct effect and primacy. The court first ruled on the direct effect of primary legislation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that,</b> though technical and tedious, raised a fundamental principle of Union law. In Van Gend en Loos (1963), a Dutch transport firm brought a complaint against Dutch customs for increasing the duty on a product imported from Germany. The {{court ruled that the}} Community constitutes a new legal order, the subjects of which consist of not only the Member States but also their nationals. The principle of direct effect would have had little impact if Union law did not supersede national law. Without supremacy the Member States could simply ignore EU rules. In Costa v ENEL (1964), the court ruled that member states had definitively transferred sovereign rights to the Community and Union law could not be overridden by domestic law.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bones}} were prepared, photographed and studied, {{they were sent}} to New Jersey where work began on making the mount. This work {{consists}} of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated {{as it was in}} life. The real skull was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head 13 feet off the ground. Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken, and thus appeared distorted. The museum made a cast of the skull, and altered this cast to remove the distortions, thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may have looked like. The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> can be opened to allow researchers access for study. When the whole skeleton was assembled it was forty two feet (twelve meters) long from nose to tail and twelve feet (four meters) tall at the hips.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 2014, {{the three}} journalists {{were found guilty}} by an Egyptian court. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to 7 years in prison while Mohamed was sentenced to 10 years. The ruling was denounced by fellow journalists, {{including}} some at BBC, CNN, ABC Australia and most other major news outlets along with world leaders from Australia, Canada, The United States, United Nations, Switzerland and the United Kingdom primarily because they were found guilty based on no actual evidence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> has been deemed politically motivated and also because the ruling {{was seen as an}} attack on press freedom. The response was especially negative on the part of United States Secretary of State John Kerry who a day earlier was in Egypt and was made a promise of press freedom by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The ruling has resulted in many negative stories in print, online and on television by various news outlets around the world calling the Egyptian justice system a kangaroo court and calling the Egyptian government authoritarian.|$|E
