5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An <b>economic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Alcohol abuse {{results in}} {{problems}} on various levels in society. In terms of health, alcohol abuse {{is not only}} an important risk factor for chronic disease, but it is also related to injuries. Social harms which can be related to drinking include interpersonal problems, work problems, violent and other crimes. The scope of societal costs related to alcohol abuse in principle should be the same for both <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> and cost-of-illness studies. In general, <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> report a small part of all societal costs. To determine the cost- effectiveness of an intervention it is necessary that all costs and benefits are included. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and quantify the difference in societal costs incorporated in <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> and cost-of-illness studies on alcohol abuse. Method To investigate the economic costs attributable to alcohol in cost-of-illness studies we used the results of a recent systematic review (June 2009). We performed a PubMed search to identify <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> on alcohol interventions. Only <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> in which two or more interventions were compared from a societal perspective were included. The proportion of health care costs and the proportion of societal costs were estimated in both type of studies. Results The proportion of healthcare costs in cost-of-illness studies was 17 % and the proportion of societal costs 83 %. In <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> the proportion of healthcare costs was 57 %, and the proportion of societal costs was 43 %. Conclusions The costs included in <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> performed from a societal perspective do not correspond with those included in cost-of-illness studies. <b>Economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> on alcohol abuse underreport true societal cost of alcohol abuse. When considering implementation of alcohol abuse interventions, policy makers should take into account that <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> from the societal perspective might underestimate the total effects and costs of interventions. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} review of recent <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of antenatal screening was conducted. Relevant studies were identified {{from a number}} of sources including computerised databases, bibliographies of <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> and searches of unpublished manuscripts. Each study identified by the literature searches was categorised {{on the basis of its}} title and abstract. Studies considered relevant to the {{systematic review}} were obtained from libraries. The methodology, results, and policy implications of studies categorised as <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> upon full review were documented. A total of 566 studies were identified by the literature searches, 41 of which were categorised as <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> upon full review. The <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> covered a range of antenatal screening practices, aimed mainly at the prevention of infectious diseases and fetal anomalies. The review highlighted the poor methodological quality of the bulk of <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of antenatal screening. The study design, data collection methods, and analysis and interpretation of results frequently violated methodological guidelines adopted by health economists. The review also highlighted the narrow definition of benefits adopted by this body of literature, with most studies reporting outcomes in terms of cases detected, cases of particular disorders prevented or, most often, costs averted. The conclusions arrived at differed by area of antenatal screening. There appeared to be clear economic arguments in favour of some forms of antenatal screening, for example, triple test screening for Down's syndrome. Other <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> pertained to specific locations, which suggests that the results may not necessarily be generalisable to different settings. For all areas of antenatal screening, an updating of published <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> may be required to account for evolving economic, epidemiological, and clinical effectiveness evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{potential}} role of economic information in healthcare decision making, {{it is of}} interest to assess its influence on decisions at a national or regional level (macro level), at a healthcare facility level (meso level) and at the healthcare provider level (micro level). This literature review summarises 36 empirical studies that examined the influence of <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> on these three healthcare decision-making levels. <b>Economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> are considered useful and important; however, their direct influence on decision making (instrumental use) is moderate, especially at the macro and micro levels.

However, unexpectedly, our literature search did not reveal an empirical study analysing the considerable influence of <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> on decisions by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.

40|$|Summary Falls {{in older}} people result in {{substantial}} health burden. Compelling {{evidence indicates that}} falls can be prevented. We developed comprehensive guidelines for <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of fall prevention interventions to facilitate publication of high-quality <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the effective strategies and aid decision making. Introduction The importance of economics applied to falls and fall prevention in older people has largely been overlooked. The use of different methodologies to assess the costs and health benefits of the interventions and their comparators and the inconsistent reporting in the studies limits the usefulness of these <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> for decision making. We developed guidelines to encourage and facilitate completion of high-quality <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of effective fall prevention strategies. Methods We used a generic checklist for <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> as a platform to develop comprehensive guidelines for conducting and reporting <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of fall prevention strategies. We considered the many challenges involved, particularly in identifying, measuring, and valuing the relevant cost items. Results We recommend researchers include cost outcomes and report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of falls prevented and quality adjusted life years in all clinical trials of fall prevention interventions. Studies should include the following cost categories: (1) implementing the intervention, (2) delivering the comparator group intervention, (3) total health care costs, (4) costs of fallrelated health care resource use, and (5) personal and informal carer opportunity costs.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> on {{influenza}} vaccination from low resource settings are scarce {{and have not}} been evaluated using a systematic approach. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review on the value for money of {{influenza vaccination}} in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> published in any language between 1960 and 2011. Main outcome measures were costs per influenza outcome averted, costs per quality-adjusted life years gained or disability-adjusted life years averted, costs per benefit in monetary units or cost-benefit ratios. Results: Nine <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> on seasonal influenza vaccine met the inclusion criteria. These were model- or randomized-controlled-trial (RCT) -based <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> from middle-income countries. Influenza vaccination provided value for money for elderly, infants, adults and children with high-risk conditions. Vaccination was cost-effective and costsaving for {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} patients and in elderly above 65 y from model-based evaluations, but conclusions from RCTs on elderly varied. Conclusion: <b>Economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> from middle income regions differed in population studied, outcomes and definitions used. Most findings are in line with evidence from high-income countries highlighting that influenza vaccine is likely to provide value for money. However, serious methodological limitations do not allow drawing conclusions on cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in middle income countries. Evidence on cost-effectiveness from low-income countries is lacking altogether, and more information is needed from full <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> that are conducted in a standardized manner.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{growing number}} of <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> that use data {{collected}} in multinational clinical trials raises numerous questions regarding their execution and interpretation. Although recommendations for conducting <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> have been widely disseminated, relatively little guidance has been given for conducting <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> alongside clinical trials, particularly multinational trials. MethodsBuilding on a literature review that was conducted in preparation for an expert workshop, we evaluated a subset of methodological issues related to conducting <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> alongside multinational clinical trials. ResultsWe found wide variation {{in the types of}} costs included as part of the analyses and in the methods used to assign costs to hospitalization events. Furthermore, we found that the extrapolation of costs and survival outcomes beyond the trial period is an inconsistent practice and is often not dependent on whether a survival benefit was observed in the trial or on the epidemiology or practice patterns in the country to which the findings are directed. ConclusionsAlthough the limited sample size precluded a quantitative analysis of trial characteristics and their associations with the methodologies employed, our findings highlight the need for more guidance to analysts regarding the execution of <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> using data from multinational clinical trials. As the research community grapples with the complexities of methodological and logistical issues involved in multinational <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> the development of a standardized format to report the basic methodological characteristics of such studies would help to improve transparency and comparability for other analysts and decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} which {{factors and}} criteria {{are used in}} priority setting of pharmaceuticals, in what contexts health <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> are used, and barriers {{to the use of}} health <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> at micro, meso, and macro health-care levels. MethodsThe search for empirical articles was based on the MeSH index (Medical Substance Heading), including the search terms âeconomic evaluation,â âcost-effectiveness analysis,â âcost-utility analysis,â âcost-benefit analysis,â âpharmacoeconomic,â AND âdrug cost(s),â AND âeligibility determination,â AND âdecision-making,â AND ârationing,â AND formulary. The following databases were searched: PubMed, EconLit, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. More than 3100 studies were identified, 31 of which were included in this review. ResultsThe use of health <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> at all three health-care levels was investigated in three countries (United States [US], United Kingdom [UK], and Sweden). Postal and telephone survey methods dominated (n = 17) followed by interviews (n = 13), document analysis (n = 10), and observations of group deliberations (n = 9). The cost-effectiveness criterion was most important at the macro level. A number of contextual uses of health <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> were identified, including importantly the legitimizing of decisions, structuring the priority-setting process, and requesting additional budgets to finance expensive pharmaceuticals. ConclusionFactors that seem to support the increased use of health <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> are well-developed frameworks for evaluations, the presence of health economic skills, and an explicit priority-setting process. Differences in how <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> are used at macro, meso, and micro levels are attributed to differences in the preconditions at each level...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} {{is a common}} mental disorder. It is frequently associated with various mental co-morbidities and a fundamental loss of functioning. The borderline personality disorder causes high costs to society. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform a systematic literature review of existing <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of treatments for borderline personality disorder. Materials and Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and NHSEED for partial and full <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> regarding borderline personality disorder. Reported cost data were inflated to the year 2012 and converted into US- $ using purchasing power parities to allow for comparability. Quality assessment of the studies was performed by means of the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist, a checklist developed by a Delphi method in cooperation with 23 international experts. Results: We identified 6 partial and 9 full <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations.</b> The methodical quality was moderate (fulfilled quality criteria: 79. 2 % [SD: 15. 4 %] in partial <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> 77. 3 % [SD: 8. 5 %] in full <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations).</b> Most evaluations analysed psychotherapeutic interventions.

40|$|Links between health {{behaviours}} {{are potentially}} {{of great importance}} for cost-effectiveness estimates in <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of behaviour change strategies. This thesis investigates bias in <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> due to the omission of links between health behaviours. A framework to evaluate the health costs and consequences of behaviour change strategies while accounting for links to other health-related behaviours is proposed, and tested using {{a case study of}} the link between tobacco and alcohol use. There is strong evidence of correlation between alcohol use and tobacco use. Nevertheless, while many <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of interventions for alcohol and tobacco behaviour change have been conducted and used to inform resource allocation decisions, none have considered implications of links between the two behaviours. Assumptions about behaviour beyond typical trial endpoints in historical <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> have in general been based on limited follow-up data. Analysis of the joint dynamics of tobacco and alcohol use employing large-scale longitudinal survey data is used in this thesis as an alternative to inform assumptions about long-run smoking behaviour and its link to alcohol use, in a de novo individual-level simulation to appraise the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Smoking behaviour is found to be persistent and dynamically linked to alcohol use, but also influenced by numerous other factors, including unobserved time-invariant person-specific characteristics which determine the propensity to smoke. The ability of smoking cessation interventions to permanently reduce the propensity to smoke is important for their long-run cost-effectiveness. In the absence of data on this effect, historical <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> may have misinformed decision makers. There is a need for robust and tested assumptions about long-term behaviour and case by case consideration of the importance of inter-behavioural links in future <b>economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of behaviour change strategies, and for further investigation into the dynamics and interrelation of health-related behaviours...|$|R
