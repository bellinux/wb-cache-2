25|$|Atherton's heady rise {{continued}} when he {{made his}} debut for England in the fifth test against Australia at Trent Bridge, where he scored 0 and 47. Atherton's chance came when several England players had <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> their decision to go on a rebel tour to South Africa and so were banned from the Test team. However, despite these defections, he was selected as vice-captain of the 1989–90 A team tour to Zimbabwe rather than for the West Indies tour.|$|E
25|$|In county cricket, {{requiring}} {{four runs}} {{off the last}} ball of the Benson & Hedges Cup final in 1989, Hemmings struck a boundary off John Lever of Essex to ensure victory for Nottinghamshire. Soon after this win he was reinstated in the England side for the 5th Ashes Test match of the same year, {{thanks in part to}} the fact that several players had <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> their decision to go on a rebel tour to South Africa, including off-spinner John Emburey. Hemmings took no wickets but scored more than 30 in both innings. Hemmings toured Australia in 1990/91, where he played his last Test.|$|E
25|$|The model rocket kits were {{a modest}} success and MITS {{wanted to try}} a kit that would appeal to more hobbyists. The November 1970 issue of Popular Electronics {{featured}} the Opticom, a kit from MITS that would send voice over an LED light beam. Mims and Cagle were losing interest in the kit business so Roberts bought his partners out, then began developing a calculator kit. Electronic Arrays had <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> a set of six LSI integrated circuit chips {{that would make a}} four-function calculator. The MITS 816 calculator kit used the chip set and was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. This calculator kit sold for $175 ($275 assembled). Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual for this kit and many others over the next several years. He often accepted a copy of the kit as payment.|$|E

500|$|Boycott {{was left}} out of the first three Tests against the World XI in 1970; he played in the fourth and scored 15 and 64, and in the final Test of the summer scored 157. He won the Walter Lawrence Trophy for this century. He was {{selected}} for the 1970–71 tour of Australia, and averaged 95.93 over all first-class matches. He scored 173 in the opening first-class game, followed by 124 against Queensland. In the third Test match, having hit good partnerships in the first two, Boycott made 77 and 142 not out. During the second match, Boycott allegedly told Basil D'Oliveira, the latter having <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> that he had worked out the action of Australian spinner Johnny Gleeson, that he had [...] "sorted that out a fortnight ago." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> British withdrawal, {{addressed}} the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by Enoch Powell as [...] "one of the most horrible things that I remember in politics … (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old actor manager succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting." [...] He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be [...] "Greeks in the Roman Empire", and according to Philip Goodhart's recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote [...] "I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it was all I intended to do". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) {{that he planned to}} retire and go to the Lords. He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.|$|E

[...] It was also during these later years of his curacy that Lake [...] "began to doubt {{the teachings of the}} church and {{to think in terms of}} history and exegesis rather than theology and parish difficulties." [...] As his son reports, my father [...] "has often said that the turning point in his belief in the church came when his Vicar suggested that prayers be said at Vespers for a Mr. Brown, since the doctor had <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> that there was no hope for him. [...] The story may be apocryphal but I think it is indicative of his point of view." [...] His daughter Agnes, [...] "in conversations, was less polite and oblique: 'Heresy' was her word, pronounced with glee and gusto." [...] This type of thinking may have run in the family, for Lake told Alfred North Whitehead in 1922 that his father, the physician, [...] "being asked late in life what had done the most in his lifetime to relieve human suffering, answered, 'Anaesthesia and the decay of Christian theology.'" ...|$|E

The feeling of momentary indignation which had aroused Sir Gervaise to such an expression of his disgust at modern inventions, was appeased by this little success; and, inviting his captain to sup with him,--a substitute for a dinner,--he led the way below in high good-humour, Galleygo having <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> that the table was ready.|$|E

A woman hard to read, who seemed to delight in keeping locked up behind that fascinating rigidity of feature the intense sensibility which had been revealed to him, her master, only in occasional and rare moments of enthusiasm. She reminded him sometimes of the one holy and ineffable Madonna, at others of Berode, the great courtezan of her day, who had sent kings away from her doors, and had <b>just</b> <b>announced</b> her intention of ending her life in a convent.|$|E
