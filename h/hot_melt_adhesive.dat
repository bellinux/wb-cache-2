40|$|International audiencePrecision {{assembly}} of hybrid micro systems requires {{not only a}} high precision handling and adjusting of the parts but also a highly accurate and fast bonding technique. In this field adhesive technology {{is one of the}} major joining techniques. At the Collaboration Research Center 516, a batch process based on a joining technique using <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesives</b> was developed. This technique allows the coating of micro components with <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> in a batch. The coating process is followed by the joining process. Due to this, the time between coating and joining can be designed variably. Because of the short set times of <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesives</b> short joining times are possible. For this assembly process adapted heat management and adapted gripper systems are very important. Primarily, the conception and construction of suitable grippers, which realize the complex requirements of the heat management, meet a high challenge. This paper presents an active gripper system for the joining of micro parts using <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Furthermore, first examinations and results of an assembly process using this gripper for bonding with <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesives</b> are presented...|$|R

50|$|Another {{development}} of glue gun technology allows {{the user to}} 'spray' an area with a semi-pressure sensitive <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Using compressed air to force the adhesive at a controlled rate through a specially developed glue gun nozzle, a spiral pattern of adhesive is applied. The tackiness of the adhesive / open time is limited {{to just a few}} minutes, after which the adhesive will lose its tack, so coverage is limited.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> (HMA), {{also known}} as hot glue, {{is a form of}} {{thermoplastic}} adhesive that is commonly supplied in solid cylindrical sticks of various diameters, designed to be melted in an electric hot glue gun. The gun uses a continuous-duty heating element to melt the plastic glue, which the user pushes through the gun either with a mechanical trigger mechanism on the gun, or with direct finger pressure. The glue squeezed out of the heated nozzle is initially hot enough to burn and even blister skin. The glue is tacky when hot, and solidifies in a few seconds to one minute. Hot melt adhesives can also be applied by dipping or spraying.|$|E
50|$|Styrene block {{copolymers}} (SBC), {{also called}} styrene copolymer adhesives and rubber-based adhesives, have good low-temperature flexibility, high elongation, and high heat resistance. They are frequently used in <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> applications, where the composition retains tack even when solidified; however non-pressure-sensitive formulations are also used. High heat resistance, good low-temperature flexibility. Lower strength than polyesters. They usually have A-B-A structure, with an elastic rubber segment between two rigid plastic endblocks. High-strength film formers as standalone, increase cohesion and viscosity as an additive. Water-resistant, soluble in some organic solvents; cross-linking improves solvent resistance. Resins associating with endblocks (cumarone-indene, α-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) improve adhesion and alter viscosity. Resins associating to the midblocks (aliphatic olefins, rosin esters, polyterpenes, terpene phenolics) improve adhesion, processing and pressure-sensitive properties. Addition of plasticizers reduces cost, improves pressure-sensitive tack, decrease melt viscosity, decrease hardness, and improve low-temperature flexibility. The A-B-A structure promotes a phase {{separation of the}} polymer, binding together the endblocks, with the central elastic parts acting as cross-links; SBCs do not require additional cross-linking, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), used in high-strength PSA applications styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS), used in low self-adhering non-woven applications, styrene-ethylene/propylene (SEP), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), used in low-viscosity high-tack PSA applications, vinyl ethers.|$|E
50|$|In {{industrial}} use, <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesives</b> provide {{several advantages}} over solvent-based adhesives. Volatile organic compounds are reduced or eliminated, and the drying or curing step is eliminated. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesives</b> have long shelf life and usually can {{be disposed of}} without special precautions. Some of the disadvantages involve thermal load of the substrate, limiting use to substrates not sensitive to higher temperatures, and loss of bond strength at higher temperatures, up to complete <b>melting</b> of the <b>adhesive.</b> This can be reduced by using a reactive adhesive that after solidifying undergoes further curing e.g., by moisture (e.g., reactive urethanes and silicones), or is cured by ultraviolet radiation. Some HMAs may not be resistant to chemical attacks and weathering. HMAs do not lose thickness during solidifying; solvent-based adhesives may lose up to 50-70% of layer thickness during drying.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1920 and 1947, all professional-grade saxophones {{manufactured}} by C.G. Conn had rolled toneholes. In the early 1930s, Conn developed a unique type of saxophone pad called [...] "Conn Res-o-Pads", which were {{specifically designed for}} use on saxophones with rolled toneholes. Conn Res-O-Pads have an internal metal reinforcing ring which is hidden under the leather covering around the circumference of the pad. Their most notable feature is that {{the diameter of the}} pad extends over the rim of the key-cup, thereby giving a slightly wider surface area for the rolled tone-hole to seal onto. Rim impressions from Res-o-Pads are minimal and unlike standard pads they cannot be [...] "floated" [...] in. Though designed to fix into key-cups purely via friction, most saxophone repairers glue them in place using shellac or <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Res-o-Pads can be challenging to size correctly because (unlike standard saxophone pads which come in 0.5 mm size steps) they are only available in 1/32nds of an inch sizes which may not always correspond closely to key-cup diameters. Newly produced Conn Res-o-Pads are still available from specialist suppliers and are favored by some saxophone collectors because they give a fully authentic look and feel to vintage saxophones with rolled toneholes e.g. those made by Conn, Kohlert and Keilwerth. However, it is possible to fit standard pads to any saxophone with rolled toneholes (and many people do) without any noticeable disadvantage regarding the quality of sound produced.|$|E
40|$|Hot-melt {{adhesives}} {{have been}} commercially {{available for a}} long time and they are used in a wide range of applications. In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low off-taste, low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> with the same properties of polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Three formulations of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive. Further research needs to be conducted on EVA-HMA 3 for other properties to confirm its viability in replacing the commercial polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>adhesive</b> in packaging industry...|$|E
