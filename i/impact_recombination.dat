They are {{important}} causes of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide but their study is currently yet {{hampered by the}} lack of a cell culture system. NoVs genetically evolve by both point mutations and recombination and the murine norovirus (MuNoV) is considered as the best model for human NoVs. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an experimental model based on the MuNoV in order to investigate coinfection/superinfection parameters that could <b>impact</b> <b>recombination</b> events. Monolayers of RAW 264. 7 cells were coinfected or superinfected with two MuNoV strains (CW 1 and WU 20) using different multiplicity of infection (0. 1 / 1; 1 / 1 and 10 / 1 for CW 1 and Wu 20, respectively) and time delays (0 h; 0. 5 h; 1 h; 2 h; 4 h; 8 h; 12 h and 24 h) for infection. Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 hours post-infection. Genomic copies of both viruses were first quantified by RT-QPCR. Then, viruses from the supernatants were plaque purified (36 clones per condition) and their recombinant status was checked by a real-time PCR discriminating method using primers targeting both extremity of the MuNoV genome. Results of quantitative and plaque picking assays are compared. Together, the results confirm that recombination does not frequently occur, at least in vitro and raise the issue on why these events are however so usual with in silico detection methods. The data also showed that superinfection exclusion seems to be triggered from 4 h post infection with the first MuNoV. The mechanisms of the later should be still studied...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{most widely}} used {{state-of-the-art}} methods for reconstructing species phylogenies from genomic sequence data assume that sampled loci are identically and independently distributed. In principle, free recombination between loci {{and a lack of}} intra-locus recombination are necessary to satisfy this assumption. Few studies have quantified the practical <b>impact</b> of <b>recombination</b> on species tree inference methods, and even fewer have used genomic sequence data for this purpose. One prominent exception is the 2012 study of Lanier and Knowles. A main finding from the study was that species tree inference methods are relatively robust to intra-locus recombination, assuming free recombination between loci. The latter assumption means that the open question regarding the <b>impact</b> of <b>recombination</b> on species tree analysis is not fully resolved. Results The goal {{of this study is to}} further investigate this open question. Using simulations based upon the multi-species coalescent-with-recombination model as well as empirical datasets, we compared common pipeline-based techniques for inferring species phylogenies. The simulation conditions included a range of dataset sizes and several choices for recombination rate which was either uniform across loci or incorporated recombination hotspots. We found that pipelines which explicitly utilize inferred recombination breakpoints to delineate recombination-free intervals result in greater accuracy compared to widely used alternatives that preprocess sequences based upon linkage disequilibrium decay. Furthermore, the use of a relatively simple approach for recombination breakpoint inference does not degrade the accuracy of downstream species tree inference compared to more accurate alternatives. Conclusions Our findings clarify the <b>impact</b> of <b>recombination</b> upon current phylogenomic pipelines for species tree inference. Pipeline-based approaches which utilize inferred recombination breakpoints to densely sample loci across genomic sequences can tolerate intra-locus recombination and violations of the assumption of free recombination between loci...|$|R

The planktonic genus *Planktothrix* showed remarkable signals of both homologous and non-homologous recombination. However, {{it is not yet}} clear how frequent recombination is and whether this phenomenon impacts population structuring. In the frame of a population genetics study, we characterized 290 *Planktothrix* strains isolated from seven neighbouring lakes in the subalpine Italian region with multi locus sequence typing. Four of six house-keeping loci analysed were polymorphic, resulting in 20 distinct multi-locus genotypes. Association indices among alleles at different loci were suggestive of a so called ‘epidemic population structure’, thus intermediate between clonal and panmictic structures. Further analyses carried out by using the software ClonalFrame, which is able to infer genealogies from multy-locus datasets <b>impacted</b> by <b>recombination,</b> supported this view by detecting: i) three major clades affected by three distinct recombination events, ii) a recombination rate about equal to the mutation rate and iii) the fact that <b>recombination</b> had an <b>impact</b> in introducing molecular diversity more than double the mutation rate. Furthermore, among-lake diversity, determined by the analysis of molecular variance and verified over an annual cycle in three of seven lakes, appeared as influenced by both recombination processes and local clonal expansions.

However, the functional <b>impact</b> of the <b>recombination</b> on clonal success is not understood. Here, we identified a novel widespread hybrid clone (ST 71) of livestock-associated Staphylococcus aureus that evolved from an ancestor belonging to the major bovine lineage CC 97, through multiple large-scale recombination events with other S. aureus lineages occupying the same ruminant niche. The recombination events, affecting a 329  kb region of the chromosome spanning the origin of replication, resulted in allele replacement and loss or gain of an array of genes influencing host–pathogen interactions. Of note, molecular functional analyses revealed that the ST 71 hybrid clone has acquired multiple novel pathogenic traits associated with acquired and innate immune evasion and bovine extracellular matrix adherence.

Our model shows that recombination (i) increases the genetic diversity of the viral population, (ii) accelerates the emergence of escape mutations with and without compensatory mutations, and (iii) accelerates the acquisition of immune escape mutations in the early stage of viral infection. We see a particularly strong <b>impact</b> of <b>recombination</b> in systems with broad, non-immunodominant CTL responses.

40|$|The {{population}} {{structures of}} bacterial species {{are complex and}} often controversial. To a large extent, {{this is due to}} uncertainty about the frequency and <b>impact</b> of <b>recombination</b> in bacteria. The existence of clones within bacterial populations, and of linkage disequilibrium between alleles at different loci, is often cited as evidence for low rates of recombination. However, clones and linkage disequilibrium are almost inevitable in species that divide by binary fission and can be present in populations where recombination is frequent. In recent years, it has become possible to directly compare rates of recombination in different species. These studies indicate that in many bacterial species, including Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, evolutionary change at neutral (housekeeping) loci is more likely to occur by recombination than mutation and can result in the elimination of any deep-rooted phylogenetic signal. In such species, the long-term evolution of the population is dominated by recombination, but this does not occur at a sufficiently high frequency to prevent the emergence of adaptive clones, although these are relatively short-lived and rapidly diversify...|$|R

We have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. For Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. The lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for Strep. pyogenes). In contrast, gene trees constructed for Hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli showed {{a higher degree of}} congruence, suggesting lower rates of <b>recombination.</b> The <b>impact</b> of <b>recombination</b> therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees...|$|R
40|$|While {{a variety}} of methods exist to {{reconstruct}} ancestral sequences, all of them assume that a single phylogeny underlies all the positions in the alignment and therefore that recombination has not taken place.

If recombination is ignored, the ancestral sequences recovered can be quite distinct from the grand most recent common ancestor (GMRCA) of the sample and better resemble the concatenate of partial most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) at each recombination fragment. When independent phylogenetic trees are assumed for the different recombinant segments, the estimation of the fragment MRCAs improves significantly. Importantly, we show that recombination can change the biological predictions derived from ASRs carried out with real data.

The effect of hydrogen dissociation/recombination on LPNTP Isp is examined.

At high chamber temperatures and low chamber pressures, the increase in Isp is due to both lower average molecular weights caused by dissociation and added kinetic energy from monatomic hydrogen recombination. Monatomic hydrogen recombination increases the Isp more then hydrogen dissociation. Variations in the mole fraction of monatomic hydrogen are similar to variations in static pressure along the axial nozzle position. Most recombination occurs close to the nozzle throat.

Using input samples from ChIP-Seq studies, we detected a similar bias throughout the heterochromatic portions of the yeast genome. We also observed significant chromatin-related effects at telomeres, protein binding sites, and genes, reflected in the variation of input-Seq coverage. Experimental tests of candidate regions showed that chromatin influenced shearing at some loci, and that chromatin could also lead to enriched or depleted DNA levels in prepared samples, independently of shearing effects. Our results suggested that assays relying on immunoprecipitation of chromatin will be biased by intrinsic differences between regions packaged into different chromatin structures - biases which have been largely ignored to date.
