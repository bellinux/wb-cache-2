50|$|Chevron Corporation {{developed}} a process invented by Joel W. Rosenthal called the Chevron Coal Liquefaction Process (CCLP). It is unique due the close-coupling of the non-catalytic dissolver and the catalytic <b>hydroprocessing</b> <b>unit.</b> The oil produced had properties that were unique {{when compared to}} other coal oils; it was lighter and had far fewer heteroatom impurities. The process was scaled-up to the 6 ton per day level, but not proven commercially.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{maximize}} the yield of biodiesel from hydroprocessing waste cooking oil by re-evaluating the product cut-points [...] Waste cooking oil {{is one of the}} most difficult feed stocks for conventional biodiesel production due to its high content in free fatty acids, and other degradation products. Hydroprocessing of these low quality oils is a promising process for the upgrade of these oils. Waste cooking oil was hydroprocessed in a small scale <b>hydroprocessing</b> <b>unit</b> of CPERI/CERTH, using a commercial hydroprocessing catalyst. The total liquid product, after being separated from the gas product, was analyzed as per basic properties (density, viscosity) and simulated distillation curve according ASTM D 7213 procedure. The data from this simulated distillation were used as guidance in order to perform a fractionating distillation of the liquid product according to ASTM D 2892 procedure, in order {{to maximize}} the biodiesel yield. The cuts from this fractionating distillation were used in order to produce a fuel with properties that could be used as automotive diesel fuel. Depending on the final boiling point, the yield of this synthetic biodiesel ranged from 69. 5 % to 77. 9 % m/m. The cetane index of these fuels was very high (higher than 70). These results are very promising since this type of synthetic biodiesel seems to have excellent properties as a possible extender of diesel fuel that is derived from a waste byproduct such as waste cooking oil...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the application of}} Fischer Tropsch biowaxes as a feedstock in a pilot-scale <b>hydroprocessing</b> <b>unit</b> at operating conditions very similar to industrial size hydrotreating plants of traditional refineries. The project focus on a future coprocessing of biowax/gasoil blends due to produce bio-products derived from lignocellulosic biomass: crack gases, naphtha, kerosene, diesel and a residual product. Hydro-processing plants operating at mild cracking conditions support the production of high amounts in middle distillates at reduced coke formation. Premium bio-diesel and bio-kerosene with excellent cold flow properties are the main objective of the investigations. Various test runs with different hydrotreating catalysts have been conducted due to {{determine the influence of}} waxy feedstock on catalyst behavior and product distribution. Depending on the catalyst selected, the fixed bed reactor streamed by hydrogen operates under specified cracking condition defined by the following parameters: reactor temperature, hydrogen pressure and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). Test runs with selected catalysts - isodewaxing (IDW), hydro-desulphurization (HDS) and the catalytic deparaffination (CDP) catalyst - have been executed at constant process conditions in order to compare the product spectrum and properties of product groups. Highest amounts of bio-diesel and bio-kerosene with excellent cold flow properties can be obtained with the IDW catalyst. This NiW- based catalyst with special additives generates cleaved and reshaped molecular fragments via skeletal isomerisation increasing the isoparaffin content of naphtha and middle distillates. Further investigations with this catalyst type have been executed due to determine the catalyst aging effect in a separate long term test run. The loss of cracking severity during operation of the catalyst can be observed by a steady decline in conversion. Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and diolefines in the bio-feedstock support the formation of a coke layer on the catalyst surface resulting in reinforced deactivation. As the consequence naphtha and finally the crack gases and the kerosene fraction are shifted to higher molecular fragments increasing the diesel and residue yield. Physicochemical properties of the product groups obtained during the test run vary and especially the cold flow properties from the diesel and kerosene fraction degrade significant. Balancing the conversion decline of the catalyst in operation can be realized by increasing the reactor temperature and the hydrogen pressure, but the effect is time limited. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} on the deactivation of hydroprocessing catalysts and their reactivation by the removal of coke and metal foulants. The literature on hydrotreating catalyst deactivation by coke and metals deposition, the environmental problems associated with spent catalyst disposal, and its reactivation/rejuvenation process were reviewed. Experimental studies on catalyst deactivation involved problem analysis in industrial hydroprocessing operations, through characterization of the spent catalyst, and laboratory coking studies. A comparison was made between the characteristics of spent catalysts from fixed bed and ebullating bed residue <b>hydroprocessing</b> reactor <b>units</b> and the catalyst deactivation pattern in both types of reactor systems was examined. In the laboratory the nature of initial coke deposited on the catalyst surface and its role on catalyst deactivation were studied. The influence of initial coke on catalyst surface area and porosity was significant. Both catalyst acidity and feedstock quality had a remarkable influence on the amount {{and the nature of}} the initial coke. The hydroenitrogenation function (HDN) of the catalyst was found to be deactivated more rapidly by the initial coke than the hydrodesulphurization function (HDS). In decoking experiments, special attention was paid to the initial conditions of coke combustion, since the early stages of contact between the coke on the spent catalyst surface and the oxygen are crucial in the decoking process. An increase in initial combustion temperature above 440 oC and the oxygen content of the regeneration gas above 5 % vanadium led to considerable sintering of the catalyst. At temperatures above 700 oC there was a substantial loss of molybdenum from the catalyst, and phase transformations in the alumina support. The preferred leaching route (coked vs decoked form of spent catalyst) and a comparison of different reagents (i. e., oxalic acid and tartaric acid) and promoters (i. e., Hydrogen Peroxide and Ferric Nitrate) for better selectivity in removing the major foulant (vanadium), characterization and performance evaluation of the treated catalysts and modelling of the leaching process were addressed in spent catalyst rejuvenation studies. The surface area and pore volume increased substantially with increasing vanadium extraction from the spent catalyst; the HDS activity showed a parallel increase. The selectivity for leaching of vanadium deposits was better, and activity recovery was higher, for catalyst rejuvenated by metal leaching prior to decoking...|$|R
