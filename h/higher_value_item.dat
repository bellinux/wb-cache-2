5000|$|To better {{understand}} and breakdown {{the concept of}} social inequity aversion would be to use the study done by Sarah Brosnan (as well as with Frans B. M. de Waal), who specializes in social behavior and social cognition. [...] In their experiment, [...] "Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay" [...] five female capuchin monkeys were used and given an unequal distribution of rewards by the human experimenter. The female monkeys alternated in pairs under four different conditions with the experimenter. Of the female monkeys, two received the same reward, one female received a superior reward, one female received a superior reward without exchange (for example without work), and a single female observed a superior reward {{in the absence of}} a partner. [...] The females were much less likely to complete a trade with the human experimenter when their corresponding partner received a food item of <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>item</b> (a grape; the lower item was a cucumber), and when that partner received the higher food item with no exchange of work of any kind, the likelihood of not completing a trade intensified. [...] All of these refusals of exchange included both passive and active rejections ranging from refusing to take the awards to throwing the reward, respectively. These negative responses of situation made with the monkeys support the early evolutionary origin of inequity aversion and thus helps (in combination with the definitions of inequity and aversion) give an overall idea of what social inequity aversion is: the tendency to reject or avoid situations in which there is social inequality, unfairness, or injustice.|$|E

40|$|Selecting what is {{important}} to remember, attending to this information, and then later recalling it can be thought of in terms of the strategic control of attention and encoding, and can lead to the efficient use of memory. The present study used a selectivity task, where items were paired with varying point values, to examine how the ability to selectively and strategically remember information of differing value is influenced by aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Younger adults and healthy older adults were able to strategically and efficiently encode and remember <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>items,</b> but AD led to a specific impairment in selectivity. Although individuals with AD recalled <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>items,</b> they also recalled lower <b>value</b> <b>items,</b> and did not efficiently maximize memory performance (as measured by a selectivity index), relative to healthy older adults. Complex working memory span measures were especially predictive of the recall of the <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>items.</b> This pattern suggests that AD leads to deficits in attentional control, which can lead to impairments in value-directed remembering.

40|$|Past {{research}} using {{two levels of}} reward {{has shown that the}} higher-value items are remembered better than lower-value items and this enhancement is assumed to be driven by an effect of reward value. In the present study, multiple levels of reward were used to test the influence of reward salience on memory. Using a value-learning procedure, words were associated with reward values, and then memory for these words was later tested with free recall. Critically, multiple reward levels were used, allowing us to test two specific hypoth-eses whereby rewards can influence memory: (a) <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>items</b> are remembered better than lower <b>value</b> <b>items</b> (reward <b>value</b> hypothesis), and (b) <b>highest</b> and lowest <b>value</b> <b>items</b> are remembered best and intermediate-value items are remembered worst (following a U-shaped relationship between value and memory; reward salience hypothesis). In two experiments we observed a U-shaped relationship between reward value and memory, supporting the notion that memory is enhanced due to reward salience, and not purely through reward value. © 2011 Elsevier B.
