40|$|This paper {{examines}} some of {{the open}} economy aspects of optimal monetary policies with a particular emphasis on those aspects that may induce a fear of floating {{on the part of}} central banks. Characteristics such as openness, exchange rate pass-through and adverse balance sheet effects have been highlighted in the recent literature as being possible reasons for fear of floating. Motivated by recent experiences in East Asia, this paper examines a range of policy configurations in a small open economy macro-model that contains the above characteristics and finds the most suited policy for each one. The policy configurations differ in the degree of exchange rate involvement in the formulation of the policy. The ultimate objective is to ascertain whether the exchange rate can be used in some capacity as a feasible objective of monetary policy. The paper finds that, for most model configurations, fear of <b>floating</b> <b>policies</b> perform well [...] in some cases they are the most suited policy.

In this context, liability dollarization plays a vital role and its implications have been addressed in the literature via a “financial accelerator” mechanism. After allowing for different degrees of liability dollarization in a general equilibrium framework, this analysis uncovers some important implications about the role of the asset price channel and central bank’s commitment with the exchange rate, when assessing financial vulnerability. If we asses vulnerability in terms of the evolution of investment, we claim that, in absence of an asset price channel, departures from a pure float will not only help mitigate vulnerability but will also be welfare improving. On the other hand, and with an active asset price channel, a tighter exchange rate policy will only have marginal effects on welfare and vulnerability when compared to that associated to a reduction in liability dollarization.

Not surprisingly, the law concerning open covers is very much alive and open to further development. Given that, quite remarkably, no research study has been done specifically on those particular covers to date; this thesis is aimed at making good that deficiency. To ensure that observation is made over the whole picture in respect of the open covers and to produce a comprehensive guide to the legal complexity arising out of the association between them and their subsequent individual declarations, the complete thesis will comprise five chapters: 60 l Chapter 1 will provide historical information and development background of open covers and also will set out the main differences in the operation of <b>floating</b> <b>policies</b> and open covers which were derived originally from the former. Chapter 2 will illustrate (1) how and why the legal nature of an open cover impacts on the parties' rights, obligations, privileges and immunities, and (2) how and why the formation of an open cover {{plays a key role in}} the determination of proper nature. Chapter 3 will shed light on the applicability of the duty of utmost good faith to open covers by explaining the doctrine of utmost good faith within the general law of insurance and then clarifying whether the duty is enforceable pertaining to the covers themselves or only pertaining to subsequent policies individually. Chapter 4 will explore the agency status of insurance brokers in the context of open covers. To this end, it focuses, first, upon giving the general definition of insurance broking, secondly, describing the use and performance of the brokers in the procurement process, currency and claims process of open covers, and lastly the measure of damages recoverable from the brokers. Chapter 5 will discuss conflict of laws in open covers, and in particular problems of jurisdiction and choice of law where the open cover and declarations under it are potentially governed by different regimes.

At the time of the initial survey, 21 percent (N = 14) of businesses had smoking restrictions. Among the 54 worksites with no smoking restrictions, 14 (26 percent) adopted smoking policies within a year. The strongest predictor of policy adoption was an interaction between the presence of floating smoking restrictions (not tied to a specific area) and the manager's willingness to impose smoking restrictions on employees. Adoption of policies was also more likely to occur among worksites with younger employees. That adoption of smoking policies was more likely to occur among worksites with <b>floating</b> smoking <b>policies</b> underscores the idea that focusing efforts at the managerial level within an organization can accelerate the diffusion process.

The framework has nominal inertia, real rigidities and market frictions, and {{it is designed to}} evaluate exchange rate risk in the economy and across sectors.

We conclude that fear of <b>floating,</b> the <b>policy</b> that intends to stabilize foreign debt, is precisely the policy that leads to a higher increase in the government debt to GDP ratio. The reason is that, in order to control the exchange rate, the authorities have to increase interest rates. While a lower depreciation does contain the level of debt, it increases the cost of interest on the debt, and this increases the change in the debt to GDP ratio. The pass-through does not seem an important argument for fear of floating either.

Specifically, I consider a small open economy in which intermediate goods importers borrow in foreign currency and face a credit constraint. In this economy, exchange rate depreciation not only worsens importers' net-worth but also increases the financing amount in domestic currency, therefore exaggerating their borrowing finance premium. Besides, because of high exchange rate pass-through into import prices, fluctuations in the exchange rate also have strong impacts on domestic prices and production. These effects, together, magnify the macroeconomic consequences of the <b>floating</b> exchange rate <b>policy</b> in response to external shocks.

The recent Turkish experience towards endogenous dedollarization appears to be consistent with the view that dedollarization can also be viewed as a side effect of prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Although the dollarization composite index is on a decreasing trend, it is however still high. Therefore, an active dedollarization strategy associated with a sound macroeconomic policy stance should be considered to support the implementation of a Full Fledged Inflation Targeting Regime in the near future...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three essays on currency markets, equilibrium and expectations. The first essay examines currency markets {{in the setting of}} a temporary equilibrium model with two currencies and two central banks, where consumers have one-point expectations. Assuming that both central banks use <b>floating</b> exchange rate <b>policies</b> it is shown that if consumers have common expectations the current exchange rate will equal the expected future exchange rate. Under the assumptions made, there exist an equilibrium for the economy in the case where both central banks apply <b>floating</b> exchange rate <b>policies</b> {{as well as in the}} case where the banks co-operate and use fixed exchange rate policies. The possibilities for a single central bank to sustain a fixed exchange rate are discussed. Under some expectations, the economy may have more than one equilibrium exchange rate and these are related to different equilibrium allocations. In the second essay, a temporary equilibrium model with two currencies and where consumers have expectations on goods and currency prices with finite support is studied. Consequences for the individual consumer problem and equilibrium allocations are analyzed. State prices are defined for the case where asset markets are complete and these are used to derive conditions for consumers to meet increased risk with a variation in the portfolio of currencies, thus precluding precautionary saving. Equilibrium currency prices and adjustments in currency and good prices to a variation in the initial currency portfolio are examined. Perceived Pareto dominance is defined. It is argued that to get an allocation perceived to Pareto dominate the given equilibrium allocation consumers need more expensive portfolios. The third essay considers the determination of currency prices in an overlapping generations economy, with or without uncertainty. The economy with currencies is compared to an economy with money. For the case where there is no uncertainty and consumers have perfect foresight it is shown that currency prices may be chosen arbitrarily at one date but that the currency prices at other dates are then uniquely determined and constant over time. The analysis is extended to an economy with uncertainty where consumers are assumed to have rational expectations. It is shown that a given equilibrium allocation is consistent with constant as well as highly volatile currency prices. In general the currency prices and the exchange rate are only required to satisfy a martingale property. But if currency prices are assumed to depend only on a finite past history then they are forced to be constant over states and time. An equilibrium allocation may be realized also with incorrect expectations, about the currency prices, as long as expectations are consistent with the equilibrium portfolio values...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions {{has been}} {{the main source of}} {{information}} about the exchange-rate policies pursued by member countries. The classification contained therein has been used to document the evolution of exchange rate regimes over time as well as to study the relationship between economic performance and the choice of exchange rate system. Recently a number of authors have challenged the results of these studies on the grounds that countries may not always be following the exchange rate policy that they have announced. For example, many countries appear to have a 'fear of floating' {{in the sense that the}} evolution of their exchange rate corresponds to what one would expect to see in a fixed exchange rate country even though they are officially following a <b>floating</b> rate <b>policy.</b> New classifications have been created claiming to represent countries' actual exchange rate policy as opposed to their declared policy. Using the new classification many results relating to the evolution of exchange rate regimes and the economic consequences of exchange-rate regime choices have been overturned. It is sometimes claimed that the new so-called de facto classifications are superior to the older de jure classifications. In this paper we argue that neither the officially declared exchange rate regime nor the de facto regime tells the full story about exchange rate policy. Both contain useful information and need to be taken into account. In addition we argue that countries which claim to be floating but in fact have relatively stable exchange rates are not necessarily breaking any commitment as sometimes has been suggested. Exchange rate stability may be the result of optimally chosen monetary policies. Furthermore, countries that use monetary policy instruments actively to stabilize their exchange rate may rationally not want to announce and commit to a fixed exchange rate because of a fear of being subject to speculative attacks. We present some empirical evidence consistent with this interpretation. International Economics; Exchange Rates; Trade; Whatever Related...|$|R

The policy shift disconnected domestic interest rates from US dollar-denominated interest rates, replacing them with a growing positive relationship with the dual-currency basket (USD-EUR) adopted by the Central Bank of Russia, {{as well as a}} synthetic interest rate composed of the US dollar LIBOR and the euro LIBOR. The paper also considers the insulating properties of Russian basket targeting policies during the recent global liquidity crisis. I present evidence that the Russian MosIBOR rate was negatively related to the US dollar LIBOR rate and positively related to the synthetic USD-EUR rate during the "decoupling" stage of the crisis. Even with the steep quantitative easing of the US Fed during this period, the finding suggests the Russian money market was more in sync with the monetary policies of the euro area.

Emphasizing the role of monetary policy on the oil price effect we split our time period into two, before and after inflation targeting was officially introduced in Norway in 2001. Both ordinary least squares and Markov-switching estimations are performed on a dynamic log-linear model. The latter estimation method proves to be particularly well-performing with near perfect state predictions. As there is evidence of the oil price having asymmetrical effects, the same estimation procedures are performed allowing increasing and decreasing oil prices to have separate effects. We find that the oil price effect did, in fact, increase following the adoption of inflation targeting and that falling oil prices had more to say in this time period than increasing oil prices. In the managed float time period before 2001, the asymmetrical estimations indicate that only increasing oil prices was statistically significant. However, we find less evidence of asymmetrical effects in the this time period, suggesting more symmetrical and smaller oil price effects than under the more flexible inflation targeting monetary policy regime. Long-run solutions is found for all models, but do mostly not contain any statistically significant effects of the oil price or interest rates, implying that the equilibrium exchange rate is decided by the price difference between Norway and the EU. This is especially true in the post- 2001 time period, suggesting stronger evidence of the equilibrium exchange rate being determined by purchasing power parity under inflation targeting than under the managed <b>float</b> monetary <b>policy.</b> In the pre- 2001 time period, there are some statistically long-run oil price effects, but this could be due to the time-period being relatively short, suggesting that the oil price effects on the exchange rate are, in fact, short term. Although our speed of adjustment coefficient is somewhat low for a rapidly moving variable such as the exchange rate, our estimated half-life of such deviations are lower than those of the general consensus in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Until the 1996 Federal election, the Liberal Party {{remained}} {{committed to}} the repeal of Medicare. In that election the Liberal platform endorsed the continuation of Medicare, and support for private health insurance. Since then the Government has pursued a strategy of support for private health insurance involving three stages: one, rebates {{for the poor and}} penalties for the well-off; two, universal rebates; and three, departure from community rating to what has been described as ?lifetime health cover?. This paper reviews the coverage by the quality media of the private health insurance issue from the beginning of 1996 (prior {{to the beginning of the}} formal election campaign) to the end of 1999 (after the announcement of lifetime health cover). Over 500 articles were reviewed. Federal elections and budgets are most likely to trigger articles on private health insurance. The topic has become newsworthy, with stories now appearing which report only changes in insurance coverage. Most articles report differing perspectives on the issue; however, opposing views are frequently given little column space and appear at the end of the article. While many articles report events in a factual way, there are a significant number which provide only one perspective or viewpoint. The media rely heavily on authoritative experts and these are usually spokespersons for the private sector and the organised medical profession. When independent figures are quoted, there has been no disclosure of any financial or other links with the private health sector. The story angle was generally conflict between the various stakeholders, although the politics of health policy was also a major theme. The editorials, in contrast, urged a view of what was good for the country, rather than the winners/losers in a political conflict. The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) took quite different stances on the issue of access, hospital costs and the importance of community rating. Clearly, the media has a role to inform. Many articles are a means of disseminating new policies, or explaining their detail, or advising individuals of the implications for them. However, the media has also defined what and why private health insurance is a problem, <b>floated</b> unpopular <b>policy</b> responses, defined the solution and popularised it. For those concerned to see public debate on private health insurance, to promote information and evidence as a basis for policy, and to see community values inform health policy, there is little here to encourage.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} whether {{adopting the}} U. S. dollar {{as the sole}} legal tender could help Liberia, a postconflict economy, to boost growth and strengthen fiscal discipline. In view {{of the performance of}} exchange rate regimes in many countries and Liberia''s own experience with dollarization, we conclude that Liberia should not adopt full dollarization for the following reasons: (i) the alleged benefits voiced by the proponents of dollarization, in terms of enhanced fiscal discipline and faster economic growth, are not supported by the empirical evidence; (ii) dollarization would increase the Liberian economy''s vulnerability to external shocks and Liberia''s social fragility; (iii) banks in fully dollarized economies face additional capitalization requirements that Liberian banks cannot meet at present; and (iv) dollarization would be costly in terms of real resources because of the loss of seigniorage.
