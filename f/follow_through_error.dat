This report discusses the implementation and outcomes of the program. In the first part of the paper, a history of the program iJ provided and the diversity of educational approaches in <b>Follow</b> <b>Through's</b> model programs, the gains in basic skills demonstrated by <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> students, and the dissemination of <b>Follow</b> <b>Through's</b> model programs are discussed. The second part considers three components of the <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> program. These are: (1) a holistic approach to instruction; (2) the development and use of research-based instructional programs and practic-s; and (3) effective educational delivery systems that stress sponsorship of local projects, staff development, and implementation of parent involvement activities. The third part, a conclusion, finds that the <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> program is clearly an important source of knowledge waiting to be tapped, and that its most important message may be that there is a critical need to forge a two-directional exchange, indicating the need for a link between research and schooling practice. <b>Follow</b> <b>through</b> has also identified ways of dealing with the evaluation of school improvement efforts, and corroborated findings in the literature on effective teaching and school effectiveness. A reference list of 62 items is included. An appendix lists overall goals and major design features of some widely implemented <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> model programs.

40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{research report}} {{looks at the}} changes in reading performance for the students in one rural school district from 1965 through 1980. During those years, the district moved from 28. 5 per cent of its second grade students at or above grade level to 88. 2 per cent at or above grade level. Similar gains are demonstrated in first and third grade. These gains are discussed in terms of: (I) phonics first, then basal reading instruction; (2) sponsorship; and monitoring and evaluation that resulted from the district's participation as a <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> site in the federally supported <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> Program. In 1968 <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> was born. The federal govern-ment selected 138 communities to become <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> sites, and 19 educational centers at universities. or corporations to become <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> sponsors. Each sponsor had a specific educational approach, vary-ing from the open classroom advocated by the Bank Street College of Education to the highly structured direct instruction approach of the University of Oregon. <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> {{was designed to be}} a multi-model approach: Sponsors operating within public school districts were to be free to develop programs.
