Recombinant and truncated NPs of Hantaan, Seoul, and <b>Dobrava</b> <b>viruses</b> lacking the N-terminal 49 amino acids were also detected as multimers. Although truncated NPs of Hantaan virus lacking the N-terminal 154 amino acids existed as a monomer, those of Seoul and Dobrava formed multimers. The multimerized truncated NP antigens of Seoul and <b>Dobrava</b> <b>viruses</b> could detect serotype-specific antibodies, whereas the monomeric truncated NP antigen of Hantaan virus lacking the N-terminal 154 amino acids could not, suggesting that a hantavirus serotype-specific epitope on the NP results in multimerization. The NP-NP interaction was also detected by using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Two regions, amino acids 100 to 125 (region 1) and amino acids 404 to 429 (region 2), were essential for the NP-NP interaction in yeast. The NP of Seoul virus in which the tryptophan at amino acid number 119 was replaced by alanine (W 119 A mutation) did not multimerize in the yeast two-hybrid assay, indicating that tryptophan 119 in region 1 {{is important for the}} NP-NP interaction in yeast. However, W 119 A mutants expressed in mammalian cells were detected as the multimer by using competitive ELISA. Similarly, the truncated NP of Seoul virus expressing amino acids 155 to 429 showed a homologous interaction in a competitive ELISA but not in the yeast two-hybrid assay, indicating that the C-terminal region is important for the multimerization detected by competitive ELISA.

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} the cloning and characterisation of a mutated thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus (Taq) which exhibits an increased reverse transcriptase activity {{and is therefore}} designated for one step PCR pathogen detection using established real-time detection methods. We demonstrate that this Taq polymerase mutant (Taq M 1) has similar PCR sensitivity and nuclease activity as the respective Taq wild-type DNA polymerase. In addition and {{in marked contrast to}} the wild-type, Taq M 1 exhibits a significantly increased reverse transcriptase activity especially at high temperatures (> 60 °C). RNA generally hosts highly stable secondary structure motifs such as hairpins and G-quadruplexes which complicate or in the worst case obviate reverse transcription (RT). Thus, RT at high temperatures is desired to weaken or melt secondary structure motifs. To demonstrate the ability of Taq M 1 for RNA detection of pathogens we performed TaqMan probe-based diagnostics of <b>Dobrava</b> <b>viruses</b> by one step RT-PCR.

40|$|AbstractOld world hantaviruses, causing {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS), still present {{a public health}} problem in Asia and Eastern Europe. The majority of cases has been recorded in China. The aim of our study was to generate human recombinant neutralizing antibodies to a hantavirus by phage display technology. To preserve the structural identity of viral protein, the panning procedure was performed on native Hantaan (HTN) (76 - 118) virus propagated in Vero-E 6 cells. In total, five complete human recombinant IgG antibodies were produced in a baculovirus expression system. All of them were able to completely neutralize HTN, and Seoul (SEO) virus in a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Three of these antibodies could also completely neutralize <b>Dobrava</b> (DOB) <b>virus</b> but not Puumala (PUU) virus. All antibodies bind to Hantaan virus G 2 protein localized in the virus envelope. The sequence areas within the HTN (76 - 118) -G 2 protein detected by five selected antibodies were mapped using peptide scans. Two partial epitopes, 916 -KVMATIDSF- 924 and 954 -LVTKDIDFD- 963, were recognized, which presumably are of paramount importance for docking of the virus to host cell receptors. A consensus motif 916 -KVXATIXSF- 924 could be identified by mutational analysis.

Three groups of nine participants each were vaccinated on days 0, 28 and 56 with the DNA vaccines for HTNV, PUUV, or a mixture of both vaccines using the Ichor Medical Systems TriGrid™ Intramuscular Delivery System. All vaccinations consisted of a total dose of 2. 0 mg DNA in an injected volume of 1 mL saline. For the combined vaccine, the mixture contained equal amounts (1. 0 mg) of each DNA vaccine. There were no study-related serious adverse events. Neutralizing antibody responses were measured by a plaque reduction neutralization test. Neutralizing antibody responses were detected in five of nine and seven of nine individuals who completed all three vaccinations with the HTNV or PUUV DNA vaccines, respectively. In the combined vaccine group, seven of the nine volunteers receiving all three vaccinations developed neutralizing antibodies to PUUV. The three strongest responders to the PUUV vaccine also had strong neutralizing antibody responses to HTNV. These results demonstrate that the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines delivered by electroporation separately or as a mixture are safe. In addition, both vaccines were immunogenic, although when mixed together, more participants responded to the PUUV than to the HTNV DNA vaccine...|$|R

The nucleocapsid protein (N) is relatively conserved among hantaviruses and highly immunogenic in both laboratory animals and humans, {{and it has been}} shown to induce efficient protective immunity in animal models. To investigate the ability of recombinant N (rN) from different hantaviruses to elicit cross-protection, we immunized bank voles with rN from Puumala (PUUV), Topografov (TOPV), Andes (ANDV), and <b>Dobrava</b> (DOBV) <b>viruses</b> and subsequently challenged them with PUUV. All animals immunized with PUUV and TOPV rN were completely protected. In the group immunized with DOBV rN, 7 of 10 animals were protected, while only 3 of 8 animals were protected in the group immunized with ANDV rN, which is more closely related to PUUV rN than DOBV rN. Humoral and cellular immune responses after rN immunization were also investigated. The highest cross-reactive humoral responses against PUUV antigen were detected in sera from ANDV rN-immunized animals, followed by those from TOPV rN-immunized animals, and only very low antibody cross-reactivity was observed in sera from DOBV rN-immunized animals. In proliferation assays, T lymphocytes from animals immunized with all heterologous rNs were as efficiently recalled in vitro by PUUV rN as were T lymphocytes from animals immunized with homologous protein. In summary, this study has shown that hantavirus N can elicit cross-protective immune responses against PUUV, and the results suggest a more important role for the cellular arm of the immune response than for the humoral arm in cross-protection elicited by rN...|$|R

The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large.

40|$|Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) is a {{group of}} closely related {{zoonotic}} rodent-borne viruses that are transmitted to humans through inhalation of infected rodent excreta. They cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) with varying degree of severity depending on the causative virus. Hantavirus infections are found worldwide, but the majority of cases occur in Asia and northern Europe. As hantaviruses cause diseases with high morbidity and mortality, and as to date there is no specific treatment, efforts are concentrated on the development of vaccines. The aim of this thesis was to study immune responses to Puumala virus (PUUV), which causes a milder form of HFRS, known as nephropathia epidemica (NE), and to evaluate the use of PUUV nucleocapsid (N) protein as a potential vaccine candidate. Selection of a human combinatorial antibody phage-display library, generated from splenocytes of a PUUV immune individual, against native PUUV antigens immobilized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was shown to be a suitable method to obtain glycoprotein 2 (G 2) -specific PUUV neutralizing recombinant Fab fragments. A new epitope, designated G 2 a 3, partially overlapping the neutralizing epitope of the human MAb 1 C 9, was identified. PUUV-specific serum lgA responses in NE patients were characterized regarding kinetics, antigen specificity and neutralizing activity. Elevated levels of total IgA were observed in acute-phase samples and the majority of patients had N- and G 2 -specific IgA 1 antibodies, while responses against G 1 were low. PUUV neutralizing IgA 1 was detected in acute-phase NE sera and PUUV-specific lgA was detected in late convalescent (> 10 -year) samples. lgA was shown to be a useful complement to IgM detection in the diagnosis of PUUV infection. The role of the immune response in protection, {{as well as in the}} pathogenesis of hantavirus infection, is not clear. Immune responses against the N protein were studied in inbred mice immunized with PUUV recombinant N (rN) protein. PUUV-specific IgG of all subclasses was induced, and epitope mapping showed that B-cell sites were mainly located in the aminoterminal part of N. Several T-cell recognition sites, spanning amino acids 6 - 27, 96 - 117, 211 232 and 256 - 277 of N, were identified by proliferation assays and rN restimulated T-helper (Th) -cells mainly produced interleukin (M) - 2 and interferon-gamma, together with low levels of IL- 4 and IL- 6, indicating a mixed Thl/Th 2 response. As hantaviruses are closely related the characteristics of cross-protective responses are interesting. Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), the natural host of PUUV, were immunized with PUUV, Andes, <b>Dobrava</b> and Topografov <b>virus</b> rN proteins and subsequently challenged with PUUV. The rN proteins elicited cross- protection against challenge, and analysis of the elicited immune responses indicated a more important role for the cellular immune response compared to the humoral in cross-protection elicited by the N protein. Since hantaviruses are transmitted to humans mainly through inhalation, intranasal vaccination could be an interesting alternative vaccine strategy. This was evaluated in a transnasal/respiratory challenge model in bank voles, after immunization with PUUV rN protein formulated with the lipid based Eurocine® adjuvant (mono-olein/oleic acidlsoy bean oil). Protection was observed in 5 / 7 animals immunized three times intranasally, while 319 animals, immunized once subcutaneously and twice intranasally, were protected. In contrast, immunization with rN without Eurocine® gave rise to protection in only 2 / 9 bank voles.

At the same time, cell-culture isolation of Belgrade virus from a patient with severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) was reported [11]. Later, these virus isolates {{were found to be}} identical [77]...|$|E
40|$|In {{their paper}} (3), Klempa and coauthors {{reported}} results on (phylo) genetic analyses of hantaviruses occurring in two spe-cies of Apodemus mice, <b>Dobrava</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV) -Af (from DOBV associated with A. flavicollis) and DOBV-Aa (associ-ated with A. agrarius), {{and concluded that}} “DOBV-Af and DOBV-Aa are distinct but also subject to genetic exchanges that affect their evolutionary trajectories. ” From these grounds, they then criticize our view that DOBV-Aa is a dis-tinct hantavirus species, Saaremaa virus (SAAV) (1, 7, 9). (When we first discovered SAAV, it was designated a genetic lineage of DOBV [5, 8], {{and it was only}} with accumulating data that we {{came to the conclusion that}} it represents a distinct, new hantavirus.) We feel that the claim of Klempa et al. for cur-rently occurring genetic exchanges between DOBV and SAAV is not well grounded and their view lacks an evolutionary di...|$|E
40|$|Using nested {{polymerase}} chain reaction, we sequenced <b>Dobrava</b> <b>virus</b> (DOB) {{from the}} rodent Apodemus agrarius in Hungary. The samples we isolated group with DOB samples previously isolated from A. flavicollis. This grouping may indicate host switching. Hantaviruses, the causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, are serologically related viruses {{of the family}} Bunyaviridae and have a worldwide distribution. Unlike other bunyaviruses, hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropod vectors. The virus is excreted in the saliva, urine, and feces of infected rodents. Humans become infected by inhalation of aerosols of dried excreta, inoculation through the conjunctiva, or entry through broken skin (1). Each viral species within the genus Hantavirus is primarily associated with a single rodent species, although accidental infections {{have been reported in}} other mammals (2). Four primary reservoirs for hantaviruses are found i...|$|E
40|$|In Europe, {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal {{syndrome}} results mainly from infection with Puumala virus (PUUV) or <b>Dobrava</b> <b>virus.</b> For 31 patients from a hantavirus disease outbreak in Lower Bavaria, a district in southeast Germany, serodiagnosis was undertaken by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence assay, and immunoblot analysis. In {{a few of}} these cases, however, PUUV-specific typing of antibodies by these standard assays failed and a virus neutralization assay under biosafety level 3 conditions was required to verify the infection by this virus type. PUUV RNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from acute-phase sera of three patients and was found to be very closely related to virus sequences obtained from bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) trapped in the same area. These findings link the outbreak with a novel PUUV lineage, “Bavaria,” circulating in the local rodent population. The Bavaria lineage associated with the outbreak is only distantly related to other PUUV lineages from Germany...|$|E
40|$|Truncated {{recombinant}} nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) of Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), and <b>Dobrava</b> <b>virus</b> (DOBV) {{were expressed}} by a baculovirus system. The truncated rNPs, which lacked 49 (rNP 50) or 154 (rNP 155) N-terminal amino acids of the NPs of HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV, {{were able to}} differentiate HTNV-, SEOV-, and DOBV-specific immune sera. Recombinant NP 50 s retained higher reactivities than rNP 155 s and were proven useful for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISAs based on the rNP 50 s of HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV successfully differentiated three groups of patient sera, previously defined by neutralization tests: 17 with HTNV infection, 12 with SEOV infection, and 20 with DOBV infection. The entire rNP of Puumala virus (PUUV) distinguished PUUV infection from the other types of hantavirus infection. Serotyping with these rNP 50 s can be recommended as a rapid and efficient system for hantavirus diagnosis...|$|E
