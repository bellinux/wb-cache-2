5000|$|The basic {{operation}} of IMTS was very advanced for its time, considering that integrated circuits were not commonly available. The most common IMTS phone, the Motorola TLD-1100 series, used two circuit boards about 8 inches square, {{to perform the}} channel scanning and digit decoding process, and all logic was performed with discrete transistors. In a given city, one IMTS base station channel was [...] "marked idle" [...] by the transmission of a steady 2000 Hz [...] "idle" [...] tone. Mobiles would scan the available frequencies and lock on to the channel transmitting the <b>idle</b> <b>tone.</b> When a call was placed to a mobile, the <b>idle</b> <b>tone</b> would change to 1800 Hz [...] "channel seize" [...] tone (the <b>idle</b> <b>tone</b> would appear on another frequency, if available), and the 7 digit mobile number (three digits of the NPA and the last four digits of subscriber number, the NXX was not sent) would be sent out as rotary dial pulses, switching between 2000 and 1800 Hz to represent digits. Any mobile recognizing that the call was for someone else would resume scanning for mark <b>idle</b> <b>tone,</b> while the called mobile would then transmit 2150 Hz [...] "guard" [...] tone back to the base station. This would also initiate ringing at the mobile, and when the mobile subscriber picked up the phone, 1633 Hz [...] "connect" [...] tone would {{be sent back to}} the base station to indicate answer supervision and the voice path would be cut through. When the mobile hung up, a burst of alternating 1336 [...] "disconnect" [...] and 1800 Hz [...] "seize" [...] tones would be sent to allow the base station to service another call.|$|E

The dithering Multi-stAge-noise-SHaping (MASH) DPWM is introduced exhibiting a better <b>idle</b> <b>tone</b> suppression effect that achieves relatively higher effective number of bit (ENOB). The Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) replaces the cumbersome pseudo-random generator as the dither generation module that is proven to be more effective. The SMC with the proper sliding coefficients aiming at a better dynamic response than the traditional PID controller cooperates with our proposed DPWM. Two individual boards, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a boost converter, connecting to a Virtex-II FPGA platform compose a close-loop test environment. Experimental results verify the switching-mode-power-supply (SMPS) close-loop operation at 1 MHz switching frequency with an 11 -bit effective DPWM resolution...|$|E
40|$|The exact {{analysis}} of second order bandpass modulator with sinusoidal in-puts is performed {{and the results}} show the quantization error is neither uniformly distributed nor white and its spectrum is purely discrete and symmetric with w = 2. The location of each spectrum frequency component or <b>idle</b> <b>tone</b> depends strongly on the input amplitude but the spectrum magnitude is not input dependent. As the amplitude of input signal increased, the largest secondary tones will approach tothe center frequency and may corrupt desired signal. The crosscorrelation between quan-tization error and input do exist in our study of bandpass system with sinusoidal inputs. However, it can be cancelled out by the noise shaping function, so the mod-ulator output {{will not be a}} ected by this crosscorrelation. However, for input signal with certain bandwidth, the crosscorrelation will degrade the system performance. For higher order systems or noisy passband communication signals, the Gaussian assumption for the input to the quantizer is reasonable even for bandpass modu-lators. The {{analysis of}} quantization error power under this assumption shows {{it is not only the}} function of output step size but also the input level of quantizer. The mini-mum power of quantization error can be achieved when a speci c value of quantizer input power is applied. Two applications, direct decoding technique and improved Hartley image-reject receiver, for bandpass modulators are also introduced and analyzed. i...|$|E

40|$|Multi-bit sigma-delta based {{digital pulse}} width {{modulators}} (DPWM) {{are used in}} the control of DC-DC converters in order to achieve high resolution and therefore high output voltage accuracy at switching frequencies up to multiple MHz. The standard sigma-delta modulators which have mainly been used in these DPWMs to date generate <b>idle</b> <b>tones</b> in the applied duty cycle which result in large oscillations in the output voltage. A dithered sigma-delta modulator is instead implemented here which eliminates these oscillations in the output voltage by adding a random signal before the quantizer in the sigma-delta modulator.

In this paper we present {{an analysis of the}} saturation characteristics and tone behavior of the double loop EA modulator with unstable filter dynamics. We begin by deriving stability boundaries for the double loop EA modulator with unstable filter dynamics which yield bounds on maximum internal signal levels. We then show via simulations and steady state analysis that while tonal properties are improved by using unstable filter dynamics, <b>idle</b> <b>tones</b> are not completely removed. Specifically, we show that some unstable limit cycles have an attractor region in their neighborhood which resultsin tones in the spectrum corresponding to the fundamental or harmonics of these limit cycles. 0 I...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 As CMOS {{processes}} keep {{scaling down}} devices, the maximum operating frequencies of CMOS devices increase, and hence circuits can process very wide band signals. Moreover, the small physical dimensions of transistors allow the placing of many more blocks {{into a single}} chip, including highly accurate analog blocks and complicated digital blocks, which can process audio to communication data. Nowadays, wideband and low-power data converter is mandatory for mobile applications which need a bridge between analog and digital blocks. In this dissertation, low-power and wideband techniques are proposed. An embedded-adder quantizer with dynamic preamplifier is proposed to achieve power-efficient operation. Various double-sampling schemes are studied, and novel schemes are presented to achieve wideband operation without noise folding effect. To reduce timing delay and <b>idle</b> <b>tones,</b> a high speed DEM which alternates two sets of comparator references is proposed. Multi-cell architecture is studied to insure higher performance {{when the number of}} modulators increases. 0. 18 um double-poly/ 4 -metal CMOS process was used to implement a prototype IC. 20 MHz signal bandwidth was achieved with a 320 MHz sampling clock. The peak SNDR was 63 dB. The figure-of-merit FoM = P/(2 *BW* 2 [superscript ENOB]) was 0. 35 pJ/conversion, with a 16 mW power consumption. Measurement results show that the proposed design ideas are useful for low-power and wideband delta-sigma modulators which have low OSR. A second-order noise-coupled modulator with an embedded-zero optimization was proposed to reduce power consumption by eliminating some of the integrators. This architecture makes easier the implementation of the small feedback capacitors for high OSR modulators...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the tonal behavior of an adaptive second-order sigma-delta modulator, which {{was developed and}} published by the same authors. <b>Idle</b> channel <b>tones,</b> caused by non-white quantization error, is not desirable in applications where the human ear is the end receiver. Besides their relatively small magnitude tones in the baseband, most sigma-delta modulators produce high-powered tones near fs/ 2. It is a more serious problem because the clock noise near fs/ 2 can couple these tones down into the baseband. Various simulations show that the more randomized nature of the aforementioned adaptive architecture makes it more advantageous in tonal behavior, particularly attractive in that it significantly reduces the dominant tone near fs/ 2, {{which can not be}} reduced by dithering in a standard second order single-bit modulator. With comparison to the standard second-order sigma-delta modulators, the results are illustrated in both frequency and time domains...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of three novel low-power and low-noise schemes for the readout interfaces of MEMS Capacitive Microphones (MCM) by presenting their detailed design descriptions and measurement results as application-specific ICs (ASIC) in CMOS technology developed to exploit their application scope in consumer electronics and hearing aids. MCMs are {{a new generation of}} acoustic sensors, which offer a significant scope to improve miniaturization, integration and cost of the acoustic systems by leveraging the MEMS technology. Electret-Condenser-Microphones (ECM) are the current market solution for acoustic applications; however, MCMs are being considered as the future microphone-of-choice for mobile phones in consumer electronics and for hearing aids in medical applications. The readout interface of MCM in an acoustic system converts the output of the MEMS sensor into an appropriate electrical representation (analog or digital). The output of a MCM {{is in the form of}} capacitive-variations in femto-Farad range, which necessitates a low-noise signal-translation employed by the readout interface together with a low-power profile for its portable applications. The main focus of this dissertation is to develop novel readout schemes that are low-noise, low-power, low-cost and batch-producible, targeting the domains of consumer electronics and hearing-aids. The presented readout interfaces in this dissertation consist of a front-end, which is a preamplifier, and a backend which converts the output of the preamplifier into a digital representation. The first interface presents a bootstrapped preamplifier and a third-order sigma-delta modulator (SDM) for analog-to-digital conversion. The preamplifier is bootstrapped to the MCM by tying its output to the sensor’s substrate. This bootstrapping technique boosts the MCM signal by 17 dB and also makes the readout insensitive to the parasitic capacitors in MCM electro-mechanical structure, achieving 55 dBA/Pa of SNDR. The third-order low-power SDM converts output of the PAMP into an over-sampled digital bitstream demonstrating a dynamic-range (DR) of 80 dBA. This ASIC operates at 1. 8 V single-supply and 460 uA of total current consumption; thus, highlighting {{the feasibility of}} low-power integrated MCM readout interface. This ASIC is also acoustically characterized with a MCM, bonded together in a single package, demonstrating a reasonable agreement with the expected performance. The second interface presents a readout scheme with force-feedback (FFB) for the MCM. The force-feedback is used to enhance the linearity of the MCM and minimize the impact of drift in sensor mechanical parameters. Due to the unavailability of the sensor, the effect of FFB could not be measured with an MCM; however, the presented results point out a significant performance improvement through FFB. The preamplifier in this ASIC utilizes a high-gain OTA in a capacitive-feedback configuration to achieve parasitic insensitive readout in an area and power-efficient way, achieving 40 dBA/Pa of SNDR. The digital output of the third-order SDM achieved 76 dBA of DR and was also used to apply the electrostatic FFB by modulating the bias voltage of the MCM. A dummy-branch with dynamic matching converted the single-ended MCM into a pseudo-differential sensor to make it compatible with force-feedback. This interface operates at 3. 3 V supply and consumes total current of 300 uA. The third interface presents a chopper-stabilized multi-function preamplifier for MCM. Unlike typical MCM preamplifiers, this preamplifier employs chopper-stabilization to mitigate low-frequency noise and offset and it also embeds extra functionalities in the preamplifier core such as controllable gain, controllable offset and controllable high-pass filtering. This preamplifier consists of two stages; the first stage is a source-follower buffering the MCM output into a voltage signal and the second-stage is a chopper-stabilized controllable capacitive gain-stage. This preamplifier employs MΩ bias resistors to achieve consistent readout sensitivity over the audio band by utilizing the miller effect, avoiding the conditionally-linear GΩ bias resistors. The offset control functionality of this preamplifier can be used to modulate <b>idle</b> <b>tones</b> in the subsequent sigma-delta modulator out of the audio-band. The high-pass filtering functionality can be used to filter-out low-frequency noises such as wind-hum. This preamplifier operates at 1. 8 V and consumes total current of 50 u with SNDR of 44 dB/PA, demonstrating the feasibility of a low-power low-noise multifunction preamplifier for the MCM sensor...|$|R
