He then became an assistant producer for On the Record, and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> to the Scottish local elections.

40|$|Abstract: The {{source of}} the Camana tsunami of June 23, 2001, which was {{generated}} due to a large earthquake (Mw = 8. 4 by USGS) at {{the southern part of}} Peru, is estimated by the inversion of 10 tsunami waveforms that were recorded at ten tide gauge stations around the Pacific Ocean. Then, we perform the tsunami numerical inundation modeling to investigate the validity of this source model through comparison <b>in</b> term of <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> height with field survey data measured around Camana city. As a results, the waveform inversion shows that large slips were estimated at the deeper part (> 29 km) of the fault plane, located more than 50 km from the trench axis, with a largest slip value about 9. 96 m. The total seismic moment is calculated as 3. 7 x 1021 Nm (Mw = 8. 3) for 12 -subfault model. The inundation modeling result is consistent <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> height data measured around Camana city...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time {{it appeared that}} the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> {{some ways}} <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> to Plataea resembled {{that at the}} Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other.

As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010.

40|$|Transformation {{of waves}} on sandy beaches, their breaking, set-up and <b>run-up</b> are <b>the</b> main factors {{contributing}} to fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water table and groundwater flow. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> mechanisms have been studied using analytical models. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> standard models, the waves approaching the shoreline {{are assumed to be}} dispersive and the equivalence of the non-linear and linear solutions for the extreme characteristics of wave <b>run-up,</b> such as <b>the</b> height of maximum <b>run-up</b> and <b>the</b> velocity of <b>run-up,</b> are used. A linear system of equations for <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> of breaking waves is developed. This system is based on the application of <b>the</b> mild-slope equation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deeper area, where waves are dispersive, while the linear equations of shallow water are applied close to the shoreline, where the water depth is a linear function of distance. <b>The</b> dissipation factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shallow water equation has been formulated using its resemblance to the mild-slope equation for a non-permeable sea bottom. Application of the method is illustrated for various bottom profiles and wave characteristics, and theoretical results compared well with experimental data. These solutions of <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> phenomena will assist future studies on wave-induced beach groundwater flow...|$|R
50|$|The broad {{business}} concept shaping the forum was largely {{drawn up by}} ESADE. The link between the forum's commercial sponsors and the business school can readily be appreciated by comparing the companies listed on ESADE's Board of Trustees and those featured on the forum's web site. The strong business orientation apparent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organization of the event gave rise to considerable local controversy <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> to <b>the</b> forum and during the event itself. Several NGOs argued that they were frozen out of the decision-making process as the original Forum concept was radically altered to cater to corporate interests. The controversy may have also damaged the re-election prospects of Barcelona's incumbent Mayor—Joan Clos—a point that was repeatedly made by political commentators in local and national newspapers across the political spectrum.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{experimental}} results of long wave run-up climbing up a 1 : 40 sloping beach. <b>The</b> resulting maximum <b>run-up</b> is compared with analytical results {{and a good}} agreement is found for single sinusoidal waves with uniform wave period and varying amplitude. Subsequently, the interaction with macro-roughness elements on the beach is investigated for different long-shore obstruction ratios. <b>The</b> reduction <b>in</b> wave <b>run-up</b> is expressed {{by means of a}} nomogram relating <b>the</b> wave <b>run-up</b> without macro-roughness elements present to those cases where on-land flow is modified by macro-roughness. The presented results mainly focus on a non-staggered and non-rotated macro-roughness configuration. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> reduction, surface elevation profiles on the shore are presented, that address the shock wave generation when the wave tongue approaches the first row of macro-roughness elements...|$|R
