40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the ignition of individual fuel drops after their interaction with an incident and a reflected shock wave near the end wall of a shock tube has been carried out. The influence of the aerodynamic shattering of the fuel drop by the convective flow on the ignition characteristics has been examined by varying the <b>drop-end</b> wall separation distance. Data are presented which show the ignition delay times to {{be a function of}} the various experimental conditions encountered in this study. A comparison is made with previous investigations concerning the ignition of a liquid fuel drop due only to the interaction with an incident shock wave...|$|E
