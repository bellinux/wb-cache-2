40|$|We report self-similar {{properties}} of periodic structures remarkably {{organized in the}} two-parameter space for a two-gene system, described by two-dimensional symmetric map. The map consists of difference equations derived from the chemical reactions for gene expression and regulation. We characterize the system by using Lyapunov exponents and isoperiodic diagrams identifying periodic windows, denominated Arnold tongues and shrimp-shaped structures. Period-adding sequences are observed for both periodic windows. We also identify Fibonacci-type series and Golden ratio for Arnold tongues, and period multiple-of-three windows for shrimps.

40|$|Copper {{complexes}} with fluorinated beta-diketones were synthesized and characterized {{in terms}} of lipophilicity and peroxide-assisted oxidation of dihydrorhodamine {{as an indicator of}} redox activity. The biological activity of the complexes was tested against promastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis. Inhibition of trypanosomatid-specific trypanothione reductase was also tested. It was found that the highly lipophilic and redox-active bis(trifluoroacetylacetonate) derivative had increased toxicity towards promastigotes. These results indicate {{that it is possible to}} modulate the activity of metallodrugs based on redox-active metals through the appropriate choice of lipophilic chelators in order to design new antileishmanials. Further work will be necessary to improve selectivity of these compounds against the parasite.
