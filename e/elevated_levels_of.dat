5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that in some}} people, development of schizophrenia is related to intestinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non-celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the intestinal flora. A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to gluten different from that found in people with celiac, with <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as anti-gliadin IgG or anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. <b>Elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pesticides in wax and pollen, but {{the amounts of}} pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E
5|$|During the race, Alessandro Petacchi tested {{positive}} for <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> salbutamol at a doping control on 23 May, after winning Stage 11. Petacchi has a medical exemption to use salbutamol {{in the treatment of}} asthma, but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level. Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture of all his results from the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> {{uric acid}} in the blood. This occurs due to a {{combination}} of diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E
5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> copper on their skin. The cause for this was {{uncertain}} as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E

40|$|Fully deuterated {{components}} from autotrophic cell lysate {{are useful}} materials for labeling of heterotrophs with deuterium. To facilitate the faster production of deuterated algal lysate, we selected a mutant Chlorella strain that grows faster in heavy water than the wild type.

Pharm. Bull. 26 : 799 - 802, 2003). This suggests that the overexpression of heat shock proteins is required to compensate for the deuterium isotope effect...|$|R

25|$|Many {{acid rock}} {{discharges}} also contain <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> potentially toxic metals, especially nickel and copper {{with lower levels}} of a range of trace and semi-metal ions such as lead, arsenic, aluminium, and manganese. The <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals can only be dissolved in waters that have a low pH, as is found in the acidic waters produced by pyrite oxidation. In the coal belt around the south Wales valleys in the UK highly acidic nickel-rich discharges from coal stocking sites have proved to be particularly troublesome.|$|E
