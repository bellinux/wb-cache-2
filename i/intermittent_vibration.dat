The pair started with the P6 truss, removing the attachments to the Z1 truss, which allowed Wilson and Wheelock to use the station's robotic arm to move the truss to a position where it was [...] "parked" [...] for the night. Joking to Wilson [...] "Don't drop it!", Parazynski then moved on and installed handrails onto Harmony, while Tani went to inspect some items requested by the managers, including handrails on a Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) cart, that was considered as a possible cause of Rick Mastracchio's glove tear on STS-118. Tani noted the handrail appeared to be intact, with no obvious sharp edges.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} acute {{response}} of finger circulation to continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration</b> {{having the same}} total duration of vibration exposure and the same energy-equivalent acceleration magnitude. METHODS: Finger blood flow (FBF) was measured {{in the middle and}} little fingers of both hands of ten healthy men. Finger skin temperature (FST) was measured in the middle right finger. With a static load of 10 N, the middle finger of the right hand was exposed to 125 Hz at 44 m s(- 2) root mean square (r. m. s.) in five conditions: (1). 30 min continuous exposure, (2). two periods of 15 min, separated by a 15 min period with no vibration, (3). four periods of 7. 5 min, separated by 7. 5 min periods with no vibration, (4). eight periods of 3. 75 min, separated by 3. 75 min periods with no vibration, (5). 16 periods of 1. 88 min, separated by 1. 88 min periods with no vibration. All five exposures correspond to an 8 h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration magnitude of 1. 4 m s(- 2) r. m. s. according to International Standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001). Finger circulation was measured in all four digits before the application of vibration and at fixed intervals during vibration exposure and during a 45 min recovery period. RESULTS: The FST did not change during vibration exposure, whereas all vibration conditions produced significant reductions in FBF of the vibrated finger when compared with the pre-exposure FBF. During vibration exposure, the vibration caused a similar degree of vasoconstriction in the vibrated finger without evidence of cumulative effects during intermittent exposure. After the end of exposure to 30 min of continuous vibration there was a progressive decrease in the FBF, whereas there was no statistically significant reduction following exposure to <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration.</b> CONCLUSIONS: For the vibration stimuli investigated (exposure durations varying from 1. 88 min to 30 min, with rest periods varying from 1. 88 min to 15 min), the reduction of FBF during exposure was the same for continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration.</b> The after effect of vibration was greater following the continuous vibration exposure. Although some evidence from this study is consistent with the notion that <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration</b> has a less severe effect than continuous vibration, this evidence is not yet conclusive...|$|E

As a consequence, thermal growth of pump shaft was restricted and it was rotating in deflected shape, rubbing within throat bushes. Problem was resolved by replacing the bearing design with NU type Cylindrical roller bearing, which allows higher amount of axial displacement.

Ice properties have been taken into account, such as the discrete failure, the dependence of the crushing strength on the ice velocity and the randomness of the ice failure.

40|$|Hand arm {{vibration}} syndrome (HAVS) affects industrial workers exposed to long term hand-transmitted vibration from powered-tools. Peripheral neuropathy {{is a major}} component of the symptom complex of HAVS. Long term exposure to vibration causes myelin damage in peripheral nerves and reduces nerve conduction velocities in rats 1. This study addresses the effects of acute vibration at constant acceleration of 49 m/s 2 on myelinated fibers in peripheral nerves in Sprague-Dawley male rats using the 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆dcrat-tail vibration model, 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 which simulates hand-transmitted vibration 2. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) were assigned to vibration groups: 1 hr continuous vibration at 60 Hz; 4 hr continuous exposure at frequencies of 30, 60, 120 or 800 Hz; immediate and 24 hr following a 4 -hr cumulative exposure of continuous and <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration</b> at 60 Hz. Unanesthetized rats were restrained in cages on a nonvibrating platform with their tails placed on a vibrating stage accelerated by a B&K motor type 4809 and vibrated. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>vibration</b> was delivered in bouts of 10 min vibration alternating with 5 min rest periods repeated over 6 hr. Sham controls were restrained without vibration. After vibration exposure, the rats were anaesthetized, and the ventral nerve trunks from the proximal tail segment 7 were fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in epon-araldite and sectioned at 0. 5 25 m thickness and stained with toludine-blue for morphological quantitative analysis. The total number of myelinated axons in each cross-section of the nerve was counted using the Image J software. Myelin damage was identified by focal increase in area and intensity of toludine-blue staining and unraveling of the myelin sheath. Statistical analysis for comparing sham and the different vibration groups was done using Dunnett 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s test.

40|$|Hatching {{care has}} been {{reported}} for many taxonomic groups, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The sophisticated care that occurs around hatching time {{is expected to have}} an adaptive function supporting the feeble young. However, details of the characteristics of the adaptive function of hatching care remain unclear. This study investigated the hatching care of the subsocial shield bug, Parastrachia japonensis (Heteroptera: Parastrachiidae) to verify its function. Results show that the P. japonensis mothers vibrated the egg mass intermittently while maintaining an egg-guarding posture. Then embryos started to emerge from their shells synchronously. Unlike such behaviors of closely related species, this vibrating behavior was faint, but lasted more than 6 h. To investigate the effect of this behavior on hatching synchrony and hatching success, we observed the hatching pattern and the hatching rate in control, mother-removed, and two artificial vibration groups. Control broods experienced continuous guarding from the mother. <b>Intermittent</b> artificial <b>vibration</b> broods were exposed to vibrations that matched the temporal pattern of maternal vibration produced by a motor. They showed synchronous hatching patterns and high hatching rates. However, for mother-removed broods, which were isolated from the mother, and when we provided continuous artificial vibration that did not match the temporal pattern of the maternal vibration, embryo hatching was not only asynchronous: some embryos failed to emerge from their shells. These results lead us to infer that hatching care in P. japonensis has two functions: hatching regulation and hatching assistance. Nevertheless, severa...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new empirical model of the hydrodynamic loads associated with vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of slender circular cylinders. The most commonly used VIV analysis tools operate in the frequency domain, and are unable to account for non-linear structural effects. In addition, these methods cannot handle time varying flows, and interaction with other loads is difficult to account for. To dispose of the limitations associated with frequency domain analyses, a new method for time domain simulation of VIV is proposed in this work. Different load formulations are explored, and the final version consists of the well-known Morison's equation for inertia and drag forces, plus an additional term that models the effect of vortex shedding. A key component is a synchronization model which simulates how the vortex shedding reacts to structure motion to obtain lock-in. To evaluate the hydrodynamic load model, numerical simulations of a rigid cylinder subjected to an incoming flow and forced cross-flow oscillations are performed. Comparison with published experimental results shows that the proposed model reproduces the basic behavior of the fluctuating lift force. To predict VIV of flexible cylinders, the hydrodynamic load model is combined with a finite element structural model. A linear beam model is utilized to simulate VIV of a riser in uniform and sheared stationary flow. Fatigue damage is calculated based on rainflow counting and Miner-Palmgren summation, and comparison with experimental data shows reasonable agreement. The uncertainties associated with VIV fatigue damage are however significant, and safety factors are necessary in some cases to obtain conservative results. The proposed model has no restrictions on the time variability of the incoming flow, and through comparison with experimental data, it is demonstrated that the model accurately predicts the unstable VIV of a flexible cylinder subjected to a sinusoidal oscillating flow at two different KC-numbers. In the high KC-number case, the VIV response is <b>intermittent,</b> with <b>vibrations</b> continuously building up and dying out. It is also shown that multi-mode response occurs in oscillating flow when the reduced velocity is above a certain level, and the cylinder mass ratio is found to be important for the mode participation. Finally, the hydrodynamic load model is implemented in a non-linear finite element program for dynamic analysis of slender structures. This is used to simulate VIV of a truncated model scale steel catenary riser in two different conditions: uniform stationary flow and oscillating relative flow caused by prescribed top-end motion. The predicted strains show good agreement with experiments, although some discrepancies are seen...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the changes over a workshift in fingertip tactile perception thresholds in users of impact wrenches exposed to <b>intermittent</b> hand transmitted <b>vibration.</b> A further {{aim was to}} assess the relation between acute changes in tactile sensation, sensorineural disorders, and vibration dose. METHODS: The study populations consisted of 30 workers exposed to vibration (16 men and 14 women) and 25 control manual workers (10 men and 15 women). Sensorineural disorders in the fingers and hands were graded according to the staging system of the Stockholm workshop scale. Tactile function was tested by measuring aesthesiometric thresholds (two point discrimination and depth sense perception) and vibrotactile perception thresholds at 16, 31. 5, and 125 Hz before and after a workshift. Temporary threshold shift was then calculated as the difference between threshold measures before and after the shift. The measurement and assessment of exposure to vibration were made according to the international standard ISO 5349. The vibration dose accumulated over a workshift (m 2 s- 4 h) was estimated for each user of impact wrenches. Daily exposure to vibration was also expressed in terms of eight hour energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration ((ahw) eq(8) in ms- 2 rms). RESULTS: After adjustment for age and alcohol consumption, vibrotactile perception thresholds before exposure were greater in the workers exposed to vibration than in the controls. No differences in aesthesiometric thresholds before the shift were found between the study groups. Sensorineural disorders were mild in the workers exposed to vibration and minor neurological abnormalities were detected at the physical examination. Owing to the intermittent use of impact wrenches, the estimated mean (ahw) eq(8) for the subjects exposed to vibration was low (1. 3 ms- 2 rms). A significant temporary threshold shift in vibration perception at all test frequencies was found in the workers exposed to vibration but not in the controls. A significant increase in depth sense perception thresholds was found in the men exposed to vibration. The temporary threshold shift in vibration perception at 125 Hz, {{and to a lesser extent}} at 16 and 31. 5 Hz, was associated with the severity of sensorineural disorders. In the workers exposed to vibration the temporary threshold shift in vibration sense at all test frequencies was positively related to the estimated dose of vibration received over a workshift. No significant relation was found between aesthesiometric threshold changes and <b>vibration</b> dose. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Intermittent</b> exposure to hand transmitted vibration over a workshift can cause a deterioration of tactile perception in the fingers of users of impact wrenches. Acute tactile dysfunction was related to both the estimated dose of vibration and the severity of sensorineural symptoms. The temporary threshold shift in vibration perception suggested that fast adapting skin mechanoreceptors such as Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles were mainly involved in the acute sensory impairment to the fingertips of the workers exposed to vibration. Changes in tactile perception can occur in workers with daily exposure to vibration that is considered to be associated with a minimal risk of adverse health effects induced by vibration...|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} bottom-founded structures, {{including}} lighthouses, quay structures, mono-pod platforms, multi-legged platforms, caisson-retained islands and bridges, {{are located in}} ice-infested waters. Level ice can interact with bottom-founded structures in various manners, and over fifty years of extensive measurement campaigns has brought attention to ice-induced vibrations. This phenomenon is caused by repeated ice crushing failures across the ice-structure interface and may entail violent vibrations of the structure, thereby potentially harming the structural integrity, secondary installations and operational safety. Such ice-induced vibrations are commonly divided into three regimes: 1) Intermittent crushing 2) Frequency lock-in 3) Continuous brittle crushing in which the ice velocity increase from regime 1 to regime 3. The ice conditions leading {{to each of the}} three regimes are not yet fully understood. Therefore, measurement campaigns both in the field and in the laboratory must address these regimes, wherein two of the major ingredients are the ice force and the structural response. A laboratory-scale ice-induced vibration measurement campaign was conducted at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin during August-September 2011, from which data were obtained for this thesis. Data measured at the Nordströmsgrund lighthouse in Sweden during the winter of 2003 and structural information on the Hanko- 1 channel marker in Finland constitute the full-scale basis in this thesis. The ice forces present during ice-induced vibrations are traditionally measured by load panels or inverse techniques. Load panels are expensive; thus, inverse techniques are favorable. This thesis assessed a deterministic-stochastic framework to identify both the ice forces and responses at both the model scale and full scale. All of the considered data were limited to scenarios of ice-induced vibrations, and the considered ice conditions were primarily level ice. The framework as it is applied in this thesis consists of a joint input-state estimation algorithm, a model of the structure and a set of response measurements. Both full-order finite element models and modally reduced order models were used in this thesis. Using the laboratory measurements, the force and response identification was performed by employing two different full-order finite element models. One model was entirely based on the blueprints of the structure. The other model was tuned to more accurately reproduce the measured first natural frequency. The results were presented for two different regimes of ice-induced vibrations: the intermittent crushing regime and the continuous brittle crushing regime. The accuracy of the identified forces using the joint input-state estimation algorithm was assessed by comparing the forces with those obtained by a frequency-domain deconvolution method based on experimentally obtained frequency response functions. The results demonstrated the successful identification of the level-ice forces for both the intermittent and continuous brittle crushing regimes even when significant modeling errors were present. The responses (displacements) identified in conjunction with the forces were also compared to those measured during the experiment. Here, the estimated response was found {{to be sensitive to the}} modeling errors in the blueprint model. Simple tuning of the model, however, enabled high-accuracy response estimation. The joint input-state estimation algorithm was further used as a means to analyze the laboratory data, from which the global structural response was simultaneously identified with the forces. Novel insights into ice-induced vibration phenomena were obtained by comparing, on different time scales, measured and estimated response quantities and forces/pressures. First, the identified forces, ice velocities and time-frequency maps of the measured responses were presented for a series of ice-induced vibration tests. It was shown that the ice forces excited more than one mode of the structure and that the transition ice velocity at which the vibrations shifted from the first mode to the second mode increased with decreased foundation stiffness and superstructure mass. Second, a detailed analysis of the interaction between the structure and the ice edge was performed on a smaller time scale by comparing the locally measured pressures at the ice-structure interface to the identified structural responses and forces. It was shown that structural vibrations at a frequency that is higher than the dominant vibration frequency caused cyclic loading of the ice edge during <b>intermittent</b> crushing. These <b>vibrations</b> led to an increasing loading rate prior to ice failure. During an event that showed the tendencies of frequency lock-in vibrations, the structural response was dominated by a single vibration frequency. At full scale, a comparison between the measured and identified dynamic ice forces acting on the Nordströmsgrund lighthouse is presented. The dynamic ice forces were identified from the measured responses using the joint input-state estimation algorithm in conjunction with a reduced-order finite element model. A convincing agreement between the measured and identified forces was found. The algorithm was further used to estimate the response of the structure at unmeasured locations, including the iceaction point. The structural velocity amplitudes when the structure was subject to frequency lock-in vibrations were occasionally higher than the ice velocity and within the range of observations for other structures. A measurement campaign at the Hanko- 1 channel marker in the Gulf of Finland is planned to monitor the forces leading to ice-induced vibrations via force identification. The ice forces are to be identified using the joint input-state estimation algorithm in conjunction with a modally reduced order model. Recently developed guidelines were used to determine the optimal response measurement types and locations that ensure the identifiability of the dynamic ice forces from only a limited number of sensors and a selection of vibration modes...|$|R

We applied various frequencies of vibration to the maxillary right first molar during relapse, and monitored changes to the alveolar bone and molar root. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four male CD 1 mice were placed in 4 groups. The Control Group underwent OTM for 7 days. The other three groups received OTM for 7 days, followed by a relapse phase of 7 days. OTM was performed with a 10 g Ni-Ti spring. The Relapse Group did not receive vibration during relapse, while Relapse + 10 Hz and Relapse + 30 Hz Groups received <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration</b> throughout their relapse phases. Micro-CT imaging was performed for bone volume fraction (BVF), tissue density (TD), first molar movement (M 1 -M 2 Distance), and mesial root volume (MRV). Results: Differences in M 1 -M 2 Distance were statistically significant between control and experimental groups. No significant findings were observed between controls and experimental groups for BVF, TD, and MRV. No significant differences were observed between relapse and relapse with vibration groups for BVD, TD, M 1 -M 2 Distance, and MRV. Non-significant measurements demonstrated Relapse + 10 Hz vibration increased relapse while Relapse + 30 Hz vibration decreased relapse.

In the present study, 12 male subjects adopted a relaxed semi-supine posture assumed to involve less muscle activity than during static sitting and standing. The supine subjects were exposed to two types of vertical vibration (in the x-axis of the semi-supine body) : (i) continuous random vibration (0. 25 – 20 Hz) at five magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0 m s? 2 rms); (ii) intermittent random vibration (0. 25 – 20 Hz) alternately at 0. 25 and 1. 0 m s? 2 rms. With continuous random vibration, the dominant primary resonance frequency in the median normalised apparent mass decreased from 10. 35 to 7. 32 Hz as the vibration magnitude increased from 0. 125 to 1. 0 m s? 2 rms. This nonlinear response was apparent in both the vertical (x-axis) apparent mass and in the horizontal (z-axis) cross-axis apparent mass. As the vibration magnitude increased from 0. 25 to 1. 0 m s? 2 rms, the median resonance frequency of the apparent mass with intermittent random vibration decreased from 9. 28 to 8. 06 Hz whereas, over the same range of magnitudes with continuous random vibration, the resonance frequency decreased from 9. 62 to 7. 81 Hz. The median change in the resonance frequency (between 0. 25 and 1. 0 m s? 2 rms) was 1. 37 Hz with the intermittent random vibration and 1. 71 with the continuous random vibration.

Stimulus pairs of 20 / 70 ms, 50 / 150 ms and 170 / 250 ms were presented at 70 Hz to one group (N = 12, 18 – 38 years), and frequency pairs of 200 / 70 Hz to a second group (N = 10, 19 – 34 years). Recordings were made from subdural electrodes to similar stimuli in a third group (N = 9, 6 – 16 years) undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy. Results: A negative/positive shift was recorded in the response to the deviant stimuli to both frequency and duration increments/decrements. The initial negativity had a mean onset of 90 – 170 ms and the peak latencies of both components were dependent on stimulus duration. The negative component appeared maximal over the hemisphere contralateral to the side of stimulation and anterior to the maximum P 50 /N 70 components. The positive component appears more posterior over the mid parietal region, suggesting a separate generator, possibly in the secondary somatosensory cortex. It was most prominent with frequency deviations. Three intracranial cases showed a negative shift over the frontal areas in response to the deviant stimuli, suggesting a third generator. Conclusion: We propose that these changes in the deviant responses reflect a somatosensory mismatch response with features similar to the aMMN. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{resonance}} frequencies {{in frequency}} response {{functions of the}} human body (e. g. apparent mass and transmissibility) decrease with increasing vibration magnitude. This nonlinear biodynamic response is found with various sitting and standing postures requiring postural control. The present study measured the apparent mass of the body in a relaxed semi-supine posture with two types of longitudinal horizontal vibration (in the z-axis of the semi-supine body) : (i) continuous random excitation (0. 25 – 20 Hz) at five magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 ms? 2 rms); (ii) intermittent random excitation (0. 25 – 20 Hz) alternately at 0. 25 and 1. 0 ms? 2 rms. With continuous random vibration, the dominant primary resonance frequency in the median normalised apparent mass decreased from 3. 7 to 2. 4 Hz as the vibration magnitude increased from 0. 125 to 1. 0 ms? 2 rms. A nonlinear response was apparent in both the horizontal (z-axis) apparent mass and the vertical (x-axis) cross-axis apparent mass. With intermittent random vibration, as the vibration magnitude increased from 0. 25 to 1. 0 ms? 2 rms, the median resonance frequency of the apparent mass decreased from 3. 2 to 2. 5 Hz whereas, with continuous random vibration over the same range of magnitudes, the resonance frequency decreased from 3. 4 to 2. 4 Hz. The median change in the resonance frequency (between 0. 25 and 1. 0 ms? 2 rms) was 0. 6 Hz with the intermittent random vibration and 0. 9 Hz with the continuous random vibration. With <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration,</b> the resonance frequency was higher at the high magnitude and lower at the low magnitude than with continuous vibration at the same magnitudes. The responses were consistent with passive thixotropy being a primary cause of nonlinear biodynamic responses to whole-body vibration, although reflex activity of the muscles may also have an influence...|$|E
40|$|Context: While {{research}} suggests whole body vibration (WBV) positively affects measures of neuromuscular performance in athletes, researchers {{have yet to}} address appropriate and effective vibration protocols. Objective: To identify the acute effects of continuous and intermittent WBV on muscular power and agility in recreationally active females. Design: We used a randomized 3 -period cross-over design to observe the effects of 3 vibration protocols on muscular power and agility. Setting: Sports Science and Medicine Research Laboratory at Florida International University. Patients or Other Participants: Eleven recreationally active female volunteers (age= 24. 4 ± 5. 7 y; ht= 166. 0 ± 10. 3 cm; mass= 59. 7 ± 14. 3 kg). Interventions: Each session, subjects stood on the Galileo WBV platform (Orthometrix, White Plains, NY) and received one of three randomly assigned vibration protocols. Our independent variable was vibration length (continuous, intermittent, or no vibration). Main Outcome Measures: An investigator blinded to the vibration protocol measured muscular power and agility. We measured muscular power with heights of squat and countermovement jumps. We measured agility with the Illinois Agility Test. Results: Continuous WBV significantly increased SJ height from 97. 9 ± 7. 6 cm to 98. 5 ± 7. 5 cm (P= 0. 019, β= 0. 71, η 2 = 0. 07) but not CMJ height [99. 1 ± 7. 4 cm pretest and 99. 4 ± 7. 4 cm posttest (P= 0. 167, β= 0. 27) ] or agility [19. 2 ± 2. 1 s pretest and 19. 0 ± 2. 1 s posttest (P= 0. 232, β= 0. 21) ]. Intermittent WBV significantly enhanced SJ height from 97. 6 ± 7. 7 cm to 98. 5 ± 7. 7 cm (P= 0. 017, β= 0. 71, η 2 = 0. 11) and agility 19. 4 ± 2. 2 s to 19. 0 ± 2. 1 s (P= 0. 001, β= 0. 98, η 2 = 0. 16), but did not effect CMJ height [98. 7 ± 7. 7 cm pretest and 99. 3 ± 7. 3 cm posttest (P= 0. 058, β= 0. 49) ].

40|$|Functional {{ability is}} often {{impaired}} {{for people with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rendering these patients highly sedentary. Additionally, patients with RA often take medication known to negatively affect bone mass. Thus improving functional ability and bone health in this group of patients is important. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) therapy in patients with stable, established RA. Thirty one females with RA were randomly assigned to a control group (CON, n = 15) who continued with their normal activities or a WBV group (n = 16) who underwent a three month WBV therapy intervention, consisting of 15 minutes of <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration,</b> performed twice per week. Patients were assessed at baseline, three months, and three months post intervention for functional ability using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire; for RA disease activity using the Clinical Disease Activity Index, for quality of life using self-report fatigue and pain scores; for physical activity profiles using accelerometry, and for BMD and body composition using DXA. Patients in both groups were matched for all variables at baseline. After the intervention period, functional ability was significantly improved in the WBV group (1. 22 (0. 19) to 0. 92 (0. 19), p = 0. 02). Hip BMD was significantly reduced in the CON group (0. 97 (0. 05) to 0. 84 (0. 05) g. cm- 2, p = 0. 01), while no decreases were seen in the WBV group (1. 01 (0. 05) to 0. 94 (0. 05) g. cm- 2, p = 0. 50). Despite no change in RA disease activity in either group at either follow up, fatigue levels were improved in the WBV group (4. 4 (0. 63) to 1. 1 (0. 65), yet remained unchanged in the CON group at both follow ups (p = 0. 01). Ten minute bouts of light to moderate physical activity were significantly reduced in the CON group after the intervention (2. 8 (0. 61) to 1. 8 (0. 64) bouts per day, p = 0. 01), and were preserved in the WBV group (3. 1 (0. 59) to 3. 0 (0. 61) bouts per day, p = 0. 70). Intermittent WBV shows promise for sustained improvements in functional ability, for attenuating loss of bone mass at the hip, as well as for decreasing fatigue in patients with established RA.

40|$|When {{the human}} body is exposed to {{mechanical}} vibration, the resonance frequencies of the frequency response functions, such as apparent mass and transmissibility, decrease with increasing magnitude of excitation. For the past two decades, this biodynamic ‘nonlinearity’ has been reported with vertical and horizontal excitation of the body {{in a wide variety of}} static sitting and standing postures that require activity from muscles to maintain the stability of the body. There has been speculation, but no experimental evidence, as to the mechanism causing the non-linearity. A review of the literature suggested that either active muscular activity or passive thixotropy of soft tissues is the primary cause of the nonlinearity. The principal objective of this thesis is to identify, and provide experimental evidence of, the primary causal mechanism for the biodynamic nonlinearity. With 0. 5 to 20 Hz broadband random vertical vibration at 0. 25 and 2. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s., the first experiment investigated the effect of voluntary periodic upper-body movement and vibration magnitude on the apparent masses of 14 seated subjects. Some movements of the body, such as ‘back-abdomen bending’, significantly reduced the difference in resonance frequency at the two vibration magnitudes compared with the difference during upright static sitting. Without voluntary periodic movement, the median apparent mass resonance frequency was 5. 47 Hz at the low vibration magnitude and 4. 39 Hz at the high vibration magnitude. With voluntary periodic movement (e. g. back-abdomen bending), the resonance frequency was 4. 69 Hz at the low vibration magnitude and 4. 59 Hz at the high vibration magnitude. It was concluded that voluntary or involuntary muscular activity, or passive thixotropy of soft tissues, or both muscle activity and thixotropy, could explain the reduction in nonlinearity evident during voluntary periodic movement. The effect of shear history and vibration magnitude on the apparent mass was investigated using 12 subjects in a relaxed semi-supine posture assumed to involve less muscle activity than static sitting and standing. The semi-supine subjects were exposed to two types of vertical (in the x-axis of the semi-supine body) and longitudinal horizontal (z-axis) vibration: (i) continuous random vibration (0. 25 – 20 Hz) at five magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.); (ii) intermittent random vibration (0. 25 – 20 Hz) alternating between 1. 0 and 0. 25 ms- 2 r. m. s. With continuous random vibration, the dominant primary resonance frequency in the median normalised apparent mass decreased from 10. 35 to 7. 32 Hz as the magnitude of vertical vibration increased from 0. 125 to 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s., and from 3. 66 to 2. 44 Hz as the magnitude of horizontal vibration increased from 0. 125 to 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s. With the <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration,</b> the resonance frequency was higher at the higher magnitude (1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) and lower at the lower magnitude (0. 25 ms- 2 r. m. s.) than during continuous vibration at the same magnitudes. The response was typical of thixotropy being the primary cause of the nonlinearity. Harmonic distortions in the dynamic force of semi-supine subjects exposed to sinusoidal excitation showed similar dependence on the frequency and magnitude of vibration as previously reported for seated subjects, again suggesting thixotropy as a primary cause of the nonlinearity. In a group of 12 subjects, the apparent mass and transmissibility to the sternum, upper abdomen, and lower abdomen were measured in three supine postures (relaxed semi-supine, lying flat, and constrained semi-supine) during vertical random vibration (0. 25 to 20 Hz) at seven vibration magnitudes (nominally 0. 0313, 0. 0625, 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.). The motion transmission path that included more soft tissues exhibited a greater nonlinear response. The substantial nonlinearities found in transmissibilities to both the sternum and the abdomen of supine subjects, and previously reported for the transmissibilities of seated and standing subjects, imply that soft tissues at the excitation-subject interface contribute to the nonlinearity. It is concluded that the thixotropy of soft tissues, rather than voluntary or involuntary muscular activity, is the primary cause of the biodynamic nonlinearity seen with varying magnitudes of excitation.

40|$|In various {{fields of}} engineering, it is {{important}} to clarify the frictional sliding behavior {{for a wide range of}} scales from microscopic elements to continental plates. Especially, when two solid bodies in contact slide slowly past each other without lubrication, an <b>intermittent</b> <b>vibration</b> phenomenon might be observed. Such rate-dependent frictional behaviors are referred to as stick-slip motions, and such motions can impair the stability of machines and structures. The aim of this study is to propose a rate- and state-dependent constitutive equation for friction and is also to propose a numerical approach for analyzing frictional contact boundary value problems including rate-dependency and anisotropy. The proposed friction model and the numerical approach are referred to herein as the rate-dependent subloading friction model and the rate form approach, respectively. It is widely known that a high friction coefficient is first observed as a sliding between bodies commences, which is called the static friction. Then, the friction coefficient decreases approaching the lowest stationary value, which is called the kinetic friction. Thereafter, if the sliding stops for a while and then it starts again, the friction coefficient recovers and a similar behavior as that in the first sliding is reproduced. In this study, based on the elastoplastic theory, the constitutive model for friction was formulated by extending the conventional friction model so as to describe the above-mentioned rate- and state-dependent frictional sliding behaviors. Fundamental features of proposed model are as follows: 1. The process for the rising of friction coefficient up to the static-friction and the subsequent reduction to the kinetic-friction is formulated in the unified way as the isotropic softening process due to the plastic-sliding based on the concept of subloading surface describing the smooth elastic-plastic transition, although only the rising process has been discussed and it has been described as the isotropic hardening process in the past models. 2. The process for the recovery from the kinetic- to static-friction is formulated as the isotropic hardening due to the creep deformations of surface asperities, while it has been formulated by the irrational equation involving the elapsed time after the stop of sliding. 3. The smooth elastic-plastic transition is depicted and the cyclic sliding behavior can be described by incorporating the concept of the sliding-subloading surface in which the plastic-sliding velocity due to the rate of contact traction inside the sliding-yield surface is described exhibiting the smooth elastic-plastic transition. It is inevitable for the prediction of the loosing of screws, bolts and piles, the smooth stress/strain distribution at contact surface and the increase of traction with slip in wheel rotation on a solid surface for instance. 4. The reduction of friction coefficient with the increase of normal contact traction is described by incorporating the nonlinear sliding surface, i. e., the normal traction dependency of frictional criterion. 5. A judgment whether or not the sliding surface is fulfilled is not required in the loading criterion for the plastic sliding velocity. This advantage is of importance especially for the analysis of cyclic friction phenomena in which a loading and an unloading are repeated. These fundamental properties could be described by the concisely unified formulation in the proposed model. The qualitative property of the present model was examined and its adequacy was verified by the numerical experiments of linear sliding phenomenon. Further, the quantitative predictability of the present model was also be verified by comparing with the various basic test results. Next, I demonstrated the numerical analysis of the stick-slip instability based on the rate-dependent subloading-friction model with Coulomb’s condition. As the first stage of the analysis of general contact boundary value problems, the one-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system was used for examinations. The validity of the present approach was examined by numerical experiments of stick-slip motions under various dynamic characteristics of the system, such as the mass, the spring stiffness and the driving velocity, and various frictional properties. The flexibility of present rate form approach was verified by demonstrating the capability of describing qualitative trends in experimental reports for the stick-slip motion. Moreover, the stick-slip instability was confirmed to have a strong correlation to not only the dynamic conditions of the system, but also the properties related to the variation rate of the friction coefficient and the preliminary microscopic sliding before macroscopic sliding. I also discussed the transition between the stick-slip and the stable sliding modes, and propose simple criteria using the friction coefficient difference and/or the spring elongation. The effectiveness of proposed criterial method was demonstrated using the numerical analysis results when the dynamic conditions change roughly. Finally, the quantitative predictability of the present numerical approach was verified by comparing it to experimental results of one-degree-of-freedom system in the range of the examined conditions. The capability of the rate-dependent friction model was shown not only for various combinations of test materials but also for dynamical conditions, i. e., the stiffness, driving velocity, and mass of system. Then, I formulated an anisotropic friction model with the orthotropy and rotation of the sliding surface based on the elastoplastic theory. This model can also describe preliminary microscopic sliding and rate-dependent frictional response. First, the qualitative property of the present model was examined and its adequacy was verified by numerical experiments on the linear sliding phenomenon. The flexibility of the friction model was shown not only for fundamental anisotropic behavior but also for rate-dependency. Furthermore, the quantitative predictability of the present model was verified by comparing it with the basic experimental results in the range of the examined conditions. To analyze practical contact boundary value problems, the rate-dependent friction model was then implemented in the FEM using the user subroutine of the commercial software package. A typical FE analysis of rate-dependent frictional sliding behavior, including stick-slip motion, was conducted to examine the effect of Young's modulus, the geometric properties, and boundary conditions on the numerical results. The present FE approach using the rate-dependent friction model considers not only the properties of friction and materials but also variations in boundary conditions. In addition, the responses of the friction force and displacement of a target body but also the stress and strain states in bulk can be grasped. Moreover, the anisotropic friction model was implemented to FEM by using the user subroutine of the commercial software package. Then, the typical FE analysis was carried out and the effect of parameters prescribing the anisotropy on the numerical results was examined. From the results of the FE analyses, I suggest that the present FE approach is applicable to the practical contact boundary value problems, including the stick-slip motion, anisotropic frictional sliding and the microscopic sliding. In the present FE analyses, however, the simple FE model that includes the rigid body was adopted. Examinations of stick-slip motion should be investigated using more general FE models, involving nonlinear material property such as plasticity and hyperelasticity and several deformed bodies having complex geometries in frictional contact. It should be noted that further discussion on the application of CAE is necessary because frictional sliding sometimes represents system and environmental dependencies. However, systematic investigations using CAE with CAD are useful for design, control, and maintenance of assembled bodies and tribological conditions at contact surfaces, to suppress stick-slip motion...|$|E
