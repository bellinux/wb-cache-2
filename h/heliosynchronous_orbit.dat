50|$|A Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO, {{also called}} a <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbit)</b> is a near polar orbit around Earth (also called geocentric orbit) {{in which the}} {{satellite}} passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites. More technically, it is an orbit arranged {{in such a way}} that it precesses once a year. The surface illumination angle will be nearly the same every time that the satellite is overhead. This consistent lighting is a useful characteristic for satellites that image the Earth's surface in visible or infrared wavelengths (e.g. weather and spy satellites) and for other remote sensing satellites (e.g. those carrying ocean and atmospheric remote sensing instruments that require sunlight). For example, a satellite in sun-synchronous orbit might ascend across the equator twelve times a day each time at approximately 15:00 mean local time. This is achieved by having the osculating orbital plane precess (rotate) approximately one degree each day with respect to the celestial sphere, eastward, to keep pace with the Earth's movement around the Sun.|$|E
40|$|A gradiometric approach, {{rather than}} the more {{complicated}} satellite to satellite tracking, is proposed for studying anomalies in the gravitational fields of the Earth and, possibly, other telluric bodies. The first analyses of a gradiometer based on four of ONERA's CACTUS or SUPERCACTUS accelerometers are summarized. it is shown that the obstacles to achieving the required accuracy are not insuperable. The device will be carried in a 1000 kg lens shaped satellite in a <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> 200 to 300 km in altitude. The first launching is planned {{for the end of}} 1987...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{opportunity}} of increase of a satellite orbit altitude by solar pressure is demonstrated. The satellite is equipped by mirrors and a damper. Its flight is free drift in the gravity gradient mode - the satellite longitudinal axis is permanently directed along local vertical. The motion about that axis is steady-state oscillations caused by solar pressures and damping. Mirrors positions {{and the initial}} satellite <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> are so, that transverse component of solar pressure force is positive, and orbit semimajor axis is permanently increased. The orbit eccentricity does not exceed its initial value. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Evolution of <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> of an {{artificial}} satellite-balloon under Earth's gravitational field uncentrality and solar pressure is investigated. The satellite {{is considered to}} be a mirror-like sphere. Its mass and radius are chosen so that orbit perturbations due to gravitational field uncentrality and solar pressure have the same order. First the averaged equations of satellite motion in osculating elements is analyzed. Their solutions are constructed to describe <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbits.</b> The solutions prove to be near stationary ones. Then <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> are approximated by periodic solutions of specially constructed autonomous differential system. At last satellite motion equation are integrated numerically by multirevolution method with initial conditions of found periodic orbits. The orbits are found which remain heliosynchronous ones for some years. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the methods}} and {{techniques}} have been greatly improved since the late nineteenth century, the precision on the measurement of the gravitational constant G does not exceed 1 part in 10 3. Intrinsic variations of G caused by the geomagnetic field may explain the observed dispersion of the laboratory measurements. This involves a coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism (hereafter GE coupling) and a dependance of the effective G constant with latitude and longitude. In this paper I analyse {{the effects of this}} coupling in the framework of classical space mechanics by focusing on <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbits.</b> The predictions are found inconsistent with experimental data from the SPOT mission...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePICARD is a Satellite {{dedicated}} to the simultaneous measurement of the absolute total and spectral solar irradiance, the diameter and solar shape and the Sun's interior probed by helioseismology method. Its objectives are {{the study of the}} origin of the solar variability and the study of the relations between the Sun and the Earth's climate. PICARD was launched on June 15, 2010. The Satellite was placed into the <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> of 735 km with inclination of 98. 28 degrees. The payload consists in two absolute radiometers measuring the TSI (Total Solar Irradiance) and an imaging telescope to determine the solar diameter, the limb shape and asphericity. SOVAP (SOlar VAriability Picard) is an experiment developed by the Belgian STCE (Solar Terrestrial Center of Excellence) with a contribution of the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) composed of an absolute radiometer provided by the RMIB (Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium) to measure the TSI and a bolometer provided by the ROB (Royal Observatory of Belgium). The continuous observation of the solar irradiance at the highest possible precision and accuracy is an important objective of the Earth climate change. This requires: high quality metrology in the space environment. In this article, we describe the SOVAP instrument, its performances and uncertainties on the measurements of the TSI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{results of}} the {{observations}} of auroral oval boundaries by satellite METEOR 3 M are presented. The satellite was lunched December 10, 2002 to the polar <b>heliosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> with the altitude of 1018 km and the inclination of 99. 63 â—¦. The satellite mission includes the observations of the Earths resources, {{the control of the}} conditions in the near the Earth environment, meteorological and heliogeophysical parameters. The main goals of the mission are the forecast of the solar flare activity, control and prediction of the Earths radiation and the state of the Earths magnetic field, prediction of the conditions for the radio wave propagation, diagnostic and the control of the conditions in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The electrostatic analyser MSGI- 5 EI is used for the analysis of the variations of the fluxes of auroral protons and electrons. It measures the electron and proton fluxes within the energy range from 0. 1 to 10 keV in 50 energetic channels and the integral flux of electrons with energies> 40 keV. Determined by MSGI- 5 EI positions of the auroral oval boundaries are compared with the predictions of OVATION model. It is shown that due to auroral substorm activity the difference between observed and predicted by OVATION positions can exceed 5 degrees in latitude.
