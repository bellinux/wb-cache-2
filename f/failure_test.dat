40|$|The paper {{describes}} 120 uniaxial tensile <b>failure</b> <b>tests</b> on pultruded glass-fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) single-bolt single-lap joints. For each joint, the lap width to bolt/hole {{diameter ratio}} (W/D) and bolt diameter (D) were four and 10 mm, respectively. Five end distance to bolt/hole diameter ratios (E/D) and four test temperatures were investigated. The joints were sub-divided into 20 groups – {{one for each}} E/D and temperature combination – and each group comprised six nominally identical joints. In addition to the joint tests, a number of uniaxial tensile <b>failure</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on the virgin GFRP plate of the joints' laps.

In addition, knock-down factors, which express the ultimate stresses of the joints, relative to the ultimate stress of the virgin GFRP plate, were derived. The knock-down factors were compared with those obtained earlier for single-bolt double-lap joints. The factors may be useful for the preliminary design of single-bolt tension joints...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Prognostic health {{management}} (PHM) of electronic systems presents challenges traditionally viewed as either insurmountable or otherwise {{not worth the}} cost of pursuit. Recent changes in weapons platform acquisition and support requirements has spurred renewed interest in electronics PHM, revealing possible applications, accessible data sources, and previously unexplored predictive techniques. The approach, development, and validation of electronic prognostics for a radio frequency (RF) system are discussed in this paper. Conventional PHM concepts are refined to develop a three-tier failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). The proposed method identifies prognostic features by performing device, circuit, and system-level modeling. Accelerated <b>failure</b> <b>testing</b> validates the identified diagnostic features. The results of the accelerated <b>failure</b> <b>tests</b> accurately predict the remaining useful life of a COTS GPS receiver to within ± 5 thermal cycles.

40|$|The {{financial}} cost of using human tissues in biomedical testing and surgical reconstruction {{is predicted to}} increase {{at a rate that}} is disproportionately greater than other materials used in biomechanical testing. Our first hypothesis is that cadaveric proximal humeri that had undergone monotonic <b>failure</b> <b>testing</b> of simulated rota-tor cuff repairs would not differ in ultimate fracture loads or in energy absorbed to fracture when compared to controls (i. e., bones without cuff repairs). Our second hypothesis is that there can be substantial cost savings if these cadaveric proximal humeri, with simulated cuff repairs, can be re-used for fracture testing. Results of frac-ture tests (conducted in a backwards fall configuration) and cost analysis support both hypotheses. Hence, the bones that had undergone monotonic <b>failure</b> <b>tests</b> of various rotator cuff repair techniques can be re-used in frac-ture tests because their load-carrying capacity is not significantly reduced.
