50|$|Current best {{practice}} for stability of new survey markers {{is to use}} a punch mark stamped in the top of a metal rod driven deep into the ground, surrounded by a grease filled sleeve, and covered with a <b>hinged</b> <b>cap</b> set in concrete.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more common}} IP44 variant {{features}} a spring-loaded <b>hinged</b> <b>cap</b> over the socket. When a plug is inserted, the cap hooks over a lug on the plug and retains it in place. Fixed connectors are usually installed angled downward to prevent water entering.|$|R
5000|$|The {{oil hole}} or grease hole was usually {{covered with a}} cap of some kind to keep dirt out, from a simple plug or screw to a {{spring-loaded}} <b>hinged</b> <b>cap.</b> Sometimes a cup was mounted, acting as a small reservoir. The standard mode of maintenance was to have each machine's operator, or a dedicated oiler, go around adding a small squirt of oil or blob of grease {{to each and every}} hole on a frequent basis.|$|R
50|$|In {{clinical}} medicine, sterile {{test tubes}} with air removed, called vacutainers, {{are used to}} collect and hold samples of physiological fluids such as blood, urine, pus, and synovial fluid. These tubes are commonly sealed with a rubber stopper, and often have a specific additive placed in the tube with the stopper color indicating the additive. For example, a blue top tube is a 5 ml test tube containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant, used to collect blood for coagulation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing. Small vials used in medicine may have a snap-top (also called a <b>hinge</b> <b>cap)</b> moulded {{as part of the}} vial.|$|R
5000|$|Disposable plastic [...] "microlitre tubes" [...] of 0.5ml to 2ml are {{commonly}} used in microcentrifuges. They are molded from a flexible transparent plastic similar to polythene, are semi-conical in shape, with integral, <b>hinged</b> sealing <b>caps.</b>|$|R
40|$|Shows Yorktown Virginia and the York River on conical powder horn. Relief {{shown by}} hachures. Manuscript: Engraved bovine horn, shellacked. Has wooden pouring spout {{inserted}} at narrow end and wooden <b>hinged</b> <b>cap</b> inserted at wide end. Inscriptions: James Downae his horn, made by E. Crosby - 1781, A: Bowery, A: Lion, The: Elem Tree, and Mare Maid at: Sea. Includes pictorial represenations of the Moore House and gardens where Cornwallis's surrender took place, several vessels, a conventional flowering vine, {{and a school}} of fish. A listing of this horn is in "American Engraved Powder Horns", N. Y., no. 285, 1945, p. 51. Housed on wooden base covered by clear plastic box casement screwed-on to base at bottom. DL...|$|R
25|$|Safety {{syringes}} {{help reduce}} occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One {{of the most}} recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a <b>hinging</b> <b>cap</b> that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the needle remover. Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separate from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices as they involved in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.|$|R
40|$|The {{thin-walled}} {{spherical cap}} loaded by an external pressure generally performs a nonlinear behavior. This phenomenon {{is not as}} significant in case of the <b>hinged</b> <b>cap</b> with restricted movements in the radial direction. The linear analysis of the critical load shows that stability of the cylindrical cap is practically identical to stability of the cylindrical shell. In addition, the non-linear analysis further leads {{to the conclusion that}} the ratio between critical pressure and limit pressure might be expressed by formula pCR/pLE= 1. 6. Based on these facts, the limit elastic pressure pLE of an ideal cap can be derived from a critical external pressure pCRA of the spherical shell pLEpCR/ 1. 6 pCRA/ 1. 6. Conversion of pLE to the limit pressure of a real spherical cap in elastic-plastic area pu might be performed by means of the procedure provided by ECCS [3]. The influence of initial imperfections on stability of the spherical cap is a subject of further research...|$|R

50|$|The first C-87 {{prototype}} was 41-11608. The design included various modifications, {{including the}} elimination of gun turrets and other armament along with the installation of a strengthened cargo floor, including a floor running through the bomb bay. The glassed-in bombardier compartment of the B-24 {{was replaced by a}} <b>hinged</b> metal <b>cap</b> to allow front cargo loading. A cargo door was added to the port side of the fuselage, just forward of the tail, and a row of windows was fitted along the sides of the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The effigy of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, {{show how}} 15th century Italian-style sabatons {{would have been}} worn. These consist of a toe cap, four {{articulated}} lames, a foot plate and ankle plate, and a <b>hinged</b> heel <b>cap,</b> joined with buckled straps. Although the spurs are missing from the effigy, remains of rivet holes and staples may represent {{the way that the}} spurs would have been directly attached to the heel cap of the sabaton, rather than being strapped on afterwards.|$|R
40|$|Untitled {{pictorial}} {{depiction of}} rivers and fortifications on conical powder horn. Present title devised by cataloguer. Manuscript: Black/brown inks on bovine horn, shellacked. Has pewter pouring spout attached at narrow end and <b>hinged</b> pewter <b>cap</b> attached at wide end. Housed on wooden base covered by clear plastic box casement screwed-on to base at bottom. Photograph of this horn is in "Journal {{of the military}} service institutions of the United States", N. Y., v. 33, 1903, p. 250; see also "The world encompassed", item 258, for additional information. Includes pictorial depiction of the rivers, names of riverside forts and towns (including New York, Albany, Niagara, and Lake Champlain), pictorial representation of houses, view of "New York" at wide end, and British coat-of-arms with motto "Dieu et Mon Droit"...|$|R
50|$|Growlers are {{generally}} {{made of glass}} and have either a screw-on <b>cap</b> or a <b>hinged</b> porcelain gasket <b>cap,</b> which can maintain freshness {{for a week or}} more. A properly sealed growler will hold carbonation indefinitely and store beer like any other sanitized bottle. Some growler caps are equipped with valves to allow replacement of carbon dioxide lost while racking. The modern glass growler was first introduced by Charlie and Ernie Otto of Otto Brothers' Brewing Company in Wilson, Wyoming in 1989.|$|R
