40|$|Most-favored-nation treatment, i. e., nondiscrimination among trading partners, is a {{fundamental}} principle of the GATT WTO system. The WTO Agreement on Safeguards has thus been seen as encouraging use of a preferred form of contingent protection relative to antidumping and other inherently discriminatory measures. In practice, however, safeguard protection may also incorporate discriminatory elements. This paper focuses on three ways that policies conforming to the Agreement on Safeguards may nonetheless discriminate explicitly or implicitly among trading partners. First, {{the form of the}} safeguard policy matters: quantitative restrictions discriminate among foreign suppliers by preserving historical market shares more than a safeguard implemented as a tariff. Second, safeguard measures discriminate against faster-growing exporters and new entrants in import markets. Third, <b>formal</b> <b>exemptions</b> for partners in preferential trade agreements and for small developing-country suppliers allow these countries to gain market share at the expense of non-exempted exporters. We provide evidence of these discriminatory effects in actual cases of safeguard protection. ...|$|R

We also examine the effect of <b>formal</b> <b>exemptions</b> to the policy on student proficiency in reading two years later. In an evaluation of retention for third-grade students over time with a logit model we find that Florida's policy has increased the probability that minority students are retained {{to a greater extent than}} white students. Contrary to previous research, this differential retention occurs after controlling for student academic proficiency. However, in an evaluation of the academic performance of students who were in the first class subject to the retention policy, we find that retained students outperform students who received an exemption from the policy in reading two years after baseline, indicating that on average exemptions have not been granted to those individuals who would benefit from promotion.

40|$|The Generalised System of Preferences, {{known as}} GSP, {{is defined as}} “a <b>formal</b> system of <b>exemption</b> from the more general rules applied by the European Union on its trade {{relationship}} with third countries”. Specifically, it is a system of exemption from the GATT MFN clause that obligates WTO member countries to treat the imports of all other WTO member countries not worse than they treat the imports of their "most favoured" trading partner. The objective of GSP is to assist developing countries on poverty reduction, by helping them to generate revenue through international trade. In EU law, the GSP traditionally comes under the Common Commercial Policy, Article 133 of the EC Treaty as amended by Article 188 C of the Treaty of Lisbon. Implementation and utilisation of GSP should not solely be a duty of the preference-granting country but of the beneficiary country as well. Strengthening trade facilitation between the preference-granting country and the beneficiary country is deemed as an important factor to achieve {{the purpose of the}} GSP. Implementation of the GSP is considered as a multi complex task, associated with international trade law, international taxation law (tariffs, custom duties and administrative procedures), trade facilitations, capacity building of trade institutions, import export procedures, good governance and information technology (e-governance, e-trade, and e-statistics). All these factors are interrelated and mutually supported to optimise the utilisation of GSP by the beneficiary country...|$|R

This paper catalogues {{a range of}} factors that may account for Armenia''s stubbornly for tax collection by benchmarking Armenia''s tax-to-GDP against some comparator countries and conducting an extensive econometric study of the main determinants of tax collection. We find empirical support for {{the hypothesis that the}} persistence of Armenia''s low tax-GDP ratio can be traced to persistence of weak institutions and a large shadow economy. The gap between the potential and actual tax collection in Armenia could be as high as 6 Â½ percent of GDP. We conclude with some policy recommendations that, if adopted, can boost revenue buoyancy.

40|$|EMBA Project ReportEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This {{study was}} {{chartered}} {{with the purpose}} of evaluating the short- and long-term effects of using Test Pilots to fill Individual Augmentation (IA) billets in the support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). These aviation billets are essential to the test and acquisition workforce to ensure that viable new weapon systems are introduced to the Fleet in a timely manner, especially since test project workloads in Naval Aviation continue to rise. Our study primarily examined helicopter programs currently delayed or at risk of going over budget due to reduced manning, as well as an analysis of the return on investment for Test Pilots when they are assigned an IA. The following key observations were made during our research: 1) Each test squadron has determined their minimum, or red-line, level of manning by analyzing current and future workload requirements. 2) Test Pilots are expensive to train and the rate of return on investment is greatly diminished if their payback tour is interrupted by an IA. 3) The Navy can improve its “rip to fill” way of filling IA billets. As a result, we have provided the following recommendations on how Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIR) can better manage the process in which IA billets are filled: 1) Seek <b>formal</b> <b>exemption</b> of project officer billets from IAs. 2) Increase the manning level for naval test squadrons. 3) Make IAs more predictable. 4) Assign naval test squadrons specific recurring IA billets. 5) Internally (voluntarily) exempt project officers from IAs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the main {{distinctions between the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and regional trading arrangements (RTAs), noting that under the former, liberalization of trade {{is based on the}} most favored nation (MFN) principle, while under the latter, there is a departure from that principle leading to preferential trade liberalization. Properly instituted RTAs must confirm to Article XXIV of the GATT. But the article has not been followed by nearly all the countries that have created regional integration schemes. This has meant that while the integration schemes for the 1980 s and 1990 s have not lead to increased protection against third countries, there has not been across the board trade liberalization among the groups forming RTAs. Developing countries have sought and received <b>formal</b> <b>exemption</b> from Article XXIV through the enabling clause at the Tokyo round. Departures from the MFN principle and Article XXIV have meant that there is potential for greater trade diversion with the proliferation of RTAs. The paper finds that there is no general tendency for RTAs to become increasingly integrated entities. The European Economic Community has been an exception, where greater integration has taken place with trade within the region growing steadily. In contrast, the Association of South East Asian nations (ASEAN) has been a loose agreement. Nevertheless, trade among the group has increased rapidly on the basis of multilateral trade liberalization undertaken by the countries in the group. Latin American countries also attempted to create RTAs in the 1960 s based on their national protectionist policies which led to reduced trade within the regional as well {{as the rest of the}} world. RTAs carry with them the danger of trade diversion and that there is no inexorable logic that RTAs would lead to increased integration with lower protection. Countries venturing into RTAs must attempt to achieve GATT-plus trade liberalization, implying that RTAs are used to have greater trade liberalization than what could be achieved through GATT based trade. The lessons for Latin America to avoid unnecessary costs of these RTAs arising from trade diversion are to have low protection in the first place, to have open RTAs so that there is easy accession of new partners, to continue with the trade liberalization on a MFN basis, to avoid free trade areas (in preference for common markets) which could lead to new barriers through rules of origin and to coordinate regulatory and competition policies as well as to remove barriers arising from transport, ports and communications. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Though the {{practical}} and philosophical importance of teaching educational skills to students of medicine {{has been widely}} acknowledged, the principle accrediting bodies of resident and medical student training in the U. S. do not require medical schools to offer formal training in how to teach. Both recognize resident teaching in their competencies: the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires all residencies to have a formal program in teaching; the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) mandates that all residents and faculty charged with teaching medical students “be prepared for their roles in teaching and assessment. ” But many medical students begin to teach their peers and junior students during medical school. In a 2008 poll of 130 accredited, M. D. -granting US medical schools, all 99 responding institutions reported using their students as teachers, though less than half offered formal curriculum in teaching, and among them, the majority of curricula reached {{only a fraction of}} graduating students, usually toward the end of their final year. In addition, students teach patients from early in their training, and formal teaching skills may support this activity and thus enhance patient care. Despite favorable argument for the value and efficacy of such programs in the literature of the past three decades, U. S. medical education has largely deferred the formal instruction of educational skills to the postgraduate level. UMMS offers its students a patchwork of peer and patient educational opportunities without presently offering formal background in evidence-based teaching skills. While this type of scattered elective experience can be immensely valuable to students, further formalization may better prepare UMMS students to satisfy the institutional competency of “assuming the role of teacher when appropriate. ” The introduction and refinement of teaching skills may in turn benefit the quality of the educational program, the wider institutional and interprofessional learning environment, and patient care and health education across the Commonwealth. Many UMMS students stay on to become teaching residents and faculty, and remain – or later return – to the state to practice and teach. In a demanding era of expanding biomedical complexity, reduced resident duty hours, collaborative health care delivery, and patient-centered decision-making, offering or requiring relevant educational training to our clinicians early in their development may provide substantial benefit to our health care system and patients. Objectives: The objectives of this project were: 1) Quantify the existence of peer and patient teaching opportunities within and outside the formal UMMS educational program {{at all levels of the}} curriculum; 2) Describe the receptiveness of faculty and students toward institution of a formal program preparing all UMMS students to teach both peers and patients in a variety of settings common to residency and clinical practice in any field; 3) Report arguments for and against such a program from the vantage of faculty and students, including barriers specific to UMMS; and 4) Propose a blueprint for such a program based on the opportunities already offered, new ideas from faculty and students, and models culled both from the educational literature and from other institutions. Methods: Short online surveys were sent to course-directing faculty and to all currently enrolled UMMS students in years 1 - 4 of the curriculum using a combination of Likert-scale and open response items. Per the IRB, the survey did not require a <b>formal</b> approval or <b>exemption</b> process. Results: FACULTY: 58 % of all course and clerkship faculty responded; 48 % stated that their courses already offer some opportunity in peer and patient teaching, though only in select cases do students receive formal training in educational methodology and thorough feedback on their performance as educators. Often, these programs do not apply to all students. 50 % of faculty were most (4 - 5 on a 5 -point scale) “interested in incorporating a formal student teaching component into [their] course,” and when asked whether they had particular “ideas for how students might practice their peer education or patient teaching skills within [their] course?” 67 % answered “yes,” posing a variety of possibilities for peer and patient education, both familiar and innovative. Students: 143 responses (28 %) were received from currently enrolled students, constituting 17. 6 % of MS 1, 25. 4 % of MS 2, 26. 9 % of MS 3, and 39. 6 % of MS 4 and extending students. Self-reported comfort as a peer and patient educator increased modestly over class years, when expressed as an average of responses on a 1 - 5 Likert scale (Peer: MS 1 3. 00, MS 2 3. 13, MS 3 3. 13, MS 4 3. 47, MS 4 extended 3. 57; Patient: MS 1 3. 32, MS 2 3. 75, MS 3 3. 88, MS 4 3. 95, MS 4 extended 4. 21). 30. 8 % of students identified some opportunity to teach within the formal curriculum; outside the formal curriculum, 28. 7 % of students listed no opportunity, while the rest listed different amounts and frequencies ranging from daily to once a year, depending on how they defined teaching. 75. 6 % of responding students emphasized the value of “learn[ing] formal teaching skills - small group, lecture, bedside - in medical school” and 77. 7 % emphasized the value of opportunities to “practice formal teaching skills” (4 - 5 on a 5 -point scale). 41. 3 % indicated that they would “actively create time to learn, practice, and refine these skills prior to residency if it were not included in the formal academic program. ” Conclusion: Though teaching opportunities exist at UMMS, most are not formalized, and those offered reach less than a third of students. While comfort with peer and patient teaching increases across the educational continuum from first to fourth year, the increase remains modest. 84 % of graduates report that they felt prepared to teach as interns based on their 2011 AAMC graduation questionnaire responses, but given the importance of teaching in many aspects of medicine, we see room for improvement. Overall, there is a strong call both from both faculty and students at UMMS for formally incorporating educational training into the curriculum, with a particular focus on teaching practice. Free-response items emphasized dramatic differences in student and faculty understanding and recognition of teaching as a professional role among both peers and patients. These discrepancies highlight a need for increased awareness of the teaching responsibilities of medical students, and of the possibilities that are open to them during medical school. A structured approach to medical student teaching skills across the continuum of undergraduate medical education is the first step in this process...|$|R
