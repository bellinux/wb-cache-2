Due to environmental concerns, most industries are required to operate some kind of dust collection system to control particulate emissions. These systems include inertial collectors (cyclonic separators), fabric filter collectors (baghouses), wet scrubbers, and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators.</b>|$|E

Lowering dust losses in flue gases has more than 60 years of practice.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash is {{captured}} and {{removed from the}} flue gas by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars.|$|E
25|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} {{pass the}} dirty air through a scrubbing solution (usually {{a mixture of}} water and other compounds) allowing the particulate to attach to the liquid molecules. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> electrically charge the dirty air as it passes through. The now charged air then passes by large electrostatic plates which attract the charged particle in the airstream collecting them and leaving the now clean air to be exhausted or recirculated.|$|E

40|$|A moving {{electrode}} type <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator,</b> {{which is}} equipped with brushes to remove dust from the moving collecting plate surface, is effective in collecting high resistivity dust. The collecting plate of the moving electrode type <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> is divided into strips, coupled with chains and moved by driving wheels. In Japan, 51 units of the moving electrode type <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> have been manufactured since 1979. For the moving electrode type <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator,</b> an important factor {{is to improve the}} reliability of the moving component parts such as the movable collecting plate element, the rotating brush, the chain and so on. These parts are refined and the life spans of these parts are evaluated by actual operation results. There is an upper limit of inlet dust density for the moving electrode type <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator.</b> Fixed electrode sections are commonly combined as a pre-collector to reduce dust density at a moving electrode section. A collection performance equation has been studied using the combination of fixed electrode sections and a moving electrode section. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{station was}} fitted with <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> (ESP) {{to reduce the}} station's {{particulate}} emissions. In the late 1980s the station's units were fitted with sulfur trioxide (SO3) conditioning equipment to lower the fly ash's electrical resistivity. This was to ensure the station maintained allowable particulate emissions. Between 1989 and 1994 the station's ESPs were given a major refurbishment. This meant that the SO3 conditioning equipment {{did not need to}} be operated as frequently to maintain the allowed level of particulate emissions. This was beneficial as SO3 is hazardous.|$|E
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators.</b> Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E

25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E

The view at the time was that the remaining dust that would leave the chimney's would not have caused [...] "any appreciable pollution", and the waste gases, consisting of carbon dioxide, were thought not to [...] "cause any injury or harm to the inhabitants of the city, to buildings or to vegetation." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{iron making}} blast furnace itself is {{built in the}} form of a tall structure, lined with {{refractory}} brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size as melting starts to occur. Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four [...] "uptakes" [...] allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while [...] "bleeder valves" [...] protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the [...] "dust catcher" [...] and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a venturi scrubber and/or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that ionic wind {{is due to the}} flow of many ions in the corona {{discharging}} field.

In this experiment, the ionic wind phenomena in the model of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> was photographed by the schlieren method. The model-electrostatic precipitator was composed of one discharging wire and one plate as the collecting electrode.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{simulate}} numerically the flow through perforated plates in <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> and compare the obtained results with the one obtained experimentally. Better flow distribution in the collection chamber of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> was obtained with two perforated plates of porosity 50 %, one plate located just upstream of the diffuser exit and other at some distance downstream of the diffuser entrance. Perforated plates of higher porosity do not have the capability to spread out the flow, whereas plates of low porosity lead to excessive pressure drop. Mean velocity of flow at diffuser exit obtained numerically was 4. 5 m sec - 1 while velocity obtained experimentally at diffuser exit was 3. 75 m sec - 1, with about 16 % deviation. Numerical investigation of flow through perforated plates and velocity distribution in the collection chamber of an <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitator</b> was carried out using a Computational Fluid Dynamics code namely FLUENT. The effect of porosity and perforated plate location on flow uniformity and turbulence were studied and the results were compared with experimental data...|$|R
500|$|The South station {{had five}} {{generating}} sets and the North station had four. Each generating set had a bunker for 1,250 tonnes of coal, fed by a conveyor from the coal store. This conveyor belt system {{was built by}} E.N. Mackley & Co, Gateshead. Each bunker fed coal into a pulveriser, manufactured by Raymond. From here it was fed into a boiler in powder form and burned. All of the boilers were suspended from the boiler houses' steel frames, and were made by Clarke Chapman Group Ltd, Gateshead. The boilers were forged in Sheffield, {{the first of the}} nine arriving at Stella South in 1953. At 62tonnes, the boilers were at the time the largest ever made in the UK. The boilers were of the radiant-heat type, comprising a water-cooled combustion chamber, controlled-type superheater and an economiser. Each of the boilers had an evaporation rating of 550 kL/h, a steam pressure of 950 psi and a steam temperature of 925°F. Each boiler was equipped with two forced and two induced Howden fans, twenty-two electrically operated Clyde soot blowers, an automatic control system made by Bailey and Sturtevant <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators.</b> [...] Each station was designed to burn 2,000 tonnes of bituminous coal a day.|$|E

2500|$|Fly ash, {{also known}} as [...] "pulverised fuel ash" [...] in the United Kingdom, is a coal {{combustion}} product composed of fine particles that are driven out of the boiler with the flue gases.

In modern coal-fired power plants, fly ash is generally captured by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> or other particle filtration equipment before the flue gases reach the chimneys. Together with bottom ash removed from the bottom of the boiler, it is known as coal ash. Depending upon the source and makeup of the coal being burned, the components of fly ash vary considerably, but all fly ash includes substantial amounts of silicon dioxide (SiO2) (both amorphous and crystalline), aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and calcium oxide (CaO), the main mineral compounds in [...] coal-bearing rock strata.|$|E
