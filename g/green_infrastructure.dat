40|$|Implementation of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is an {{effective}} option for mitigating the impacts of increasing urbanization on stormwater runo ff. In this study, we evaluated the runoff reduction effectiveness under various setting sizes of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructures</b> using a process-based stormwater runoff model. The model was validated with field data from a typical community in Beijing and proved to be accurate in estimating stormwater runoff under larger rain events. The pervious area percentage and soil hydraulic properties were key parameters influencing stormwater runoff. The four types of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> including <b>green</b> area expanding, concave green space, storage pond and porous brick pavement were effective in reducing stormwater runoff, but single facility except the storage pond could not fully control runoff of 5 -year recurrence storm. With integrated <b>green</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> runoff of 5 -year recurrence storm could be 100 % reduced by expanding the pervious area percentage to over 50 %, or increase storage pond volume to over 1800 m(3), whereas a maximum runoff reduction of 95 % could be achieved when the green land was reformed to concave with a depth of 4 cm, or 50 % of the impervious area was replaced with porous brick pavement with a storage capacity of 8 mm. The combination of <b>green</b> <b>infrastructures</b> with proper setting sizes is necessary for optimal control of stormwater runoff management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by floodwalls and levees, or designed to withstand temporary inundation.

Modification in climate may intensify already existing issues concerning stormwater management (due to impervious area) and water supply (due to the increase of the population). In this context, water use efficiency and best water management practices are key-issues in the urban environment already stressed. Blue and <b>green</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are nature-based solutions that provide synergy of the blue and green systems to provide multifunctional solutions and multiple benefits: increased amenity, urban heat island improvement, biodiversity, reduced energy requirements [...] . They are particularly efficient to reduce {{the potential impact of}} new and existing developments with respect to stormwater and/or water supply issues. The Multi-Hydro distributed rainfall-runoff model represents an adapted tool to manage the impacts of such infrastructures at the urban basin scale. It is a numerical platform that makes several models interact, each of them representing a specific portion of the water cycle in an urban environment: surface runoff and infiltration depending on a land use classification, sub-surface processes and sewer network drainage. Multi-Hydro is still being developed at the Ecole des Ponts (open access from [URL] {{to take into account the}} wide complexity of urban environments.

It was particularly focused on their ability to fulfil regulation rules established by local stormwater managers in order to connect the parcel to the sewer network.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{strategic}} role that urban biodiversity and ecosystem services management, natural infrastructure and adaptive governance approaches {{can play in}} making our economies and societies more resilient and in linking human societies and the natural environment. Resilience - a concept that entered the debate on urban governance - means the ability of urban systems, considered as linear-systems, to react to external disturbances by returning to some socio-ecological equilibrium steadystate by overcoming a crisis period (Gunderson & al. 2010, Newman & al. 2009).

40|$|In {{order to}} develop climate {{resilient}} urban areas and reduce emissions, several opportunities exist starting from conscious planning and design of green (and blue) spaces in these landscapes. <b>Green</b> urban <b>infrastructure</b> has been regarded as beneficial, e. g. by balancing water flows, providing thermal comfort. This article explores the existing evidence on the contribution of green spaces to climate change mitigation and adaptation services. We suggest a framework of ecosystem services for systematizing the evidence on the provision of bio-physical benefits (e. g. CO 2 sequestration) {{as well as social}} and psychological benefits (e. g. improved health) that enable coping with (adaptation) or reducing the adverse effects (mitigation) of climate change. The multi-functional and multi-scale nature of <b>green</b> urban <b>infrastructure</b> complicates the categorization of services and benefits, since in reality the interactions between various benefits are manifold and appear on different scales. We will show the relevance of the benefits from <b>green</b> urban <b>infrastructures</b> on three spatial scales (i. e. city, neighborhood and site specific scales). We will further report on co-benefits and trade-offs between the various services indicating that a benefit could in turn be detrimental in relation to other functions.
