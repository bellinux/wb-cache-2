5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> human adults and infants, {{who engage in}} this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, {{and in the case}} of the adult, speech.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, and this <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous {{estimates of the}} tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events {{along the coast of}} Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative {{to the size of the}} tsunami that followed.|$|E

50|$|During the War in Bosnia, {{inhabitants}} {{along the}} mouth of the river were expelled and murdered. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the villages of Vrbanjci, Večići, Hrvaćani, Garići, and Rujevica.|$|R
50|$|Several Red Army rifle {{divisions}} were insufficiently {{prepared to}} perform an assault of a multi-lined defense setup. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> reserve divisions, whose training was not always properly supervised.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} {{areas are}} the poorest. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> Topaana, in Čair municipality, and for Šuto Orizari municipality, {{which are the}} two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from a generation to the other. Topaana, located close to the Old Bazaar, is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood {{in the beginning of}} the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Šuto Orizari, located on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with Romani as its local official language. It was developed after the 1963 earthquake to accommodate Roma who had lost their house.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark stripes {{on the sides of}} its head that extend back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.|$|E
25|$|Aside from sun {{exposure}} and hormones, hyperpigmentation {{can be caused}} by skin damage, such as remnants of blemishes, wounds or rashes. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> those with darker skin tones.|$|E

25|$|Coins {{were another}} support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic {{caliphate}} reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing visual depiction with words. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally the coins were inscribed with {{quotes from the}} Qur'an.|$|R
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of fish vertebrae, jaw bones, teeth, and other informative skeletal elements improves prey identification and quantification over otolith analysis alone. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> fish species with fragile otoliths, but other distinctive bones, such as Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).|$|E
25|$|Different taekwondo {{styles and}} {{associations}} (ATA, ITF, GTF, WT, etc.) use different taekwondo forms. Even {{within a single}} association, different schools in the association may use slightly different variations on the forms, or use different names for the same form (especially in older styles of taekwondo). This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> beginner forms, {{which tend to be}} less standardized than mainstream forms.|$|E
25|$|Italy has {{the richest}} {{concentration}} of Late Antique and medieval mosaics in the world. Although {{the technique is}} especially associated with Byzantine art, and many Italian mosaics were probably made by imported Greek-speaking artists and craftsmen, the numbers of significant mosaics remaining in the core Byzantine territories are surprisingly few. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the centuries before the Byzantine Iconoclasm of the 8th century.|$|E
40|$|Parallel with anthropological literature, {{analysis}} of genealogical data shows {{a strong relationship}} between infant mortality rates and allowing deceased infants to remain unnamed. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> infants dying shortly after birth. Findings suggest the question, “When does life begin? ” has had social as well as biological and religious answers. ...|$|R
50|$|Academic art {{not only}} held {{influence}} in Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other Western countries. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> Latin American nations, which, because their revolutions were {{modeled on the}} French Revolution, sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is Ángel Zárraga of Mexico.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{the more}} rigid {{membership}} structure of Team 10, the Metabolist's saw their movement as having organic form {{with the members}} being free to come and go, although the group had cohesion they saw themselves as individuals and their architecture reflected this.

This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> those “hotspots” located in remote trans-border tropical forests.|$|E
25|$|Many DRM systems require {{authentication}} with {{an online}} server. Whenever the server goes down, or a region or country experiences an Internet outage, it effectively locks out people from registering or using the material. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> {{a product that}} requires a persistent online authentication, where, for example, a successful DDoS attack on the server would essentially make all copies of the material unusable.|$|E
25|$|When {{looking at}} the virgin black liquor dry solids we note that on average dry solids has increased. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> latest very large {{recovery}} boilers. Design dry solids for green field mills have been either 80 or 85% dry solids. 80% (or before that 75%) dry solids has been in use in Asia and South America. 85% (or before that 80%) has been in use in Scandinavia and Europe.|$|E

50|$|During the 17th century, {{there were}} a number of schools {{dedicated}} to girls, but the cultural norm was for girls to be informally educated at home. During the 18th century, there was an increase in the number of girls being educated in schools. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> middle-class families whose rising financial status and social aspirations made providing an aristocratic style of education for their daughters both desirable and possible.|$|R
25|$|Jämtland is {{inhabited}} by several mammals from the weasel family. Besides the already mentioned wolverine the oter, otter, is {{widespread in the}} province and common near several streams, the least or snow weasel exists, along with planted, released and escaped minks. The province {{is also home to}} the pine marten and the ermine. These mammals have often been hunted for their valuable fur, for Jämtland this <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the ermine.|$|E
25|$|Pottery in Metepec and {{the rest}} of the Toluca Valley began in the pre Hispanic period during which both {{utilitarian}} and decorative/ritual items were made. Pottery in the Valley of Toluca shows strong Nahua influence, especially Aztec. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> urns, braziers, cups and plates. Another important influence was from the Cholula area of Puebla in the use of polychrome decoration. Decorative techniques included stamping, painting, incising, scraping and raised relief.|$|E
25|$|Those who reload {{with the}} primary goal of maximizing {{accuracy}} or terminal performance may end up paying more per reloaded round than for commercial ammunition—this <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> military calibers which are commonly available as surplus. Maximum performance, however, requires the highest quality components, which are usually the most expensive. Reloaders who reload {{with the primary}} goal of saving money on ammunition, however, can make a few tradeoffs to realize significant cost savings with a minimal sacrifice in quality.|$|E
50|$|Although Sentinel was {{ultimately}} cancelled, the testing phase revealed {{a key issue}} that {{would prove to be}} invaluable during the following Safeguard development. The issue was related to the problems encountered when formerly separate developments were brought together and proved not to work. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the software systems, which seriously delayed the program on several occasions. This led to a number of changes for the Safeguard program to address these concerns.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{recovery}} {{equipment is}} extremely sophisticated and manufactured in quantity throughout the world. However {{up until the}} mid-seventies {{a large proportion of}} the equipment in use was homemade, often just consisting of a ridged jib and a simple block and tackle. After both World Wars, a number of army surplus vehicles were purchased cheaply by operators and converted to civilian use. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> recovering trucks and other commercial vehicles.|$|R

25|$|The Battle of Jutland was {{annually}} {{celebrated as}} a great victory by the right wing in Weimar Germany. This victory was used to repress {{the memory of the}} German navy's initiation of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, as well as the memory of the defeat in World War I in general. (The celebrations of the Battle of Tannenberg played a similar role.) This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the city of Wilhelmshaven, where wreath-laying ceremonies and torch-lit parades were performed {{until the end of the}} 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} wearing {{sunglasses and}} not smoking. Early on the symptoms may be improved with glasses. If {{this does not}} help, surgery to remove the cloudy lens {{and replace it with}} an artificial lens is the only effective treatment. Surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life. Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, which <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> women, those living in rural areas, {{and those who do not}} know how to read.|$|E
25|$|The correlatives, {{although}} clearly cognate with European languages (for example, kiel, tiel with French quel (which), tel (such); ĉiu with Italian ciascun (each), and -es {{with the}} German genitive -es, etc.), have been analogically leveled {{to the point}} that they are often given as examples of Esperanto innovations. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the indefinite forms like io (something), which were devised by iconically removing the consonant of the ki- and ti- forms. Likewise, the restriction of the Italian and Greek masculine noun and adjective ending -o to nouns, and the feminine noun and adjective ending -a to adjectives and the article la, is an Esperanto innovation using existing forms.|$|E
50|$|Each motive {{originated}} {{a different}} type of reaction (cognitive, affective or behavioural). The self-enhancement motive creates both affective and cognitive responses. Affective responses result in negative feedback leading to less positive affect then positive affect. This is moderated by trait modifiability, {{in the sense that we}} can find the former event to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> unmodifiable traits. On the other hand, cognitive responses lead to favourable feedback being judged as more accurate, but only in the case of modifiable traits.|$|R
