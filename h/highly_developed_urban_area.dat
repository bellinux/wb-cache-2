40|$|Purpose A {{knowledge-based}} {{urban development}} {{needs to be}} sustainable and, therefore, requires ecological planning strategies to ensure {{a better quality of}} its services. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an innovative approach for monitoring the sustainability of urban services and help the policy-making authorities to revise the current planning and development practices for more effective solutions. The paper introduces a new assessment tool–Micro-level Urban-ecosystem Sustainability IndeX (MUSIX) – that provides a quantitative measure of urban sustainability in a local context. Design/methodology/approach A multi-method research approach was employed in the construction of the MUSIX. A qualitative research was conducted through an interpretive and critical literature review in developing a theoretical framework and indicator selection. A quantitative research was conducted through statistical and spatial analyses in data collection, processing and model application. Findings/results MUSIX was tested in a pilot study site and provided information referring to the main environmental impacts arising from rapid urban development and population growth. Related to that, some key ecological planning strategies were recommended to guide the preparation and assessment of development and local area plans. Research limitations/implications This study provided fundamental information that assists developers, planners and policy-makers to investigate the multidimensional nature of sustainability at the local level by capturing the environmental pressures and their driving forces in <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> Originality/value This study measures the sustainability of urban development plans through providing data analysis and interpretation of results in a new spatial data unit. ...|$|R

The gridded remotely sensed parameter data sets are directly substituted for the land-use/lookup-table-based values in the Noah-UCM modeling framework. Model performance in reproducing ET (evapotranspiration) and LST (land surface temperature) fields is evaluated utilizing Landsat-based LST and ET estimates from CIMIS (California Irrigation Management Information System) stations {{as well as in}} situ measurements. Our assessment shows that the large deviations between the spatial distributions and seasonal fluctuations of the default and measured parameter sets lead to significant errors in the model predictions of monthly ET fields (RMSE = 22. 06 mm month − 1). Results indicate that implemented satellite-derived parameter maps, particularly GVF, enhance the capability of the Noah UCM to reproduce observed ET patterns over vegetated areas in the urban domains (RMSE = 11. 77 mm month − 1). GVF plays the most significant role in reproducing the observed ET fields, likely due to the interaction with other parameters in the model. Our analysis also shows that remotely sensed GVF and ISA improve the model's capability to predict the LST differences between fully vegetated pixels and highly developed areas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Many taxing {{authorities}} use {{unimproved land}} (site) values {{as a tax}} base. In <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> this may {{require the use of}} indirect valuation methods, such as an extraction technique to arrive at the land value. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose that the land extraction (residual) valuation calculation of an investment property should incorporate productivity variables, rather than cost based figures, in order to simulate market value principles. Design/methodology/approach – This paper examines the assessment of the land component of investment property as an ad valorem tax base. It justifies a valuation methodology using the market comparison approach before developing a model to meet specified criteria. The model incorporates productivity based benchmarks and differentials appropriate for shopping centre properties. The model is then tested on an Australian shopping centre. Findings – This paper found that the land value component of a major shopping centre in Australia could be derived from comparable vacant and improved sales using the variables of moving annual turnover (MAT) and gross lettable area (GLA) as key value determinants. Research limitations/implications – This exploratory research identified a model that is appropriate for major shopping centres in Queensland, Australia. The model could form the framework for other types of investment property but the key productivity determinants would require re-examination. Practical implications – This study provides a practical solution to an ongoing valuation problem arising from the rating legislation in Australia, which requires the determination of site value for all property types. Originality/value – This paper uses productivity variables to assess the site value of investment property. This innovative methodology can provide a more accurate appraisal of site values...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Computer Science) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 With {{the growing}} number of {{vehicles}} and users, monitoring road and traffic within cities is becoming a huge research challenge. With urban scale enlargement coupled with the exponential {{growth in the number of}} vehicles, South Africa (SA) is not an exception. Consequently, congestion and pollution (i. e. noise and air) have become the order of the day. Road congestion and traffic-related pollution are well-known for huge negative socio-economic impact on several economies worldwide. For over a decade now, the number of cars on SA roads has increased tremendously and the road transport profile is characterized by its sizeable and total dependence on cars particularly in the <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> alongside cycling, and other public transport. This has brought about increasing congestion in public roads which poses a serious problem not only for SA, but many countries of the world and has to be contained. Several solution methods have been proposed requiring dedicated hardware such as GPS devices and accelerometers in vehicles or camera on roadside and near traffic signals. Most other works in literature concentrated on lane systems and orderly traffic, which is common in the developing world and in some cases, the traffic is highly chaotic and unpredictable. The situation in SA cities like Johannesburg and Pretoria is not different. All these methods are costly and require much human effort. Therefore, in this dissertation, we present a novel model that is cost etfective, requires less human intervention, but uses wireless sensor networks, GPS and RFID scanner to monitor traffic in major SA cities. The novel model was developed and simulated using Visual Sense platform, the results obtained after simulation shows that the congestion level during busy hours was reduced and the traffic was managed.

Three studies examined environmental attributes associated with {{mental and physical health}} within children's most proximate settings: homes, neighborhoods, and schools: Chapter 2 : Research about how residential design attributes may moderate effects of crowding on children's psychological health is sparse. This two-part, cross-sectional study first examined the relation between residential interior density and self-reported crowding among children. Second, analysis investigated the potential role of residential design attributes - floor plan arrangement, child's bedroom ceiling height, volume, and window area - to buffer adverse effects of crowding on children's psychological health and physiological stress. Results suggested that bedroom ceiling height may moderate negative effects of home and bedroom crowding on children's psychological health and physiological stress. Chapter 3 : The amount of nature needed for humans to achieve the welldocumented benefits of nature exposure is unknown, partially because no common nature measure exists. This study developed and tested a nature estimation method, using freely available Google Earth satellite images, to address estimation limitations of 2006 National Land Cover Database and automated Geographic Information Systems procedures. Amounts of nature (vegetation, trees, water) surrounding a sample of New York residences were estimated and compared using both methods. The Google Earth method better estimated nearby nature in dense, <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> while either estimation method was appropriate for less densely populated areas. Chapter 4 : Based on environmental psychology and behavioral economics strategies associated with healthy eating, the Cafeteria Assessment for Elementary Schools (CAFES) offers an objective, reliable, and valid instrument that quantifies physical cafeteria attributes linked to selection and consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) at the scale of room, table, plate, and food. Observations, interviews, and FV serving and consumption data obtained from lunch tray photography were used to develop and validate CAFES. Total CAFES and four scale scores were associated with FV consumption outcomes. Researchers and practitioners can use CAFES to identify critical areas for intervention; suggest low- and nocost intervention strategies; and contribute to design guidelines aimed at promoting healthy eating among elementary school students. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|R

The present article {{contributes to the literature}} on this subject by addressing innovation measurement on the regional level. The dimensionality of regional innovation is examined by applying a principal component analysis on seven innovation output indicators in European regions from the Community Innovation Survey and two traditional indicators, i. e. patent applications and R&D expenses. The analysis reveals that regional innovation indeed needs to be regarded as a multidimensional concept involving technological, commercial and service innovation. These distinct {{innovation activities}} exhibit clear regional patterns with both technological and service innovation concentrated in <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> territories and <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> displaying particularly strong innovation performance in services. In addition, commercially successful innovation appears clustered in backward regions and may thus be seen as imitation efforts and technology transfers from areas at the innovation frontier.

40|$|The study forms {{a direct}} {{analysis}} and personal response towards the symbolism and architecture of Baluchistan through three methodological stages of research: literature review, case study, and examination, classification {{and analysis of}} results. The research first focuses on the social environment of Baluchistan such as social patterns, languages, local economy and the lifestyle of the nomadic, semi-nomadic and the rural settled people {{in order to understand}} the input of local culture and tribo-religious influences of local architecture, in particular the form of mosque, its feature elements such as dome, mihrab, minbar and most importantly the minaret. The fieldwork and collecting data is theoretically contextualised and draws upon a combination of reference points from Islamic architecture as well as anthropology. The Baluchi lifestyle is analysed, taking into account native architecture including mosques and symbolic minarets as key factors, together with their design, characteristics, social contextualisation and methods of production. Selected architectural forms of normal houses and mosques and the design of their featuring constituent elements are analysed to explain their symbolic meaning and their visual content. Historical contexts and the relationship between the Baluchi lifestyle, textiles (prayer rugs), local architecture and the design of their mosques is an important part of understanding the social and religious significance of minarets in Baluchistan. Therefore, the principle and functions of minarets in rural areas of Baluchistan, along with their local traditional architecture are compared to the principles of religo-cultural architecture in <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> Islamic <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> in order to examine the potential changing patterns of minarets in rural areas of Baluchistan, including the configuration and function towards the understanding of the symbolic meaning of minarets.

40|$|Urbanisation is characterised by mass {{migration}} {{of people to}} <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> and conversion of land from rural to urban land uses. Changes in population dynamics have led to half the world’s population living in <b>urban</b> areas; in <b>developed</b> countries, <b>urban</b> dwellers account for three-quarters of the total population. Though populations have shifted from rural to <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> people continue to rely on their environment, and trees in particular, for tangible and intangible benefits alike. A great deal of factual and anecdotal knowledge supports the role of trees for ecological, social, and economic well-being. In spite of this, during urbanisation, previously vegetated land is converted to housing, roads, or utility corridors, {{all of which are}} necessary to support growing populations. This thesis investigates tree growth in these modified urban landscapes, in particular, the effects of pavements on urban trees. Pavements are truly pervasive, covering {{more than half of all}} land in <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> Their durability and strength are of great importance to transportation, but large-scale soil sealing is not without consequence. Pavements affect the hydrologic cycle, soil and air temperature, and nutrient cycling. Because of their effect on the surrounding environment, pavements inherently affect remnant or planted trees. They are believed to negatively affect tree growth and survival, thereby compromising the ecological, social, and economic benefits otherwise derived from the urban forest. In recent times, porous pavements have been increasingly installed in favour of impervious pavements. Porous pavements are perceived to be an environmentally-sound alternative to standard impervious pavements. This thesis begins by reviewing the literature concerning porous pavement’s effect on underlying soil and urban vegetation, thus illustrating the scarcity of empirical data describing the effect of porous pavement on tree growth. A greater understanding of porous pavement’s impact on the surrounding environment is needed, if its installation is to continue. With this aim in mind, this thesis describes an experiment in Christchurch, New Zealand, which monitored the impacts of porous and impervious pavement on underlying soil conditions, and subsequent tree growth. The experiment comprised 50 Platanus orientalis trees planted in an augmented factorial design, which consisted of controls and four treatments. Trees were split evenly amongst plots, such that ten replicates existed per treatment. The pavement treatments measured 2. 3 m by 2. 3 m, and were based on the combination of pavement type (2 levels: porous, impervious) and pavement profile design (2 levels: +/- subbase compaction and gravel base). The resulting four treatments were impervious concrete pavement (IP), impervious concrete pavement with compacted subbase and gravel base (IP+), porous concrete pavement (PP), and porous concrete pavement with compacted subbase and gravel base (PP+). From December 2007 to March 2009, data were collected to determine the effect of these treatments on soil moisture, aeration, pH, and nutrient concentration. Final tree height, stem diameter, shoot and root biomass, and root distribution were also measured at the conclusion of the experiment. Results of this experiment indicated that the effects of pavement porosity on soil moisture and aeration were dynamic, varying with season and soil depth. Increased soil moisture beneath porous pavements resulted from rapid infiltration following precipitation. This decreased the duration of plant stress resulting from drought. Relative to bare soil, paved plots had consistently greater soil moisture, likely because pavements reduced evaporation. The inclusion of a gravel base in the profile design limited capillary upflow, which resulted in lower soil moisture under pavements designed with a gravel base. Soil aeration was significantly lower beneath pavements relative to unpaved plots. This is likely related to greater soil moisture beneath pavements. Finally, soil pH increased beneath pavements, in particular beneath porous pavements. Though all growth parameters increased for trees surrounded by porous, rather than impervious pavement, this occurred only in the absence of a compacted subgrade and gravel base. Evidently, the impact of the compacted subgrade superseded the impact of pavement porosity. Furthermore, root growth was relatively shallow beneath pavements, likely due to favourable soil moisture directly beneath pavements. This research highlights (i) the dramatic effect of pavements on underlying soil conditions; (ii) that pavements do not inherently limit tree growth; (iii) that porous pavements can conditionally improve tree growth; and (iv) that soil compaction limits potential benefits resulting from porous pavements...|$|R
5000|$|Organic {{agricultural}} products are produced mainly {{in three different}} areas: Northeast China, the coastal areas of Eastern China and Southeast China. The main certified areas in Northeast China include the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning province, which produces cereals, beans, pumpkin and sunflower kernels. In the developed coastal regions, which include Shandong, Jiangsu, Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Fujiang provinces, {{the focus is on}} producing organic vegetables for the Japanese and the internal Chinese market. Southeast China provinces like Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Fujian are the main areas for organic tea production. The processing for these products are mainly located in the <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> and <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> of eastern China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shandong and Jiangsu Province. [...] The domestic organic market was completely non-existent in China at the start of modern organic production, but it has grown steadily since the year 2000. This is partially due to increasing concerns over food safety, which a huge issue among Chinese consumers, as the government estimates 40,000 people are affected by food poisoning in a year. In wealthier <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> like Hong Kong, where demand for organic food is increasing, consumers are concerned about the fact that China uses 30% of world's nitrogen fertilizer on 10% of world's arable land along with being the largest user of pesticides and fertilizer in the world. The capital city of Beijing is the largest domestic organic market, accounting for approximately 1/3 of total domestic market value. Large urban metropolises like Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Shenzhen are also major domestic markets. Domestic organic food are found mainly in supermarkets, specialized stores and home delivery systems, which have gained popularity in recent years. The most common products in these domestic markets are rice, beans, meat, milk, eggs, vegetables, and cooking oil. Within China, organic products are cost significantly more than conventional products, with cereals and meat being three times the price of conventional products. Organic vegetables can be as much as 10 times the price of conventional vegetables. [...] The Chinese government is experimenting with incentives at the provincial level in order to attract farmers to organic farming. Certain provinces have tried to implement their own large export ventures while other jurisdictions offer incentives, like tax benefits to private operators.However, issues remain that hamper the domestic organic market. The vast distances to viable organic markets in China has a negative effect on the local incentives. For instance, the Southern Chinese province of Yunnan is a highly productive area for agriculture, but the area itself has very little demand for organic products and the long distances to the markets of Beijing and Shanghai limits organic producers in Yunnan from significant expansion. Another issue is that so much of Chinese organic products are being exported, the big supermarket chains don’t have the steady supply of high volume products to maintain customer confidence. This makes it difficult for small producers, who can’t guarantee consistent volume, to enter the market. For many Chinese consumers, {{there is a lack of}} general knowledge about organic foods. According to Shanghai Organics, some consumers still view organic as a foreign idea, separate from food safety issues that garner the most attention. The biggest barrier is still price, which is much higher when compared to conventional products. In America the premium for organic prices are between 9%-78% the price of conventional products. In China the premium can be up to 700%, with most demand coming from the wealthier expat communities and the richer <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Bryan/College Station (B/CS) {{region has}} been {{reported}} to have elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water. Increased DOC concentrations are worrisome as DOC {{has been shown to be}} an energy source for the recovery and regrowth of E. coli and many watersheds are impaired by high bacteria levels. To examine the sources and fates of DOC in rural and urban regions to better understand DOC movement though the environment, seven watersheds were studied. To investigate source, streams were analyzed using diffuse reflectance near infrared spectroscopy (DR-NIR) and carbon isotopes. Fate of DOC was determined through monthly streams samples, gathered between March 2011 and February 2012, which were incubated for biodegradable DOC (BDOC). Soil in the region was sampled based on land use categories. Soil was analyzed for DOC and BDOC as well as DOC adsorption, the other major fate of DOC. Above ground vegetation was sampled in conjunction with soil and analyzed for BDOC. Data indicated that fecal matter from cliff swallows provided considerable organic material to streams in the B/CS region as shown through DR-NIR. Carbon isotope values in streams ranged from - 23. 5 +/- 0. 7 % to - 26. 8 +/- 0. 5 %. Stream spectra may be able to predict carbon isotope values in streams (Adj. R 2 = 0. 88). Mean annual stream DOC concentrations ranged from 11 +/- 3 mg/L to 31 +/- 12 mg/L, which represents a significant decrease in DOC between 2007 and 2011. Concurrent increases in pH and conductivity were also recorded. The decrease in DOC and the increases in pH and conductivity may be due to impacts of high sodium irrigation tap water. Biodegradable DOC was low in streams, which is likely due to DOC being present in streams in refractory forms that are resistant to microbial breakdown. Soil chemistry, including soil adsorption, was greatly influenced by sodium. The elevated adsorption coefficients and release values seen in <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> and <b>urban</b> open <b>areas</b> can be attributed to frequent exposure to high sodium irrigation water. The results indicate that sodium is a major driver of DOC in the system. Sound management decisions concerning irrigation water chemistry and urban development might eventually emerge to protect water quality as a result of this research...|$|R
40|$|Decreases in area {{of natural}} {{vegetation}} have occurred increasingly since European occupation of Australia. Many remaining large tracts are being dissected by roads, railway lines and strips of development. These are serious problems for attempts at conservation {{of the native}} biota. Large animals {{are likely to be}} the most conspicuously affected. This study examines conservation of the mammal fauna in the Illawarra region of New South Wales {{in the context of the}} remaining patches of native vegetation. The 2 ̆ 2 Region 2 ̆ 2 is defined as the area bounded by the Sydney <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> in the north, the line of the western edge of the Water Board catchments in the west, the Shoalhaven River in the south and the ocean in the east. Within this region, natural vegetation remains mostly as three large tracts of land in the escarpment/tablelands (Royal National Park, Water Board catchments, and Morton National Park and surrounds) and numerous isolated patches, mostly on the coastal plain. A unique feature of the region, especially in the northern end, is the close proximity of <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> commercial and <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> to the large tracts of native vegetation contained within the various reserves. Ten study sites were established in the large tracts and 23 were established in the isolated patches. The terrestrial mammal fauna of each study site was surveyed between 1983 and 1987, using a variety of techniques such as trapping, spotlighting and identifying tracks, scats and other signs. Historical records of mammal occurrences were obtained from a variety of sources; personal interviews with long-time residents, archival material from early settlers and explorers and museum records. A detailed description of the mammal fauna of the region as a whole, and of the specific study sites is presented, related to the vegetation, geology, topography etc. These surveys show that the region as a whole contains a wide diversity of mammal species (49 species including bats; 32 species of terrestrial mammals). This is almost the full complement expected on the basis of historical records (33 terrestrial species). Thirteen introduced species were recorded. Much of the current diversity is contained within the large tracts of reserved vegetation in the escarpment/plateau areas. Individual isolates contained only from 0 to 13 species of native, terrestrial mammals. Low species diversity of these isolates was related mainly to three factors: area, degree of isolation and degree of disturbance. I argue that the large tracts of relatively undisturbed vegetation of the escarpment and plateau are an essential element in future mammal conservation in the region, although small isolated fragments, especially those containing unusual vegetation types, will be of some value. The close proximity of development to these tracts of vegetation means that disturbance will be a continuing pressure. The analysis of the isolates sampled showed the importance of large size and close proximity to other native vegetation in sustaining a high species diversity. These principles should be applied to future design and management of the escarpment reserves. I identify certain areas of land which should be added to existing reserves to ensure the preservation of specific habitats and hence certain mammal species. I argue that the isolating impact of roads and railway lines must be overcome, and I also indentify 2 ̆ 2 wildlife corridors 2 ̆ 2 to reduce the effects of fragmentation of this formerly continuous tract of vegetation...|$|R
