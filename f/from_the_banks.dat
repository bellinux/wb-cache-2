5|$|After {{three days}} of {{negotiations}} in federal court, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer announced a settlement on November 14, 2008. WMATA had 14 similar lease agreements with other financial institutions when the KBC case went to trial.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{second line}} ran a mile closer to Warsaw, {{along the lines}} of {{partially}} preserved First World War-era trenches built by German and Russian armies in 1915, separated by a no man's land. It ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the river Bugonarew at Fort Beniaminów, along the StrugaZielonkaRembertów-ZakrętFalenica line. The two most prominent pivots of this line were the towns of Radzymin and Wołomin. The third line of defence ran in the immediate vicinity of the right-bank borough of Praga, while the Vistula River bridgeheads formed the final fourth line.|$|E
2500|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> {{point of}} view, when a debit card {{is used to}} pay a merchant, the payment causes a {{decrease}} in the amount of money <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> owes to <b>the</b> cardholder. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> point of view, your debit card account is <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> liability. [...] A decrease to <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> liability account is a debit. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> point of view, when a credit card is used to pay a merchant, the payment causes an increase in the amount of money <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> is owed by <b>the</b> cardholder. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> point of view, your credit card account is <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> asset. An increase to <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> asset account is a debit. Hence, using a debit card or credit card causes a debit to the cardholder's account in either situation when viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> perspective.|$|R

[...] A customer's periodic bank statement generally shows transactions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank's</b> perspective, with bank deposits characterized as credits and withdrawals as debits.|$|R
5|$|Chopra is a {{supporter}} of environmental charities and is brand ambassador for NDTV Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and provide solar power to rural villages without electricity supplies. She appeared with children in an animated video to support the cause, and removed rubbish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the Yamuna river in Agra to increase awareness of environmental issues. During {{the third and fourth}} editions of Greenathon, She adopted up to seven villages to provide with a regular supply of electricity. She adopted a tigress in 2011 and a lioness in 2012 at the Birsa biological park, paying for both animals' upkeep for a year. To promote organ donation, Chopra pledged to donate her own organs after death and was co-keynote speaker at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Bollywood-themed 20th-anniversary celebration of its liver-transplant programme in 2012.|$|E
5|$|F. Augustus Heinze's {{association}} with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved {{too much for the}} board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.|$|E
5|$|I-470 {{enters the}} city limits of Wheeling and Ohio County, West Virginia; the Greater Wheeling Trail, a rail trail, passes under the freeway as I-470 {{approaches}} a three-level diamond interchange with US250 and WV2. The concurrent highways connect to downtown Wheeling {{in the north and}} Benwood to the south. I-70 climbs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the river into more woodlands before an interchange with West Bethlehem Boulevard, which provides access to the village of the same name to the south. Continuing easterly, I-470 comes to its end at an incomplete interchange with its parent, I-70, over Wheeling Creek near Elm Grove and {{to the north of the}} J.B. Chambers Youth Sports Complex and Wheeling Skate Park. Traffic from I-470 can only access eastbound I-70, and only traffic traveling westbound on I-70 can access I-470. The eastern branch of the Greater Wheeling Trail, which parallels the creek, passes underneath I-470 as it merges into I-70.|$|E

5|$|Nag Nathaiya {{is celebrated}} {{on the fourth}} lunar day of the dark {{fortnight}} of the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). It commemorates the victory of Krishna over the serpent Kaliya. On this occasion, a large Kadamba tree (Neolamarckia cadamba) branch is planted {{on the banks of}} the Ganges so that a boy, playing the role of Krishna, can jump into the river on to the effigy representing Kaliya. He stands over the effigy in a dancing pose playing the flute, while an audience watches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the river or from boats. Bharat Milap celebrates the meeting of Rama and his younger brother Bharata after the return of the former after 14 years of exile. It is celebrated during October–November, a day after the festival of Vijayadashami. Kashi Naresh attends this festival in his regal attire. The festival attracts a large number of devotees.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 March, German attacks {{continued}} to push back the remaining units of the 66th Division, now supported by the 1st Cavalry Division {{and a handful of}} tanks. The composite force managed a fighting retreat, with most units avoiding encirclement. Shortly after noon the remnants of the division were ordered to retreat behind the 50th (Northumbrian) Division, which were preparing fresh defences on the original Green Line {{along the edge of the}} rear zone. The 66th Division retreated through the new defensive line by 4:00 pm, with the aid of the 5th Durham Light Infantry (DLI), which had been temporarily transferred to support them and the 50th Division took over the front line. Over the following days, the divisions of XIX Corps fell back towards the line of the River Somme, where the 66th Division (plus the 5th DLI) took up positions on the west bank of the river around Barleux and Foucaucourt-en-Santerre, west of Peronne. On 24 March, the German army crossed the Somme and the 2/8th Lancashire Fusiliers counter-attacked the bridgeheads without success but continued to hold a line close to the river. Expecting a follow-up attack the next day, 149th Brigade was temporarily attached to 66th Division and both units were slowly pushed back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the Somme, withdrawing to Assevillers as night fell on 25 March.|$|E
