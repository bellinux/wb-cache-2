As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>who</b> remained.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the London and Brighton Railway in 1840s (the line was officially opened to Brighton from Haywards Heath on 21 September 1841) was an {{important}} milestone in the Town's history and development, despite the station remaining a request stop on the route {{for a number of}} years after opening. The influx of trades associated with railway construction and operation, including many navvies changed the demography of the Town. The Railway Tavern on Station Road was constructed to provide accommodation <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>who</b> needed it on Railway business. The {{arrival of the}} railway shaped the traffic pattern of the Town and continues to this day; all road traffic has to cross the line either in the South on Station Road or in the North on Leylands Road. The opening of the Lewes Branch connected the Keymer Brick and Tile Company to the railway network providing access to greater markets.
