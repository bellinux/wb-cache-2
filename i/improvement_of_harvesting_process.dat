40|$|Mainly in {{developing}} countries, food loss and waste {{is a problem}} that is difficult to measure. Investigations have been conducted in industrialized countries; however, consistent evidence of how much is really being depleted is limited. The accessible data give the illusion of evidence, but are supported by very restricted facts. In recent years, food waste and loss have gained importance because more than 35 % of food is wasted. Nevertheless, with this percentage of food, most of the 800 million people that go hungry every day in the world could be fed. This reflection paper aims to describe the different approaches and meanings of food waste, food loss and food wastage. Similarly, this article identifies the phases of the food supply chain where food is being lost and wasted. Based on the available data, developed and developing countries are compared. It was concluded that, in developed countries, the most important losses are in the consumption phase; {{in developing}} countries, the losses take place in the growing and harvesting phase. Changing consumption habits as well as the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> cropping and <b>harvesting</b> <b>processes</b> could be an option for reducing this problem, especially in developing countries...|$|R

The harvested energy is stored losslessly in an infinite-capacity battery at each sensor. In each time slot, the fusion center schedules K sensors for data transmission over K orthogonal channels. The fusion center does not have direct knowledge on the battery states of sensors, or the statistics <b>of</b> their energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>processes.</b> The fusion center only has information of the outcomes of previous transmission attempts.

40|$|Background: Animal {{breeding}} {{programs have}} been very successful in improving the mean levels of traits through selection. However, in recent decades, reducing the variability of trait levels between individuals has become a highly desirable objective. Reaching this objective through genetic selection requires that there is genetic variation in the variability of trait levels, a phenomenon known as genetic heterogeneity of environmental (residual) variance. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the potential for genetic <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> uniformity <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> weight and body size traits (length, depth, and width) in the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) strain. In order to quantify the genetic variation in uniformity of traits and estimate the genetic correlations between level and variance of the traits, double hierarchical generalized linear models were applied to individual trait values. Results: Our results showed substantial genetic variation in uniformity of all analyzed traits, with genetic coefficients of variation for residual variance ranging from 39 to 58 %. Genetic correlation between trait level and variance was strongly positive for harvest weight (0. 60 ± 0. 09), moderate and positive for body depth (0. 37 ± 0. 13), but not significantly different from 0 for body length and width. Conclusions: Our results on the genetic variation in uniformity <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> weight and body size traits show good prospects for the genetic <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> uniformity in the GIFT strain. A high and positive genetic correlation was estimated between level and variance <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> weight, which suggests that selection for heavier fish will also result in more variation in <b>harvest</b> weight. Simultaneous <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> weight and its uniformity will thus require index selection. </p...|$|R

While mortality rates after bleeding (18 %) were similar to previous studies, we found significant decreases in the linear and angular velocity of freely moving animals, as well as changes in their activity levels and expression of circatidal behavioral rhythms. Further, we found reductions in hemocyanin levels, which may alter immune function and cuticle integrity.

40|$|Microalgae {{harvesting}} is a {{major challenge}} because microalgal cells are small and carry a negative surface charge and biomass concentration in cultures is relatively low. The microalgal biomass (0. 05 %, w/w) needs to be concentrated to a paste with 15 %– 25 % water content. This dewatering process is ideally performed in two stages, including a first preconcentration step in combination with a second dewatering step. Microalgae are a very heterogeneous group of organisms differing in size and shape and culture conditions.

The new land use concept of paludiculture - the use of wet and rewetted peatlands for agriculture and forestry - now offers possibilities for landowners and land managers to continue using these sites under wet conditions.
