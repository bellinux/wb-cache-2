5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The <b>exposition</b> {{consists of two}} or three thematic and tonal areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode works) or to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the <b>exposition</b> involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with the character of a development section. The main themes of the <b>exposition</b> are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The <b>exposition</b> ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new tonal area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second thematic group of the <b>exposition,</b> is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first thematic group returns in the recapitulation with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E

Second, we present our experience of using <b>expositions</b> to guide college students in the thinking process of understanding problems and constructing computer algorithms to solve them. Third, we introduce the reader to a data structure called suffix trees. Even though suffix trees allow efficient solutions {{to a wide range of}} complex string problems, the lack of good <b>expositions</b> kept them from being taught in mainstream computer science education [7]. Finally, we suggest ways to involve students in critical reading and writing of <b>expositions</b> to enhance their thinking skills...|$|R
