5|$|Then the accompanist {{returns to}} Life's A Funny Proposition until {{the father is}} sitting down in the house. What's the Use of Dreaming leads to Gee, But It's Great to Meet a Friend {{with the arrival of}} a friend. A waltz accompanies the gallery scene until the picture is shown, leading to Some Day When Dreams Come True as the artist becomes famous. The {{introduction}} with the society woman is accompanied by <b>How</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> Miss Josephine and then by So Long Mary as she exits. No Place Like Home begins the next scene until the wife recognizes the emotional distancing of her husband when All I Ask is Love is played. The studio scene begins with I Love My Wife, But Oh You Kid and leads to Be Sweet to Me Kid or Next to your Mother... with Nobody's Little Girl during the crying scene.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Murray's {{family lived}} in poverty and were {{constantly}} moving to different areas of London, which meant that he was often bullied and involved in fights. By the time his family settled in Clapton in 1970, Murray joined a skinhead gang and [...] "had a violent {{couple of years of}} being out on the street." [...] He developed an interest in rock music when he was 15 after hearing [...] "Voodoo Chile" [...] by Jimi Hendrix on the radio, about which he recalls, [...] "everything changed, just like that. Getting into rock music wasn't like a gradual process for me; it was completely sort of extreme, totally black and white. I heard 'Voodoo Chile' on the radio and I thought, 'Bloody hell! What is THAT? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> THAT?' And I started hanging around the rock music section of the record stores and buying albums, thinking about getting into the big time, wondering what that would be like." [...] After [...] "hanging 'round record stores" [...] and acquiring several Hendrix and blues albums, Murray decided to take up the guitar. At 16, he formed his first band, a trio called Stone Free, which also included Adrian Smith on vocals, who would also become a member of Iron Maiden in 1980. From there, Murray would answer ads in Melody Maker and regularly audition for different bands at the weekend, leading to short stints in Electric Gas, [...] "this sort of soft-rock, American-type band," [...] and The Secret, [...] "this sort of mad punk band," [...] with whom he would record a single, [...] "Café De Dance", in 1975.|$|E
