40|$|Objectives: In Croatia, ethics {{committees}} are legally required in all <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> by the Law on the Health Protection. This paper explores {{for the first}} time the structure and function of ethics committees in the <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Croatia. [...] - Design: Cross-sectional survey of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> (excluding pharmacies and homecare institutions) to identify all ethics committees. [...] - Setting: Croatia six years after the implementation of the Law on the Health Protection. [...] - Main measurements: Structure and function of ethic committees in the <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions.</b> [...] - Results: 46 % of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Croatia (excluding pharmacies and homecare institutions) have an ethics committee; 89 % of ethics committees have 5 members 3 of whom are from medical professions and 2 come from other fields; 49 % of those committees stated that their main function is the analysis of research protocols. Only a small fraction of those ethics committees sent in standing orders, working guidelines or other documents that are connected with their work. [...] - Conclusions: Although there are legal provisions for ethics committees in the <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Croatia, there is an evidence of discrepancies between the practice and the “Law on the Health Protection,” suggesting the need for revision of the law. There is a need for creating separate networks of HECs and IRBs in Croatia. In comparison with other countries, the development of ethics committees in Croatia has some similarities with other transitional societies in Europe. Additional research should be undertaken in the work of ethics committees in Croatia in order to understand committees’ group dynamics, attitudes, and knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} factors {{necessary}} for telehealth implementations in healthcare organisations. We focus on the transfer of medical information using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The paper identifies current applications of telehealth and telemedicine. It contends that we are using such applications in a static manner, whilst futuristic systems would be dynamic in nature and would support the transfer of context-based information. This could make web-based multimedia patient administration systems the norm for <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions.</b> Such a scenario is {{likely to lead to}} a situation where <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> would be flooded with large amounts of clinical data. The introduction of the Knowledge Management (KM) paradigm would enable <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> to face the challenge of transforming large amounts of medical data into relevant clinical information. A KM solution would allow <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> to give clinical data context, so as to allow knowledge derivation for more effective clinical diagnoses. It would also provide a mechanism for the effective transfer of the acquired knowledge so as to aid telecare workers, as and when required...|$|R
40|$|Reform {{of state}} {{institutions}} is {{a gateway to}} a country's progress and development. This research seeks {{to answer the following}} questions: 'to what extent do institutions, such as water, basic education and primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions,</b> conform to good governance standards in Egypt?' and secondly, 'how can good governance offer a new perspective for institutional reform in Egypt?'. The research presents a comparative assessment for governance within the Egyptian water, basic education and primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions.</b> The assessment is based on nationally-owned governance indicators, which informed the measurement and assessment of governance within the water, basic education and primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Egypt. The comparative assessment reveals low levels of transparency, participation, accountability and responsiveness shared among the water, basic education and primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>institutions.</b> As a result, the research suggests a reform process for state institutions from a good governance perspective that, in particular, emphasises transparency, participation, accountability and responsiveness. good governance; institutional reform; water; basic education; primary healthcare; performance measurement; Egypt; composite index; transparency; accountability; participation; responsiveness; state institutions...|$|R
