The fleet rehabilitation is part of this modernization; in 2009, <b>fire</b> <b>alarms,</b> fire sprinklers, yellow tactile platform edge domes, and cemented-mat rubber tiles were installed. The rough black tiles on the platform edge mark the location of the doorway of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the right place to board. All faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced.|$|E
5|$|In February {{after one}} round of drink service, three men were denied further service at Sixteen {{due to their}} {{apparent}} intoxication and as a payback, the three pulled what {{was intended to be}} a prank. They set off <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> and opened a fifth-floor stairwell Chicago Fire Department standpipe valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands of gallons of water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|E

On 25 November 2009 the crew took over the Pullens buildings in Southwark. To emphasise Logue's humble background, the entire street was transformed into one from 1930s London. Large advertisements for (among other things) Bovril and fascism were added to walls, grit and grime to streets and buildings. To reproduce London smog of the timethick enough that cars might need guidance from someone walking aheadso much artificial smoke was used that <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> were triggered.|$|E

5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, {{the peace}} was again broken and <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> began to ring {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance.

The number of <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> plummeted, thanks to improvements in building fire safety and fire suppression, but worsening public health and a crisis in health care availability led the public to call on DCFEMS to provide much more emergency health care. In 2002, there had fewer than 100 <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> per month but 8,000 to 9,000 calls for medical assistance.

50|$|The later {{history of}} S. H. Couch should be {{considered}} in light of developments across the American <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> and Signal industry generally, and modernization efforts in the Boston area in particular. A quick overview of this industry is available through several sources including the National Fire Protection Association's Guide to <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> and Signaling System Installation. Section I of the Pocket Guide notes the very first public <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> reporting system in the world, the Boston <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> Telegraph, went into service in April 1852. The Guide also highlights key transitions that affected the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> industry such as smoke detectors beginning in 1960, visible signaling in the 1980s, and adoption of microprocessor and software technology. A more detailed look at the evolution of Boston's public <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system, from 1859 to 1973, can be seen here courtesy of the Boston Sparks Association. Eventually, a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> industry consolidation phase took place.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> system. The type of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> pull station, which signals the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|R

25|$|Most {{strobe lights}} on sale {{to the public}} are factory-limited to about 10–12Hz (10–12 flashes per second) in their {{internal}} oscillators, although externally triggered strobe lights will often flash as frequently as possible. Studies {{have shown that the}} majority of people that are susceptible to the strobing effects can have symptoms at 15Hz-70Hz, albeit rare. Other studies have shown epileptic symptoms at the 15Hz rate with over 90 seconds of continuous staring at a strobe light. There have been no known seizures at or below the 8Hz (or 8 flashes per second) level. Many <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> in schools, hospitals, stadiums, etc. strobe at a 1Hz rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{nursing home}} was {{equipped}} with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one fire alarm box located {{at the entrance of}} the building. The automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarms</b> are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} sound films stimulated {{the search for}} new {{applications}} of photocells. Various types of photocells were considered: vacuum, gas-discharge, photovoltaic and photoresistive, but the industry favored slow yet cheap selenium devices. By the mid-1930s, selenium photocells controlled assembly lines, elevators and looms. <b>Fire</b> <b>alarms</b> with selenium sensors came into mass production in the UK {{and then in the}} US. Norbert Wiener proposed, and Truman Gray built an optical scanner for inputting and processing data in analog computers. Kurt Kramer introduced a selenium photocell to medical research. In 1940, Glenn Milliken built the first practical selenium-based oximeter to monitor the physical condition of the Royal Air Force pilots. It was a RO where the light source and detector were separated by the ear lobe of the pilot.|$|E

Measurements of <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> sound pressure levels (SPLs) in five elder care centres showed that the sound output of a <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> can be depreciated after installation. The alarm level of a new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> installation could alert most of the building occupants but could not awaken a sleeping person. Subjective ratings on the <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> audibility in terms of minimum <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> SPL were studied with 230 awaken subjects divided by two age groups (22 - 48 and 66 - 88) in the five elder care centres. A higher perceived SPL is preferred for the elder age group to obtain the same subjective rating, {{when compared with the}} younger age group. Correlations between the subjective ratings and the measured SPL show that the alarm SPL of 65 dBA can alert most of the occupants in daytime, but expressed a preference that the alarm SPL be increased. The results show that the minimum required <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> SPL is 74. 5 dBA, which agrees with the recommended alarm SPL at bed head of 75 dBA in the design guidelines.
