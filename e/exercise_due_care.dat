5000|$|It was {{accepted}} that the underwriting agents had {{a duty to}} <b>exercise</b> <b>due</b> <b>care</b> and skill (see for instance, s 13 Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982). The question was whether the agents could be liable to the indirect investors (the names behind in the syndicate which had formed another syndicate). The problem {{was that there was}} a contractual relationship between the head syndicate managers and its direct members, but not necessarily a contractual relationship between the head syndicate managers {{and the members of the}} sub-syndicate.

The court said that Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad had failed to demonstrate that the shipment of acrylonitrile by rail through populated areas is so hazardous an activity that even when shippers <b>exercise</b> <b>due</b> <b>care,</b> the law should nevertheless create incentives to relocate the activity to nonpopulated areas or to reduce the scale of the activity.|$|E

50|$|English {{law allows}} actions for libel {{to be brought}} in the High Court for any {{published}} statements which are alleged to defame a named or identifiable individual(s) (under English law companies are legal persons, and may bring suit for defamation) in a manner which causes them loss in their trade or profession, or causes a reasonable person to think worse of him, her or them. Allowable defences are justification (i.e. {{the truth of the}} statement), fair comment (i.e., whether the statement was a view that a reasonable person could have held), and privilege (i.e., whether the statements were made in Parliament or in court, or whether they were fair reports of allegations in the public interest). An offer of amends is a barrier to litigation. A defamatory statement is presumed to be false, unless the defendant can prove its truth. Furthermore, to collect compensatory damages, a public official or public figure must prove actual malice (knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth). A private individual must only prove negligence (not <b>exercising</b> <b>due</b> <b>care)</b> to collect compensatory damages. In order to collect punitive damages, all individuals must prove actual malice.|$|R
