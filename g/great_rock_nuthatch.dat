50|$|The western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta neumayer) (sometimes known {{simply as}} <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch)</b> is a small {{passerine}} bird which breeds from Croatia east through Greece and Turkey to Iran. This nuthatch is largely resident apart from some post-breeding dispersal. The eastern <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> Sitta tephronota is a separate species, which occurs further east in south-central Asia.|$|R

50|$|Pliny the Elder {{believed}} that it was these birds that inspired man to build homes of earth in imitation of the western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch's</b> nests.|$|R
5000|$|The western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> has a tsik {{call and}} a trilled tui tui tui [...] song. It {{is common in}} {{suitable}} habitat in most of its range.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is a bird {{associated}} with habitats with bare rocks, especially in mountainous areas. Those {{at the highest}} altitudes may move lower down in winter.|$|R
5000|$|He identified, amongst other Mediterranean species, {{the western}} <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> [...] and the Iberian ribbed newt. The yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) {{was named after}} him by Johann Friedrich Naumann.|$|R
5|$|The western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> builds an {{elaborate}} flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests {{are located in}} rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is 13.5 cm long, {{slightly}} smaller than Eurasian nuthatch, {{and has the}} typical nuthatch big head, short tail and powerful bill and feet. It is long-legged and long-billed compared to most of its relatives.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship {{with other members}} of the genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue nuthatch (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet-fronted nuthatch (S. frontalis), yellow-billed nuthatch (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed nuthatch (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas, and the uniqueness of its plumage, argues against the assumption. According to the International Ornithological Congress and ornithologist Alan P. Peterson, no subspecies have been identified. * Weakly-supported clade** Beautiful nuthatch (S. formosa)** *** **** Eastern <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. tephronota)**** [...] Western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. neumayer)*** **** ***** Kashmir nuthatch (S. cashmirensis)***** Chestnut-vented nuthatch (S. nagaensis)***** [...] Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea)**** [...] White-tailed nuthatch (S. himalayensis) ...|$|R
50|$|Fauna: The common {{birds in}} the reserve include white-throated robin, western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> sombre tit and {{northern}} wheatear. There are many species of butterflies, of which 23 are unique to the Hermon nature reserve and do not exist in Israel. The common reptiles in the reserve include the Vipera bornmuelleri and the four-lined snake.|$|R
500|$|In 2014, Eric Pasquet, et al. {{published}} a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species. The {{position of the}} beautiful nuthatch within the genus was not established with certainty, having a far lower statistical association than others in the model. Nevertheless, under the findings the species appears closest evolutionarily to three clades of nuthatches: two nuthatches that prefer rocky environments, the western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. neumayer) and the eastern <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. tephronota); species in the [...] "europaea" [...] group, including the Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea), Siberian nuthatch (S. arctica), chestnut-vented nuthatch (S. nagaensis), Kashmir nuthatch (S. cashmirensis), Indian nuthatch (S. castanea), chestnut-bellied nuthatch (S. cinnamoventris) and the Burmese nuthatch (S. neglecta); {{as well as the}} white-tailed nuthatch (S. himalayensis), and therefore, the white-browed nuthatch (S. victoriae). These close relatives are generally all species that plaster the entrance to their nest with mud.|$|R
5|$|All nuthatches nest in cavities; {{except for}} the two species of <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches,</b> all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft {{materials}} on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|R
5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|R
50|$|Animals in {{the region}} include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, the golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, the red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, onager, mangar and the Euphrates {{softshell}} turtle. Bird species found {{in the region}} include, the Dead Sea sparrow, eastern <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> European nightjar, hooded crow, masked shrike, Menetries's warbler, pale rockfinch, rufous-tailed scrub robin, see-see partridge and squacco heron, among others.|$|R
5000|$|... == Nature == Natural {{habitats}} include semi-desert, calcareous grasslands, and juniper woodlands alternated with cliffs, canyons, {{and rocky}} outcrops. Vicinity of Areni community {{have been considered}} as a Prime Butterfly Area, where wide variety of rare butterflies, including Papilio alexanor, Colias chlorocoma, Colias aurorina, Pseudochazara schahrudensis, Tomares romanovi, Callophrys paulae, and number of others can be observed.Also the area is interesting for bird observations, being inhabited by Egyptian Vulture, White-throated Robin, Eastern <b>Rock</b> <b>Nuthatch,</b> Black-headed Bunting, and number of other species.|$|R
5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch {{is very similar to}} the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|R
500|$|A {{total of}} 121 bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen raptor species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the hazel grouse, Tengmalm's owl, wallcreeper and willow tit. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> and alpine swift, while the second comprises birds of prey like the griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon and common kestrel, that search for food in a wider zone.|$|R
5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|R
5|$|Nuthatches forage along {{tree trunks}} and {{branches}} and {{are members of}} the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. <b>Rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|R

25|$|In {{the initial}} {{explication}} of character displacement, {{many of the}} examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> in Asia, Australian honeyeaters of the genus Myzantha, Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. David Lack found that when the two species Geospiza fortis and G. fuliginosa occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a Geospiza fortis island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor G. magnirostris in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on.|$|R
