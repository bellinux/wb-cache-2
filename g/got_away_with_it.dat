5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E
25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought to myself. And leaned it against a hut. And walked away.

25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, it was rumoured {{that this}} version was {{produced}} by Edgar Froese of Tangerine Dream, but no such credit appears on the label, and this rumour is now regarded as someone's wild guess, based on Froese being Virgin's most prominent German recording artist at the time. To this day, nothing is known for certain about who [...] "Paul" [...] was, who produced it, whether Virgin Records UK knew of or approved its recording, and if not, how Virgin Records Germany <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> releasing <b>it.</b>|$|R

500|$|The adaptations {{have had}} an {{influence}} {{on the work of}} the writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss said that Lost Hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child and that [...] "I absolutely love The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, 'It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...' There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> by putting the treasure back.

500|$|According to a December 2011 {{interview}} with Craig, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there}} was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not." [...] He said that he and Forster [...] "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} 45 seconds of soft synthesizers and {{ethereal}} vocals, somewhat akin in atmospherics to the group's early 1980s songs [...] "Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Drowning Man"; during this, Bono laments that [...] "sometimes I feel like checking out." [...] This {{is followed by}} the entrance of drums and guitar in a familiar U2 rhythm, as Bono describes the burdens of love and how he is [...] "in the black; can't see or be seen." [...] Each verse culminates with the refrain [...] "Baby, baby, baby, light my way." [...] Flood, who engineered and mixed the recording, noted that there was considerable laughter and debate during the sessions about whether Bono could get away with singing the repeated [...] "baby"s, one of the most heavily used clichés in pop songs and one that he had avoided up to that point in his songwriting; Flood later commented that [...] "he <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> alright." ...|$|E

In fact, he would probably, in his anger at the slaughter of his escort, have ordered me to be executed on the spot. As it was, he did not take either that, or the loss of his presents, greatly to heart." ...|$|R

500|$|Doggett phones Scully to {{tell her}} that Kobold claims Richman is at an old marina near Annandale, Virginia. Scully drives there, but is {{attacked}} by Richman. When Doggett and Reyes arrive, they hear a gunshot from inside an abandoned warehouse. There, they find Richman dead. Scully explains that he was holding her at gunpoint until they arrived, then shot himself. After Scully's lecture to FBI cadets, Doggett explains to her and Reyes that Kobold planned the entire ordeal as a game and <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Explaining that the word [...] "Dae/moni/cus" [...] was code for the chosen victims' names, in a game Kobold devised to culminate in his eventual escape from the asylum. That the [...] "demons" [...] angle was merely to get the X-files' involvement and that they were all thoroughly [...] "checkmated" [...] by Kodold. Reyes, though accepting of Doggett's theories, is still nevertheless disconcerted with the true feeling of evil that she experienced, and believes Doggett was equally out of sorts because, though loath to admit it, he too felt its presence.|$|E

2500|$|In 1919, under Freud's supervision, Helene began {{analyzing}} {{her first}} patient, Viktor Tausk, {{while at the}} same time Freud was analyzing Helene. After three months, upon Freud's request, Helene terminated Tausk's sessions. During her sessions with Freud, Helene reported 'falling in love with Freud.' She often felt herself to be Freud's daughter, claiming that Freud had inspired and released her talents. Helene claimed, however, that Freud tended to focus [...] "too much on her identification with her father" [...] and her affair with Lieberman. In one analysis with Freud, Helene dreamt that she had both female and male organs. Through analysis with Freud, she discovered that her personality was largely determined by her [...] "childhood wish to be simultaneously [...] father's prettiest daughter and cleverest son." [...] After one year, Freud terminated Helene's analytic sessions, to instead work with the Wolf Man. Helene nevertheless was a brilliant clinician, who stood up to Freud and <b>got</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> when she 'disagreed with him about her patients.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week."
