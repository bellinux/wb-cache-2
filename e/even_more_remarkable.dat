40|$|In {{previous}} work, we {{have described}} an early-activated and ultraviolet B (UVB) -induced apoptotic pathway in human keratinocytes, {{which can be}} completely inhibited by AKT activation. We now compared this response of primary human keratinocytes with the response of two p 53 -mutated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) -derived cell lines (A 431 and A 253) to an apoptotic UVB dose. In these cell lines, both the basal AKT phosphorylation status and the apoptotic response to UVB diverged strongly from the response of healthy primary keratinocytes. <b>Even</b> <b>more,</b> a <b>remarkable</b> correlation {{was found between the}} two. Although a constitutive dual phosphorylation of AKT rendered the A 253 SCC cell line completely resistant to the early-activated and UVB-induced apoptotic pathway, deficient T 308 phosphorylation of AKT in the SCC cell line A 431 led to a greatly augmented sensitivity to the early-activated, UVB-induced apoptotic pathway. These results indicate that the preservation of a healthy AKT pathway is essential for a wild-type UVB-induced apoptotic response in skin, and suggest that AKT-mediated dysregulation of the early-activated apoptotic response to UVB is an important event in the oncogenic transformation of keratinocytes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{intellectual}} {{atmosphere of}} Russian fin de siècle {{was characterized by}} a strong fascination for Norway, its nature, its culture and its literature. A good example is Henrik Ibsen who was {{a significant source of}} inspiration for Russian dramatists, writers and poets. The Russian symbolists in particular saw Ibsen as a tutelary spirit and not least the “younger” symbolist Andrey Bely regarded his works and thoughts as a prefiguration and a foreshadowing of his own. Ibsen was important to Bely through all his various stages of intellectual, artistic and spiritual seeking and in accordance with Bely’s highly interpretative, hermeneutical approach to the world, in which everything he experienced was transformed to confirm his own symbolist Weltanschauung, also Ibsen was transformed in much the same manner. And the very intriguing way in which Bely rewrites the Norwegian playwright into his own writings will be the main topic of this article, illustrating how the Russian symbolist refigures the Norwegian dramatist to make him fit into his own continuous search for new and meaningful perspectives and positions. Moreover and <b>even</b> still <b>more</b> <b>remarkable,</b> this search convincingly demonstrates how the Ibsenian legacy throughout the many different phases of Bely’s creative development keeps it crucial place within Bely’s life cycle, thereby establishing a most interesting thread in the complex web of Ibsen’s Wirkungsgeschichte...|$|R
25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular {{way to spend}} time. The only problem {{was that they were}} often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> when one considers the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E

25|$|Mesoamerican civilization {{provides}} a remarkable exception: civilization prospering {{in the tropical}} swampland. The Maya are often perceived as having lived in a rainforest, but technically, {{they lived in a}} seasonal desert without access to stable sources of drinking water. The exceptional accomplishments of the Maya are <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> because of their engineered response to the fundamental environmental difficulty of relying upon rainwater rather than permanent sources of water. “The Maya succeeded in creating a civilization in a seasonal desert by creating a system of water storage and management which was totally dependent on consistent rainfall.” The constant need for water kept the Maya on the edge of survival. “Given this precarious balance of wet and dry conditions, even a slight shift in the distribution of annual precipitation can have serious consequences.” Water and civilization were vitally connected in ancient Mesoamerica. Archaeologist and specialist in pre-industrial land and water usage practices Vernon Scarborough believes water management and access were critical to the development of Maya civilization.|$|E

Robert, though in an {{advanced}} age at his father's death, was <b>even</b> then <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> for those virtues which make us entertain {{hopes of a}} young man than for that steady prudence which is necessary when the short career we are to run will not allow us to make many mistakes. He had, indeed, a temper suitable to the genius of the time he lived in, and which therefore enabled him to make a considerable figure in the transactions which distinguished that period. He was of a sincere, open, candid nature; passionately fond of glory; ambitious, without having any determinate object in view; vehement in his pursuits, but inconstant; much in war, which he understood and loved. But guiding himself, both in war and peace, solely by the impulses of an unbounded and irregular spirit, he filled the world with an equal admiration and pity of his splendid qualities and great misfortunes. William was of a character very different. His views were short, his designs few, his genius narrow, and his manners brutal; full of craft, rapacious, without faith, without religion; but circumspect, steady, and courageous for his ends, not for glory. These qualities secured to him that fortune which the virtues of Robert deserved. Of Henry we shall speak hereafter.|$|R
5000|$|Although senescent {{cells can}} no longer replicate, they remain metabolically active and {{commonly}} adopt an immunogenic phenotype consisting of a pro-inflammatory secretome, the up-regulation of immune ligands, a pro-survival response, promiscuous gene expression (pGE) and stain positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, along with p16Ink4A, is regarded to be a biomarker of cellular senescence. Nonetheless, false positives exist for maturing tissue macrophages and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase {{as well as for}} T-cells p16Ink4A. Senescent cells that grow attached to a solid substrate such as glass or plastic surface assume flattened appearance becoming thinner and having greater cellular and nuclear area. After staining nuclear DNA with a fluorescent dye the cellular imaging by laser scanning cytometry reveals a dramatic decrease in intensity of the mean maximum pixel of the nuclear DNA-associated fluorescence accompanied by an increase in nuclear area; thus <b>even</b> a <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> decrease in the ratio of maximal pixel to nuclear area. A Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) consisting of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases is another highly characteristic feature of senescent cells. SASP contributes to many age-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. The damaging effects of SASP have motivated researchers to develop senolytic chemicals that would kill and eliminate senescent cells to improve health in the elderly.

25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine {{to get a better}} look at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and most parts of the frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones was not part of the normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to remove some of the jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E

James Harden scored a then career high of 46 points in the win over his former team.

The blackened hulks of huge uprooted trees, scarcely distinguishable from the fragments of genuine wrecks beside them, were securely fastened by chains to stakes and piles driven in the marsh, while heaps of broken and disjointed bamboo orange crates, held together by ropes of fibre, glistened like ligamented bones heaped in the dead valley. Masts, spars, fragments of shell-encrusted boats, binnacles, round-houses and galleys, and part of the after-deck of a coasting schooner, had ceased their wanderings and found rest in this vast cemetery of the sea. The legend on a wheel-house, the lettering on a stern or bow, served for mortuary inscription.

6000|$|When Tasmania {{was first}} colonised the natives were roughly {{estimated}} by some at 7000 and by others at 20,000. Their number was soon greatly reduced, chiefly by {{fighting with the}} English and with each other. After the famous hunt by all the colonists, when the remaining natives delivered themselves up to the government, they consisted only of 120 individuals (37. All the statements here given are taken from 'The Last of the Tasmanians,' by J. Bonwick, 1870.), who were in 1832 transported to Flinders Island. This island, situated between Tasmania and Australia, is forty miles long, and from twelve to eighteen miles broad: it seems healthy, and the natives were well treated. Nevertheless, they suffered greatly in health. In 1834 they consisted (Bonwick, p. 250) of forty-seven adult males, forty-eight adult females, and sixteen children, or in all of 111 souls. In 1835 only one hundred were left. As they continued rapidly to decrease, and as they themselves thought {{that they should not}} perish so quickly elsewhere, they were removed in 1847 to Oyster Cove {{in the southern part of}} Tasmania. They then consisted (Dec. 20th, 1847) of fourteen men, twenty-two women and ten children. (38. This is the statement of the Governor of Tasmania, Sir W. Denison, 'Varieties of Vice-Regal Life,' 1870, vol. i. p. 67.) But the change of site did no good. Disease and death still pursued them, and in 1864 one man (who died in 1869), and three elderly women alone survived. The infertility of the women is <b>even</b> a <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> fact than the liability of all to ill-health and death.
