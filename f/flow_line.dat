25|$|The natural {{progression}} was {{to streamline}} the assembly process and the company introduced a method known as Progressive Construction. In this process the mass-produced parts were combined into “unit assemblies”, each {{of which was a}} major sub-component of the finished carriage such as side panels, carriage ends or the roof. The workshops were organised on the “flow-line” principle, similar to a modern assembly line, and the unit assemblies were taken to workstations, where the precision machining of the mass-produced parts ensured they all fitted accurately into position, building into a complete carriage as the unit moved along the <b>flow</b> <b>line.</b> The technique was already in use in Derby prior to grouping, and was adopted in Wolverton during 1925, with Newton Heath following two years later. By using this method, the time taken to construct a typical carriage fell from six weeks to six days and by 1931 Derby and Wolverton were able to handle the entire LMS carriage building workload, and production at Newton Heath ceased.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gradient}} <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> equation, in {{a situation}} where Floer's ideas can be successfully applied, is typically a [...] geometrically meaningful and analytically tractable equation. [...] For symplectic Floer homology, the gradient flow equation for a path in the loopspace is (a perturbed version of) the Cauchy–Riemann equation for a map of a cylinder (the total space of the path of loops) to the symplectic manifold of interest; solutions are known as pseudoholomorphic curves. [...] The Gromov compactness theorem is then used to show that the differential is well-defined and squares to zero, so that the Floer homology is defined. [...] For instanton Floer homology, the gradient flow equations is exactly the Yang-Mills equation on the three-manifold crossed with the real line.|$|E

40|$|Precision {{agriculture}} techniques imply {{a spatial}} management of fields {{and to do}} so a good understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of yield is needed. Average yield data from seven irrigated maize fields were used to study the yield pattern considering the distance of plants to <b>flow</b> accumulation <b>lines.</b> It was found that there is a significant correlation between average yield and distance to <b>flow</b> accumulation <b>lines</b> (DFL). This correlation is best represented by a polynomial function. The most common shape of the yield pattern curve considering the distance to <b>flow</b> accumulation <b>lines</b> shows that there is an increase in average yield with DFL from 0 to 12. 5 – 17. 5 m. Near the <b>flow</b> <b>lines</b> the average yield presents lower values due to drainage problems causing plant growth problems. It was also observed higher yield variability near the <b>flow</b> <b>lines.</b> For higher distances from the <b>flow</b> <b>lines</b> there is a continuous decrease in average yield due to less water availability and other variations of soil properties...|$|R
