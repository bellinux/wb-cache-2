5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for {{the night at the}} country estate of the Palmers, who live five and a half miles away from Willoughby's estate. Marianne cannot resist going to see the estate; she becomes gravely ill {{trekking}} up a hill in a torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would have been <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> happy.|$|E

5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{signed for}} Arsenal in September 1991 for £2.5m, {{which was at}} the time a club record fee. He scored on his debut against Leicester City in a League Cup tie, {{produced}} a hat-trick on his league debut against Southampton, and in the final match of the season, scored another hat-trick, also against Southampton, to take his total to 31 goals in all competitions. The third goal of that hat-trick was the last goal scored in the old First Division before the Premier League broke away in 1992. Wright's 29 league goals (24 for Arsenal, 5 for Palace) were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the league's top scorer. , only Wright and Teddy Sheringham have led the top-flight scoring charts having scored for two different clubs during the season in question.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{pressures}} put on {{him after the}} Warp, Braddock travels abroad for a while. R.C.X. recruits his sister Betsy to become Captain Britain while he is overseas, angering Brian <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> quit when he learns this upon his return. She manages in the role for a while, but unfortunately she proves no match for Slaymaster, who tears out her eyes. Aware of his twin's pain through their telepathic bond, Brian rushes back to fight Slaymaster, whom he eventually kills. After this episode, Brian resumes the mantle of Captain Britain. In real-world terms, these events took place over twelve pages across two issues, though more than five months pass for the characters while Betsy is Captain Britain. Their effect on Betsy, and her future with the X-Men, was profound.|$|E
500|$|Davis slumped {{a bit in}} 2009 spring {{training}} but still began 2009 as the Rangers' first baseman. Rangers' manager Ron Washington said, [...] "I'm not worried about Chris.

He's going to have bad times, but what he did tonight is what he's capable of and he'll do that <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> love you." [...] On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 21 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 32 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 73 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling Vásquez in a 98 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
500|$|Relatively few {{documents}} from the period survive {{and it is difficult}} to reconstruct the details of Gibbs's early career with precision. [...] In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs's principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician Hubert Anson Newton, a leading authority on meteors, who remained Gibbs's lifelong friend and confidant. [...] After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited <b>enough</b> money <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> financially independent.|$|R

500|$|As {{a congressman}} for three months, Greeley {{introduced}} legislation for a homestead act {{that would allow}} settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848 the Tribune published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported {{a bill that would}} have corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had [...] "divided the House into two parties—one that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|The inaugural Giro d'Italia's first stage, [...] from Milan to Bologna, {{began on}} 13 May 1909 at 2:53am {{in front of}} a large crowd. 127 riders set off from the {{starting}} line outside La Gazzettas headquarters in the Piazzale Loreto. [...] The stage was marred by mechanical issues and crashes owing to bad weather, the first mass crash occurring before dawn less than [...] from the start. Luigi Ganna, leading after the first real climb near Lake Garda, was delayed by a puncture with about [...] to go and the other racers attacked, but he caught them again after they were stopped by a train crossing. The leading riders then made their way into Bologna, where Dario Beni won the stage. The second stage, [...] long, saw the first uphill finish, into Chieti, where Giovanni Cuniolo edged out Ganna for the stage win.

He died in 1855 at the age of 30, leaving behind a wife, a daughter, and a son. The Boston Herald included a mere three sentence summary of his life and descendants in its December 1 issue.|$|R
500|$|The episode has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times remarked, [...] "Great acting, a decent twist {{and the truth}} {{behind one of the}} most enigmatic characters in television history. Why can’t more Fringe episodes be like this? Why can’t more television be like Fringe?'". Hanson also lauded Jared Harris' performance, calling him [...] "a fantastic villain. Arrogant and superior, with hints of insecurity. Jones’ speech about all living creatures needing incentive might have been goofy coming from any other actor, but from Harris, it is creepy beyond belief. So glad Fringe found a way to bring David Robert Jones back." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated it 9.0/10 for being a [...] "fast-paced story" [...] that was [...] "the best episode of the season so far". He continued [...] "Olivia's great escape from Jones and Bad Nina was fantastic television and some clever writing." [...] Isler did find some of the Observer revelations [...] "a bit of a let-down" [...] however, as he felt he had already been made aware of them; this was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> critical of the episode.|$|E

Chibnall, Marsters and {{producer}} Richard Stokes discuss the role of [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] in developing John's character and placing him on a redemptive path. Marsters felt the character to be on a [...] "journey" [...] whilst Chibnall deliberately played upon the question of [...] "can you trust him, or can't you?" [...] Stokes commented that the character isn't the [...] "selfish and anarchic" [...] character seen in [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] and that his [...] "affection and love for Captain Jack are <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> try and do the noble thing". Stephen James Walker, a writer of reference works on Doctor Who and its spin-offs, notes that because of the reluctance of Hart's collaboration with Gray and his remorse for his actions the episode leaves the audience [...] "a little more favourably disposed" [...] towards the character. In April 2008 Marsters indicated that he expected to return to Torchwood in the near future. He later expressed a desire to be part of Torchwoods fourth series after it was revealed the show would be largely produced in Los Angeles.|$|E

NPR's Ken Tucker and Emily Yang of The Signal said that the recording's sound was reminiscent of the 60's pop. Nina Baniamer of Contactmusic.com found the track's production [...] "epic and ambitious" [...] and called the [...] "anthemic" [...] song [...] "sure fire hit". The Boston Globe critic Ken Capobianco praised the song for its [...] "artfully arranged throwback" [...] and exalted Mars's vocals on his love songs, such as [...] "Marry You". Leah Greenblatt, writing for Entertainment Weekly, stated that [...] "Marry You" [...] has [...] "a malt-shop heart" [...] beating beneath its [...] "digital skin", which shows innovation and creativity. The Independent music critic, Andy Gill, flattered the single by calling it [...] "overly ingratiating". Blues & Soul said that [...] "Marry You" [...] is the second part of Just The Way You Are', similarly the [...] "euphoria gets deployed", there is simplicity on the song which culminate in [...] "the perfect platform for Mars' angst ridden yearning vocals to ride over the top complete with church bells."

500|$|After a stage {{each for}} the {{breakaway}} and the sprinters, during {{which there were}} no major changes to the overall standings, the riders were faced with the very climbing-intensive final two road stages. The [...] team rode a very hard tempo in stage 19 over the Passo del Mortirolo, which eventually whittled that group down to just Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi. They crossed the Mortirolo more than two minutes ahead of Arroyo, which was nearly enough time to make Basso the virtual race leader. Arroyo, noted as a far better descender than Basso, took very aggressive lines coming down the Mortirolo and caught up with Vinokourov, Sastre, Evans, and John Gadret, who had been {{between him and the}} leading trio. Basso's group had only 30 seconds on Arroyo's {{at the start of the}} stage-concluding Aprica climb, but they took more and more time as the climb went on and finished three minutes ahead, giving Basso the pink jersey with two days left to race. Arroyo elected not to try to aggressively descend any of the four large climbs on course in the final road race stage, settling for second place by riding with Basso and the other top riders in the peloton most of the day. There were a few changes in time gaps, but the same riders remained in the top ten from the previous day, as Johan Tschopp won the stage from a breakaway. The individual time trial in Verona which closed out the Giro also provided for small changes to the overall, but Basso's 15th place on the stage was easily <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> Giro champion. Arroyo and Nibali rounded out the podium.|$|E
