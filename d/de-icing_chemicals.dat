40|$|Transport and {{degradation}} of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemical</b> (containing propylene glycol, PG) in the vadose zone were studied with a lysimeter experiment and a model, in which transient water flow, kinetic degradation of PG and soil chemistry were combined. The lysimeter experiment indicated that aerobic {{as well as}} anaerobic degradation occurs in the vadose zone. Therefore, the model included both types of degradation, which {{was made possible by}} assuming advection-controlled (mobile) and diffusion-controlled (immobile) zones. In the mobile zone, oxygen can be transported by diffusion in the gas phase. The immobile zone is always water-saturated, and oxygen only diffuses slowly in the water phase. Therefore, the model is designed {{in a way that the}} redox potential can decrease when PG is degraded, and thus, anaerobic degradation can occur. In our model, manganese oxide (MnO 2, which is present in the soil) and NO 3 - - 3 (applied to enhance biodegradation) can be used as electron acceptors for anaerobic degradation. The application of NO 3 - - 3 does not result in a lower leaching of PG nor in a slower depletion of MnO 2. The thickness of the snowcover influences the leached fraction of PG, as with a high infiltration rate, transport is fast, there is less time for degradation and thus more PG will leach. The model showed that, in this soil, the effect of the water flow dominates over the effect of the degradation parameters on the leaching at a 1 -m depth...|$|R
40|$|Road surface {{conditions}} must {{be monitored}} constantly and classified accurately (icy vs. snowy vs. dry etc.) to give decision-makers {{the information they}} need to carry out highway winter maintenance effectively. In the USA and around the world, thousands of automatic road weather stations (RWSs) are installed at roadsides to serve this purpose. Since information on road "slipperiness " is critical for driver safety, the RWS information must be as accurate as possible. Vaisala has designed and introduced a new model of pavement sensor to market. It measures surface water thickness on the pavement using an optical reflection method. The information on water layer thickness leads to improved accuracy in the measurement of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemical</b> concentration in the surface solution. In addition, the new optical reflection method enables snow detection based on high reflection value. Both of these factors improve the detection accuracy of pavement conditions. This paper describes the results of laboratory and field tests that were conducted using the Vaisala pavement sensor, described above, attached to a road weather station. Several different salt concentrations were measured in the laboratory with an accuracy of 10 % or better. The water layer thickness measurement results are presented in the range of 0 [...] . 8 mm.

Overall, 81 bridges constructed with ECR were sampled. Fick 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law was applied in this study to estimate the time required to reach the corrosive threshold of chloride concentration at the rebar level i. e., the time length of the corrosion initiation stage. No signs of corrosion were observed on the rebars collected from uncracked locations. Rebars that had surface corrosion undercutting the epoxy coating were those collected from cores that were taken from cracked locations. In general, no delaminations or spalls were found on the decks where these bars were cored. The surface chloride concentration at 1 / 22 ̆ 2 below the deck surface and the diffusion constant were found to be 14. 0 lb/yd 3 and 0. 05 in 2 /yr respectively.

40|$|Winter-runoff from {{airports}} {{contains a}} high fraction of contaminated stormwater. Contaminants such as <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> propylene glycol and potassium formate, heavy metals and PAHs are often present in stormwater runoff from airports {{and contribute to}} pollution of groundwater and surface water. Installing granular filters along the runway, {{can be seen as}} an alternative solution to remove contaminants by means of physical processes such as filtration, adsorption and by biodegradation. As a part of the project Klima 2050, the hydraulic performance of five different filter media, consisting of fine, coarse and mixed Filtralite materials provided by Weber Saint-Gobain and activated carbon, was tested for treatment of stormwater. The synthetical stormwater used in the tests represented the first flush of winter-runoff from airports exposed to <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> and contained sediments and <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> from Værnes Airport in Trondheim, provided by Avinor. A column study consisting of four series of tests; with two different flows and two different concentrations of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> was conducted to investigate the hydraulic performance of the different filter media in varying conditions and the removal of turbidity, suspended solids, <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> and heavy metals. The results showed that the hydraulic performance of the different filter media varied {{depending on the type of}} media used and the conditions tested. Whereas the experiments with high flow lasted only one day before the filters were clogged, the experiments with low flow lasted 5 - 7 days before clogging. All filter media provided good removal, between 93. 8 % and 99. 6 %, of particles by size exclusion, while adsorption (with removal of between approximately 10 % and 40 % of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals)</b> only was observed in the filter media with an activated carbon layer.

Over all, the tested filter media showed acceptable hydraulic performance, both in terms of suspended solids removed and operation time before clogging. All filters, with two exeptions, removed more than 1. 2 kg/m 2 suspended solids per surface area before clogging.

40|$|At {{airports}} in Norway, propylene glycol (PG) and potassium formate (PF) {{are used as}} <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> to provide safe air traffic.

In addition, air traffic is expected to increase. <b>De-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> degradation has a finite capacity, mainly dependent on nutrients, oxygen and temperature. In this thesis, some filter media have been tested to evaluate adsorption and biodegradation capacity of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Filtralite media is today used for drinking- and wastewater treatment. Filtralite media is a promising media in a bioretention system, due to low head loss and high storage capacity. Batch experiments and column experiment have been conducted to investigate adsorption and biological degradation of the <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> propylene glycol and potassium formate. Batch experiments were performed to investigate adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC), Filtralite NC 0 - 2 and Filtralite NC 0. 8 - 1. 6. Adsorption was shown onto GAC. Linear isotherm was found as best-fit for both chemicals (PG, R 2 = 0. 99 and PF, R 2 = 0. 94). PG and PF showed similar power indexes with Freundlich isotherm, close to 1 (1 /n of 0. 883 and 0. 871 respectively), which indicate that adsorption onto GAC was not very high {{for any of the}} <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Second order kinetics fitted best for both chemicals. No adsorption onto the Filtralite media was observed. Columns were filled with Filtralite NC 0. 8 - 1. 6 (Column 1) and Filtralite NC 1. 5 - 2. 5 (Column 2). Synthetic stormwater was prepared with concentration of 20 mg/l PG and 13. 4 mg/l PF. Degradation in a 1 m 3 feed tank was investigated prior to the column experiment, to find that 50 % of the <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> were degraded after 5 days. This resulted in changing the synthetic stormwater every day to prevent the risk of degradation. Degradation in the columns was shown to be significant in the upper ~ 15 cm for both columns, while degradation in the lower parts of the columns were not significant. Initial removal in the upper ~ 15 cm was 20 % for column 1 and 15 % for column 2. Increased phosphorous and nitrogen in the synthetic stormwater showed improved degradation (C:N:P= 24 : 7 : 1), with the average of 50 % removal through both the filters in the columns. Results from Iwasaki modelling showed increased filtration coefficients after nutrient addition. Clogging occurred in the top 15 cm of the filter. From these results it was found a lifetime of 2 years for the filters tested in the column experiment, which is relatively low, probably due to high sediment loading. In reality the sediment load might actually be less than in the column experiment, however sediment loading was necessary due to the need of bacteria for the biofilter form the sediments. A top layer of GAC in the biofilter was considered, however a biofilter with a GAC layer on top reduces the lifetime of the filter due to clogging, and is therefore not recommended due to low adsorption capacity.

40|$|In recent times, fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) bars {{have been}} used as a replacement for conventional steel reinforcing bars in reinforced concrete members where the corrosion of steel is a major problem as a result of severely aggressive environments. The application of FRP bars as reinforcement in concrete structures has thus been proposed as a potential {{solution to the problem of}} steel corrosion in aggressive environments; however, the use of FRP could introduce other durability problems such as alkali resistant resins/fibres, <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemical</b> resistance, creep rupture of fibres, ultra-violet resistance, and freeze-thaw performance. One of the problems is long-term bond behaviour between FRP bars and concrete. FRP bars are coated with a polymer which is known to experience time-dependant deformation (creep) under sustained loads. It is anticipated that creep of the bars' coating and/or the bars' surface features (lugs) could be a factor contributing to the total creep in the reinforced concrete system. Also, glass FRP (GFRP) bars may deteriorate in water and alkaline environments if the coating is damaged and the glass fibres are exposed to water and alkaline solutions which are harmful for the glass fibres. An experimental program was conducted in two phases to study the long-term bond behaviour between FRP bars and concrete under sustained loads. Also, the effects of water and alkaline solutions on the bond between FRP bars and concrete under sustained loads were investigated. In Phase I, two types of carbon FRP bars (CFRP) and one type of glass FRP bar (GFRP), in addition to conventional steel rebar, were used to make pullout specimens which were tested under various levels of sustained loads at room temperature and exposed to air. In Phase II, three different types of GFRP bars were employed in pullout specimens that were tested under two different sustained load levels in three different environments at room temperature. In this phase, the specimens were either submerged in water or an alkaline solution, or were exposed to air. To help explain the test results, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) techniques were used to examine the materials and the tested specimens. It was concluded that one of the two CFRP bars and the GFRP bar used in Phase I exhibited poor bond performance under sustained loads when compared to companion steel specimens. Deterioration of the bars' surface features was observed in these FRP bars. The other type of CFRP bar tested performed well in terms of long-term bond behaviour under sustained loads. For the FRP bars used in Phase II, bond degradation between the bars and concrete was not a problem. All three bars showed good bond behaviour under sustained loads. Instead, shear failure at the fibre-matrix interface was found to be a problem, causing a decrease in tensile strength of the bars under sustained loads. SEM investigation revealed circumferential cracks at the fibre-matrix interface in the bars' cross-sections, especially in the specimens tested at higher load levels. X-ray maps, obtained using EMPA, indicated no sign of calcium ion ingress in any of the specimens tested in Phase II. However, some specimens tested in water and alkaline solutions failed sooner than the companion specimens tested in air. This may have been because of degradation of the matrix due to absorption of water, although no evidence of deterioration of the matrix could be found...|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{may also}} use electrically heated resistive elements {{embedded in a}} rubber sheet cemented to the leading edges of wings and tail surfaces, propeller leading edges, and helicopter rotor blade leading edges.

Formerly used urea, which causes environmental concerns, {{has been replaced by}} mainly potassium formate and potassium acetate based <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Also betaine based products, developed in Finland, are used as de-icers. The introduction of these new alkali metal based de-icers was followed by an increase in the occurrence of corrosion in different parts of aircrafts, such as cadmium-plated steel parts. The aim of this thesis was to study the corrosive effect of several new <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> on cadmium coat-ings and to compare results obtained using various test methods. 	This thesis consists of theoretical and experimental parts. In the literature review, the corrosion mechanisms of cadmium are presented, the <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> as a corrosive environment are evaluated, and different corrosion tests for examining the in-fluence of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> on cadmium coatings are described. In the experimental part, the results from different corrosion tests are compared and the corrosive effect of de-icers is researched. Also the effect of de-icing chemical concentration and the cad-mium coating quality on corrosion are examined. The chemicals used in the tests were commercial potassium formate and acetate, pure potassium formate and acetate as well as betaine based commercial de-icing chemical. In this thesis, four different test pro-grams were used, from which two are immersion tests and two cyclic exposure tests, in which the specimens are in turns immersed in the de-icing chemical and in turns in en-vironmental exposure in a heating chamber. The specimens contained four different types of cadmium coatings deposited in three different coating plants. The corrosive ef-fect of each de-icer on cadmium coatings were evaluated after the corrosion tests by weight change measurements and scanning electron microscope. 	According to the results, potassium formates were more corrosive than potassium acetates based on the higher measured weight losses. Betaine based Betafrost B did not cause significant weight changes, thus being the least corrosive of the studied chemicals. In the one month long cyclic exposure test, Boeing 2004, corrosion inhibitors included in commercial potassium formate and commercial potassium acetate decreased the corrosion rate of cadmium, whereas according to the two weeks long cyclic exposure test, AMS G- 12 (2009), the corrosion inhibitors did not decrease the corrosion rate. Undiluted chemicals caused significantly more corrosion on the cadmium coatings than chemicals diluted to 50 % and 25 % by their weight. According to the one month long cyclic exposure test, dull finished specimens lost less weight than bright finished, but otherwise the quality of the cadmium coatings did not influence substantially the results. 	Immersion tests did not produce very reliable results because of the large devia-tions caused by the small weight changes. One day long standardized immersion test ASTM F 1111 was insufficient for evaluating the corrosive effect of de-icers on cad-mium coatings, and {{there is a need to}} develop a new better standard test procedure. Test results were very sensitive to the variation of test parameters, for example temperature and humidity, and therefore the test parameters should be defined precisely when devel-oping a new test method. /Kir 1...|$|E

Several field experiments examining the transport and degradation of propyleneglycol (PG), potassium acetate (KAc) and non-reactive tracers were performed in a lysimeter trench under natural snowmelting conditions. Chemicals were applied underneath the snow cover and the transport in a heterogeneous coarse sandy soil was examined by extracting soil water from 30 or 40 suction cups placed at five depths between 0. 4 and 2. 4 m depth. Transport and degradation was analysed by spatial moment calculations. The <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> showed the same basic displacement as chemically inactive tracers, an initial fast transport during the melting period followed by a period of stagnation throughout the summer season. PG seemed to be displaced to greater depths compared to non-reactive tracer after the first application.

Potassium acetate showed some adsorption, with calculated retardation factors of approximately 1. 3 and 1. 2. The degradation rate constant for PG was calculated to be 0. 015 day− 1 in 1994 and increased to 0. 047 day− 1 in the second application made in 1995.

40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} the use of cross-borehole {{electrical}} resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys as a monitoring method of the infiltration of snowmelt containing <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL) is located on Norway’s largest rain fed aquifer. The winter conditions require the use of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> (propylene glycol, PG, and potassium formate, KFo) due to safe air traffic. The groundwater is protected by law against contamination and as the <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> are spread {{to the side of the}} runways, OSL is dependent on the transport rate and degradation capacity of the unsaturated zone. ERT is currently being tested in field as a monitoring method for the infiltration of <b>de-icing</b> <b>chemicals</b> and their degradation in the unsaturated zone. A tracer experiment was carried out at Moreppen which is a research station located outside the area of OSL. PG and KFo were applied on the snow cover prior to the snowmelt in 2010 at two separate walls (north and south wall) of a lysimeter trench together with an inactive tracer (Br-). The infiltration of chemicals and snowmelt at these two walls were monitored by cross-borehole ERT. Time-lapse inversions showing the difference in resistivity between the time of interest and a background dataset were compared, and the south wall infiltration monitored by the ERT was compared to extraction of soil water by the use of suction cups (Prenart Super Quartz) installed in the soil profile. Looking at time-lapse inversions, infiltration of melt water and conductive chemicals is clearly seen. The north wall showed greater depth of infiltration with higher reduction in resistivity compared to the south wall. This can be due to coarse layers of sediment at different depth in the two profiles slowing down the infiltration. PG applied to the south wall is not conductive and KFo is, explaining differences in reduction of resistivity. The infiltration depth suggested by the suction cups was shallower than shown by the ERT for the south wall indicating that either infiltrating water was transported deeper than Br- or that old water was pushed deeper by piston flow. Time-lapse inversions are shown here to be a good qualitative method to monitor infiltration of water and conductive chemicals at a scale of a few meters, such as in field experiments. Individual inversions for the south and north wall of the separate datasets were temperature corrected. Electrical resistivity is temperature dependent and to be able to view changes due to solute and water content needs to be removed. ERT gives mainly qualitative inversion results and to obtain quantitative information in form of water content and saturation the inversions for the south wall were converted using petro-physical relationships and fitting parameters from soil at Moreppen. Yeh et al. (2002) ’s formula for water content gave values within the expected range when comparing the values to previous water content measurements. Saturation calculated from Archie’s law seems to be limited by the uncertainty of estimated porosity as the porosity is likely changing through the profile and might give better results when looking at change in saturation when porosity can be assumed fixed. As translating ERT inversions to water content using the fitting parameters for the Moreppen soil has been shown here to be within a realistic range, the conversion has the potential to calculate the solute resistivity and change in solute over time if water content is known. Combining ERT with a method to measure water content (e. g. TDR) would allow the inversions, using these formulas, to be converted to solute which is of interest when monitoring contamination in the subsurface. Joint inversions with cross-borehole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys will provide superior inversions.

40|$|Atmospheric icing from {{supercooled}} droplets in {{the atmosphere}} can have catastrophic consequences {{for a number of}} man-made structures in regions with cold climate and at high altitude, resulting in accidents with both socioeconomic losses and loss of human lives. To mitigate the icing problem, active <b>de-icing</b> involving <b>chemical,</b> thermal and mechanical techniques have been developed to remove ice that has already accumulated. These techniques are sub-optimal, however, as they are plagued with problems such as high energy consumption, hazard to the environment, high economic costs, and need for frequent reapplication. This thesis takes a look at an entirely different approach, namely utilizing superhydrophobic surfaces to reduce or eliminate the accumulation and adhesion of ice from the outset. Much of the research in the field of superhydrophobicity has involved surfaces with open-cell structures, e. g. pillar-like surfaces and surfaces with bumps and valleys. It has been reported that surfaces with closed cells have a comparative advantage in that they are better at retaining their hydrophobic properties under pressure. This thesis investigates the wetting properties (which are often closely tied to icephobic properties) of closed-cell structures further, using LAMMPS simulations. The simulations show that wetting on these surfaces satisfies the well-known theories of Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter. However, on the small scale on which the simulations were carried out, the effect of tuning the roughness scale is not as predicted by theory. Furthermore, no comparative advantage against open-cell structures could be demonstrated for the closed-cell surfaces. A physical experiment was also carried out, in which the influence of water condensation on the dynamic behavior of water droplets on a nearly-superhydrophobic black silicon surface was tested. The results confirm a well-known problem: Condensation severely deteriorates the water repellency of hydrophobic surfaces. The literature review and experiments in this thesis shows that superhydrophobic surfaces have a great potential for use in anti-icing applications, demonstrating delayed freezing, reduced ice accumulation, and reduced ice adhesion. Nevertheless, major problems are yet to be solved, including deterioration of icephobicity due to mechanical damage, and reduced icephobicity in humid conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Effective winter {{maintenance}} {{makes use}} of freezing-point-depressant chemicals to prevent {{the formation of the}} bond between snow and ice and the highway pavement. In performing such winter maintenance, the selection of appropriate chemicals for the bond prevention task involves consideration of a number of factors, as indicated in Nixon and Williams (2001). The factors are in essence performance measurements of the chemicals, and as such can be easily incorporated into a specification document to allow for selection of the best chemical(s) for a given agency to use in its winter maintenance activities. Once performance measures for <b>de-icing</b> or anti-icing <b>chemicals</b> have been specified, this allows the creation of a quality control program for the acceptance of those chemicals. This paper presents a series of performance measurement tests for chemicals, and discusses the role that they can play in such a quality control program. Some tests are simple and rapid enough that they can be performed on every load of chemicals received, while for others, a sampling technique must be used. An appropriate sampling technique is presented in the paper. Further, each test is categorized as to whether it should be applied to every load of chemicals or on a sampling basis. However, applying quality controls to the chemicals as received is only part of a much broader quality program. This paper will explore how the quality control of chemicals can be extended into a program that applies quality measures throughout winter maintenance activities. Obviously, such an extension involves performance measures, and these issues will also be considered...|$|R

An appropriate sampling technique is presented. Further, each test is categorized as to whether it should be applied to every load of ice-control products or on a sampling basis. The study includes a detailed literature review that considers the performance of ice-control products in three areas: temperature related performance, product consistency, and negative side effects. The negative side effects are further broken down into three areas, namely operational side effects (such as chemical slipperiness), environmental side effects, and infrastructural side effects (such as corrosion of vehicles and damage to concrete). The review indicated that in the area of side effects the field performance of ice-control products is currently so difficult to model in the laboratory that no particular specification tests can be recommended at this time. A study of the impact of ice-control products on concrete was performed by Professor Wang of Iowa State University as a sub-contract to this study, and has been presented to the Iowa Highway Research Board prior to this report...|$|R
