5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> particles in the nucleon. These <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral.</b> A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

Though simple atomic nuclei formed {{within the first}} three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> atoms formed. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According {{to general}} {{relativity}} gravitation effects any objects carrying the energy.

5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral.</b> If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, {{one with the}} cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral,</b> the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E

40|$|We derive the {{equation}} of state (EOS) for <b>electrically</b> charge <b>neutral</b> dense matter using Quantum Hadrodynamics (QHD) model. This is carried out in a nonperturbative manner including quantum corrections for baryons through a realignment of vacuum with baryon-antibaryon condensates. This yields the results of relativistic Hartree approximation of summing over baryonic tadpole diagrams. The quantum corrections from the scalar meson is also {{taken into account in}} a similar way. This leads to a softening of {{the equation}} of state for the hyperonic matter. The formalism also allows us to do a self consistent calculation of the in-medium sigma meson mass. The effects of such quantum corrections on the composition of charge neutral dense matter is considered. The effect of the resulting EOS on the structure of the neutron stars is also studied.

5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E
25|$|Neutrinos {{may have}} {{another source of}} mass through the Majorana mass term. This type of mass applies for <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> {{particles}} since otherwise it would allow particles to turn into anti-particles, which would violate conservation of electric charge.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electrically</b> reduced <b>neutral</b> red (NR) {{served as}} the sole source of {{reducing}} power for growth and metabolism of pure and mixed cultures of H 2 -consuming bacteria in a novel electrochemical bioreactor system. NR was continuously reduced by the cathodic potential (− 1. 5 V) generated from an electric current (0. 3 to 1. 0 mA), and it was subsequently oxidized by Actinobacillus succinogenes or by mixed methanogenic cultures. The A. succinogenes mutant strain FZ- 6 did not grow on fumarate alone unless electrically reduced NR or hydrogen was present as the electron donor for succinate production. The mutant strain, unlike the wild type, lacked pyruvate formate lyase and formate dehydrogenase. Electrically reduced NR also replaced hydrogen as the sole electron donor source for growth and production of methane from CO 2. These results show that both pure and mixed cultures can function as electrochemical devices when electrically generated reducing power {{can be used to}} drive metabolism.

40|$|We examine <b>electrically</b> {{and color}} <b>neutral</b> quark matter in beta-equilibrium {{focusing}} {{on the possibility of}} mixed phases between different color superconducting phases. To that end we apply the Gibbs criterion to ensure phase equilibrium and discuss the external conditions under which these mixed phases can occur. Neglecting surface and Coulomb effects we find a rich structure of different mixed phases with up to four components, including 2 SC and CFL matter as well as more ``exotic'' components, like a phase with us- and ds-pairing but without ud-pairing. Preliminary estimates indicate, however, that the mixed phases become unstable if surface and Coulomb effects are included.

40|$|We studied {{electrical}} transport in magnetic semiconductors, {{which is}} determined by scattering of free carriers off localized magnetic moments. We calculated the scattering time and the mobility of the majority and minority-spin carriers with both the effects of thermal spin fluctuations and of spatial disorder of magnetic atoms taken into account. These {{are responsible for the}} magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin fluctuations thus promoting negative magnetoresistance. Simultaneously, scattering off the built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spin concentrations may increase with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the magnetic field. It promotes positive magnetoresistance. We discuss the role of the above effects on magnetoresistance of non-degenerate semiconductors where magnetic impurities are <b>electrically</b> active or <b>neutral...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{neutrino}} is {{so named}} because it is <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> and because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was originally thought to be zero.

Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected.|$|E
25|$|As the {{universe}} expanded, adiabatic cooling caused the energy {{density of the}} plasma to decrease until it became favorable for electrons to combine with protons, forming hydrogen atoms. This recombination event happened when the temperature was around 3000K or when {{the universe}} was approximately 379,000years old. As photons did not interact with these <b>electrically</b> <b>neutral</b> atoms, the former began to travel freely through space, resulting in the decoupling of matter and radiation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Motivated by {{the fact}} that {{neutrino}}s are massive, we study the effect of neutrino Yukawa couplings on neutralino dark matter observables within the framework of a supersymmetric seesaw. We find that neutrino couplings significantly affect the neutralino relic density in regions of parameter space where soft SUSY-breaking slepton masses and/or trilinear couplings are large. Depending {{on the size of the}} couplings, the neutralino relic density spans over an order of magnitude in the A-funnel, focus point and stop-coannihilation regions of mSUGRA. We also show that dark matter detection rates A very attractive aspect of R−parity conserving supersymmetry (SUSY) [1, 2] is that it predicts the existence of a massive, <b>electrically</b> and color <b>neutral,</b> stable weakly interacting particle that is a natural Cold Dark Matter (CDM) candidate.

40|$|The axino is a {{promising}} candidate for dark {{matter in the}} Universe. It is <b>electrically</b> and color <b>neutral,</b> very weakly interacting, and could be - as assumed in this study - the lightest supersymmetric particle, which is stable for unbroken R-parity. In supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, in which the strong CP problem is solved via the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the axino arises naturally as the fermionic superpartner of the axion. We compute the thermal production rate of axinos in supersymmetric QCD. Using hard thermal loop resummation, we obtain a finite result in a gauge-invariant way, which takes into account Debye screening in the hot quark-gluon-squark-gluino plasma. The relic axino abundance from thermal scatterings after inflation is evaluated. We find that thermally produced axinos could provide the dominant part of cold dark matter, for example, for an axino mass of 100 keV and a reheating temperature of 10 ^ 6 GeV.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} and {{investigate}} the "Gapless Color-Flavor Locked " (gCFL) phase, a possible {{new phase of}} dense and cold quark matter. At high enough densities, quarks {{interact with each other}} and form pairs similarly to electrons in superconduc-tors. This phenomenon in the case of quark matter is called Color Superconductiv-ity. Color superconducting matter must be <b>electrically</b> and color <b>neutral,</b> because otherwise there are huge energy costs, due to the charges. At asymptotically high densities, equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks make the system neutral, all the quarks pair, and the quark matter is in the Color-Flavor-Locked phase. At intermediate densities however, the strange quark mass changes the number densities of the quarks and this makes the CFL phase unstable. The gCFL phase emerges {{as a result of the}} strange quark mass effect and the neutrality conditions. The gCFL phase has gapless modes and non-zero electron density, unlike CFL. These new properties of gCFL have significant astrophysical implications. The interior of neutron stars might have densities at the regime where gCFL dominates. If this is the case, we argu...|$|R

Matter is described by classical fields/fluids. We distinguish <b>electrically</b> charged from <b>neutral</b> matter. Electric charge and magnetic flux are postulated to be conserved. As a consequence, the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous Maxwell equations emerge {{expressed in terms of}} the excitation H and the field strength F, respectively. H and F are assumed to fulfill a local and linear "spacetime relation" with 36 constitutive functions. The propagation of electromagnetic waves is considered under such circumstances in the geometric optics limit.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{conditions}} of a possible static equilibrium between spherically symmetric, <b>electrically</b> charged or <b>neutral</b> black holes and ambient matter. The following kinds of matter are considered: (1) neutral and charged matter with a linear equation of state p_r = wρ (for neutral matter {{the results of our}} previous work are reproduced), (2) neutral and charged matter with p_r ∼ρ^m, m > 1, and (3) the possible presence of a "vacuum fluid" (the cosmological constant or, more generally, anything that satisfies the equality T^ 0 _ 0 = T^ 1 _ 1 at least at the horizon). We find a number of new cases of such an equilibrium, including those generalizing the well-known Majumdar-Papapetrou conditions for charged dust. It turns out, in particular, that ultraextremal black holes cannot be in equilibrium with any matter {{in the absence of a}} vacuum fluid; meanwhile, matter with w > 0, if it is properly charged, can surround an extremal charged black hole.
