It was {{furnished}} as such at that time, {{and is now}} a unique survival in England, hearing its last case, that of an attempted suicide of a priest, in the 1930s. Until 1881, the south transept, which is unusually large, also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity: the parish church of St Oswald. Although the 17thcentury saw additions to the furnishings and fittings, there was no further building work for several centuries. By the 19thcentury, the building was badly in need of restoration. The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> is largely the work of Victorian restorers, particularly George Gilbert Scott.|$|E

25|$|Some authors use {{the name}} <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> {{of a simple}} polygon to simply mean the explement <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> (not supplement!) of the {{interior}} angle. This conflicts with the above usage.|$|R
5000|$|In several {{high school}} {{treatments}} of geometry, the term [...] "exterior angle theorem" [...] {{has been applied}} to a different result, namely the portion of Proposition 1.32 which states that the measure of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the remote interior angles. This result, which depends upon Euclid's parallel postulate will be referred to as the [...] "High school <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem" [...] (HSEAT) to distinguish it from Euclid's <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem.|$|R
25|$|Analogously, a {{line segment}} PD through some point D on AB {{extended}} bisects the corresponding exterior angle BPQ where Q is on AP extended. Since {{the interior and}} <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points P such that angle CPD is a right angle forms a circle, of which CD is a diameter.|$|E
25|$|The {{sum of the}} {{measures}} of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space is always 180 degrees. This fact is equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. This allows determination of {{the measure of the}} third angle of any triangle given the measure of two angles. An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of {{the measures}} of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{supplement}} of {{an interior}} angle is called an exterior angle, that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair of angles. There are two <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending {{one of the}} two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem is Proposition 1.16 in Euclid's Elements, {{which states}} that the measure of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a {{triangle}} is greater than either of the measures of the remote interior angles. This is a fundamental result in absolute geometry because its proof does not depend upon the parallel postulate.|$|R

50|$|The {{high school}} <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem (HSEAT) {{says that the}} size of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> at a vertex of a {{triangle}} equals the sum of the sizes of the interior angles at the other two vertices of the triangle (remote interior angles). So, in the picture, the size of angle ACD equals the size of angle ABC plus the size of angle CAB.|$|R

2500|$|Exterior angle – The {{exterior}} angle is the supplementary {{angle to the}} interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle [...] "turned" [...] at a corner is the exterior or external angle.

This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular [...] "eight" [...] or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or starriness of the polygon.

Consider a spherical triangle one of whose vertices is the North Pole {{and the other two}} lie on the equator. The sides of the triangle emanating from the North Pole (great circles of the sphere) both meet the equator at right angles, so this triangle has an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> that is equal to a remote interior angle. The other interior angle (at the North Pole) can be made larger than 90°, further emphasizing the failure of this statement. However, since the Euclid's <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem is a theorem in absolute geometry it is automatically valid in hyperbolic geometry.|$|R

5000|$|A {{triangle}} {{has three}} corners, called vertices. The {{sides of a}} triangle (line segments) that come together at a vertex form two angles (four angles if you consider {{the sides of the}} triangle to be lines instead of line segments). Only one of these angles contains the third side of the triangle in its interior, and this angle is called an interior angle of the triangle. In the picture below, the angles ∠ABC, ∠BCA and ∠CAB are the three interior angles of the triangle. An <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> is formed by extending one of the sides of the triangle; the angle between the extended side and the other side is the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle.</b> In the picture, angle ∠ACD is an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R
