A metal duct wall was used as the impingement surface with an applied heat flux of 100 kW/m(2), which for a gas turbine combustor cooling application operating at steady state with a temperature difference of similar to 450 K corresponds to a convective heat transfer coefficient of similar to 200 W/m(2) K.

Of the softer coatings tested the flexible polyurethane coatings seem to have promise for future use in fluid-borne sand particle erosion environments. Pure epoxy coatings show typical brittle erosion behaviour, with fusion-bonded epoxy having mixed ductile and brittle behaviour and glass fibre reinforced epoxy showing strong ductile behaviour. CVD deposited coatings of either boron carbide or diamond are the most resistant surfaces tested and outperform bulk ceramics such as silicon carbide by orders of magnitude for Ek< 8 ?J and 90 ° <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> angle. Areas requiring further research to allow accurate prediction of coating life are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a fundamental gas-kinetic study {{on a high}} speed planar rarefied jet impinging on a flat plate of specular reflections. Based on previous collisionless planar free jet results, it is straightforward to obtain <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> flowfield solutions, and <b>jet</b> <b>impingement</b> for specular reflective plate surface properties. Several direct simulation Monte Carlo simulation results are provided and they validate these analytical solutions of rarefied planar jet flows. The results can find applications in many disciplines, such as materials processing, molecular beams, and space engineering...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional {{arrays of}} {{circular}} air jets impinging on a heat transfer surface {{parallel to the}} jet orifice plate are considered. The <b>jet</b> flow, after <b>impingement,</b> is constrained to exit in a single direction along the channel formed by the jet orifice plate and the heat transfer surface. In addition to the crossflow which originates from the <b>jets</b> following <b>impingement,</b> an initial crossflow is present which approaches the array through an upstream extension of the channel. The temperature of the initial crossflow air may differ from the jet air temperature. The configurations considered are intended to model the impingement cooled midchord region of gas turbine airfoils in cases where an initial crossflow is also present. Nusselt numbers and dimensionless adiabatic wall temperatures resolved to one streamwise jet hole spacing were experimentally determined for ratios of the initial crossflow rate to the total jet flow rate ranging from zero to unity. These are presented and discussed relative to the flow and geometric parameters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} and original {{framework for the}} biomechanical analysis of patients affected by ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm and aortic insufficiency. Our aim is to obtain crucial indications about {{the role played by}} deranged hemody-namics on the ATAAs risk of rupture. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed using patient-specific geometries and boundary conditions derived from 4 D MRI. Blood flow helicity and wall shear stress descriptors were assessed. A bulge inflation test was carried out in vitro on the 4 ATAAs after surgical repair. The healthy volunteers showed no eccentric blood flow, a mean TAWSS of 1. 5 ± 0. 3 Pa and mean OSI of 0. 325 ± 0. 025. In 3 aneurismal patients, <b>jet</b> flow <b>impingement</b> on the aortic wall resulted in large TAWSS values and low OSI which were amplified by the AI degree. However, the tissue strength {{did not appear to be}} significantly reduced. The fourth patient, which showed the lowest TAWSS due to the absence of jet flow, had the smallest strength in vitro. Interestingly this patient presented a bovine arch abnormality. <b>Jet</b> flow <b>impingement</b> with high WSS values is frequent in ATAAs and our methodology seems to be appropriate for determining whether it may increase the risk of rupture or not...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral aneurysms are a {{pathological}} vessel dilatation that bear {{a high risk}} of rupture. For the understanding and evaluation of the risk of rupture, the analysis of hemodynamic information plays an important role. Besides quantitative hemodynamic information, also qualitative flow characteristics, e. g., the inflow <b>jet</b> and <b>impingement</b> zone are correlated with the risk of rupture. However, the assessment of these two characteristics is currently based on an interactive visual investigation of the flow field, obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or blood flow measurements. We present an automatic and robust detection as well as an expressive visualization of these characteristics. The detection can be used to support a comparison, e. g., of simulation results reflecting different treatment options. Our approach utilizes local streamline properties to formalize the inflow <b>jet</b> and <b>impingement</b> zone. We extract a characteristic seeding curve on the ostium, on which an inflow jet boundary contour is constructed. Based on this boundary contour we identify the impingement zone. Furthermore, we present several visualization techniques to depict both characteristics expressively. Thereby, we consider accuracy and robustness of the extracted characteristics, minimal visual clutter and occlusions. An evaluation with six domain experts confirms that our approach detects both hemodynamic characteristics reasonably...|$|R
