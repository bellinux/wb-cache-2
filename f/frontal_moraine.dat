40|$|Monitoring {{of three}} moraine lakes (two {{of which are}} located on <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines,</b> and one is lateral) lasted some years. It was defined that each lake has {{individual}} temperature mode which depends partly by air temperature and much more by incoming melted waters, volume of their accumulation and type of underlying rocks. Type of underlying rock in which the lake kettle is formed has decisive importance. Direct contact of lake water with glacier ice gives its temperature during ablation period of 2. 54 °С or in 3. 1 times lower, than in frontal lakes. That’s why the dam quickly collapses and the lake volume increases. Dams of the lakes located on <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines</b> are subject of destruction much less. Dynamics of these lakes is caused by retreat of glaciers, and the maximum depths are fixed in {{the central part of}} a lake. Water temperature during the cold period remains here steadily positive and promotes formation of filtration channels in the layer with moraine sediments which almost without ice. The increasing of lakes occurs due to ice ablation from the nearest glacier. Precipitations, if they influence to the change of water level in lakes, are not essential. </p...|$|R

The toolbox performance has been evaluated using two extant glaciers, an icefield and a cirque/valley glacier from which the subglacial topography is known, using the basic reconstruction routine in GlaRe.

Three boulders from a <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine</b> were dated with the cosmogenic nuclide isotope 10 Be. The results demonstrate that the boulders have been exposed since 15. 24 Â± 0. 85 ka. This age constrains {{the formation of the}} <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine</b> to the Oldest Dryas cold event. This age fits with that of other glacier deposits dated to the Older Dryas in the Alps, Balkans, Carpathians and Turkish mountains. The Pelister palaeoglacier has been reconstructed and its equilibrium line altitude extracted, returning a value of 2250 ma. s. l. This is in good agreement with the equilibrium line altitudes of most other reconstructed glaciers of the same age in the circum- Mediterranean mountains, demonstrating a comparable response to the Oldest Dryas event. Other palaeoenvironmental records near the Pelister mountain indicate that the Older Dryas was here characterized by a cold and remarkably dry event. The temporal relationship between Older Dryas glacier advances in the Balkan region and recorded changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation during the Laurentide Ice Sheet massive ice discharge (H 1 event) confirms the strong climatic link between the pan-Mediterranean regions and the North Atlantic Ocean...|$|E

This diagram has been reproduced in so many text-books, that it may be worth-while pointing out a fault in its construction. The case represented by the authors is that of two terminal amphitheatres lying within eachother (fig. 1) 1). The manner in which the outer moraine with its fluvio-glacial fan of sediments is drawn in on top of the inner moraine proves it to be the younger of the two. In this case the glacier must have ridden over the inner circle, thereby destroying its ridge; but in the drawing this ridge is represented as having been left perfectly intact.

40|$|The {{methodology}} for reconstructing late Holocene glacier dynamics in the Torngat Mountains will involve: (i) mapping of former ice marginal positions, marked by abandoned <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines</b> and valley-side trimlines, using colour aerial photographs (1 : 40, 000 scale, 2005) {{of the region}} (Figure 4); (ii) dating of moraine sequences in front of selected glaciers using established lichenometric techniques (Box 1); and (iii) reconstructing an integrated record of ice cover through measurement of in situ cosmogenic radionuclide inventories in rock surfaces recently exposed by receding glaciers (Box 2). Mountain glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change and are important for both global sea level rise and local ecosystems. In the Torngat Mountains of northern Labrador, there are 59 small cirque glaciers (< 1. 5 km 2) covering an area of 16. 7 km 2.

We demonstrate the link between European and Chinese loess sequences, dust records in Greenland, and variations in the North Atlantic sea ice extent.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{deglaciation}} of the present-day ice-free environments in the Maritime Antarctica has profound geomorphological and ecological implications. However, {{the timing of}} glacier retreat is still poorly understood. This {{is the case of}} the deglaciated areas existing in Byers (Livingston Island) and Barton (King George Island) peninsulas. The dating of the basal sediments collected from different lakes in these two peninsulas allowed inferences of the ages of formation of each lake. The integration of these ages enables the reconstruction ofthe spatial and temporal pattern of deglaciation of these areas. The chronological framework has been establishedusing two complementary techniques: radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating. In both peninsulas the deglaciation started during the Early Holocene, around 8 ka cal BP. The areas located far away from the current ice domes and the highest peaks in the two peninsulas (nunataks) were the first areas to become ice -free. During the mid- Holocene (5 - 6 ka cal BP) the central part of these peninsulas was progressively deglaciated.

40|$|Moraines {{marking the}} Neoglacial limits in Svalbard are {{commonly}} ice cored. Investigating {{the nature of}} this relict ice is important because it can aid our understanding of former glacier dynamics. This paper examines the composition of the lateral–frontal moraine associated with the Neoglacial limit at Austre Lovénbreen and assesses the likely geomorphological evolution. The moraine was investigated using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), with context being provided by structural mapping of the glacier based on an oblique aerial image from 1936 and vertical aerial imagery from 2003. Multiple up-glacier dipping reflectors and syncline structures are found in the GPR surveys. The reflectors are most clearly defined in lateral positions, where the moraine is substantially composed of ice. The frontal area of the moraine is dominantly composed of debris. The core of the lateral part of the moraine is likely to consist of stacked sequences of basal ice that have been deformed by strong longitudinal compression. The long term preservation potential of the ice-dominated lateral moraine is negligible, whereas the preservation of the debris-dominated <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine</b> is high. A glacier surface bulge, identified on the 1936 aerial imagery, provides evidence that Austre Lovénbreen has previously displayed surge activity, although it is highly unlikely {{to do so in the}} near future in its current state.

40|$|Glacial {{features}} were described {{for the first}} time on the Galicia Mountains, a mountain range separating the lakes of Ohrid and Prespa in Macedonia. The geomorphological mapping of part of this range allowed to document the existence of frontal and lateral moraines, as well as trimlines, cirques and polished rocks. These glacial features allowed the reconstruction of the original topography of the glaciers that deposited the frontal moraines. The Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) of three different phases of expansion was calculated (ca. 1850 m, ca. 2000 m and 2130 m a. s. l.) through the Area-Altitude Balance Ratio (AABR) method, and correlated with the values available for the Balkan region and northern Greece. An attribution to Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Lateglacial (Oldest and Younger Dryas) was argued for the glacial phases of Galicica Mountains, in agreement with the ELAs of dated moraines in the region, as well as in the Apennines and Maritime Alps. Through the extrapolation of summer temperatures at the ELAs for the single glacial phases, the amount of precipitation needed to sustain the glaciers existence was calculated (3500 - 3700 mm of weq) using a well established polynomial regression. The attribution to the LGM of the lowermost <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine</b> points out to an older age for the till found well below the examined area, near the Prespa Lake shore.

40|$|Continuity of {{sediment}} transfer through glacial systems {{is essential to}} maintain subglacial bedrock erosion, yet transfer at temperate glaciers with overdeepened beds, where subglacial fluvial sediment transport should be greatly limited by adverse slopes, remains poorly understood. Complex multiple transfer processes in temperate overdeepened systems has been indicated {{by the presence of}} large <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine</b> systems, supraglacial debris of mixed transport origin, thick basal ice sequences, and englacial thrusts and eskers. At Svínafellsjökull, thrusts comprising decimetre-thick debris-rich bands of stratified facies ice of basal origin, with a coarser size distribution and higher clast content than that observed in basal ice layers, contribute substantially to the transfer of subglacial material in the terminal zone. Entrainment and transfer of material occurs by simple shear along the upper surface of bands and by straininduced deformation of stratified and firnified glacier ice below. Thrust material includes rounded and well-rounded clasts that are also striated, indicating that fluvial bedload is deposited as subglacial channels approach the overdeepening and then entrained along thrusts. Substantial transfer also occurs within basal ice, with facies type and debris content dependent on the hydrological connectedness of the adverse slope. A process model of transfer at glaciers with terminal overdeepenings is proposed, in which the geometry of the overdeepening influences spatial patterns of ice deformation, hydrology, and basal ice formation. We conclude that the significance of thrusting in maintaining sediment transfer continuity has likely been overlooked by glacier sediment budgets and glacial landscape evolution studies...|$|E
40|$|A new, {{detailed}} {{survey of the}} Rodoretto Valley (Western Alps, Italy) has been conducted resulting {{in the production of}} a new morphological and quaternary geological map of the area. The authors used the innovative Solid (True) Ortho-Photo (STOP) technology integrated with navigation sensors (Global Navigation Satellite System-GNSS/Inertial Measurement Unit-IMU). This state-of-the-art procedure has demonstrated several operational advantages during both the land survey and the post-processing phases. The survey highlighted remarkable glacial evidences and landforms probably connected with Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations (DSGSDs) phenomena. The glacial forms which have been detected consist of diffuse relics of cirques, glacial slopes, small lateral and <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines</b> and some outwash incisions. The deposits associated with the relics are lodgment till, flowtill and outwash sediments, respectively. The gravitational evidences and the very fractured bedrock that has been recognized {{on both sides of the}} Rodoretto Valley, suggest the presence of two DSGSDs which are confirmed also by the occurrence of some doubled ridges in the higher elevation band of the slopes. Moreover, several minor scarps and many longitudinal and transversal trenches, of various size, occur in the intermediate band. Extended landslide bodies have been recognized in the lower altimetric band. The major new geological element detected and interpreted after the survey and the map production is represented by the identification of a well defined WNW-ESE trend of fractured rocks and gravitational landforms. The observed fractures are not limited to the Rodoretto Valley, suggesting the possible connection of the described gravitational landforms with a tectonic discontinuity with the same WNW-ESE trend.

The main trace follows an axial valley running SW-NE within the Mérida Andes (northwestern Venezuela), and crosscuts a series of moraines related to late Pleistocene glaciers developments and retreats, at an altitude between 2600 and 5000 m. Several lakes were generated after the last retreat (between the Late Glacial Maximum –LGM– and the Younger Dryas re-advance), dammed by lateral and <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines.</b> Among them, the Los Zerpa moraine system yielded rich outcrops ranging from an upstream very coarse torrential to deltaic fill, to a downstream clayey-silty horizontal laminated lacustrine accumulation; a fore-set-type heterogeneous "prograding" body links the two sets. The whole system, as well as the surrounding moraines, underwent successive major earthquakes during the Late Glacial/lower Holocene period as evidenced by co-seismic scarps in the moraines, migrations of the outlet, and associated sagponds. Besides active faulting affecting both the moraines and the sedimentary fill, the latter –main purpose of our detail study– exhibits various evidence of strong disturbances which we relate to seismic shaking, such as: i) successive unconformities with co-seismic slips along fractures in the coarse proximal sediments; ii) successive dip changes, discontinuities, and slumps in the foreset-like set; iii) slumps with basal liquefaction, syn-sedimentary fractures, and instantaneous re-sedimentation in the fine-grained laminated accumulation. Lateral (temporal) correlations are established between the successive disturbances detected in the three situations; in turn, these sedimentary events are correlated with seismic activity of the Boconó Fault main trace. Thus, the whole paleo-lake may be considered as a natural seismograph which worked during several thousands years, after the end of the LGM and during early Holocene...|$|R

In summer 2001, an exploratory seismic expedition by RCMG and LIN yielded the very first reflection seismic profiles from Lake Khubsugul. In total, 35 sparker profiles were collected from different parts of the lake; they have a penetration of up to 400 ms TWT and a resolution of units 1 and 2 represent shallow-water, deltaic deposits, units 3, 4 and 5 deep-water hemipelagic deposits, and units 6, 7 and 8 U? deposited after cessation of the main tectonic activity, at about 200 ka?U a cyclic succession of shallow-water (lowstand) delta deposits and deep-water (highstand) hemipelagic deposits. Units 6, 7 and 8 are bounded at the base by a distinct erosional unconformity with uneven channelised morphology clearly indicative of sub-aerial erosion.

40|$|The seismostratigraphic and {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} whole length of the Magellan Strait, from the Atlantic to the Pacific entrance is for first time illustrated {{on the basis of}} multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles. The Strait crosses a geologically complex region that includes different morphotectonic provinces, and has been subdivided into three distinct segments, eastern (Atlantic), central, and western (Pacific), being each segment characterized by peculiar sedimentary and tectonic architectures. The MCS profiles shed light on the subsurface of the region in particular on the Quaternary and Tertiary features. In the foreland basin province, the MCS profiles imaged an almost undeformed structural and stratigraphic frame with very thick Cretaceous to Tertiary package. Seismic evidence of deformation of the foreland units occurs in the fold-and-thrust belt province. Along the Cordillera province, the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault exerts an important morpho-tectonic control that strongly conditions its bathymetric profile. The seismic profiles also highlighted a number of depositional features linked to the up to 150 m thick sedimentary record of the glacial cycles. Whereas the eastern segment (outer foreland province) is devoid of significant glacial-related deposits, the central segment (inner foreland and fold-and thrust belt provinces) shows evidence of repeated advances and retreats of the Magellan glacier. An important moraine ridge complex, probably corresponding to the glacial advance “D”of Clapperton et al., has been seismically imaged in the central segment, as well as an older, large bank of ice distal sediments that have been interpreted as proglacial lake deposits, which show evident signs of repeated glacial erosions.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{and interpret the}} surface terrain types associated with a widely-reported 4 km long, midlatitude martian viscous flow feature (VFF). The feature {{is located in the}} southern hemisphere, on the poleward-facing rim of a 60 km-diameter crater in eastern Hellas Planitia. High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images, analysed in both 2 D and 3 D, reveal that the upper margin of the feature is bounded by steep (30 °) headwalls, typically some tens of metres high, that are formed from unconsolidated material and characterised by a series of slope–parallel linear incisions. Below these incised headwalls, the feature flows at a general angle of 10 ° from a broad upper basin to a confined lower tongue that is bounded by a nested sequence of elongate raised ridges. These characteristics are typical of several VFFs in the region and are strikingly similar to moraine-bounded valley glaciers on Earth, and we sub-classify this feature as a ‘glacier-like form’ (GLF) ^ 1. The GLF comprises five distinctive surface terrain types that contrast sharply with surface characteristics outside its bounding moraines.

This analysis suggests that the GLF reached its maximal extent in the geologically-recent past, and that it may have been partially wetbased at that time. Subsequent to this phase, the GLF experienced an extended period of general recession that has been punctuated by several episodes of still-stand or advance. Currently, the GLF’s basin appears to be composed of a lower zone that is dominated by an exposed former glacier bed and an upper zone that may still contain a now-degraded and dust-mantled viscous mass, similar to many partially-glacierized basins on Earth...|$|R

The {{mapping of}} the North Velebit region {{provided}} {{for the first time}} the evidence of glaciation traces. Three glaciation types have been determined: cirque, valley and plateau glaciation. The glaciation affected the top part of the mountain, above 1400 meters height. Therefore, the glaciation had regional properties. The following morphological forms have been positively found out and mapped: exara-tion forms (glacier valleys, cirques, aretes, striae and polished surfaces) and accumulation glacial morphological forms. <b>Moraine</b> forms (<b>frontal,</b> terminal, slope and end moraines) undoubtedly point out that the North Velebit glaciation occured two stages. There were three glaciation centres: in the Zavižan basin, Lubeno-vačko polje and on the Jezero plateau. From the basin »Lubenovačko polje« ice was flowing versus the Alan pass and in three parts versus the Bakovac valley and the »Veliki kotao« basin.

Geomorphological {{characterisation}} {{and interpretation}} of a mid-latitude glacier-like form: Hellas Planitia, Mars. Icarus, 211 (1), 330 - 346.

40|$|The {{northern}} terminus of Emerald Glacier (51 ﾟ 31 'N, 116 ﾟ 32 'W) in the Yoho Valley, British Columbia was {{bordered by}} a small, actively forming <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine</b> during summer 1979. Stratigraphic and morphological contrasts existed round the ice front, which primarily {{resulted from a}} contrast {{in the distribution of}} supraglacial debris. [...] Sedimentological and geotechnical techniques were utilised to determine the origin of stratigraphic units within the moraine ridge. [...] Moraine A, at the margin of heavily debris covered ice, exhibited a complex stratigraphy. At most sites a lens of subglacially derived till was evident, between units of supraglacially derived material. It is proposed that the moraine forming process involved the initial development of an ice-front talus apron, which was subsequently pushed and over-ridden. A plastic subglacial till was squeezed from beneath the supra-morainal ice margin, and overlain by a sorted supraglacial unit during glacier retreat. The moraine was actively advancing during the field season due to the maintenance of glacier-moraine contact resulting from the retardation of ice-melt afforded by the supraglacial debris cover. [...] Moraine B is located at the margin of debris-free ice. The stratigraphy is less complex, although an upper unit representing a younger depositional phase was observed. The process of formation involved the melt-out of subglacial deposits during the summer months (July to August), which were bull-dozed into a ridge during winter advance. Successive accretions of till onto the proximal moraine side, perhaps on a annual basis, are suggested. [...] Deterioration of climate, resulting in positive mass balances is the main cause of glacier advance. Positive balances have been recorded from nearby glaciers between 1973 and 1976. This suggests that small glaciers are sensitive indicators of periods of climatic deterioration. [...] The thesis concludes that more than one moraine forming process may be observed around a single ice margin, one of which may be 'annual' in nature; and that complex moraines may be formed by depositional processes operating at the margin of a temperate glacier. If complexities exist in presently forming moraines, then such a possibility must be considered when examining deposits of past glaciations...|$|E
40|$|The glaciers of the European Alps are {{currently}} affected by large mass losses, due to unfavorable climatic conditions. Glacier areas and volumes rapidly decrease and the bedrock tends to outcrop, causing morphological changes and fragmentation of most ice bodies. However, different glaciers are reacting {{in different ways}} to the same climatic forcing. Investigations on small ice bodies have a particular significance in this context, since they largely contribute to the total loss of glacier area, due to their large number and rapid shrinkage. In addition, they can provide important insight into processes governing glacier wastage and into snow redistribution by wind and avalanches, since they allow detailed investigations. In summer 2010 a specific field campaign was carried out on Montasio Occidentale Glacier (W. G. I. number I 4 L 0003005), a 0. 07 km 2 avalanche-fed ice body located in the Italian Julian Alps (Eastern European Alps). The "niche" glacier is exposed to north and its altitude averages 1940 m a. s. l., ranging from 2105 to 1880 m a. s. l [...] The purpose was to assess its current status (surface topography, total area and volume, degree of activity and alimentation) and possible peculiarities in the reaction of this glacier to current climatic changes. Indeed, processes and feedbacks governing mass exchanges {{in this kind of}} low-altitude, avalanche-fed glaciers are still somewhat unknown. In addition, the Julian Alps are characterized by very high precipitation amounts and differences in climatic sensitivity are very likely to exist with respect to drier areas of the Alps. The Montasio glacier was completely surveyed by a Terrestrial Laser Scanner in September 2010, obtaining a high resolution Digital Elevation Model (cell size 20 x 20 cm). Additional information like reflectivity and RGB values associated to the TLS survey allowed us to distinguish and map the different substrata (snow, firn, debris) which cover the ice body, and to automatically delineate the glaciated area and the surface features. Geophysical investigations were also performed, to investigate the internal structure of the glacier and its depth. Measurements were carried out along longitudinal and transversal transects using a radar system equipped with a 75 MHz and a 200 MHz antennas. The EM image of the subsurface highlighted several reflecting surfaces within the glacier body and at the boundary between the ice and the underlying bedrock. Geomorphological investigations were performed in the glacier area and in its foreland, {{in order to make a}} detailed geomorphological map. The glacier is bordered by a prominent <b>frontal</b> <b>moraine,</b> cut to the right and left sides by meltwater gullies, almost inactive. Some other outer, minor moraine ridges are present at lower altitude; they formed during stadial phases and {{are currently}} covered by a soil. On the glacier, in a middle position, a squeeze moraine outcrops. The first results of our observations confirm a peculiar behavior of Montasio glacier with respect to the most part of alpine glaciers. In particular, its mass seems to be stationary or slightly increasing in the latest years, in response to recent snowy winters and in spite of current warm summers. This first dataset will constitute the basis for future work. Our intention is to reconstruct the glacier evolution since the Little Ice Age and to continue the monitoring of this ice body to evaluate its behaviour in the coming year...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCirques are emblematic landforms of alpine landscapes. The {{statistical}} distribution of cirque-floor elevations {{is used to}} infer glacial equilibrium-line altitude, {{and the age of}} their <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines</b> for reconstructing glacial chronologies. Very few studies, however, have sought to measure cirque-floor and supraglacial ridgetop bedrock downwearing rates in order to confront these denudation estimates with theoretical models of Quaternary mountain landscape evolution. Here we use 10 Be nuclide samples (n = 36) from moraines, bedrock steps, and supraglacial ridgetops among a population of cirques in the east-central Pyrenees in order to quantify denudation in the landscape and detect whether the mountain topography bears any relevance to the glacial buzzsaw hypothesis. Minimum exposure ages (MEAs) obtained for a succession of moraines spanning the Oldest Dryas to the Holocene produced a deglaciation chronology for three different Pyrenean ranges: Maladeta, Bassiès, and Carlit. Based on a series of corrections, calibrations, and chronostratigraphic tuning procedures, MEAs on ice-polished bedrock exposures were further used to model denudation depths at nested timescales during the Würm, the Younger Dryas, and the Holocene. Results show that subglacial cirque-floor denudation was lower during glacial periods (Würm: ~ 10 mm/ka) than during deglacial and interglacial periods (tens to hundreds of mm/ka). The relative inefficiency of glacial denudation in the cirque zone during the Würm would have resulted from (i) cold-based and/or (ii) low-gradient glaciers situated in {{the upper reaches of the}} icefield; and/or from (iii) glacier-load starvation because of arrested clast supply from supraglacial rockslopes situated in the permafrost zone. Denudation peaked during the Younger Dryas and Holocene glacial advances, a time when cirque glaciers became steeper, warmer-based, and when frost cracking weakened supraglacial ridgetops, thus enhancing sub-glacial erosion by providing debris to the sliding glacier base. Cirques, therefore, grow faster during more temperate periods of cirque glaciation than under full glacial conditions. Another key finding was the very low rates of ridgetop lowering averaged over the Würm and Holocene (10 – 25 mm/ka). A comparison of the denudation rates obtained from the cirque zone with regional estimates of crustal uplift indicates that the alpine topography is not in a steady state. The low intensity of glacial denudation failed to bring the topography to a buzzsaw equilibrium state...|$|R
40|$|The Chilean Lake District, {{located in}} Southern Chile, {{comprises}} 17 lakes at the foothill of the Cordillera de los Andes. These lakes, dammed by <b>frontal</b> <b>moraines,</b> were formed {{during the last}} deglaciation (12500 - 12000 BP). Their sedimentary infilling {{has the potential to}} contain a complete and continuous Holocene sedimentary record of environmental and climatic changes having affected the area. High-resolution reflection seismic data (sparker and pinger) collected during the 2001 - 2002 expedition in the framework of the Belgian ENSO-CHILE project have allowed us to select two lakes for the collection of long and short sediment cores: Lago Icalma (38 ° 50 ’S, alt. 1150 m) is located in the Cordillera de los Andes, in {{the upper part of the}} Bio-Bio River. Its watershed (148 km 2) is dominated by a soft post-glacial sediment cover, interrupted by two important pumice layers. According to the high-resolution seismic survey, the 70 m-thick sedimentary infilling consists of morainic deposits, under- and interflows and laminated lacustrine deposits. The western part of the main basin represents an elevated platform, free of the influence of bottom-currents and turbidites and possibly consisting of interflow deposits. Core descriptions and physical property analyses of sediments (gamma-density, low and high-resolution magnetic susceptibility) suggest that the deposits consist of an alternation of volcanic deposits and terrigenous sediments correlated on pinger profiles, showing the presence of several low-amplitude layers. Lago Puyehue (40 ° 40 ’S, alt. 185 m) is located at the foothill of the Cordillera de los Andes and presents a glacial morphology much more complicated than Lago Icalma. Its watershed is larger (1267 km 2) and dominated by Quaternary and Tertiary volcanic rocks. The lake is composed, in its western part, by a large basin, filled by 250 m of sediments, as can be deduced from sparker profiles. The eastern part of the lake presents a complex substratum morphology. However, it was possible to find a suitable location in underflow and interflow deposit areas for the collection of two long cores. Core description and physical property analyses of sediments of the interflow area suggest a good and continuous sedimentary record. With this contribution, we wish to illustrate the potential of high resolution geophysical site-survey data for interpreting core descriptions and physical property analyses...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper reviews data {{currently}} {{available on the}} glacial fluctuations {{that occurred in the}} Pyrenees between the Würmian Maximum Ice Extent (MIE) {{and the beginning of the}} Holocene. It puts the studies published since the end of the 19 th century in a historical perspective and focuses on how the methods of investigation used by successive generations of authors led them to paleogeographic and chronologic conclusions that for a time were antagonistic and later became complementary. The inventory and mapping of the ice-marginal deposits has allowed several glacial stades to be identified, and the successive ice boundaries to be outlined. Meanwhile, the weathering grade of moraines and glaciofluvial deposits has allowed Würmian glacial deposits to be distinguished from pre-Würmian ones, and has thus allowed the Würmian Maximum Ice Extent (MIE) –i. e. the starting point of the last deglaciation– to be clearly located. During the 1980 s, 14 C dating of glaciolacustrine sequences began to indirectly document the timing of the glacial stades responsible for the adjacent <b>frontal</b> or lateral <b>moraines.</b> Over the last decade, in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides (10 Be and 36 Cl) have been documenting the deglaciation process more directly because the data are obtained from glacial landforms or deposits such as boulders embedded in <b>frontal</b> or lateral <b>moraines,</b> or ice-polished rock surfaces. On that basis, it is now accepted that (i) the Würmian MIE occurred in the Pyrenees during MIS 4 and not the Global LGM; and that (ii) a major glacial readvance took place during the Global LGM. This ice readvance reached a position close to the MIS 4 icefield boundary in the Eastern part of the range, but apparently not in the west. (iii) Soon after the Global LGM, the Pyrenean ice margin went into major and rapid recession. Even before the beginning of the Lateglacial, the main trunk glaciers had already retreated to the upper parts of the valleys. (iv) The paleogeography of the Pyrenean icefield during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) is still partially unknown but all available data indicate that glaciers during the Oldest Dryas (GS- 2 a) were substantially smaller than during the Global LGM. During the Bølling-Allerød interstadial, the Pyrenean ice margins retreated substantially, and glacier...|$|R
