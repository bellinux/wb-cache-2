30|$|A {{differential}} transform {{method to}} analyze stationary heat conduction through homogeneous <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with negligible heat loss {{from the tip}} has been presented. The major conclusion of this work is that for stationary heat conduction through <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the DTM solution can be obtained in a closed series solution which does not necessitate an iterative method such as the Newton–Raphson methods for {{the determination of the}} initial value of temperature transform function. The proposed method is shown to converge with a few Taylor series for both low and high values of the thermal length characteristic parameter. Application of the present DTM solution to longitudinal fins of rectangular and triangular profiles and pins of cylindrical and conical profiles show an excellent agreement with exact results. For all cases studied, the magnitude of temperature decreases with increasing thermal length characteristic parameter. This indicates that the loss of heat from <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> is more significant for low convection coefficient of the cooling fluid than that for <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with high thickness and conduction coefficient.|$|R

This calls into question the validity of the one-dimensional assumption utilized in the design methodologies for heat exchange equipment incorporating plain and radial rectangular fins. <b>Extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> are additional surfaces (fins) appended to a primary heat absorbing or rejecting surface (prime surface) to increase the rate of heat transfer to or from the <b>surface.</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> enhance heat transfer by increasing the area available for heat transfer [1, 2]...|$|R

If any light and flat or nearly flat article be projected or thrown edgewise in a slightly inclined position, the same will rise on the air till the force exerted is expended, when the article so thrown or projected will descend; and it will readily be conceived that, if the article so projected or thrown possessed in itself a continuous power or force equal to that used in throwing or projecting it, the article would continue to ascend {{so long as the}} forward part of the surface was upwards in respect to the hinder part, and that such article, when the power was stopped, or when the inclination was reversed, would descend by gravity aided by the force of the power contained in the article, if the power be continued, thus imitating the flight of a bird. Now, the first part of my invention consists of an apparatus so constructed as to offer a very <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> or plane of a light yet strong construction, which will have the same relation to the general machine which the extended wings of a bird have to the body when a bird is skimming in the air; but in place of the movement or power for onward progress being obtained by movement of the <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> or plane, {{as is the case with}} the wings of birds, I apply suitable paddle-wheels or other proper mechanical propellers worked by a steam or other sufficiently light engine, and thus obtain the requisite power for onward movement to the plane or extended surface; and in order to give control as to the upward and downward direction of such a machine I apply a tail to the <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> which is capable of being inclined or raised, so that when the power is acting to propel the machine, by inclining the tail upwards, the resistance offered by the air will cause the machine to rise on the air; and, on the contrary, when the inclination of the tail is reversed, the machine will immediately be propelled downwards, and pass through a plane more or less inclined to the horizon as the inclination of the tail is greater or less; and in order to guide the machine as to the lateral direction which it shall take, I apply a vertical rudder or second tail, and, according as the same is inclined in one direction or the other, so will be the direction of the machine.|$|E

40|$|The {{dehydrogenation}} behaviour of a cylindrical MgH 2 {{metal hydride}} tank is examined by {{taking into account}} five different heat management scenarios. A three-dimensional mathematical model, validated with experimental results is utilized to simulate the dehydrogenation process of an up-scale cylindrical Mg metal hydride tank. The scope {{of this study is}} to examine the dehydrogenation kinetics of 100 g of H 2 that have been stored to the tank. Five different heat management scenarios are examined and compared to each other: a base case where the heat source for the dehydrogenation process is an external heater (external jacket) surrounding the tank. The second case examines the effect of the radiation heat transfer arising from an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to the metal hydride tank as a possible heat source for the dehydrogenation procedure. The third scenario takes into account the usage of internal heating tubes within the tank and the case of using 8 - 12 - 16 - 20 and 24 co-central tubes. For the fourth scenario, the optimum number of the co-central tubes from the previous case is used in combination with interior <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> (fins). Finally, the last scenario involves the combination of the interior <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with the external jacket as a possible heat management technique. The results showed that when using the external heating jacket and the radiation heat from the SOFC the time for the hydride to release all the stored hydrogen (100 g) is greater than 15 min, while when using embedded heating tubes with oil as the flowing fluid the time is almost 7 min and when combine the embedded heating tubes with <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> the time for the fully release of hydrogen can reduce more to 2 min.
