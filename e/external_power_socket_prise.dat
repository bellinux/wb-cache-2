5000|$|Weight - Some AC {{adapters}} can be heavy, exerting {{excess weight}} on the <b>power</b> <b>socket</b> (this depends on the socket design {{of the country in}} question). Some <b>external</b> <b>power</b> supplies are [...] "power bricks" [...] (also known as [...] "line lumps") having a short AC cord so they can lie on the floor, thus relieving strain, at the expense of clutter. Other wall-hanging types are made long and thin, minimizing the leverage of their weight vector that pulls the plug out, but exacerbating the size problem. The weight for equipment that must be carried (e.g. for traveling) is not a disadvantage of external supplies, as the alternative is an equally heavy internal supply; but in many cases a single universal supply could replace several proprietary ones.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, the conference {{compartment}} was equipped with a large table, four freely movable chairs, an electronic typewriter, a fax machine, a telephone and <b>power</b> <b>sockets.</b> It could be used with a reservation {{of at least three}} seats. Originally, first-class tickets were necessary. If there were no reservations in the conference compartment, it could be used at the head conductor's discretion. In 1992, demand was high: the conference compartments were booked 8197 times. A year later, that number dropped to 4400.
