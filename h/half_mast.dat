5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown at half-mast {{as a sign}} of mourning. The {{decision}} to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning.

Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.|$|E

5|$|Many more {{hotels and}} {{restaurants}} were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides {{to make way for}} a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from uremia. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to <b>half</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E

He was picked up by HMS Orion, where the English, recognizing his bravery treated him, and his crew, with great respect. Intrépide was scuttled the next day to avoid recapture by Cosmao's squadron.|$|R
50|$|On September 8, 2010, the United States Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) {{announced}} {{the selection of}} Allora & Calzadilla as the American representative at the 2011 Venice Biennale, a first for artists living in Puerto Rico. The proposal for the exhibition was developed between the artists and curator Lisa D. Freiman (Chair, Department of Contemporary Art, Indianapolis Museum of Art, and Director, 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park), during {{the fall and winter}} of 2009. The exhibition consisted of six new commissions, including: Armed Freedom Lying on a Sunbed (2011), Track and Field (2011), Body in Flight (Delta) (2011), Body in Flight (American) (2011), Algorithm (2011) and <b>Half</b> Mast\Full <b>Mast</b> (2010). In most of the pieces, the artists did away with subtlety in favor of a direct invocation of the imposing specter of American militarism, treating nationalism first and foremost as an aesthetic language that expresses itself through the military machine, ritualized bodies, and official architecture. The installations and performances inside the pavilion further the artists’ investigations of “bio-power” and technology, deforming and repurposing bodies and materials in conjunctions that are at once ominous and comical.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1999, Land Mark is {{a series}} of {{projects}} that encompasses film, video, photography and performance pieces related to the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, which, for 60 years, was used by the United States for military operations, leading to a civil disobedience campaign waged by local residents. The works include Land Mark (1999/2003/2006), Land Mark (Footprints) (2001-02), Returning a Sound (2004), Under Discussion (2005) and <b>Half</b> Mast\Full <b>Mast</b> (2010). Allora & Calzadilla interrogate the economic, cultural, and political markers that differentiate one area of land from another, and the processes of colonization and gentrification that come to define its changing status. As a whole, these works connected performances typical of political activism to artistic traditions like engraving. Land Mark is explained semantically as an instrument for reading marks left on the territory (landmarks) instead of as a simple point of spatial orientation (landmark). The spatial investigations in Allora & Calzadilla's work are made {{in terms of what the}} artists call “the trace.” At once a poetic trope and a set of material operations, the trace links presence and absence, inscription and erasure, preservation and destruction, and appearance and disappearance.|$|R
25|$|The Finnish flag {{is raised}} at 8 am and lowered at sunset, however {{not later than}} 9 pm. On {{independence}} day, the flag is flown until 8 pm regardless of the dark.

2500|$|The Crowell-Collier Publishing Company had {{its roots}} in the {{agricultural}} trade of the 19th century. Industrialist Phineas P. Mast, the owner of P. P. Mast, manufactured farm and agricultural tools, and he wanted a magazine to promote his products. Mast made wind engines, pumps, plows and mowers in Springfield, Ohio. Mast hired John S. Crowell away from the successful Home and Farm of Louisville in 1877 to manage the new bi-monthly farm journal called Farm & Fireside. By the 1890s, Farm & Fireside maintained a circulation of over <b>half</b> a million. <b>Mast</b> relinquished his role as acting executive in 1879, but he stayed on as an investor. Crowell along with T.J. Kirkpatrick (who was Mast's nephew) then changed the name of the publishing house to Mast, Crowell and Kirkpatrick Publishers.|$|R
60|$|We ran {{more and}} more lines, and {{more and more}} lines {{continued}} to part, {{and more and more}} the pretty boat went over on her side. We bent all our spare lines; we unrove sheets and halyards; we used our two-inch hawser; we fastened lines part way up the <b>mast,</b> <b>half</b> way up, and everywhere else. We toiled and sweated and enounced our mutual and sincere conviction that God's grudge still held against us. Country yokels came down on the wharf and sniggered at us. When Cloudesley let a coil of rope slip down the inclined deck into the vile slime and fished it out with seasick countenance, the yokels sniggered louder and it was all I could do to prevent him from climbing up on the wharf and committing murder.|$|R

25|$|Foley was {{reassigned to}} the Culebra Naval Station {{located on the}} island of Culebra, Puerto Rico. On January 14, 1910, Sgt. Alexander J. Foley {{suffered}} a heart attack and {{died at the age of}} 44. The Department of the Navy did not consider it practical at that time to transfer his body to his hometown, therefore Foley was buried in the municipal cemetery of Culebra, with flags at <b>half</b> <b>mast</b> and with full military honors.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be flown during {{celebrations}} and other solemn manifestations which mark events of importance for Serbia, and on other occasions. During state mourning, it is flown at <b>half</b> <b>mast,</b> including by the organs of provinces, local organs, and public services. The flag must be displayed in an election room during an election for state bodies and in the room of civil registry dedicated for marriage (the officiant has to carry a sash with flag colours as well).|$|E
25|$|Previously {{the flag}} was {{generally}} only flown on public buildings on days marking the birthdays {{of members of}} the Royal Family, the wedding anniversary of the monarch, Commonwealth Day, Accession Day, Coronation Day, the Queen's Official Birthday, Remembrance Sunday, and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament. The Union Flag is flown at <b>half</b> <b>mast</b> from the announcement of the death of the Sovereign (save for Proclamation Day), or upon command of the Sovereign.|$|E
5000|$|The Kraken was {{difficult}} to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch King Kong vs. Godzilla which had a real octopus crawling over miniatures. During the filming of the attacks, Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) divulged that [...] "the Kraken, at the moment, is just Gore Verbinski running around, going, 'I'm a tentacle. I'm a tentacle. Be afraid.'" [...] Gore Verbinski worked with Industrial Light & Magic to create the scenes for the film involving the Kraken. When filming {{the attack on the}} Edinburgh Trader, they used the ship as a set in shallow waters. Many more sailors were digitally added on board the ship, and others were digitally replaced for complex shots. When the time came to film the Edinburgh Trader being broken in half, two massive pipes were filled with 30,000 pounds of cement for a total of 60,000 pounds and crushed down onto the set. To prepare for this event, most metal and the masts were removed, because the metal would prevent the ship from satisfyingly breaking in <b>half</b> while the <b>masts</b> would prevent better camera close-ups. Furthermore, the interior middle of the ship was lined with cables of explosives to blast the wood apart in the air. After the shot, other men were filmed on another blue tilting set and digitally added on deck. John Knoll, Visual Effects Supervisor, confessed that it was extremely complex to add the Kraken's tentacles between all the environmental effects of water and wood debris.|$|R
25|$|Following {{official}} {{confirmation that}} George D. Wick was lost at sea, Youngstown's municipal government declared that all local factories, businesses, and schools should observe {{five minutes of}} silence at 11 a.m. on April 24, 1912, to honor the industrialist's memory. Meanwhile, the Wick family's pew at the city's First Presbyterian Church was roped off, and flags throughout the community were flown at <b>half</b> <b>mast.</b> A memorial monument was later erected for Wick at Youngstown's Oak Hill Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In the Weimar Republic, the {{university}} was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber. Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within {{the university}}: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard {{was head of the}} physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to <b>half</b> <b>mast</b> the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.|$|E
25|$|April 1944 {{brought more}} coastal escorting, screening, patrolling, and {{military}} assault and landing exercises, often with PC-553 and PC-1225. Three air raids were sounded in April while {{the ship was}} berthed. On 27 April 1944, five Landing Ship, Tanks (LST) were attacked just behind PC-552s convoy. About 400 sailors and soldiers died. Overnight there was sporadic gunfire and illumination fire. On 29 April 1944, PC-552 set her flag at <b>half</b> <b>mast</b> {{in memory of the}} Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox and for those lost during the engagement with German E-boats on 27–28 April.|$|E
25|$|Deaths {{of members}} of the royal family have {{occurred}} in connection to the appearance of the White Lady in the palace. In March 1871, Princess Eugenie saw the ghost and three days later Queen Louise died. The White Lady appeared again in 1907, and shortly after that, King Oscar II died. The last time she was seen was in 1920, when Princess Margaret lay dying. Suddenly the flag at the palace was lowered to <b>half</b> <b>mast</b> and a guard is said to have seen the White Lady on the roof. Two hours after this the princess died.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2007, the Mirvish family {{released}} a statement to announce the death of Ed Mirvish after midnight at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto.

His store was closed and its lights were dimmed, as staff bid farewell to the former owner. A similar gesture was made by theatres on Broadway, which dimmed their lights for one minute at 8pm on July 13. Toronto Police provided ceremonial and mounted units (including the horse Honest Ed) for his funeral. Flags at Toronto's civic centres were lowered to <b>half</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{security}} was heightened at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in Toronto, {{all of the}} party leaders agreed that the day's session of Question Period should continue. In Edmonton, public tours were cancelled for {{the day at the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta and security increased. The Legislative Assembly of British Columbia was placed under restricted access and most constituency offices on Vancouver Island were closed as a precaution. Nova Scotia's legislature, sitting that day, restricted access in the public gallery to the press and staff of the government and political parties. The National Assembly of Quebec flew its flag at <b>half</b> <b>mast</b> the evening of October 22 as a tribute to Cirillo.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} the arms of Ireland, since 1945 the harp is the arms of each President of Ireland whilst in office. Typically the arms are borne as a banner {{in the form of}} a Presidential Standard. The {{standard}} is flown over Áras an Uachtaráin, the President's residence in Dublin, at Dublin Castle when the President is in residence and on vehicles used by the President. As with other Presidential and Royal Standards, it is never flown at <b>half</b> <b>mast.</b> However, the Presidential Standard never takes precedence over the flag of Ireland, whereas, for example, the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom takes precedence over the flag of the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April 1904, Makarov (who had now {{transferred}} his flag to Petropavlovsk) left port {{to go to}} {{the assistance}} of a destroyer squadron he had sent on reconnaissance north to Dalny. He was accompanied by the Russian cruisers , , and , along with the battleships Poltava, Sevastopol, Pobeda, and Peresvet. The Japanese fleet was waiting, and Makarov withdrew towards the protection of the shore batteries at Port Arthur. However, the area had been recently mined by the Japanese. At 09:43, Petropavlovsk struck three mines, exploded and sank within two minutes. The disaster killed 635 officers and men, along with Admiral Makarov. At 10:15, Pobeda was also crippled by a mine. The following day, Admiral Togo ordered all flags to be flown at <b>half</b> <b>mast,</b> and that a day’s mourning be observed for his fallen adversary. Makarov was officially replaced by Admiral Nikolai Skrydlov on 1 April 1904; however, Skrydlov was unable to reach his command due to the Japanese blockade, and remained at Vladivostok overseeing command of the Vladivostok cruiser squadron until recalled to St Petersburg on 20 December.|$|E
