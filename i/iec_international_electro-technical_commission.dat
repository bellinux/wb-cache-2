In the current scenario real time communication demands for fast, efficient processing {{as well as}} less storage of data, specially images and videos. The requirement of storage plays crucial role in real time application, which leads to requirement of efficient and fast compression techniques. For still image compression, the Joint Photographic Experts Group ' or JPEG standard has been established by ISO (International Standards Organization) and <b>IEC</b> (<b>International</b> <b>Electro-Technical</b> <b>Commission).</b> Since then lots of work had been done on single channel image compression mostly using wavelet transform. But rapid growth in modern communication demands higher and higher compression ratio with smaller error. This arises the need of effective and standardized gray image compression technique. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop and implement an algorithm for compression of single channel image i. e. gray images as well as to speed up the compression of multichannel images with high compression. This paper presents a new method of implementation of available wavelet transform based image compression technique for gray image compression using fuzzyfied discrete wavelet transform. Zadah in his first paper on fuzzy, discussed that fuzzy logic is an efficient tool for handlingimprecise and vague situations, hence fusion of fuzzy rule base with discrete wavelet transform is the Efficient way to achieve higher compression ratio with less error.

These standards define {{the characteristics of the}} fuses and describe the tests to be run in order to check fuse's ability to take up their main functions, i. e. current-conduction and operation under overloads and short-circuits. But fuses never carry current neither operate under standardized conditions. For example, rated current is evaluated under specified ambient temperature, without cooling air-flow, and with 1 meter-long connection-cables on both sides. In the field, temperature can reach up 80 ∘C, with or without air-flow and connection-parts are much more shorter. An issue is that current is never constant, often being cyclingly applied; equipments are frequently in use during the day and stopped in the night. ON-time and OFF-time generate alternative heating, then alternative stresses leading to thermal fatigue. MERSEN run many tests along the years, allowing to develop a method for choosing right fuses for each application.

40|$|The {{tidal current}} energy {{resource}} is challenging to assess with accuracy and precision. An accepted standard methodology is lacking, {{which in turn}} perpetuates uncertainty and hinders the industry’s development. Technical Committee 114 of the <b>International</b> <b>Electro-technical</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC-TC- 114) is working to develop a standard for emerging tidal energy conversion systems. The draft standard prescribes methods for determining, objectively and reliably, the scale and character of tidal current energy resources at a site. The IEC-TC- 114 draft standard for tidal energy resource assessment and characterisation {{has not yet been}} tested in a real world case study. Hence, it is not yet known whether the proposed methods will yield the desired outcome. This research has adopted the Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy (FORCE) project in Minas Passage, Nova Scotia, for pilot application of the draft standard on tidal current resource assessment. The Bay of Fundy, located on the Atlantic coast of North America between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, is known for having the highest tidal range in the world and has long been recognised as an ideal stage for tidal energy development. The thesis is presented in three main parts. Firstly, the latest peer-reviewed scientific literature is summarised and the standard is reviewed in view of lessons learned. The aim of this exercise is to establish a scientific basis for and to develop suggestions towards improving and extending future revisions of the standard. Secondly, a comprehensive assessment of the tidal current energy resource at the FORCE project site is conducted {{in a manner that is}} consistent with IEC-TC- 114 protocol based on available measurements from static current profiler surveys and a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the upper Bay of Fundy developed for this study. Thirdly, a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the main sources of error and uncertainty affecting resource assessment, a topic which has yet to be addressed in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Insulators {{used in the}} {{construction}} of spacecraft are irradiated with high-energy electrons in the space environment and this sometimes causes the insulators to charge to very high voltages. Such charged insulators can generate spontaneous electric partial-discharge pulses of the order of mA to tens of A. These pulses sometimes last enough time to destroy the expensive micro-circuitry present in the spacecraft. In evaluating the threat to the spacecraft due to these discharges, calculation of the resistivity becomes a critical parameter since it determines how accumulated charge will distribute across the spacecraft and how rapidly charge imbalance will dissipate. So far, resistivity values for the insulators for spacecraft applications have been simply imported from tabulated results measured using standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and <b>International</b> <b>Electro-technical</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>IEC)</b> methods. This thesis work provides the details of the charge storage method which {{has been found to be}} more appropriate in calculating the resistivity of spacecraft insulators by emulating the space environment better. This method is based on the concept that the resistivity is better measured as the decay of the charge deposited on the surface of an insulator, rather than by the flow of current across two electrodes around the sample which is the case with the classical method of measurements. From the results obtained from the charge storage method, it has been found that the ASTM resistivity values for thin film insulating spacecraft materials have been found to under-predict charge transport values applicable to many spacecraft charging problems, by 10 to 104 times. The charge storage method has only one side of the insulator in vacuum exposed to charged particles, light and plasma, with a metal electrode attached to the other side of the insulator. The chamber for measuring the charge storage decay has been designed with the capability to measure 32 samples simultaneously. The details of the apparatus, instrumentation, test methods, data acquisition methods, and data analysis for measuring resistivity of the spacecraft insulators are given here. Details about the vacuum environment, sample mounting, isolation of the samples, charging of the samples, measurement of the surface charge, rotary motion of the sample carousel, etc., are also given. The report also includes differences between the classical methods and the charge storage method both in terms instrumentation and methodology. The results obtained from both methods are tabulated showing the superiority of the charge storage method. Recommendations for future work are also included...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the microprocessor into the power system protection field, modern microprocessor based numeric relays have developed very rapidly in the last 20 years, and modern power system protection schemes are virtually all based on microcomputers technology. The <b>International</b> <b>Electro-technical</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>IEC)</b> recently launched the standard IEC 61850, “Communication Networks and System in Substation”, which is having a major impact on the structure of new protection systems and schemes. In itself it describes the concepts for sub-station communications covering protection, control and metering functions. However, although it {{is going to have a}} major impact on the power systems communications, it will also influence the design of future protection systems. There will also be a host of other opportunities and advantages that can be realised. These include easier upgrading, refurbishment and replacement of sub-station protection. They also provide for greater use of general purpose Intelligent Electronics Devices (IEDs), self-healing systems, and plug and play type facilities. The Ethernet based communication network for data transfer between process level switchyard equipment and bay level IEDs, the process bus, is defined in IEC 61850 Section 9 - 2. This process bus facilitates the communication of two types of real-time, peer-to-peer communication messages. Generic object-oriented substation event messages, the GOOSE messages and the data sample values, SVs which include the measured currents and voltages. Although this standard describes the message structures and the timing requirements, it does not describe the process bus topology. This work describes different LAN topologies that can be used in the design of process bus for protection systems. It considers the implications of the different structures on the operation of the protection scheme and how these relate to the operational strategy of different operators. It provides an assessment of the data handling capabilities of the system and how the demands of the protection system can be met. Several potential problem areas are identified and analyzed. The probabilistic nature of these systems is discussed and the implications explained. It also provides an insight into the implementation of the alternative topologies and their performance when applied to a transmission line feeder protection and transformer protection. The digital substation and the implementation of IEC 61850 are fundamental to the future of protection ‘relays’. There are many pointers to the potential directions that these systems will develop and the skills required for the protection engineers of the future. This project is seeking to overcome some of the ownership challenges presented by modern protection and control (P&C) devices, which have an inherent short life due to their dependence on modern electronics and software.

40|$|Fatigue damage {{calculations}} {{are conducted}} as state-of-art design process for wind turbines. Fatigue analysis is performed on spar caps and trailing edge tape (UD material) considering uni-axial stress state. The main {{objective of the}} research project is to analyze the effect of various parameters like yaw errors, wind turbine design load cases and blade mass imbalances on fatigue damage of blade. Also, an overall structural study of the blade has been performed based on the guidelines of <b>International</b> <b>Electro-technical</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>IEC)</b> 61400 - 1 Ed. 3 to understand the structural robustness of blade in terms of stiffness and strength. Loads based on an onshore site have been generated using aero-(servo) -elastic code, Fatigue Aerodynamics Structural and Turbulence (FAST). Based on these loads and predominantly linear Finite Element Model (FEM) calculations on a blade model in ANSYS (except for flapwise loading on spar caps), stress time series are calculated. Finally, using these stress time series, the fatigue damage at different blade sections are calculated in ’Octave’ environment using rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner’s rule. Results show that blade is stiff enough from blade-tower interference and resonance per- spective, but buckling is observed in the trailing edge close to the tip, with flapwise buckling mode coming out as the most critical one. Fatigue is not a structural issue based on state-of- art calculations and design load cases, even in the critical transition region (from circular to DU airfoil along the span of the blade). It was found that positive yaw errors are more detri- mental to fatigue life than negative ones for an anti-clockwise rotating turbine. Trailing edge tape is more affected by blade mass imbalance while spar caps are sensitive to changes in yaw errors in terms of fatigue life. Power production design load case is completely dominating fatigue life when compared to start up and shutdown load cases. All the results that have been presented here {{are based on a}} particular wind site conditions, a specific blade and a wind turbine model. The idea has been to give a qualitative and relative overview of different trends in the structural analysis, rather than coming to a conclusion in an absolute sense. Due to the presence of considerable cone angle, shaft tilt and rotor overhang, blade-tower interference is not an issue for the analyzed blade design. It should be, however, considered to increase the trailing edge tape length towards the tip region to prevent buckling issues. Also, extra core materials could be provided (thus increasing bending stiffness and thickness) to prevent buckling problems. Operation of turbine under other significant loading conditions like icing and heavy leading edge erosion should be incorporated to study fatigue in more detail. Fatigue life should be evaluated and validated with models other than Miner’s sum (for example, residual strength degradation model) along with full blade test (for an existent blade) for precise results. An aero-elastic stability analysis of full wind turbine model should be performed to understand the dynamics of whole system on blades. Finally, fatigue damage in bond lines between different components of blade is also a critical consideration for future work.
