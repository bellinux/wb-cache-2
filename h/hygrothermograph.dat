40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in all-electric townhouses and apartments in the winter (N = 83) and summer (N = 54) to ascertain how energy conservation strategies focusing on thermostat change and set-backs and other low-cost/no-cost approaches would affect overall electricity use and electricity used for heating and cooling, the home thermal environment, the perceived comfort of participants, and clothing that was worn. The studies assessed the effectiveness of videotape modeling programs that demonstrated these conservation strategies when used alone or combined with daily feedback on electricity use. In the winter, {{the results indicated that}} videotape modeling and/or feedback were effective relative to baseline and to a control group in reducing overall electricity use by about 15 % and electricity used for heating by about 25 %. Hygrothermographs, which accurately and continuously recorded temperature and humidity in the homes, indicated that participants were able to live with no reported loss in comfort and no change in attire at a mean temperature of about 62 °F when home and about 59 °F when asleep. The results were highly discrepant with prior laboratory studies indicating comfort at 75 °F with the insulation value of the clothing worn by participants in this study. In the summer, a combination of strategies designed to keep a home cool with minimal or no air conditioning, in conjunction with videotape modeling and/or daily feedback, resulted in overall electricity reductions of about 15 % with reductions on electricity for cooling of about 34 %, but with feedback, and feedback and modeling more effective than modeling alone. Despite these electricity savings, <b>hygrothermograph</b> recordings indicated minimal temperature change in the homes, with no change in perceived comfort or clothing worn. The results are discussed in terms of discrepancies with laboratory studies, optimal combinations of video-media and personal contact to promote behavior change, and energy policies that may be mislabeled as sacrificial and underestimate the effectiveness of conservation strategies such as those investigated in these studies...|$|E
40|$|Aims Saussurea involucrata is {{not only}} a rare and {{protected}} species, but also an important traditional Chinese medicinal plant. The species is an herbaceous monocarpic perennial that grows in the alpine zone. Our objective was to investigate floral biology of this species in a high-altitude area of the Tianshan Mountains and to gain an understanding of how its floral biology is adapted to the alpine environment. Methods The research was conducted at the Tianshan Glaciological Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (43 ° 06 ′ N, 86 ° 49 ′ E, 3 540 m a. s. l.) in Xinjiang. We selected an undisturbed population of plants and measured and recorded floral characteristics during flower opening. Also, the dynamics of nectar secretion were monitoredby collecting nectar with a syringe and determining sugar concentration with a pocket refractometer. Temperature and relative humidity {{both inside and outside the}} involucral bracts were measured with a portable <b>hygrothermograph,</b> and number of seeds produced by plants was counted in the field. Important findings The inflorescence is a compound capitulum composed of many capitula on a short stem, and it is surrounded by large green involucral bracts. About 26 of the uppermost capitula contained 137 ± 34 fertile florets each, but the lower capitula in the axils of the bracts had sterile florets. The maximum temperature and relative humidity differences in one day between inside and outside the bracts were 7. 2 °C and 54. 2 %, respectively. Opening of florets on a single plant lasted about 45 – 55 days and for the population about 65 – 75 days. The duration of peak flowering was ca. 35 days, and the mean number of flowering florets per plant each day was 201. Flowering phenology did not differ between years (p > 0. 05). Longevity of a floret from open corolla to a wilted stigma was 4 – 6 days. Herkogamy, protandry and secondary pollen presentation were conspicuous during floret opening, thus avoiding self-pollination and interference between female and male function. Both nectar volume and sugar concentration of a single floret reached a maximum value at 12 : 00 (solar time) within 1 day. Over a 3 -day period of consecutive nectar secretion, nectar volume gradually increased, while sugar concentration decreased. In the natural habitat, mean percent seed set per capitulum and total seed number per plant were 91. 7 % ± 4. 2 % and 3 326. 4 ± 28. 7, respectively. These characteristics are adaptations to the extreme alpine environment ofthe Tianshan Mountains...|$|E

5000|$|The Lunder Conservation Center, {{which opened}} in July 2000, is the first art {{conservation}} facility that allows the public permanent behind-the-scenes views of preservation work. Conservation staff are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques which conservators use to examine, treat, and preserve artworks. The Lunder Center has five conservation laboratories and studios equipped to treat paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, sculptures, folk art objects, contemporary crafts, decorative arts, and frames. The Center uses various specialized and esoteric tools, such as <b>hygrothermographs,</b> to maintain optimal temperature and humidity to preserve works of art. Staff from both the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery work in the Lunder Center.|$|R
50|$|An ongoing {{monitoring}} {{system is essential}} to the preventive care of objects in collections storage, as it helps to identify any problems, evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures, and document the effect of extraordinary events such as water leaks, long periods of drought, or heavy rains. <b>Hygrothermographs</b> are a tool that constantly monitors both the temperature and relative humidity, and are fairly reliable if properly calibrated, a task that must be completed at least every three months if not more frequently. The value with these devices is that they constantly record the data onto graphs that can be analyzed at a later time. Hygrometers, thermometers, and thermohygrometers are also useful for determining the temperature and relative humidity of a space, but the most reliable tool is a psychrometer. Data loggers are becoming more popular in institutions as they are small, record data at desired intervals, and allow the data to be easily transferred to a computer in multiple formats including graphs and tables, which allows for easy collection and assessment of the data.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Presentation date: 1981 - 05 - 01 Variability {{of plant}} species distributions, plant connunities, soil and {{hydrological}} factors {{in an area}} of the Netarts Spit tidal marsh are examined. The purpose is to advance general understanding of Oregon's tidal marsh ecosystems in terms of plant coninunities and functio'nal habitat conditions and make a contribution to the conceptual and technical framework used by regulatory agencies to manage wetlands. Vegetation, soil and hydrological attributes were measured periodically from May, 1978 to March, 1979 along three transects extending parallel to the elevation gradient. Each transect began at point bayward of the lower limit of marsh vegetation and continued to a point shoreward of the perceived upper limit of the marsh on the narrow, stabilized dune ridge separating Netarts Spit from the ocean. Plant species distribution and abundance by cover class was recorded in microplots located at increments of five meters or less along each transect. Soil and hydrological observations at intervals of approximately six weeks were made at 29 primary sampling sites located at increments of 15 meters or less along the transects. Water table fluctuations and soil moisture tension were examined in situ. Soil cores were extracted from the marsh for analysis of interstitial soil moisture content and salinity, soil texture, pH, organic matter content, cation exchange capacity, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and sodium content. Data on tidal inundation frequency and duration were provided by the National Ocean Survey from a tide gauge located at Netarts public boat dock. Weather data were obtained from continuously recording <b>hygrothermographs</b> and an accumulating rain gauge located in the ecotone between marsh and upland. Comparative climatic data were obtained from published National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Data Center Bulletins. Analysis of individual environmental gradients was initiated by arranging the data matrix into a composite transect ordered by elevation. Each attribute was then plotted against elevation using graphically comparable scales. Data synthesis was accomplished using a combination of reciprocal averaging ordination (to identify coimlunity gradients) and cluster analysis (for sampling site classification) applied to hierarchical data sets composed of combinations of physical, chemical, and vegetative sampling site attributes. Habitat at lower elevations of the study area (0. 70 m below mean high water) is dominated by tidal factors which decrease steadily as one approaches extreme higher high water (0. 52 m above mean high water). Fine textured sediments are saturated near the middle elevations of the study area (- 0. 25 to 1. 00 m above mean high water), with the lower and higher elevations dominated by sand. Hydrologic factors (water table depth and soil moisture tension) dominate the highest elevations of the study area but decrease steadily as one approaches mean high water. The remaining environmental factors (interstitial soil moisture content and salinity, cation exchange capacity, specific ion concentrations, organic matter, and pH) may each be interpreted as variants of {{one or more of the}} three primary environmental gradients: tides, sediment texture, and hydrology. Interstitial soil moisture salinity, soil moisture tension, and water table depth all show maxima during months with high daily temperatures and low precipitation (Aug. -Sep.,) and minima during months with low daily temperatures and high precipitation (Dec. -Mar.). Interstitial soil moisture content shows the reverse relationship with minima during Aug. -Sep. and maxima during Dec. - Mar. Plant community structure of the tidal marsh may be best understood as a species continuum beginning at about 0. 60 m below mean high water characterized by snecies dominance at low elevation (_ 0. 51) to 0. 40 m above mean hiah water) givinG way to soecies diversity at higher elevations. This continuum may be locally qraduated into three or more subdivisions or plant communities by the dynamic reltionshi of intertidal deposition and erosion processes. Community structure of the associated dune upland is distinguishable environmentally and floristically as distinct from the tidal marsh at about 0. 90 m above mean hich water although no attempt is made to resolve finer details of urland community structure beyond the marsh interface...|$|R
