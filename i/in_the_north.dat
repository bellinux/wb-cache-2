5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England – male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> East increased by 6.0 years and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

50|$|Tyler's Ground (also {{known as}} Tyler's Meadow) was a cricket ground in Loughborough, Leicestershire. It is {{believed}} {{the ground was}} located along Allsop's Lane {{on the edge of}} the town, with the ground being described as located a short distance from Loughborough railway station. The first recorded match played at <b>the</b> ground was <b>in</b> 1856, when Loughborough played an All-England Eleven. A single first-class match was played at <b>the</b> ground <b>in</b> 1875, when <b>the</b> <b>North</b> played <b>the</b> South, with W. G. Grace taking nine wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North's</b> first-innings and William Mycroft taking six wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South's first-innings. Grace then took five wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North's</b> second-innings, ending with match figures of 14/108, while Mycroft took eight wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South's second-innings to finish with match figures of 14/38. No batsman passed 26 runs, with the highest innings score being 130 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North's</b> second-innings. <b>The</b> match ended <b>in</b> a victory by 125 runs for <b>the</b> <b>North.</b> No further matches are recorded as being played at the ground following this date and its location is today agricultural fields.|$|R
5|$|Several phylogenetic studies, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences, have established the sister species {{relationship between the}} porbeagle and the salmon shark (L.ditropis), which occurs in place of it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pacific.

5|$|The IWC {{prohibited}} {{hunting in}} the Southern Hemisphere in 1976. The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pacific and Southern Hemisphere, over-reporting fin whale catches to cover up illegal takes of other species. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pacific, they reported taking over 10,000 fin whales between 1961–79, while the true catch was less than 9,000. In the Southern Hemisphere, they reported taking nearly 53,000 between 1948 and 1973, when the true total was a little over 41,000. The fin whale was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pacific in 1976, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Atlantic in 1987, with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes.
