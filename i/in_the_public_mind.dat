5|$|In John's gospel, Jesus and {{his disciples}} go to Judea early in Jesus' {{ministry}} before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information. According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> than Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause of labor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind,</b> so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E

25|$|The Gospel of John remarks, in , that, though Jesus drew {{many people}} to his baptism, they still did not accept his testimony, and the Jesus Seminar concludes, {{on the basis of}} Josephus's accounts, that John the Baptist likely had a larger {{presence}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> than Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{suicide of}} the People's Temple has helped embed {{the idea that}} all New Religious Movements are {{destructive}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind.</b> Bryan R Wilson argues against that view {{by pointing out that}} only five such events have occurred in similar religious groups: the Branch Davidians, Solar Temple, Aum Shinrikyo and Heaven's Gate.|$|E
25|$|The disc {{companies}} had superior advertising and promotion, {{most notably the}} Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States and the Gramophone Company/HMV in the Commonwealth.

25|$|When {{the news}} reached Europe, Christians were horrified and Pope Sergius IV sent a {{circular}} letter to all churches {{calling for a}} holy fight in the Middle East and expulsion of Muslims from the Holy land. The events would later be recalled by Pope Urban II in his preaching for the Crusade at Clermont. Although the crusades happened almost a century after the desecration and caused by various other complex political intrigues, it was still very much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> as a cause.

25|$|Within a few years, {{the focus}} of {{spamming}} (and anti-spam efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today. Arguably, the aggressive email spamming {{by a number of}} high-profile spammers such as Sanford Wallace of Cyber Promotions in the mid-to-late 1990s contributed to making spam predominantly an email phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind.</b> By 1999, Khan C.

25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> it became popular {{to assume that}} the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen were all that was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

25|$|The {{police were}} {{convinced}} that Chang was running a large operation and several staff from his restaurant were found selling drugs and convicted. He sold {{his interest in the}} Regent Street restaurant and opened the Palm Court Club in nearby Gerrard Street, in what is now London's Chinatown, but which then was just another London street. Police interest continued, however, and after a number of raids Chang was forced to move to Limehouse in October 1923, a poor area near the London docks that contained the original small Chinese community of London and which had been connected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with opium smoking since Victorian times.|$|E
25|$|The {{reputation}} of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of Hope Leslie, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that {{in the opinion of}} some of the critics are superior to either Redwood or Hope Leslie. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became firmly associated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with the rising form of a native literature. It was not only read with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times appearing in 1830.|$|E
25|$|Dana {{made the}} Sun a Democratic newspaper, {{independent}} and outspoken in {{the expression of}} its opinions respecting the affairs of either party. His criticisms of civil maladministration during General Grant's terms as president led to a notable attempt {{on the part of}} that administration, in July 1873, to take him from New York on a charge of libel, to be tried without a jury in a Washington police court. Application was made to the United States District Court in New York for a warrant of removal, but in a memorable decision Judge Blatchford, later a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, refused the warrant, holding the proposed form of trial to be unconstitutional. Perhaps {{to a greater extent than}} in the case of any other conspicuous journalist, Dana's personality was identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with the newspaper that he edited.|$|E

25|$|Gable {{made three}} {{pictures}} with Spencer Tracy, which boosted Tracy's career and cemented them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> as a team. San Francisco (1936) featured Tracy {{in a brief}} but Oscar-nominated role in which he played a priest who knocks Gable, by then the studio's foremost leading man, down in a boxing ring. Despite being onscreen for only 17 minutes, the appearance immediately catapulted Tracy, whose career had floundered for years despite delivering superb performances in quality films, into major stardom {{in the wake of}} the picture becoming the year's biggest box-office attraction. Test Pilot (1938) gave Tracy a larger supporting part as the agonizing friend of Gable's glamorous pilot while Boom Town (1940) depicted an epic rivalry between Gable and Tracy's characters and their oil businesses. Each pairing was a box-office phenomenon. MGM had teamed Tracy with Gable every two years until Tracy finally insisted upon a star billing clause in his contract, ending any further Gable-Tracy collaborations.|$|E
25|$|It was however at Her Majesty's, London on 20 May 1851, {{that she}} and Reeves won very great acclaim for their Fidelio, the first of five {{performances}} which established her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> as a leading tragédienne: critics compared her with her great predecessors in the role, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient and Maria Malibran. Gardoni and Calzolari led the Chorus of Prisoners. For this production, musical recitatives were composed by Michael Balfe imitating Beethoven's style, pointing {{the content of the}} dialogue with motifs drawn from the principal arias. Most appreciated them, but James William Davison, critic of The Times, was angered because he claimed that Cruvelli had altered the music 'in {{such a way as to}} bring it within range of mediocre capabilities.' Chorley, never an admirer, thought this was the turning-point, where her decline began. Then three performances of Norma, in which Cruvelli gave herself free rein, generated much enthusiasm in London. Cruvelli sang at Buckingham Palace on 7 June 1851, and was invited again the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, a bill {{to authorize}} the {{collection}} of tolls on the Cumberland Road (which provided for yearly improvements to the road) was vetoed by the President.

Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it could not undertake the construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation {{of the national government}} in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay.

25|$|Codreanu {{had to go}} into hiding, {{waiting for}} things to calm down and delegating {{leadership}} to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for Duca's killing; Stelescu, who soon became Codreanu's adversary as head of the Crusade of Romanianism, later alleged that he had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol's mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt ("She was a person adverse to your action. How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist that was the main beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority if he came to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>mind</b> with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E
