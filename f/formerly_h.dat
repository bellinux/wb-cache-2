50|$|Gardeners and nurserymen {{have also}} created hybrids between less closely related species. The {{earliest}} was probably H. × nigercors, {{a cross between}} H. niger and H. argutifolius (<b>formerly</b> <b>H.</b> lividus subsp. corsicus or H. corsicus, hence the name) first made in 1931. H. × sternii, a cross between H. argutifolius and H. lividus, first exhibited in 1947, is named after the celebrated British plantsman Sir Frederick Stern. H. × ballardiae (H. niger crossed with H. lividus) and H. × ericsmithii (H. niger crossed with H. × sternii) similarly commemorate the noted British nursery owners Helen Ballard and Eric Smith. In recent years, Ashwood Nurseries (of Kingswinford in the English Midlands), already well known for its Ashwood Garden Hybrids (H. × hybridus singles, semi-doubles, doubles and anemone-centres), has created hybrids between H. niger and H. thibetanus (called H. 'Pink Ice'), and between H. niger and H. vesicarius (called H. 'Briar Rose'). The gardenworthiness of these hybrids has still to be proven.|$|E
5000|$|Kopper King is {{a complex}} hybrid {{involving}} three species of Hibiscus and {{is the culmination of}} a forty-year breeding program established by the Fleming brothers at their nursery in Nebraska. This cultivar was produced by backcrossing two Hibiscus cultivars for three generations: the pollen parent was an inbred seedling of Dahliatown Orchid, a cultivar of H. moscheutos, and the seed parent was Jazzmen, itself a hybrid of H. moscheutos, H. laevis (<b>formerly</b> <b>H.</b> militaris), and H. coccineus. Kopper King first bloomed in 1987 on the Fleming brothers property in Nebraska. After testing to verify the characteristics of the plant were stable, they applied for a patent on this cultivar on November 3, 1997. United States plant patent number PP10,793 was granted on February 16, 1999. The patent in part claims that, [...] "this hardy hibiscus plant contributes to the market with its sheer beauty, its compact growth habit, its great resistance to disease and insects, its stability through extremes in rain and drought, and its extreme hardiness." ...|$|E

50|$|The Toltec cotton rat (Sigmodon toltecus) is a rodent {{species in}} the family Cricetidae. It is found in eastern Mexico from the Rio Grande to the Yucatán Peninsula, {{as well as in}} Belize and {{northern}} Guatemala. It prefers moist grassland habitat. While long thought to be a subspecies of S. hispidus, recent taxonomic revisions, based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data, have split the extensive former species range into three separate species. Carroll et al. (2004) indicate that the southern edge of the S. hispidus distribution is likely near the Rio Grande where it meets the northern distribution of S. toltecus (<b>formerly</b> S. <b>h.</b> toltecus). The range of S. toltecus extends from northern Mexico south into Chiapas where it occurs in sympatry with S. hirsutus (<b>formerly</b> S. <b>h.</b> hirsutus).Rats from this species group have been used as laboratory animals.|$|R
