40|$|PIE is an {{experimental}} personal information environment implemented in Smalltalk {{that uses a}} description language to support the interactive development of programs. PIE contains a network of nodes, each {{of which can be}} assigned several perspectives. Each perspective describes a different aspect of the program structure represented by the node, and provides specialized actions from that point of view. Contracts can be created that monitor nodes describing different parts of a programâ€™s description. Contractual agreements are expressible as formal constraints, or, to make the system <b>failsoft,</b> as English text interpretable by the user. Contexts and layers are used to represent alternative designs for program...|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} is transforming {{interior design}} by allowing utilities, goods and {{information to be}} delivered where and when we need them. How will new information technologies impact the design of interior spaces? Intelligent interiors can be more flexible and expressive than traditional spaces. Automation, personal fabrication and augmented reality {{can be applied to}} interior spaces with new interaction modes that operate at an architectural scale. Water, light, and other utilities can be automated in a way that empowers users by providing direct feedback, tangible benefit and being <b>failsoft.</b> Appliances can make it possible to produce and recycle a large number of variable goods locally and on demand. Many of the objects and surfaces of interior spaces can serve as displays to provide information intuitively where and when it is needed. This thesis demonstrates how distributed intelligence can increase productivity and enrich the experience of interior spaces. Experiments with augmentations to the utilities, goods and information of a working kitchen suggest guidelines for interaction with intelligent interior spaces. Th...|$|E
