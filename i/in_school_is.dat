His success <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> mediocre despite study, and he often skips classes, adding to his already poor reputation among teachers and students alike. He lives a secluded life, only leaving his home to go to church and to travel. He suffers from an ailment that causes intense coughing and shivering {{that may or may not}} be related to his involvement in the Gaia Project. Though he rejects Tory and Mandy's attempts to help him during a relapse of his condition, he eventually becomes close friends with the two during their peer tutoring sessions. He owns approximately seven cats.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} few years of life, {{children}} are mastering concrete words such as [...] "car", [...] "bottle", [...] "dog", [...] "cat". By age 3, children are likely able to learn these concrete words without the need for a visual reference, so word learning tends to accelerate around this age. Once children reach school-age, they learn abstract words (e.g. [...] "love", [...] "freedom", [...] "success"). This broadens the vocabulary available for children to learn, which helps to account for the increase in word learning evident at school age. By age 5, children tend to have an expressive vocabulary of 2,100–2,200 words. By age 6, they have approximately 2,600 words of expressive vocabulary and 20,000–24,000 words of receptive vocabulary. Some claim that children experience a sudden acceleration in word learning, upwards of 20 words per day, but it tends to be much more gradual than this. From age 6 to 8, the average child <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> learning 6–7 words per day, and from age 8 to 12, approximately 12 words per day.|$|E
500|$|Writing about Lee's {{style and}} use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: [...] "Laughter... the {{gangrene}} under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at." [...] Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her [...] "hysterically funny". To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons {{the best way to}} get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. [...] Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} screening students <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> for emotional/behavioral problems. METHODS: Elements relevant to planning and implementing effective mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> <b>are</b> considered. Screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> <b>is</b> linked to a broader national agenda to improve {{the mental health of}} children and adolescents. Strategies for systematic planning for mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> <b>are</b> presented. RESULTS: Mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> <b>is</b> a very important, yet sensitive, agenda that is in its very early stages. Careful planning and implementation of mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> offers a number of benefits including enhancing outreach and help to youth in need, and mobilizing school and community efforts to promote student mental health while reducing barriers to their learning. CONCLUSIONS: When implemented with appropriate family, school, and commu-nity involvement, mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> {{has the potential to be}} a corner-stone of a transformed mental health system.

2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to {{consider}} whether the violation of freedom of religion could be upheld under section 1 of the Charter. [...] Following R. v. Oakes (1986), the Court asked {{whether there was a}} sufficient objective for the violation. [...] The main concern, as noted by the Quebec Court of Appeal, was school safety, which helps to maintain an atmosphere in which students can learn. [...] The Supreme Court agreed that would qualify as an important objective under section 1. [...] However, they then noted there were varying degrees of safety, with the highest degree of safety being excessive. [...] The Court contemplated the highest degree of safety would require the banning of scissors and other such objects. [...] Thus, safety <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> usually only supposed to be [...] "reasonable." [...] However, because the council wanted to rid the schools of weapons, the Court deemed the council's objective to be reasonable. [...] This raised the question as to whether the rights infringement was rational and proportionate to the objective. [...] The banning of the kirpan was considered rational because it was a weapon, and thus the banning fit the objective of ridding the school of weapons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phrase in}} its pejorative sense {{has been used}} {{since at least the}} mid-1950s. According to a 1953 article in the Boston Globe on [...] "Hepster Lingo," [...] "Any snap course <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> 'underwater basket weaving. In {{a letter to the editor}} of the Los Angeles Times in 1956, a {{correspondent}} bemoaned an alleged decline in academic standards among college football programs and mentioned [...] "majoring in underwater basket weaving, or the preparation and serving of smorgasbord, or, particularly at Berkeley, the combined course of anatomy and panty-raiding". The following year, an article in the National Review mentioned that [...] "the bored students in the educationists' courses call those dreary subjects 'underwater basket-weaving courses, and another year on a newspaper column noted that [...] "One seaside university is bowing to the stern educational demands of the times by eliminating its popular course in underwater basket weaving". An article in the Daily Collegian at Penn State University in 1961 refers to a parody in which [...] "a typical Miami coed majoring in underwater basket weaving was interviewed". An article from 1976 refers to football players so dumb that they had to take underwater basket weaving, and another 1976 article refers to underwater basket-weaving as [...] "an old old family joke".|$|E

60|$|Accordingly at any leisure moment, {{before the}} close of school, each one went with her box to the {{stationary}} shelves, which you will see {{in the corners of}} the room, where a supply of paper, of all the various sizes, used <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> <b>is</b> kept, and taking out a sufficient number, they supplied all the desks in their respective divisions.|$|E
60|$|Another way {{to excite}} interest, {{and that of}} the right kind <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> <b>is</b> not to remove difficulties, but to teach the pupils how to surmount them. A text book so {{contrived}} as to make study mere play, and to dispense with thought and effort, is the worst text book that can be made, and the surest to be, in the end, a dull one. The great source of literary enjoyment, which is the successful exercise of intellectual power, is, by such a mode of presenting a subject, cut off. Secure therefore severe study. Let the pupil see that you are aiming to secure it, and that the pleasure which you expect that they will receive, is that of firmly and patiently encountering and overcoming difficulty; of penetrating, by steady and persevering effort, into regions, from which the idle and the inefficient are debarred; and that it is your province to lead them forward, not to carry them. They will soon understand this, and like it.|$|E

What is to become of them for the other sixteen hours, when they are returned to all the influences, the dread of which first suggested this contrivance?

It is to be feared not, because, though they must have heard many good precepts, their condition <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> artificial; they have been removed from the discipline and exercise of humanity, and they have, besides, been subject to many evil temptations within school and peculiar to it.|$|E

After {{exploring}} the ground, {{the first thing}} to be done, as a preparation for reforming individual character, <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> <b>is,</b> to secure the personal attachment of the individuals to be reformed. This must not be attempted by professions and affected smiles, and still less by that sort of obsequiousness, common in such cases, which produces no effect but to make the bad boy suppose that his teacher is afraid of him; which, by the way, is, in fact, in such cases, usually true. Approach the pupil in a bold and manly, but frank and pleasant manner. Approach him as his superior, but still, as his friend; desirous to make him happy, not merely to obtain his good-will. And the best way to secure these appearances, is, just to secure the reality. Actually be the boy's friend. Really desire to make him happy;--happy, too, in his own way, not in yours. Feel that you are his superior, and that you must and will enforce obedience; but with this feel, that probably obedience will be rendered, without any contest. If these are really the feelings which reign within you, the boy will see it, and they will exert a strong influence over him, but you cannot counterfeit appearances.|$|E

60|$|The task of {{pedagogy}} at {{this point}} becomes delicate. First of all, the teacher must recognize {{the fact that his}} class will not, however good their intentions, leap to a liking for Comus or Lycidas or even for the Nativity Ode. It is of no use to assign stanzas or lines as lessons and to expect these to be studied to a conclusion like a task of French translation. The only way not to be disappointed in the performance of the class is to expect nothing. It will be well at first, except where the test is quite simple, for the teacher to read it himself, making comment, in the way of explanation, as he goes on. Now and then he will stop and have a little quiz to hold attention. When classical allusions come up requiring research, the teacher will tell in what books the matter may be looked up, and will show how other poets, or Milton elsewhere, have played with the same piece of history or mythology. Thus a poem may be dealt with for a number of days. Repetition is, to a certain extent, excellent. The verses begin to sink into the young minds; the measure appeals to the inborn sense of rhythm; the poem is caught by the ear like a piece of music; the utterance of it becomes more like singing than speaking. In fact, the great secret of teaching poetry <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> {{to get rid of the}} commonplace manner of speech befitting a recitation in language or science, and to put in practice the obvious truth that verse has its own form, which is very different from the form of prose. But repetition may go too far. Over-familiarity may beget indifference. Other poems await the attention of the class.|$|E
