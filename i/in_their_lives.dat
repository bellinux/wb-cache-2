5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E

5|$|In the 21st century, {{approximately}} 75percent of Finnhorses {{are used}} {{at some point}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> for harness racing, with riding being the second most popular use. Many Finnhorses have multiple uses, such as starting their career in harness racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the New York Giants from 1925 to 1978 covers the American {{football}} franchise from the team's inception until the conclusion of their tumultuous 1978 season. Currently members of the NFL's National Football Conference, the Giants were founded in 1925 by original owner Tim Mara in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara gave control of the team over to his two sons—Wellington and Jack—early <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> During this period in their history the Giants acquired four NFL championships, but also suffered some down times, including consecutive non-playoff seasons from 1964 to 1978.|$|E

5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection.

5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

5|$|Bedřich Smetana {{was born}} as Friedrich Smetana on 2March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the {{traditional}} border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He {{was the third}} child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of the correct literary Czech until much later <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they {{spent a great deal}} of time away from each other and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some point <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and {{is the most common}} cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|For the album's theme, {{the members}} drew {{inspiration}} from the conversations they had {{during the first week}} of recording when they discussed about the happenings <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> while being apart. Composed mostly of mid-tempo songs and ballads that are subsequent continuations of each other, altogether telling one complete story, Destiny Fulfilled is an R album. It was released to generally mixed reviews among music critics who criticized its mid-tempo ballads and lyrical content. The album was commercially successful; it reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and has since been certified triple Platinum in that region. It was also successful in different countries worldwide receiving certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom among others.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives)</b> than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
