2500|$|Pollution of {{breathable}} air is {{a central}} problem {{in the management of}} the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made. [...] Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the polluter pays principle, which makes the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment, is accepted. It has strong support in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Community (EC) countries. It is also known as <b>extended</b> <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> (EPR). [...] EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the waste profile of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.|$|E
40|$|A {{principle}} of <b>extended</b> <b>producer’s</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{in the law}} of waste management pursues the following aims of the waste management: 1) the maximum decrease {{in the amount of}} waste in any type of business and human existence, 2) the immediate reuse of production waste in a manufacturing process, 3) recovery of raw materials from collected waste, 4) application of processes to dispose of waste, 5) orderly waste storage ensuring the least damage to the environment. The overriding objective of this principle is application of legal instruments encouraging producers to undertake activities which will: prevent production of waste, decrease the level of using materials and energy at every stage of a product life cycle and encourage to introduce changes in the phase of a product design and during its manufacture. Broadly speaking, a {{principle of}} <b>extended</b> <b>producer’s</b> <b>responsibility</b> is connected with a producer’s financial liability for a product. In a legal structure of the <b>extended</b> <b>producer’s</b> <b>responsibility</b> we deal with preventive liability.

40|$|Minerals {{originated}} from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are blamed for financing violent {{conflict in the}} area {{over the past decade}} and have been called conflict minerals. They vividly demonstrate a key human rights issue facing responsible supply chain management. The conflict minerals issue has led to a significant shift in responsible supply chain management in two ways: <b>extending</b> <b>producer</b> <b>responsibility</b> to respect human rights in the total supply chain through establishing traceability and transparency; and developing legally binding supply chain responsibility. This article examines an emerging effort to source conflict-free minerals using closed-pipe supply chain in the DRC as a new strategy to respond to the above paradigm shift. By exploring whether this new strategy can contribute to conflict prevention in the DRC, this article argues that the closed-pipe supply chain allows building long-term relationship with various stakeholders and has the potential to transform socio-economic structures in the producing communities, thereby leading to peacebuilding in the long run...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} waste {{management}} and recycling have become regional or inter-national issues; {{they can no}} longer be considered only in a national context. The region-alization or internationalization of waste and recycling issues is caused in large part by the steady advance of economic integration, especially increasing trade and investment flows resulting from trade and investment liberalization. Just as economic integration has separated the location of consumption from the location of most efficient production, it has also separated the most efficient and effective location of recycling from the location of production and consumption. This makes it difficult to operate domestically oriented recycling schemes, as demonstrated by the case of Japan. Therefore, national policies, although still important, are now insufficient, and this article will propose policy recom-mendations to address this, including the development of national recycling systems and capacity linked to regional recycling zones, regionally coordinated <b>extended</b> <b>producers</b> <b>responsibility,</b> and regional certification schemes for recyclers and traders...|$|R

In other words, we elucidate that in cases wherein a cause for a sticky tendency exists toward the status quo such as increasing returns and where the policies inducing prices to correct the distorted allocation of resources by externality are less likely to lead to an efficient solution, regulatory and systematic policies are efficient, and that EPR becomes meaningful in a situation where it is efficient to apply such regulatory and systematic policies to the "upper stream" rather than the point where externality arises. Second, we create a mathematical illustration to show this theoretically. Third, we verify the degree of increasing returns regarding the home electric appliances recycling system as an EPR policy to infer the efficient situation that has been realized by the EPR policy compared with the cases where non-EPR policies were adopted...|$|R
40|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} waste management in China: progress and {{the barriers to}} overcome Serious adverse impacts {{on the environment and}} human health from e-waste recycling have occurred in the past and continue to occur in China today, {{due to a lack of}} national management strategies. China has made great efforts to face the challenges of the approaching peak increase in the domestic generation of e-waste and the illegal shipment of e-waste from other countries. This study examined recent progress and analysed the main problems associated with this issue in China. It was found that the material and the finan-cial flows of e-waste in China had their own specific charac-teristics. Nearly 60 % of the generated e-wastes were sold to private individual collectors and passed into informal recy-cling processes. More than 90 % of Chinese citizens are reluc-tant to pay for the recycling of their e-waste. This is due to their traditional understanding that there remained value in these end-of-life products. Regulations concerning e-waste in China have been drafted but their deficiencies are obvi-ous. The <b>extended</b> <b>producer</b> <b>responsibilities</b> (EPR) have been introduced but are not well defined.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper that Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) issues associated with home appliances, such as TV sets, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, personal computers, are linked in the WEEE flow and recycling systems and are important to matters of public policy and regulation. In this paper, the sources and generation of WEEE in China are identified, and WEEE volumes are calculated. The results show that recycling capacity must increase if the rising quantity of domestic WEEE is handled properly. Simultaneously, suitable WEEE treatment will generate large volumes of secondary resources. Environmental problems caused by existing recycling processes have been investigated in a case study. Problems mainly stem from open burning of plastic-metal parts and from precious metals leaching techniques that utilize acids. The existing WEEE flow at the national level was investigated and described. It became obvious that a considerable amount of obsolete items are stored in homes and offices and have not yet entered the recycling system. The reuse of used appliances has become it high priority for WEEE collectors and dealers because reuse generates higher economic profits than simple material recovery. The results of a cost analysis of WEEE flow shows that management and collection costs significantly influence current WEEE management. Heated discussions are ongoing in political and administrative bodies Lis to whether <b>extended</b> <b>producer</b> <b>responsibilities</b> policies are promoting WEEE recycling and management. This paper also discusses future challenges and strategies for WEEE management in China. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|With an {{ever-increasing}} {{awareness of the}} environmental impact of manufacturing, more and more political organizations (countries, states, and unions) are enacting legislation designed to protect the environment. One category of this restrictive legislation is called <b>Extended</b> <b>Producer</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> (EPR). EPR directives place greater responsibility on manufacturers for the environmental impact of their products. These laws shift the focus from the products origin to the products final destination and from the process of manufacturing to the product itself. The highest impact of these directives is the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, finalized by the European Union in 2003. The RoHS directive restricts imports of new electrical and electronic equipment containing lead and five other hazardous substances. For manufacturers to successfully comply with RoHS and similar legislation, they need the ability to exchange material content information. This information would then propagate through the supply chain from the raw material suppliers {{all the way to the}} final producer. While a solution could be generated for any single piece of legislation, the problem is that companies will need to successfully deal with potentially dozens of laws and directives. To deal with this problem, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (a US Government Research Laboratory) developed a data model to address the underlying material declaration problem using a software development methodology. This data model was used in the development of IPCs 1752 Material Declaration standard. IPCs 1752 standard helps the electronics industry comply with RoHS by providing a data exchange mechanism by which businesses can declare the presence or absence of the restricted materials. While IPC 1752 was created to deal with EUs RoHS, the data model was designed with the intent that it would be able to support future RoHS-like legislation (China RoHS, California RoHS, etc). Even if different solutions were developed for each piece of Legislation, they can interoperate provided they are based on the same data model. This paper looks at the data model designed for the IPC 1752 standard, the methodology that was used to create it, and how it can be adapted to similar RoHS-like laws and directives.

40|$|Growing {{interest}} in environmental and socio-economic accounting at the sub-regional and organisational level requires a consistent and comprehensive method for computing and reporting responsibility for impacts of industrial production {{such as water}} use, pollution, or employment. This work presents a formulation for allocating responsibility for production impacts consistently amongst all agents such as consumers, producers, workers, and investors throughout demand and supply chains, {{in a way that}} reflects their contribution to the production process. Generalised input-output theory is used to re-trace the flow of past inter-industrial transactions, and examine ex-post how, for example, inputs of resources or outputs of pollution were associated with these transactions. Introducing the concept of a responsibility share we enable the division of responsibility into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive portions that are assigned to the different economic sectors, and that become consistently smaller as we move away from the location of the impact within the supply or demand chain system. <b>Extended</b> <b>responsibility,</b> <b>producer,</b> consumer, supply chain, environmental impact,...|$|R
