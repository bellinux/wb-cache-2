50|$|The Doctor mulls {{over this}} and regrettably {{believes}} that the Earth is doomed from the solar flare, and offers to take Clara, Danny, and the students safely away. Clara and Danny agree to stay on Earth with the students, and Clara tells the Doctor he should escape on his own given {{how many times he}} has saved the planet in the past. As the Doctor watches from orbit, he is stuck by inspiration and returns to Earth. He tells Clara the creatures were referring to the Tunguska Event and the Curuçá impact, events that should have been catastrophic for life on Earth. The Doctor {{believes that the}} trees were created to buffer the effects of the solar flare as they had for these events. Danny reports that the world governments, unable to burn down the trees due to their ability to control oxygen near them, are planning on using <b>defoliating</b> <b>agents</b> on the trees, which would render them unable to stop the solar flare. The Doctor hacks into the global cellular network and Maebh reads off a message prepared by the other students to warn the governments off this plan, and to request Annabel return to her. The governments stop their plan in time. As Clara and Danny escort the children home, Danny tells Clara he knows she lied to him about her travels with the Doctor, but forgives her and allows their relationship to grow.|$|E
40|$|Nine {{defoliation}} treatments {{based on}} <b>defoliating</b> <b>agents</b> {{that are in}} use in the area plus two additives (compounds A, B) were applied to Pima and Upland cotton to compare the treatment effects on percent leaf drop and yields. All of the treatments were beneficial to leaf drop compared to the untreated check with the Ginstar treatments generally performing better than the chlorate. One of the additives enhanced the early defoliation effectiveness of chlorate, the other additive enhanced the effectiveness of Ginstar throughout the defoliation process. More studies will be needed before recommendations can be made...|$|E
5000|$|For {{trees to}} be useful in archaeological analysis, they must [...] "produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem", they must [...] "live for decades and, preferably, centuries" [...] and they [...] "must have been used {{extensively}} by humans either for habitation or fuel." [...] One {{of the problems with}} this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a <b>defoliating</b> <b>agent</b> (e.g. drought, late frost, or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form. Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet.|$|R
40|$|Symposium, {{that on the}} gonads, {{dealt with}} the {{endocrine}} system. The Organizing Committee for the Endocrine Target Organ Symposium fully recognizes the diversity of scientific topics to be included into this two-day period. Nevertheless, it seemed just as defensible to include these diverse topics into one symposium as to attempt to splinter such topics {{in the context of}} toxicology. The format of the endocrine symposium is to devote separate sessions to the testes, the ovaries, the adrenal cortex, and to the thyroid gland. More specifically, each session provides an overview or state-of-the-art approach to discussing pituitary and target organ relationships. Some presentations deal with the biochemical actions of the particular target organ hormone, and finally some factors, including chemicals and environmental, that may affect these endocrine systems are discussed. This initial session focuses upon the physiology and biochemistry of the testes and those factors that affect gonadal function. To set the tone of the symposium, particularly as it relates to occupational and environmental factors and the male reproductive system, it might be of interest to recall a few recent occurrences that have received widespread attention in the popular press and newspapers. In 1977, the Metatocide, dibromochloropropane (DBCP), was reported to cause azoospermia or oligopsermia in men working in a California pesticide factory. The mechanism of DBCP toxicity is unknown, but it may act like an alkylating agent upon germinal epithelium. A somewhat more controversial example of chemicals contaminating the environment and adversely affecting the reproductive system is Agent Orange. Agent Orange, a herbicide, was used extensively in Vietnam to <b>defoliate</b> the jungle. <b>Agent</b> Orange is...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} preliminary analyses {{conducted over}} two specific cotton plots shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1. AVIRIS low altitude imagery and experimental cotton plots. October is typically {{the time of}} the year for cotton picking in the SJV. About three weeks prior to picking the irrigation is stopped in preparation for the application of a defoliant <b>agent.</b> <b>Defoliated</b> cotton is more easily harvested. The flight date of 10 October was after irrigation had stopped, but before application of the defoliant agent. In practice, this would be too late in the season to affect any economic benefit. Also, because irrigation was stopped, the onset of water stress affects the data. However, these data provide great scientific value by allowing development and testing of analysis techniques that may be used to map subtle localized conditions across plots of specific crops. 3. Ground Work Throughout the growth season which started in late May 1998, multispectral imagery was collected over the fields using the Shafter Airborne Multispectral Remote Sensing System (SAMRSS) instrument. This sensor package consists of three 10241024 CCD cameras equipped with filters simulating the first four TM bands. A fourth thermal infrared camera was also used. The SAMRSS GSD is about 0. 6 m, and calibration panels are used for ground truth. The cotton fields, and the panels are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2. SAMRSS imagery of the experiment fields. Plot 41 A contains underground drip irrigation lines that allow control of water delivery to each individual row of plants. Plots 41 and 41 A were used for irrigation studies and for (unplanned) pest infestation monitoring. Other parameters, such as soil water holding capacity, soil percent silt and clay, and electrical conductivity were also mapped for these f [...] ...|$|R
