5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – {{one at the}} time of initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E

25|$|In {{the setting}} of acute chest pain, the {{electrocardiogram}} is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the ST segment, new left bundle branch block), treatment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack {{in the form of}} angioplasty or thrombolysis is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, {{it is not possible to}} immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{states that}} excess sodium can {{increase}} {{blood pressure and}} the risk <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> disease and stroke in some individuals. Therefore, health authorities recommend limitations on dietary sodium. The United States Department of Health and Human Services recommends that individuals consume no more than 1500–2300mg of sodium (3750–5750mg of salt) per day depending on race, medical condition and age. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume no more than 5 g of salt per day.|$|E
25|$|Ritter {{rules are}} a {{compilation}} of reminders, symptoms, and risk factors designed to prevent the misdiagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection.

25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, {{it was not clear}} why they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack or stroke.|$|E
25|$|Biomaterials can {{be derived}} either from nature or {{synthesized}} in the laboratory {{using a variety of}} chemical approaches utilizing metallic components, polymers, ceramics or composite materials. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be relatively passive, like being used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug {{over an extended period of}} time. A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.|$|E

[...] She had been plagued by unusual fatigue since 1998, and her heart condition was formally diagnosed in January, 2001. She began taking medication and trained on a limited basis from 2003 to 2005, starting about 100 horses in that period, with 15 wins. However, her condition deteriorated. She started only one horse in 2005 and had no starters from 2006 until 2009. In 2008, {{at the age of}} 39, she was placed on a waiting list <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> transplant. After a seven-month wait, an organ became available on November 13, 2008, and Ritvo received her new heart that day in an operation that lasted 17 hours.

She was discharged from the hospital seven days after her surgery. She later gave a letter to the hospital to pass on to the organ donor's family, but has never heard from them.
