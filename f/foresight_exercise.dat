However, although evaluative analyses of <b>foresight</b> <b>exercises</b> have supplied evidence on acclaimed benefits [...] such as the generation of futureoriented knowledge and strengthening of collaborative networks [...] they also point to challenges in translating foresight results into actions within research and technology development (RTD) organizations. In this paper, we address these challenges by considering the work of the Wireless World Research Forum (WWRF) which has sought to promote the conception, development and diffusion of wireless communication technologies. Specifically, by contrasting this work with well-known government-initiated <b>foresight</b> <b>exercises,</b> we typify so-called explicit, emergent, and embedded foresight activities and explore their interrelationships. Our comparative analysis points to conditions under which policy interventions may not be needed for the emergence of foresight activities that exert a major influence on RTD agendas...|$|R

40|$|While the {{expansion}} of foresight scope towards systemic processes and societal considerations has provided significant opportunities for learning and synchronised action between different business units and/or policy fields, it may also have caused digression and ambiguity in the practice and theory of the management of foresight processes.

But the assessment of self-rated top-experts tend to suffer from an optimism bias, due to the experts involvement and their underestimation of realisation and diffusion problems. The degree of optimism is positively correlated with the degree of self-rated knowledge, and it is more pronounced for the least pioneering and for organisational innovations. Experts with top self-ratings working in business have a stronger optimism bias than those working in academia or in the administration.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to review the conduct and {{immediate}} impacts of a recently-completed two-year national technology <b>foresight</b> <b>exercise</b> conducted in one of Europe's smallest and wealthiest countries, Luxembourg. The country’s small size brings into sharp view many of the underlying tensions present in those foresight exercises that explicitly attempt to set national priorities. These tensions include the ability (or otherwise) to underpin the foresight process with sufficient and appropriate 'objectivised ' knowledge (including national statistics, international benchmarking data, and future-oriented 'intelligence'), the organisation of dialogic spaces that are not solely 'hijacked ' by special interests, and setting the 'granularity ' of emergent priorities {{at a level that}} makes them 'operationalisable ' in informing R&D funding programmes. The exercise was organised by the FNR, the only research council in Luxembourg. The paper shows that the position of the FNR in the research landscape had both benefits and drawbacks during the conduct of the exercise {{as well as for the}} follow-up implementation.
