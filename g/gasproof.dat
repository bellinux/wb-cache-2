25|$|Because of the {{invasion}} of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany during World War II the Dutch royal family first fled to the United Kingdom. Irene was not yet a year old when the family was forced to leave the Netherlands; she was christened in the Chapel-Royal of Buckingham Palace in London, the wife of King George VI, Queen Elizabeth being one of her godparents. As the family was leaving the Netherlands, the port where they were boarding the British warship was fiercely attacked by a German air raid; one of the German bombs exploded within 200 yards of the family. Irene was placed in a <b>gasproof</b> carrier to guard the child against chemical warfare.|$|E
2500|$|The palace {{is located}} in the village of Jedlinka (German: Tannhausen) [...] In 1943, it was {{purchased}} by the Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (National Socialist People's Welfare) from the Böhm family {{as a result of their}} financial problems. At the beginning of 1944 the plans to transform it into a hospital were disrupted because the building was confiscated by military authorities and adapted as headquarters for the Schlesische IndustriegemeinschaftAG (Silesian Industrial Company). An air-raid shelter was created in the cellar with armoured, <b>gasproof</b> doors. The palace and the nearby town of Jedlina-Zdrój (German: Bad Charlottenbrunn) was established as general base of operations for Project Riese.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1938, {{just eight}} months after the order, the {{prototype}} was finished. It was presented to a delegation of the Ordnance Department which was much impressed. In May the prototype was presented to the Commissie Pantserautomobielen. It demanded that a test programme would be quickly completed because it was intended to order new armoured cars before the end of 1938 to be able to begin equipping units in 1940 as planned. The design was intended to use the Swedish Landsverk turret as there was no Dutch manufacturer capable of producing light guns in the 25 - 40 mm range and it would be more efficient to have a single armoured car gunnery training programme. As no new turret was at the moment available, DAF had made a dummy, an almost exact replica of both armour and weaponry. For test purposes this dummy turret was again removed and replaced with a turret taken from a M36 vehicle. Tests were carried out between 4 July and 23 September 1938 by the 1e Eskadron Pantserwagens, a unit based in North Brabant, comparing it with their regular Landsverk M36. Various terrain types and obstacles had to be negotiated. The results were very favourable for the Pantrado 3. Whereas the M36 was incapable of crossing ditches, would get itself stuck on dry sand roads and had great trouble climbing steep slopes, the Pantrado 3 effortlessly overcame these obstacles. Its suspension system allowed for a much smoother cross-country ride. The main drawback was that the <b>gasproof</b> monocoque hull trapped both heat and noise. This affected crew comfort and it was impossible for the crew members to hear each other. Also on one occasion the Ford V8 engine overheated but this was shown to have been caused by using an outdated cooling system that the Ford company had already replaced on its production lines; subsequently the newer version was installed. A minor negative point was that the exhaust pipe had been fitted on the bottom and easily was damaged in terrain. Nevertheless the commission, clearly impressed by the general performance and the modern exterior, already on 9 September judged the type to be [...] "very acceptable".|$|E
40|$|<b>Gasproof</b> {{thin-wall}} {{tubes of}} fine-grained ceramics based on zirconia and gadolinia {{have been produced}} by magnetic pulsed compaction and thermal sintering. Data on their structures and electric characteristics are presented. The tubes with a diameter of ~ 15 mm, wall thickness of ~ 0. 7 mm, and length up to 80 mm are characterized by an uniform porous-free structure with a mean grain size {{in the range of}} 100 - 300 nm. The obtained ceramics possess high electrolytic properties...|$|E
