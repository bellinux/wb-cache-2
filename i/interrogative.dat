5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, <b>interrogative</b> words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal <b>interrogative</b> pronoun who is the only <b>interrogative</b> pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tonal patterns of sentences in Dominican Spanish produced {{in response to}} three pragmatic intents: declaratives, absolute <b>interrogatives,</b> and pronominal <b>interrogatives.</b> The results indicate that there are systematic variations between the three utterance types; however, the final tonal rise was not a determining factor. Distinct patterns of tonal levels distinguished {{each of the three}} utterance types. The pronominal <b>interrogatives</b> demonstrated a higher initial tonal value and prenuclear High tone, while the absolute <b>interrogatives</b> presented a significantly higher tonal value for the nuclear pitch accent. These findings identify specific intonational behaviors that vary across dialects of Spanish. Finally, the data indicate that pragmatic utterance level intonational marking of Spanish <b>interrogatives</b> is not limited to boundary tones as was previously suggested in the literature...|$|R
5|$|Personal pronouns {{exist for}} the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include <b>interrogative</b> pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials, and particles, the last being rather numerous.|$|E
5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and <b>interrogative</b> constructions.|$|E
5|$|Syntactic {{coordination}} and subordination {{is done by}} combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, <b>interrogative,</b> imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context. The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.|$|E
40|$|Analyses {{developed}} so far, {{failed to}} provide an adequate semantics for the interpretation of which-interrogatives of the form P are Q?". In this paper a new logical language is developed, where whichinterrogatives are expressed by universally quantifying over conditional <b>interrogatives.</b> Furthermore, a new semantic notion is introduced, that of an alternative. By means of the latter an adequate interpretation is given and shortcomings concerning answerhood and trivial <b>interrogatives</b> are suciently dealt with. 3 Contents 1 Introduction 5 2 The propositional logical case 6 2. 1 Simple yes/no-interrogatives.................. 6 2. 1. 1 The syntax of simple yes/no-interrogatives..... 6 2. 1. 2 The semantics of simple yes/no-interrogatives.... 7 2. 2 Adding conditional <b>interrogatives...............</b> 11 2. 2. 1 The syntax of conditional <b>interrogatives.......</b> 11 2. 2. 2 The semantics of conditional <b>interrogatives.....</b> 12 2. 2. 3 Another approach [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two types}} of expressions that seem to exist in all lan-guages, demonstratives and <b>interrogatives.</b> Based on {{a representative sample of}} 100 languages it is shown that demonstratives and <b>interrogatives</b> have some striking features in common. They cross-cut the boundaries of several word classes and encode the same semantic features: person, thing, place, direction, manner, time, and amount. It is the central hypothesis of this study that the crosslinguistic parallelism between demonstratives and <b>interrogatives</b> is motivated by their pragmatic functions: both initiate a search for information that is guided by their semantic and syntactic fea-tures. Further, it is argued that demonstratives and <b>interrogatives</b> have a special status in language. Although both types of expressions are commonly considered grammatical markers, they do not serve an ordinary grammatical function. Grammatical markers organize the information flow in the ongo-ing discourse, whereas basic demonstratives and <b>interrogatives</b> are immedi-ately concerned with the speaker-hearer interaction. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{language}} distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, <b>interrogative,</b> past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) {{and eight}} cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, {{as well as}} for case.|$|E
5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and <b>interrogative</b> adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, <b>interrogative,</b> imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the <b>interrogative</b> call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{acquisition}} of English multiple <b>interrogatives</b> such as Who did what? by advanced learners of English whose first language is Indonesian. The underlying functional feature of multiple <b>interrogatives</b> is multiple focus features, which are not available in Indonesian. Unlike English, there is no equivalent structure of multiple <b>interrogatives</b> in Indonesian since wh-questions in this language are instantiations of unique focus constructions. Acceptability judgment tasks were administered on four wh-pairings: whowhen, who-where, what-when, and what-where. The first task was {{in the form of}} questions with a pair-list answer and single answer, whereas the second was in the form of questions within the contexts. Conjoined <b>interrogatives</b> were also added into the tasks in order to observe the L 1 transfer. The results clearly demonstrate that overall advanced learners of English were significantly different from the English native speakers in their ratings of acceptability of multiple <b>interrogatives.</b> However, the statistical data of each wh-phrase pairing demonstrates that L 2 learners performed like native controls in their ratings of most of the pairings. These findings suggest that the present study lends partial support to Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis and No Parameter Resetting Hypothesis...|$|R
