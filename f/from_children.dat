He observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork <b>from</b> <b>children</b> was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls <b>from</b> <b>children</b> inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} of the {{initiative}} to challenge the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for anti-censorship campaigners; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography <b>from</b> <b>children</b> were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E

5|$|The book's eight {{chapters}} address prominent themes affecting slave children, including education, leisure, religion, {{transitions to}} freedmen, and work expectations.

King's evidence includes slave narratives, ex-slave interviews collected by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), plantation owner diaries, census records, newspapers, autobiographies, missionary reports, and Freedmen's Bureau records. She contrasts Northern and Southern slave life, as well as their ownership by whites, blacks, and Native Americans.|$|E

The episode was watched by 7.14 million viewers in the UK, and was given an Appreciation Index of 83. Though Graham received letters <b>from</b> <b>children</b> who enjoyed the episode, it did not generate a positive response from adult fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World WarI in 1917, 131 men <b>from</b> <b>Children</b> of Israel enlisted or were drafted; one was killed. By 1919, the congregation's family {{membership}} {{had reached}} 450, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $18,000 (today $). The congregational school, which still held classes once a week, had 14 teachers and 388 students. The following year, women {{were given the}} right to vote at all congregational meetings. Fineshriber left in 1924 to become head rabbi of Congregation Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia. During his tenure, Children of Israel's membership doubled, and the religious school grew from 100 to 550 students. He died in 1968, and is the congregation's only deceased senior rabbi not buried in its cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material <b>from</b> <b>children.</b> A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E

5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material <b>from</b> <b>children</b> without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many <b>from</b> <b>children.</b> For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
