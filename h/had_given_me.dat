25|$|Marjorie Barnard met Flora Eldershaw, {{who was a}} {{year ahead}} of her, in her first year at the University of Sydney. Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of these rumours and arguments, the belief {{strengthened}} among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin explicitly advised Edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying Simpson, indicating that if he did, in direct contravention of his ministers' advice, the government would resign en masse. The King responded, according to his own account later: [...] "I intend to marry Mrs. Simpson as soon as she is free to marry... if the Government opposed the marriage, as the Prime Minister <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> reason to believe it would, then I was prepared to go." [...] Under pressure from the King, and [...] "startled" [...] at the suggested abdication, Baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] {{incorporated}} {{the use of}} the Electronic LinnDrum machine, {{and was one of the}} first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. LinnDrum had been used sparingly in their previous single [...] "Do Your Dance", but in [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] its use was more spontaneous, which Dave Thompson, author of Funk noted as if [...] "it virtually duetted with Dickey, creating one of the most distinctive records of the year—and one of the most imitated of the age." [...] The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey was present during the recording. Buckmaster recalled: [...] "I was over at [...] place almost every day with Norman, and some days I stayed away to write, or to mix the music. Gene <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the keys to his apartment, and also let me use the piano to record the song. I didn't want to work on at Miles' because his piano was falling to bits." ...|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} it was Evita's work with the {{foundation}} that played {{a large role in}} her idealization, even leading some to consider her a saint. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she [...] "...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism." [...] Poet , a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: [...] "I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> a Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense...." ...|$|E
500|$|After the tour, Bradman {{was full}} of praise for Miller, {{although}} somewhat critical of his aggressive batting, which the Australian captain thought to be reckless: [...] Bradman criticised Miller's hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller's attitude to cricket, saying [...] "He is never one to accept runs when they are there for the taking...I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> joy in the game approached by others." [...] With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton {{said that it was}} up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller's persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter's retirement after the tour. During Bradman's testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this.|$|E

2500|$|Van Dyck's portraits {{certainly}} flattered {{more than}} Velázquez's; when Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover, first met Queen Henrietta Maria, {{in exile in}} Holland in 1641, she wrote: [...] "Van Dyck's handsome portraits <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> so fine {{an idea of the}} beauty of all English ladies, that I {{was surprised to find that}} the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth..." ...|$|E

[...] "If only the heavens <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> twenty more years of rule and a little leisure," [...] he wrote while in exile on Saint Helena, [...] "one would vainly search today for the old Paris; nothing would remain of it but vestiges." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Etowah County Circuit Judge Julius Swann died in office. Republican Governor H. Guy Hunt {{was charged}} with making a {{temporary}} appointment until the next election. Moore's name was floated by some of his associates, and a background check was initiated with several state and county agencies, including the Etowah County district attorney's office. Moore's former political opponent Jimmy Hedgspeth, who still helmed the D.A.'s office, recommended Moore despite personal reservations, and Moore was installed in the position {{he had failed to}} win in 1982.

2500|$|By his own reckoning, {{the best}} spell Roberts ever {{delivered}} {{was during the}} Headingley Test of the West Indies' 1976 tour of England: [...] "I only got three wickets, but in my mind there was a decision given against me. It was a leg-before decision against Peter Willey, where he played right back onto his stumps to a fuller delivery. I would've bowled England out that afternoon if the umpire <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the decision." [...] Despite an excellent record in Tests his international career was relatively short and ended in 1983. Imran Khan (former captain Pakistan national cricket team) once described a ball bowled to him by Andy Roberts as the fastest and most terrifying he had ever faced.|$|E

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me.</b> I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough.

2500|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} for a bride, Charles looked to France instead. The English agent Kensington {{was sent to}} Paris in 1624 to examine the potential French match, and the marriage was finally negotiated in Paris by James Hay and Henry Rich. Henrietta Maria was aged just fifteen {{at the time of}} her marriage, but this was not unusually young for royal princesses of the period. Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime.

2500|$|Gibb {{said he had}} [...] "battled the booze" [...] {{since the}} 1970s. John Lennon {{introduced}} him to his favourite drink, scotch and coke: [...] "If he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> cyanide, I would have drunk the cyanide, I was so {{in awe of the}} man." [...] With his neighbour Ringo Starr he would go out drinking. [...] It {{got to the point where}} he became unreliable and prior to going onstage would have to feel his way along the wall to get there, according to Barry. One factor in Maurice's recovery was the active intervention of his brothers, who had recently lost their youngest brother Andy. In an interview, Maurice acknowledged that his final years of alcohol abuse had been driven by his failure to reach Andy before his death, and his subsequent guilt. After rehab Maurice started to rediscover his family again, spending quality time with them. To celebrate this, he and Yvonne renewed their wedding vows in 1992. [...] The ceremony was attended not only by many members of their families but many of the friends Gibb made while at the rehabilitation center. Maurice would remain sober until his death.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was placed}} {{in command of the}} Department of the Columbia in 1874, went west to Washington Territory's Fort Vancouver, where he fought in the Indian Wars, {{particularly}} against the Nez Perce, with the resultant surrender of Chief Joseph. He was criticized by Chief Joseph as precipitating the war by trying to rush the Nez Perce to a smaller reservation, with no advance notice, no discussion, and no time to prepare. Joseph said, [...] "If General Howard <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> plenty of time to gather up my stock and treated Too-hool-hool-suit as a man should be treated, {{there would have been no}} war." [...] Subsequently, Howard was superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1881–82. He served as commander of the Department of the Platte from 1882 to 1886 and the Military Division of the Pacific from 1886 to 1888. From 1888, his final command was of the Department of the East (Military Division of the Atlantic) at Fort Columbus on Governors Island in New York Harbor, encompassing the states east of the Mississippi River. He retired from the United States Army at that posting in 1894 with the rank of major general. The French government made him a chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1884.|$|E
2500|$|Brown later {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} Life Against Death, referring to its chapter on [...] "Language and Eros" [...] as [...] "quite immature." [...] He {{observed that the}} book, [...] "records the first revision of my historical identity, from Marx to Marx and Freud", a process which occurred because his first [...] "historical identity", Marxism, had been [...] "wrecked in the frozen landscapes of the Cold War, {{the defeat of the}} simplistic hopes for a better world that inspired the Henry Wallace campaign for the Presidency in 1948." [...] Brown, who saw Louis Zukofsky's poetry as anticipating the ideas of both Life Against Death and Love's Body (1966), has called Life Against Death [...] "my first exuberant surge of premature post-Marxist energy", writing that in it he had wagered his [...] "intellectual life on the idea of finding in Freud what was missing in Marx." [...] Brown [...] "found in Freud's analysis of the pathological dimension of human desires the basis for a post-Marxist critique of capitalism." [...] Commenting on his intellectual development, Brown noted that, [...] "My Marxist background <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> a healthy prejudice against moneymaking. Imagine my excitement when I discovered Sandor Ferenczi's article 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money'; with its immortal conclusion, 'After what has been said money is seen to be nothing other than deodorized, dehydrated shit that has been made to shine.'" ...|$|E
