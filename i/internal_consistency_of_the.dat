500|$|Dirac {{described}} the quantization {{of the electromagnetic}} field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators {{with the introduction of}} the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, Werner Heisenberg and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, {{it would be possible to}} perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, [...] in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the subscales}} {{contained}} {{only a few}} items, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation-specific subscales <b>of</b> motivation were all acceptable. The invested effort subscale assessed students’ test-taking motivation defined according to Baumert and Demmrich’s ([2001]) definition—willingness to engage on test items. We assigned the other subscales to the test-related facets (test attractiveness, usefulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test) and to the person-related facets (emotional state, worry, distraction) of test-taking motivation.|$|R

2500|$|For many believers, the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish and Christian scriptures is {{important}} because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin. On {{the subject of the}} Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the Torah that [...] "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the Hebrew Bible or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that [...] "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected rabbinic leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies." [...] However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this [...] "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> {{surplus value}} <b>of</b> a {{multilevel}} {{exploratory factor analysis}}, compared to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a standard exploratory factor analysis plus aggregation. Until now, this alternative multilevel technique has never been used in educational effectiveness research. Both methods were used to construct school process variables, {{based on data from}} 1550 teachers within 113 cycle groups. Our results show broader and, to some extent, also distinct factors at the group level in comparison with the teacher level, irrespective <b>of</b> taking <b>the</b> dependency into account. Furthermore, while <b>the</b> total amount <b>of</b> variance explained is not larger at the group level, we observe higher <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group-level factors.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> {{reliability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three {{scales in}} NUEPS was determined {{in the study}} by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient for the above sample. The results in Table  2 indicate that the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> reliability ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three NUEPS scales. For the whole scale, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.98, and <b>the</b> half-split reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale was 0.93. For the ‘STA’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.95, with a half-split reliability <b>of</b> 0.93. For <b>the</b> ‘SRP’, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.95, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Finally, for the ‘LAPI’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.92, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measures used in this study can be considered as favorable.|$|R
50|$|Past {{research}} has measured RCSE with a psychological scale consisting of 11 items. The scale contains two related sub-scales: the general Contingent Self-Esteem Scale and the Contingencies of Self-Worth Scale.

50|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale, a team which included the original authors found that the original questionnaire contained some irrelevant questions and produced a shortened version of the scale containing 28 items.

50|$|This {{scale is}} made up of two {{questionnaires}} (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) with 42 items each, which provide a total score on intra-couple communication and scores relative to 6 dimensions: communication, adjustment, intimacy and sexuality, children, jobs and income, and religious beliefs.

5000|$|Objects are {{instances}} of classes. They contain data and provides services. The data forms {{the attributes of}} the object. The services are known as methods (also known as operations or functions). Typically, methods operate on private data (the attributes, or state of the object), which is only visible to the methods of the object. Thus the attributes of an object cannot be changed directly by the user, but only by the methods of the object. This guarantees the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} tested <b>the</b> psychometric {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leisure Coping Strategy Scale (LCSS), named as LCSS-M, in Mexican population.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPADI {{total and}} its subscales {{measured}} with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient were high (0.932 for SPADI-Total, 0.899 for SPADI-Disability, 0.905 for SPADI-Pain). Intraclass correlation coefficients showed excellent test–retest reliability (0.899 for Disability, 0.902 for Pain, and 0.929 for total SPADI). A significantly high positive correlation {{was found between}} the SPADI total score and its subscales, and Quick DASH for Pain and Disability. Significant correlations were also found between SPADI scales and EQ- 5 D variables. There was a moderate positive correlation with the variables “self-reliance” (r =  0.66), “common activities” (r =  0.58), and “pain/discomfort” (r =  0.49), and a weaker correlation with the “mobility” variable (r =  0.20). Factor analysis (PAF method) revealed a bidimensional formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPADI. Eight items (five pain/three disability) weighted the first factor by > 0.5, and five disability items weighted the second factor.|$|R

5000|$|In {{statistics}} and research, internal consistency is typically a measure {{based on the}} correlations between different items on the same test (or the same subscale on a larger test). It measures whether several items that propose to measure the same general construct produce similar scores. For example, if a respondent expressed agreement with the statements [...] "I like to ride bicycles" [...] and [...] "I've enjoyed riding bicycles in the past", and disagreement with the statement [...] "I hate bicycles", this would be indicative of good <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test.|$|E

50|$|Internal {{consistency}} has routinely {{been high}} {{in studies of}} the PSC and its various forms, formats, and languages. The original study of the PSC found alpha = 0.86 indicating that the PSC had a fairly high degree of internal consistency. One of the original studies of the PSC-17 measured <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full scale and each of its subscales and found alpha values for each between 0.79 and 0.89. A study using the English, Spanish, oral, and written formats of the PSC found alpha = 0.91-0.92 for all formats. A study done with the Dutch PSC found alpha = 0.89, one done with the German PSC found alpha = 0.86, for the Korean PSC alpha = 0.95.|$|E

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed separately on samples of three different age groups, and <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subscales were investigated.
