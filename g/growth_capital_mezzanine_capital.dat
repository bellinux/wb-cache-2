As a consequence of a loan denial, innovative companies experience a smaller drop in the share of actual to planned investment than non-innovative companies. The non-randomness of loan denials is controlled for with a selection equation employing the intensity of banking competition at the district level as an exclusion restriction. We can explain the better performance of innovative companies by their ability to increase the use of external equity financing, such as venture <b>capital</b> or <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital,</b> when facing a loan denial.

40|$|The {{distinctive}} feature of innovative undertakings, {{as opposed to}} standard investment undertakings, {{is the presence of}} the innovation creation phase characterised by a risk connected with the lack of certainty as to the research results. The said risk is so significant that it cannot be accounted for in the handling costs and the methods of providing security to traditional and unconventional forms of financing. The use of hybrid forms of financing, which include venture <b>capital</b> and <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital,</b> allows one to increase the elasticity of handling costs of the forms of financing, as well as to make use of special forms of security. In the case of venture capital, in the period of the project's realisation, the handling costs of such form of financing do not occur as funds become shareholders of the project until its completion. The security has the form of corporate governance on account of shares (stocks) held. In the case of <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital,</b> in the period of the project's realisation the handling costs can be decreased by way of a part of them being "brought forward" until completion of the project {{in the form of the}} so-called warrant.

40|$|Purpose of the article: There {{are more}} kinds of used {{financial}} sources and the chargeable {{of them are}} termed as capital. They can {{can be divided into}} two basic groups according to the legal position of the provider, namely into equity and debt. Each item of capital is connected with some costs because of the existence of risk. There is generally known, that owners bear a higher rate of risk than creditors, thus the cost of equity should be higher than cost of debt. But there are also differences in risk rates within each group of capital, because there are more kinds of equity and debt. So the cost of every item of equity and debt should be estimated differently. Furthermore, there is used a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital,</b> which has some characteristics of both equity and debt. Methodology/methods: There is implemented a secondary research based on studying existing literature dedicated to either kinds of <b>capital,</b> including the <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital,</b> or cost of capital. The existing theory about estimating cost of equity and debt is consequently applied on individual types of <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital.</b> Scientific aim: This article has its aim to estimate cost of <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital,</b> which can be used in three basic forms, namely senior subordinated debt, convertible subordinated debt or redeemable preferred stock. To fulfill this aim, there is used the theory of estimating cost of common and preferred stock and the theory of options. Findings: The providers of senior subordinated debt bear a higher risk than other “classical” creditors, which is analogous to holders of common and preferred stock. So the difference between cost of these two kinds of debt (before interest tax shield) should be the same as the difference between cost of common and preferred stock. By estimating cost of convertible subordinated debt can be used the theory of options. So the convertible subordinated debt is divided into two parts, debt itself and the call option, whose cost is estimated as cost of equity. Costs of both parts are added up. Cost of redeemable preferred stock is estimated by using the theory of options, too. But in this case, the holder of preferred stock is in the short position, which means, that cost of this option is subtracted from the cost of preferred stock itself. Conclusions: Cost of any types of <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital</b> is higher than cost of debt, but lower than cost of equity, which is related to the rate of risk. Furthermore, cost of senior subordinated debt is lower than cost of convertible subordinated debt and cost of this type of <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital</b> is lower than cost of redeemable preferred stock, because of different rates of risk, too. So using <b>mezzanine</b> <b>capital</b> can significantly affect the capital structure and the weighted average cost of capital...|$|R
