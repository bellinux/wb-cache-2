The proposed tearing test is convenient especially for imaging techniques such as thermography, and can help give new insights into the tearing process of paper.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{orientation}} {{effects of}} biaxially stretched polystyrene (PS) sheets and polyethylene (PE) blown films were investigated. The study mainly {{focused on the}} relationships between orientation of amorphous PS and semi-crystalline PE and their shrinkage, tensile properties and tear resistance. For low orientations, {{it was found that}} the stress and strain (shrinkage in films) can be simply related to birefringence for both PS and PE. For tear properties of PE films, better correlations were observed with crystalline orientation factors.

40|$|Abstract Two polyethylene-based on single-site {{metallocene}} catalyst (mLLDPE) {{were selected}} to characterize the effect of long chain branching (LCB) on blown film processability, optical and mechanical properties. 13 C NMR and parallel plate rheology were used to identify LCB presence on LLDPEs. Blown films were produced from 100 % LLDPEs using three different machine direction (MD) stretch ratios. When the same processing conditions for the two LLDPEs grades were used, better processability was observed for LLDPE with LCB. In relation to mechanical and physical properties, <b>Elmendorf</b> <b>tear</b> and optical properties were highly influenced {{by the presence of}} LCB. Tear resistance is affected by film orientation and is inversely proportional to the level of LCB in the polymer. It was observed a reduction of 50 % in the MD tear strength when comparing with the polymer without LCB. However, haze decreases significantly with the presence of LCB, about 40 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{correlations}} between the properties and microstructural characteristics of polyethylene blown films, three polymers were evaluated in this study: low density polyethylene (LDPE), {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). Series of blown films were produced at different process conditions. Morphological characteristics of the films were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), FTIR, and birefrigence measurements. Herman's orientation factors of the films were determined via both wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) pole figures and infrared dichroism. Differential scanning calorimetry and WAXD were used to determine the degree of crystallinity and crystal dimensions. Finally, key mechanical properties including <b>Elmendorf</b> <b>tear,</b> dart impact, tensile properties in both MD and TD and optical properties such as haze and clarity have been measured. By using the statistical design of experiments and multivariate modeling, these properties are correlated to the microstructural parameters including the degree of crystallinity, lamellar thickness, Herman's orientation factors, and roughness.

40|$|Effects of {{nanofiller}} {{concentration and}} surface treatments on the morphology, thermal, viscoelastic and mechanical behaviors of polypropylene copolymer (PP) /boehmite alumina (BA) nanocomposites were investigated. Both untreated and treated BA particles with octylsilane (OS) and with sulphonic acid compound (OS 2) were {{added up to}} 10 wt% to produce nanocomposites by melt mixing followed by film blow molding and hot pressing. Dispersion of BA was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray scattering were adopted to detect changes in the crystalline structure of PP. Thermooxidative degradation of the nanocomposites was assessed by thermogravimetrical analysis. Dynamic mechanical analysis served for studying the viscoelastic, whereas quasi-static tensile, creep and <b>Elmendorf</b> <b>tear</b> tests were used to detect changes in the mechanical performance. BA nanoparticles were finely dispersed in PP up to 10 wt%, {{even when they were}} not surface modified. The resistance to thermal degradation was markedly improved by BA nanomodification. Changes observed in the mechanical properties were attributed to BA dispersion, filler/matrix interactions and related effects because the crystalline characteristics of the PP matrix practically did not change with BA modification...|$|R

In this regard, {{the influence of the}} main operating parameters such as type of polymer used (polyester, polypropylene and polyamide), type and concentration of the CNTs on conductivity, and mechanical and thermal properties of the melt spun fibres was studied. The conductivity of melt spun fibres was measured based on the method developed by Morton and Hearl. The morphologies of the CNTs–polymer composite fibres were studied by scanning electron microscopy.

This method was as good as or better than conventional micro -Kjeldahl technique s. Durable press cotton fabric from the earlier W 103 Western Regional study was laundered for 0, 1, 12, 24, 36 and 48 times at 140 F followed by a 104 F rinse and tumble drying. An additional sample at each laundry level was both steam pressed and laundered. The fabric was then analyzed for total percent add-on of finishes, total nitrogen, durable press rating, wrinkle recovery angle, bursting strength and <b>Elmendorf</b> <b>tear</b> resistance. Percent add-on and decreases in nitrogen content due to extraction with perchloroethylene, ethanol, water and 0. 1 N HC 1 were also determined. Steam pressing in addition to laundering did not significantly affect any of the physical properties studied. Bursting strength did not change significantly during laundering. Tear resistance decreased significantly through 36 launderings. Significant decreases occurred during the first laundering and up to the twelfth laundering for percent add-on, durable press rating and wrinkle recovery angles. Total nitrogen content showed a significant quadratic effect on durable press ratings with increased launderings. This was related only to the 0. 1 N HC 1 extractable nitrogen containing fraction. Major decreases in other nitrogen containing and most percent add-on fractions occurred only during the first laundering. No other relationships were shown between nitrogen content and observed physical properties...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of mode-I {{fracture}} toughness of ductile polymeric thin films is nontrivial. In {{order to gain}} understanding about the fracture mechanics and the processing-structure-property relationships of metallocene linear low-density polyethylene (m-LLDPE) thin film, a custom-built double-edge notched tensile (DENT) test fixture was developed to perform the mode-I fracture test on m-LLDPE thin films, and the essential work of fracture (EWF) analysis, which employs an unique energy partitioning concept, was used to characterize the {{fracture toughness}} of the thin films. Effects of specimen geometry, strain rate, film orientation, processing parameters, and resin densities on the specific essential work of fracture, we, and the specific non-essential work of fracture, wp, were investigated. The usefulness of the methodology incorporating the EWF analysis and the custom-built film fixture for characterizing LLDPE fracture toughness is evaluated and discussed, and {{the correlations between the}} EWF parameters and the films? <b>Elmendorf</b> <b>tear</b> properties were also made. The visual, full-field stress distributions of the EWF film specimens were measured in-situ during mode-I facture testing by the photoelastic method, and the deformation in the process zone of post-mortem specimen was also characterized. A new experimental approach has been developed to directly quantify and partition the total mode-I fracture energy of m-LLDPE blown films. Three distinctive deformation zones have been identified from the photoelastic observation of the m-LLDPE blown films during the mode-I facture testing. These three zones include the essential work zone due to necking and crack propagation, the non-essential plastic deformation zone, and a newly proposed recoverable viscoelastic deformation zone. The tensile true stress-strain curves of m-LLDPE blown films and the full-field strain mapping of the mode-I DENT specimen were generated to allow for quantitative energy partitioning at each deformation zone in-situ as defined by the EWF approach. The current approach allows to perform directly quantification and partitioning of the total mode-I fracture energy for the exact physical interpretation of the EWF parameters and their correlation to material characteristics...|$|R

Three {{different}} crops had been studied which include the pineapple (Ananas Comosus) leaf, corn (Zea mays) stalk and Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum). Those crops were characterized as agro waste material in Malaysia and have a high potential to become an alternative fiber. The objective of this work was to analysis the chemical composition which are pineapple leaf, corn stalk and Napier grass; to investigate the properties of hand sheet made from those crops; to determine the influence of different pulping process and process variables on the physical and chemical properties. Every chemical components analyse; Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Ash and Lignin content by TAPPI Test Method. All of three samples were undergo acidic and alkali pulping process. Fiber Analyser was used for fiber analysis and SEM use for observation on sample. From pulping process, the step will continue for papermaking. Lastly, tensile, bursting, folding, and <b>tearing</b> <b>tester</b> machine will test paper production. Result shows that pineapple leaf gives high cellulose content (66. 2 %) and lower lignin content (4. 2 %) compared corn stalk and napier grass. Alkaline pulping shows a quality of pulp rather than acidic pulping process due to the pulp strength and colour of fiber. Corn stalk gives a high potential to be an alternative for mechanical properties viewed. High tensile index (90. 99 Ndg), burst index (6. 64 kpa*m 21 g) and fold index (3. 51 Nm) by corn stalk paper rather than pineapple leaf and napier grass but lower in tear index (2. 85 ~ m ~ l gT) h. is wass due to the long fiber length by pineapple leaf about 13. 36 mm fi-om SEM images. This arrangement form and effect a structure of fiber. Based on all tests, corn stalk materials have high potential to be fiber substitution but pineapple leaf and napier grass have their own characteristic to be alternative fiber.

The pulping of rice straw was carried out with the soda process (Chaiarrekij et al. 2011) before being extensively washed with tap water to remove the alkali. The xylanase pretreatment (18.6  U crude xylanase.g- 1 dry pulp) with or without sorbitol at a final concentration of 0.75  M, was performed in transparent plastic bags with 10 % (w/v) rice straw pulp suspended in 50  mM sodium acetate buffer (pH  6.0). The reaction was performed at 70 °C for 2  h (Viikari et al. 2007). Reducing sugars in the hydrolysates were determined by the DNS method. For H 2 O 2 treatment, the enzyme-treated pulp (or the enzyme-untreated pulp as the control) {{was transferred to the}} H 2 O 2 solution (10 % (v/v) final concentration) and incubated for 1  h at the same temperature. The resultant bleached pulp was made into 60  g.m- 2 hand sheets on a Rapid-Köthen sheet former (RK- 2 A KWT, PTI, Austria) according to the ISO Standard Method 5269 – 2.
