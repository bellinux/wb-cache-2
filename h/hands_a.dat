5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E

5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or {{continue to live}} in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their <b>hands.</b> <b>A</b> few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E

5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the <b>hands.</b> <b>A</b> scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|Case {{took over}} the lease on the hotel in 1907 and bought the {{property}} on which the building sat in 1927 for US$1 million. Case remained owner and manager of the hotel {{until his death in}} June 1946. In October that year, The Algonquin was purchased by Ben Bodne of Charleston, South Carolina for just over US$1 million. Bodne undertook an extensive restoration and renovation effort. Bodne sold the hotel in 1987 to a group of Japanese investors and the Algonquin changed <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> number of times before ending up with Miller Global Properties in 2002. Following a two-year, US$3 million renovation, the hotel was sold again in 2005 to HEI Hospitality.|$|E

5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French <b>hands,</b> <b>a</b> product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Kasim becomes jealous when {{he hears}} about his brother's fortune, and wants to know the secret behind this. Under Salima's guidance, he invites Alibaba and his {{household}} for a feast. After cunningly obtaining {{the secret of the}} dacoits' cave, Kasim sentences Alibaba to death, falsely accusing him of attempted murder. Marziana pretends to heed Kasim's order. She declares that Alibaba has been unfaithful to her and he deserves this retribution. Taking a knife, Marziana acts as though she means to kill Alibaba, but instead cuts the ropes that bind his <b>hands.</b> <b>A</b> fight ensues between Alibaba and Kasim's thugs (during which Salima is accidentally killed), but Alibaba subdues them and escapes with his allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named <b>Hand</b> <b>A,</b> <b>Hand</b> B, and <b>Hand</b> C. <b>Hand</b> <b>A</b> is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. <b>Hand</b> <b>A,</b> for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. <b>Hand</b> B has <b>a</b> somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than <b>Hand</b> <b>A.</b> <b>Hand</b> C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by <b>hand</b> <b>A</b> and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|R

5|$|Nostalgia for old Hollywood movies {{would be}} a theme of Donen's next film: Movie Movie, {{produced}} by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment and scripted by Larry Gelbart and Sheldon Keller. The film is actually two shorter films presented as an old fashioned double feature, complete with a fake movie trailer and an introduction by comedian George Burns. It starred George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Michael Kidd and Eli Wallach and premiered in competition at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. The first of the two films is Dynamite <b>Hands,</b> <b>a</b> black and white tribute to boxing – morality films. The second film is Baxter's Beauties of 1933, {{a tribute to the}} extravagant musicals of Busby Berkely. Like Donen's previous two films, it was unsuccessful both financially and critically.|$|E
5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense of Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet their}} protein {{requirements}} and obtain nitrogen, these lemurs also hunt small arthropods. In captivity, P.furcifer strongly favored preying mantises and moths {{of the family}} Sphingidae while ignoring grasshoppers, larva of the moth genus Coeloptera, and small reptiles. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the <b>hands,</b> <b>a</b> stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as galagos. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed on are high in protein, so some fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects.|$|E
5|$|During the Jin–Song wars, {{the invading}} Jurchens sacked the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng in 1126 AD, and an {{enormous}} amount of prized literature found in the Imperial Library was lost, including the original copy of the Wujing Zongyao. After the original was lost, only a few manuscripts survived {{as a result of its}} secretive nature. Only a few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy <b>hands.</b> <b>A</b> remaining copy of the Wujing Zongyao was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the Southern Song dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the Wujing Zongyao of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin. The entire Wujing Zongyao was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available. However, the historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign <b>hands,</b> <b>a</b> clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

5|$|Some time in {{the early}} 12th century, a castle was built within the town. Originally a wooden fort built by Richard de Redvers, first cousin to King Henry I, it was rebuilt in stone by Baldwin de Redvers to resist King Stephen {{during the civil war}} with the Empress Matilda. The castle again saw action during the Civil War of 1642–1651 when {{occupied}} by the Parliamentarians. Christchurch changed <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> number of times: originally under Royalist control, it was captured by Sir William Waller's Parliamentary army in 1644. Lord Goring briefly retook the town in 1645 but was obliged to withdraw and returned with a larger force days later and laid siege to the castle. However, the Parliamentarians withstood the siege and maintained their hold on the town. Fearing such a powerful stronghold might once again fall into Royalist hands, Cromwell ordered the castle to be destroyed in 1652.|$|E
5|$|The Anzacs {{were confronted}} by a treacherous, {{confusing}} tangle of ravines and spurs that descended from the heights of the Sarı Baır range to the sea. The landing was only lightly opposed by scattered Turkish units until Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division and perceiving {{the threat posed by}} the landings, rushed reinforcements to the area in what became a race for the high ground. The contest for the heights was decided on the second ridge line where the Anzacs and Turks fought over a knoll called Baby 700. The position changed <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> number of times on the first day before the Turks, having the advantage of the higher ground on Battleship Hill, took final possession of it. Once the Anzac advance was checked, the Turks counter-attacked, trying to force the invaders back to the shore, but failed to dislodge them from the foothold they had gained. A trench perimeter quickly developed and a bloody stalemate ensued until August.|$|E
5|$|The six {{surviving}} Yugoslav {{boats were}} {{captured by the}} Italians during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, and were operated by the Regia Marina in a coastal and second-line escort role. Immediately following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, one ex-Yugoslav boat was sunk by German aircraft, another was scuttled by its Italian crew, and two more fell back into Yugoslav <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> few months later. The remaining two were seized by the Germans. Of the two ex-Yugoslav boats {{taken over by the}} Germans, both were operated by Croatian crews or by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia for some time before being recovered by the Germans. One was destroyed by Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats in June 1944, and the other was sunk by Royal Air Force aircraft in 1945. The two surviving boats were commissioned by the Yugoslav Navy after the war, one continuing in service until the early 1960s.|$|E
