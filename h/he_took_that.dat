He advertised his business regularly in the golf magazines. In addition to his skill as a club maker, Low was a superb player. As of 1915 he had tied his own course record of 3-under-par 71 on the par 74 Baltusrol course no less than a dozen times. That same year he placed seventh in the 1915 U.S. Open held on his home course at Baltusrol.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the time}} that the robot is gone, Antimony meets a {{creature}} called Reynardine, who tries to take over her body but, by accident, instead becomes trapped in the body of a stuffed animal she carries; and becomes subject to her command. Because of her relationship with Reynardine and the events with Coyote and Ysengrin, Antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium, one of the individuals who moderate disputes between the Wood and the Court and communicates with etheric beings, and she decides to return to the woods to speak with Coyote. When Antimony visits Coyote, she learns that in the past Coyote had travelled across the sea to find Renard (called later Reynardine) and Ysengrin and make them into [...] "powerful being" [...] like himself.Antimony: [...] "Why were you looking for Renard in the first place? [...] Why bring him here?"Coyote: [...] "I sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself!" [...] He had given Ysengrin [...] "power over the trees" [...] and given Reynardine the power to take bodies, but bodies that Reynardine took always died after he left themCoyote: [...] "For some reason, when Renard had the ability , any body <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> was not his own would die when it was used up." [...] and Ysengrin was hardly strong enough to stand without the help of Coyote's tree armor. Reynardine had been in love with Antimony's mother, Surma,Coyote: [...] "I wouldn't be surprised if he cared very deeply about you, ! You see, Renard fell desperately in love with Surma!" [...] and had used his power to steal a young man's body and woo Surma; the man died, however, and Reynardine was imprisoned in Gunnerkrigg Court until the events surrounding his first meeting with Antimony.Coyote: [...] " [...] soon runs away! He steals the body of a young man and disappears into the Court, looking to woo the fiery Surma. [...] We heard he was captured, tricked! ... and I did not see him again until last summer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arthur J. Singer, {{author of}} Arthur Godfrey: The Adventures of an American Broadcaster (2000), rejects this accusation, citing Godfrey's good {{personal}} relations {{with a number}} of Jews in the entertainment industry, including his longtime announcer Tony Marvin. As for Godfrey's association with the Kenilworth, the hotel did establish a [...] "No Jews" [...] policy in the 1920s, but abandoned it when Godfrey acquired a stake in the hotel in the early 1950s. [...] In the eyes of the public, the increasingly negative publicity Godfrey, despite his ongoing popularity, generated since 1953 no doubt added credence to the accusations. [...] In fact Godfrey was only a part-owner of the hotel and insisted that when <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> stake, he ended any discriminatory policies that existed. [...] Further undermining Fisher's account, he appeared on Talent Scouts years before Godfrey purchased a part interest in the Kenilworth.|$|E
