5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box.

Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> to play. After easily finishing the task at hand, Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student.

5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E
5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E

5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
