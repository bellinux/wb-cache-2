And since it’s early in the morning we will be in good condition. Judy has described the background, her family background and early background in detail, so we will begin with the second question, which asks for her to select the experiences that were most important in her intellectual development. Judy, what were the early adult experiences? Which ones were important to you? I thought it was early, but I guess it’s early adult. Rosenblith: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>probably,</b> the most important early adult experiences were: being denied candidacy for the Ph. D. at UCLA, which is described in more detail in section one; being a married graduate student with two children under three and ending up at Harvard with a trunk full of data, relevant to Allport’s work; having both a very successful and very traumatic experience at Harvard, where my first try for getting a degree went awry, partly over relationships with Allport; and later returning to Harvard under the aegis of Bob Sears, although just at the time he was leaving. The people I had contact with at Harvard, as professors were certainly extremely important to my intellectual development. Bob Sears is clearly the most important of them.

5000|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass. It's a very Victorian world, and when I was writing Spook Country I kept running up against that feeling that the world I'm actually trying to predict is becoming more Victorian, not less. Less middle class, more like Mexico, more like Mexico City. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>probably</b> not a good direction.
