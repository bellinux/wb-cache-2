5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed <b>flight-worthy.</b> On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E

During Hurricane Katrina, ET-122 was damaged at the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in New Orleans and while the tank was certified as completely <b>flight-worthy</b> after its repairs were completed, NASA management ruled that ET-122 posed a slightly higher risk of losing foam from the repaired areas and therefore assigned it to the STS-335 mission that would likely never fly. However, once it was decided to fly Atlantis on a full STS-135 mission, the tank assignments were swapped so that in the event STS-134 (Endeavour) were to suffer damage from ET-122, Atlantis with the newer and less risky ET-138 would be poised to rescue Endeavours crew.|$|E

Afterwards, Enterprise would conduct two Spacelab missions. However, in the period between the rollout of Enterprise and the rollout of Columbia, a number of significant design changes had taken place, particularly with regard to the weight of the fuselage and wings, which meant retrofitting the prototype would have been a much more expensive process than previously realized, requiring the dismantling of the orbiter and the return of various sections to subcontractors across the country.

50|$|As a sales {{incentive}} amid low customer demand {{during the}} Great Recession, Airbus had offered buy-back guarantees to airlines that chose to procure the A340. By 2013, the resale {{value of an}} A340 declined by 30% over ten years, and both Airbus and Rolls-Royce were incurring related charges amounting to {{hundreds of millions of}} euros. Some analysts have expected the price of a <b>flight-worthy,</b> CFM56-powered A340 to drop below $10 million by 2023. As an effort to support the A340's resale value, Airbus has proposed reconfiguring the aircraft's interior for a single class of 475 seats. As the Trent 500 engines are half the maintenance cost of the A340, Rolls-Royce proposed a cost-reducing maintenance plan similar to the company's existing program that reduced the cost of maintaining the RB211 engine powering Iberia's Boeing 757 freighters. Key to these programs is the salvaging, repair and reuse of serviceable parts from retired older engines. Airbus could offer used A340s to airlines wishing to retire older aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, claiming that the cost of purchasing and maintaining a second-hand A340 with increased seating and improved engine performance reportedly compared favourably to the procurement costs of a new Boeing 777.|$|E

Except for the 104th, based around the Aegean Sea, the other six Gruppi comprised just 61 aircraft, with only 22 serviceable. Almost all the available machines were sent to the Raggruppamento Aerosiluranti, but of the 44 aircraft, only a third were considered <b>flight-worthy</b> by 9 July 1943.

Despite the use of an improved engine, capable of a maximum speed of 475 km/h, these machines were unable to cope with the difficult task of resisting the invasion. They were too large to allow them to evade detection by enemy defences, and their large aircrew requirement resulted in heavy losses of personnel. In the first five days SM.79s performed 57 missions, at night only, and failed to achieve any results, with the loss of seven aircraft.

5000|$|AS-501 was the Saturn V's first flight. At the time, it was {{the largest}} launch vehicle to ever attempt a flight. This mission was NASA's first to use [...] "all-up" [...] testing, a {{decision}} that goes back to late 1963. George Mueller, the head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight at that time, was a systems engineer who previously worked on military missile projects, recognized all-up testing was successfully used to rapidly develop the Air Force's Minuteman ICBM program, and thought it could be used to meet Apollo's schedule. [...] Previously, the way Wernher von Braun's team at the Marshall Space Flight Center, and the old NACA Langley Research Center engineers tested new rockets was by testing each stage incrementally. The Saturn V's test program departed from the conservative incremental approach previously used by the Marshall and Langley engineers. It would be tested all at once, with all stages live and fully <b>flight-worthy,</b> including an Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM). [...] This decision dramatically streamlined the program's test flight phase, eliminating four missions, but it required everything to work properly the first time. [...] Apollo program managers had misgivings about all-up testing but agreed to it with some reluctance since incremental component tests would inevitably push the lunar landing mission past the 1970 goal.|$|E
