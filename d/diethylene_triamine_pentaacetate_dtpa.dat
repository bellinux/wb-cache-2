40|$|Vasoactive {{intestinal}} peptide causes bronchodilatation {{when given}} intravenously but is less effective in both animals and man when given by inhalation. This difference {{may be due}} to poor transit of the peptide across the bronchial epithelium. To test this hypothesis pulmonary clearance of radiolabelled vasoactive intestinal peptide was measured in Sprague Dawley rats and compared with that of pertechnetate (TcO 4 -) and <b>diethylene</b> <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (<b>DTPA).</b> Despite a molecular weight (MW) of 3450, iodinated vasoactive intestinal peptide was cleared rapidly from the lungs, with a mean half time (t 1 / 2) of 19 minutes after an initial slower phase. This compares with a t 1 / 2 of 10 minutes with TcO 4 - (MW 163) and a t 1 / 2 of 158 minutes with DTPA (MW 492). The possibility that vasoactive intestinal peptide mediates a non-specific increase in permeability was discounted {{by the fact that the}} combination of vasoactive intestinal peptide and DTPA did not alter DTPA clearance significantly. Chromatography and radioimmunoassay of blood taken after intratracheal administration of vasoactive intestinal peptide demonstrated a metabolite but no unchanged peptide. An intravenous injection of the peptide disappeared on first pass through the lung. It is concluded that inhaled vasoactive intestinal peptide lacks efficacy as a bronchodilator not because of slow diffusion to airway smooth muscle but because it is metabolised at an early stage of its passage through the respiratory epithelium...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{prepared}} macromolecular MR T 1 contrast agent: pullulan-conjugated Gd <b>diethylene</b> <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (Gd-DTPA-Pullulan) and estimated residual free Gd 3 +, chelation stability {{in competition with}} metal ions, plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics, and abdominal MR contrast on rats. Residual free Gd 3 + in GdDTPA-Pullulan was measured using colorimetric spectroscopy. The transmetalation of Gd 3 + incubated with Ca 2 + was performed by using a dialysis membrane (MWCO 100 - 500 Da) and investigated by ICP-OES. The plasma concentration profiles of Gd-DTPA-Pullulan were estimated after intravenous injection at a dose 0. 1 mmol/kg of Gd. The coronal-plane abdominal images of. normal rats were observed by MR imaging. The content of free Gd 3 +, the toxic residual form, was less than 0. 01 %. Chelation stability of Gd-DTPA-Pullulan was estimated, and only 0. 2 % and 0. 00045 % of Gd 3 + were released from Gd-DTPA-Pullulan after 2 h incubation with Ca 2 + and Fe 2 +, respectively. Gd-DTPA-Pullulan displayed the extended plasma half-life (t(1 / 2,alpha) = 0. 43 h, t(1 / 2,beta) = 2. 32 h), much longer than 0. 11 h and 0. 79 h of Gd-EOB-DTPA. Abdominal MR imaging showed Gd-DTPA-Pullulan maintained initial MR contrast for 30 min.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the {{preparation}} and characterization of [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomaterials. [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) (gadolinium(III) <b>diethylene</b> <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetate)</b> was transferred into LDH by anionic exchange. The intercalation of [Gd(dtpa) ] 2 ̆ 7 - into LDH {{was confirmed by}} X-ray diffraction for the new phase with the interlayer spacing of 3. 5 - 4. 0 nm and by FTIR for the characteristic vibration peaks of [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -). The morphology of the nanoparticles {{was influenced by the}} extent of [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) loading, in which the poly-dispersity quality decreased as the [Gd-(dtpa) ](2 -) loading was increased. Compared with the morphology of the original Mg 2 Al-Cl-LDH nanoparticles (hexagonal plate-like sheets of 50 - 200 nm), the modified LDH-Gd(dtpa) nanoparticles are bar-like with a width of 30 - 60 nm and a length of 50 - 150 nm. LDH-Gd(dtpa) was expected to have an increased water proton magnetic resonance relaxivity due to the intercalation of [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) into the LDH interlayer that led to slower molecular anisotropic tumbling compared with free [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) in solution. Indeed, LDH-nanoparticle suspension containing approximate to 1. 6 mm [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) exhibits a longitudinal proton relaxivity r(1) of approximate to 16 mm(- 1) s(- 1) and a transverse proton relaxivity r(1) of approximate to 50 mm(- 1) s(- 1) at room temperature and a magnetic field of 190 MHz, which represents an enhancement four times (r(1)) and 12 times (r(2)) that of free [Gd(dtpa) ](2 -) in solution under the same reaction conditions. We have thus tailored LDH-nanoparticles into a novel contrast agent with strong relaxivity, promising for great potential applications in magnetic resonance imaging...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Modeling of {{pharmacokinetic}} {{parameters and}} pharmacodynamic actions requires {{knowledge of the}} arterial blood concentration. In most cases, experimental measurements are only available for a peripheral vein (usually antecubital) whose concentration may differ significantly from both arterial and central vein concentration. Methods A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for the tissues drained by the antecubital vein (referred to as "arm") is developed. It is assumed that the "arm" is composed of tissues with identical properties (partition coefficient, blood flow/gm) as the whole body tissues plus a new "tissue" representing skin arteriovenous shunts. The antecubital vein concentration depends on the following parameters: the fraction of "arm" blood flow contributed by muscle, skin, adipose, connective tissue and arteriovenous shunts, and the flow per gram of the arteriovenous shunt. The value of these parameters was investigated using simultaneous experimental measurements of arterial and antecubital concentrations for eight solutes: ethanol, thiopental, 99 Tc m -diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (<b>DTPA),</b> ketamine, D 2 O, acetone, methylene chloride and toluene. A new procedure is described {{that can be used}} to determine the arterial concentration for an arbitrary solute by deconvolution of the antecubital concentration. These procedures are implemented in PKQuest, a general PBPK program that is freely distributed [URL]. Results One set of "standard arm" parameters provides an adequate description of the arterial/antecubital vein concentration for ethanol, DTPA, thiopental and ketamine. A significantly different set of "arm" parameters was required to describe the data for D 2 O, acetone, methylene chloride and toluene – probably because the "arm" is in a different physiological state. Conclusions Using the set of "standard arm" parameters, the antecubital vein concentration can be used to determine the whole body PBPK model parameters for an arbitrary solute without any additional adjustable parameters. Also, the antecubital vein concentration can be used to estimate the arterial concentration for an arbitrary input for solutes for which no arterial concentration data is available. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The patient {{population}} receiving long-term {{oxygen therapy}} has increased {{with the rising}} morbidity of COPD. Although high-dose oxygen induces pulmonary edema and interstitial fibrosis, potential lung injury caused by long-term exposure to low-dose oxygen has not been fully analyzed. This {{study was designed to}} clarify the effects of long-term low-dose oxygen inhalation on pulmonary epithelial function, edema formation, collagen metabolism, and alveolar fibrosis. Methods Guinea pigs (n = 159) were exposed to either 21 % or 40 % oxygen for a maximum of 16 weeks, and to 90 % oxygen for a maximum of 120 hours. Clearance of inhaled technetium-labeled <b>diethylene</b> <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (Tc-DTPA) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-to-serum ratio (BAL/Serum) of albumin (ALB) were used as markers of epithelial permeability. Lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (W/D) was measured to evaluate pulmonary edema, and types I and III collagenolytic activities and hydroxyproline content in the lung were analyzed as indices of collagen metabolism. Pulmonary fibrotic state was evaluated by histological quantification of fibrous tissue area stained with aniline blue. Results The clearance of Tc-DTPA was higher with 2 week exposure to 40 % oxygen, while BAL/Serum Alb and W/D did not differ between the 40 % and 21 % groups. In the 40 % oxygen group, type I collagenolytic activities at 2 and 4 weeks and type III collagenolytic activity at 2 weeks were increased. Hydroxyproline and fibrous tissue area were also increased at 2 weeks. No discernible injury was histologically observed in the 40 % group, while progressive alveolar damage was observed in the 90 % group. Conclusion These results indicate that epithelial function is damaged, collagen metabolism is affected, and both breakdown of collagen fibrils and fibrogenesis are transiently induced even with low-dose 40 % oxygen exposure. However, these changes are successfully compensated even with continuous exposure to low-dose oxygen. We conclude that long-term low-dose oxygen exposure does not significantly induce permanent lung injury in guinea pigs. </p...|$|R
