5000|$|... {{tenancy at sufferance}} - {{created when}} tenant remains after lease expires and becomes a <b>holdover</b> <b>tenant,</b> {{converts}} to holdover tenancy upon landlord acceptance.|$|E
50|$|The {{landlord}} {{may also}} impose {{a new lease}} on the <b>holdover</b> <b>tenant.</b> For a residential tenancy, this new tenancy is month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise it is the same period as the period before the original lease expired. In either case, the landlord can raise the rent, so long as the landlord has told the tenant of the higher rent before the expiration of the original lease.|$|E
50|$|The {{landlord}} {{may also}} be able to impose a new lease on the <b>holdover</b> <b>tenant.</b> For a residential tenancy, such new tenancy lasts month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise, the tenancy lasts for the same length of time as the duration under the original lease. In either case, the landlord can charge a higher rent, if the landlord, before the expiration of the original lease, has notified the tenant of the increase.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{papers at}} a {{conveyancing}} include: deed(s), certified checks, promissory note, mortgage, certificate of liens, pro rata property taxes, title insurance binder, and fire insurance binder. There {{may also be}} side agreements (e.g., <b>holdover</b> <b>tenants,</b> delivery contracts, payment holdback for unacceptable repairs), seller's {{right of first refusal}} for resale, declaration of trust, or other entity formation or consolidation (incorporation, limited partnership investors, etc.). Where [...] "time is of the essence," [...] there have been cases where the entire deposit is forfeited (as liquidated damages) if the conveyancing is delayed beyond the time limits of the buyer's contingencies, even if the purchase is completed.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{families}} of Archie Bunker and Alf Garnett, however, the Beltr√°ns in the first episode are moving up from their working-class digs to a nice, middle-class duplex in Burbank, which they've bought thanks to some lottery winnings. Upon moving in, they discover that their next-door neighbors (and <b>holdover</b> <b>tenants)</b> are a homosexual couple: a Spanish physician, Fernandito Salazar (Gabriel Romero), and his American boyfriend, Kevin Lynch (James C. Leary). This sets up a number of plot lines {{through the course of}} the series, much as did the Jeffersons moving in next door to the Bunkers {{in the early days of}} All in the Family.|$|R
50|$|In England and {{according}} to the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in India, the landlord has a duty to deliver possession to the tenant {{at the beginning of a}} lease. The justification for placing this burden on the landlord is the idea that the landlord has more resources than the new tenants to pursue legal remedies against wrongful <b>holdovers</b> (former <b>tenants</b> that will not give up possession of the lease).|$|R
5000|$|A {{fixed term}} tenancy {{comes to an}} end {{automatically}} when the fixed term runs out or, {{in the case of a}} tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. If a <b>holdover</b> <b>tenant</b> remains on the property after the termination of the lease, s/he may become a tenant at sufferance because the lessor/landlord has suffered (or allowed) the tenant to remain as a tenant instead of evicting him or her. Such a tenancy is generally [...] "at will," [...] meaning the tenant or the landlord may terminate it at any time, upon the providing of proper statutory notice.|$|E
