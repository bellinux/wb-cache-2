2500|$|Urechia, Laurian, Ghica and Petru Grădişteanu {{decided to}} issue a common reply to Maiorescu's accusations, using Rosetti's {{newspaper}} Românul as their venue. One of Urechia's texts in the series accused Maiorescu of [...] "mocking for the urge of mocking", and called Beţia de cuvinte [...] "an unqualifiable diatribe". He defended his group as the true representatives of a cultural line leading back to the Wallachian uprising of 1821, and rhetorically asked Maiorescu: [...] "could it be true that in these 50 years all that was planted in the national soil are <b>feather</b> <b>grass</b> and creeping thistle?" [...] Tudor Vianu, who believes Urechia had [...] "too much knowledge of things", cautions that [...] " [...] pen would slide too fast over paper". He defines Urechia's reply as [...] "gauche and prolix". While he criticizes Urechia's views on history, literary historian Z. Ornea believes that he was justified in opposing Junimist [...] "exclusivism", especially when rejecting Maiorescu's theory that the state needed to redesign its educational system by closing down universities and building more primary schools.|$|E

Grasslands, shrubby areas, valleys and rocky {{outcrops}} are among the habitat types found in the locality, and the balance of the plant species depends much on whether it is a wet year or a dry one. In a wet season Allium species tend to predominate, along with fringed sagewort (Artemisia frigida) and other sagebrush species (Artemisia). In dry years the dominant vegetation is <b>grasses</b> including <b>feather</b> <b>grasses</b> (Stipa spp.) and wheatgrasses, and shrubs such as Caragana and the Gobi apricot.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A highly selfing {{breeding}} system affects gene flow, {{which may}} have consequences for patterns of genetic variation and differentiation on both the population and species level. <b>Feather</b> <b>grasses</b> (Stipa spp.) are dominant elements of Eurasian steppes that persist in Central Europe in scattered isolated populations that are of great conser-vation interest. Cleistogamy is common in the Stipa pen-nata group, the phylogeny of which is largely unresolved. Intraspecific patterns of genetic variation can be charac-terised by lack of gene flow due to selfing, but also by large-scale historical migrations and long-term isolation. We analysed both 5 species within the S. pennata group and 33 populations of Stipa pulcherrima sampled across {{a large part of}} its range. Using AFLP markers we assessed phylogenetic relationships of the S. pennata group an...|$|R
