40|$|AbstractAt present, in {{our country}} the main deep <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> are rotary disk <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> spindle-type <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> and full {{hydraulic}} motor head drive <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> and most of foreign <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> equipment are full hydraulic motor head drive <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs.</b> These rigs have many disadvantages; they cannot meet the demand of deep drilling. As the major breakthroughs {{were made in the}} development of high power permanent magnet frequency conversion motor, it is possible to develop the permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> so the efficiency of drilling can be improved. In this paper, the difficulties of deep drilling and existing problems of deep <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> are analyzed, and direct drive permanent magnet motor top-driving <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> and its parameters and characteristics are introduced. The development of deep borehole permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> accords with the requirements of drilling technology development and innovation concept, it is the development direction of deep core drill's renewal, will promote the development of geo-drilling technology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{oil wells}} {{drilling}} activities are performed {{with a large}} variety of equipment. The analysis of working cycles at oil <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> indicates that the time consumed with assembling/disassembling and transportation of the equipment represents a significantly long resource time {{in comparison with the}} time allowed for drilling activities. This issue leads to the necessity of better planning and controlling assembling activities in order to increase the effectiveness of using the drilling equipment.
