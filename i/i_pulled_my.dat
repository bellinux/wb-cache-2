[...] I {{thought it was a}} forward pass and I was looking at the ball being thrown and I was {{signaling}} for a grounding penalty. Then, when I realized the ball was in play, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> hands back… The guys played a great game. The focus shouldn't be on this.” [...] During the game, Mack Brown was furious with the penalty call and insisted that Jessee did not touch the ball. [...] After the game Brown said that Jessee stepping onto the field [...] " [...] how bad our family wanted to win the game".|$|E
2500|$|While {{performing}} {{her song}} [...] "Human Nature" [...] in her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again. The Sun notes, [...] "Her actions {{may have been}} offensive to some members of her audience, as Turkey is a traditionally Islamic country, with a largely Muslim population" [...] before noting that [...] "Perhaps fans shouldn't have been surprised - as she did warn them, writing No Fear on her back. [...] Amy Odell from BuzzFeed said that criticizing the gesture based on her age sends [...] "a very archaic message", adding that [...] "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!". Three days later, The Sun published an article entitled, [...] "Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53." [...] Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna [...] "as a positive role model for older women." [...] While some initially claimed Madonna as [...] "clingy" [...] and [...] "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, [...] "I felt nervous when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> bra down but that’s only natural— Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, {{it was an incredible}} feeling." [...] She goes on to say about Madonna, [...] "She looks incredible now— better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" [...] before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, [...] "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." [...] Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna [...] "will not change" [...] despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, [...] "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that [...] "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> {{hands away}} {{and burst into}} hysterical, undignified tears.|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>my</b> copy of Metrophage 1 {{out of its}} {{battered}} pink paper folder.

60|$|Wondering {{what was}} up <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> on <b>my</b> {{clothing}} and made my way aft. The captain was in the cabin alone.|$|R
60|$|Dismounting and {{advancing}} {{to act as}} spokesman, while my companions sat motionless and silent in their saddles, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> off <b>my</b> cap.|$|R

60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> horse {{round and}} rode ahead. As I went, my ears being very quick, I heard {{the other two}} talking together.

60|$|To relieve {{my friend}} from his embarrassment, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> out <b>my</b> watch and urged {{that we should}} walk in the {{direction}} of the Admiralty, as the hour for my interview had nearly arrived.|$|R
60|$|We {{took our}} way {{carefully}} and cautiously across the great Glacier des Bossons, over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags and buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic proportions. The desert of ice that stretched {{far and wide}} about us was wild and desolate beyond description, and the perils which beset us were so great that at times I was minded to turn back. But <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> pluck together and pushed on.|$|E
6000|$|This {{conviction}} was banished on {{the second}} afternoon of my stay at the mill. I was sitting under a tree in the orchard near the house, thinking and smoking my pipe, when along the road which ran {{by the side of}} the lake came Mr. Vincent on my black horse General and his daughter on my mare Sappho. Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> straw hat over my eyes, but this precaution was not necessary. They were looking at the beautiful lake, with its hills and overhanging trees, and saw me not! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw you {{laughing}} {{and talking to}} {{her in front of}} her father's house. I heard you with her in their garden the evening before you left and she disappeared, and it was my voice you heard in the lane. Had I known that you were going that night, I would have followed you and killed you, and saved her. The next morning you were both gone. I waited a time and then went to the depot of your regiment and enlisted. I had failed to save her, but at least I could avenge her. That bullet was mine, and had you not stumbled over a Pandy's body, I suppose, just as <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> trigger, you would have been a dead man.|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Many will forsake {{the truth}} {{before the world}} is pulled down. [Stretching out {{his arms over his}} head.] <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> down <b>my</b> own house, now I go out to pull down the world.|$|R
60|$|And here <b>I</b> again <b>pulled</b> out <b>my</b> pocket-book, {{and emptied}} the {{contents}} on the table.|$|R

6000|$|Well it was I {{had ample}} time to get on my guard! In {{wheeling}} my horse I booted him so hard that he reared. As I had been warm I had my sombrero over the pommel of the saddle. And when the head of my horse blocked any possible sight of movement of my hand, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> gun and held it concealed under my sombrero. This rustler had bothered me in my calculations. And here he came galloping, alone. Exultation would have been involuntary then but for the sudden shock, and then the cold settling of temper, the breathless suspense. Snecker pulled his huge bay and pounded to halt abreast of me. Luck favored me. Had I ever had anything but luck in these dangerous deals? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say! I {{rounded the}} end of that log and put down the hill at a two-twenty clip, old bald-face reachin' for me at every jump. At the bottom was a broad, open flat, quarter of a mile to timber and full of niggerheads. I knew if ever I slipped I was a goner, but I hit only the high places till you couldn't a-seen my trail for smoke. And the old devil snortin' along hot after me. Midway across, he reached for me, jest strikin' the heel of my {{moccasin}} with his claw. Tell you I was doin' some tall thinkin' jest then.

6000|$|... 'The yellow land lay on our left, {{the grey}} sea on our right. Knight though I was, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> oar amongst the rowers. I caught seaweed and dried it, {{and stuffed it}} between the pots of beads lest they should break. Knighthood is for the land. At sea, look you, a man is but a spurless rider on a bridleless horse. I learned to make strong knots in ropes--yes, and to join two ropes end to end, so that even Witta could {{scarcely}} see {{where they had been}} married. But Hugh had tenfold more sea-cunning than I. Witta gave him charge of the rowers of the left side. Thorkild of Borkum, a man with a broken nose, that wore a Norman steel cap, had the rowers of the right, and each side rowed and sang against the other. They saw that no man was idle. Truly, as Hugh said, and Witta would laugh at him, a ship is all more care than a Manor.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{the last}} spark of light disappeared, {{and through the}} Egyptian {{darkness}} I could see the faint line of white around the window blinds. I felt that {{the time had come}} to speak; so <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> off <b>my</b> respirator and called out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'About a month after, as I {{was coming}} from Blair {146b} alone, {{about the same time}} of the night, a big dog {{appeared}} to me, of a dark greyish colour, between the Hilltown and Knockhead {146c} of Mause, on a lea rig a little below the road, and in passing by it touched me sonsily (firmly) on the thigh at my haunch-bane (hip-bone), upon which <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> staff from under my arm and let a stroke at it; and I had a notion at the time that I hit it, and my haunch was painful all that night. However, I had no great thought of its being anything particular or extraordinary, but that it might be a mad dog wandering. About a year after that, {{to the best of my}} memory, in December month, about the same time of the night and in the same place, when I was alone, it appeared to me again as before, and passed by me at some distance; and then I began to think it might be something more than ordinary.|$|E
6000|$|From Bleymard after dinner, {{although}} it was already late, I set out to scale {{a portion of the}} Lozère. An ill-marked stony drove-road guided me forward; and I met nearly half a dozen bullock-carts descending from the woods, each laden with a whole pine-tree for the winter's firing. At the top of the woods, which do not climb very high upon this cold ridge, I struck leftward by a path among the pines, until I hit on a dell of green turf, where a streamlet made a little spout over some stones to serve me for a water-tap. [...] "In a more sacred or sequestered bower ... nor nymph nor faunus haunted." [...] The trees were not old, but they grew thickly round the glade: there was no outlook, except north-eastward upon distant hill-tops, or straight upward to the sky; and the encampment felt secure and private like a room. By the time I had made my arrangements and fed Modestine, the day was already beginning to decline. I buckled myself to the knees into my sack and made a hearty meal; {{and as soon as the}} sun went down <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> cap over my eyes and fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|By and by I came to dread those things; {{and this}} dread grew and grew and grew; grew until I got to anticipating {{them with a}} cold horror. For I was an {{indolent}} man, and not fond of letter-writing, and whenever these things came I had to put everything by and sit down--for my own peace of mind--and dig and dig until I got something {{out of my head}} which would answer for a reply. I got along fairly well the first year; but for the succeeding four years the Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle was my curse, my nightmare, the grief and misery of my life. And I got so, so sick of sitting for photographs. I sat every year for five years, trying to satisfy that insatiable organization. Then at last I rose in revolt. I could endure my oppressions no longer. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> fortitude together and tore off my chains, and was a free man again, and happy. From that day I burned the secretary's fat envelopes the moment they arrived, and by and by they ceased to come.|$|E

6000|$|As {{a fitting}} climax, {{in the middle}} of the level men call the Ladies' Mile the Horror was {{awaiting}} me. No other 'rickshaw was in sight--only the four black and white jhampanies, the yellow-paneled carriage, and the golden head of the woman within--all apparently just as I had left them eight months and one fortnight ago! For an instant I fancied that Kitty must see what I saw--we were so marvelously sympathetic in all things. Her next words undeceived me-- [...] "Not a soul in sight! Come along, Jack, and I'll race you to the Reservoir buildings!" [...] Her wiry little Arab was off like a bird, my Waler following close behind, and in this order we dashed under the cliffs. Half a minute brought us within fifty yards of the 'rickshaw. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> Waler and fell back a little. The 'rickshaw was directly {{in the middle of}} the road; and once more the Arab passed through it, my horse following. [...] "Jack! Jack dear!

60|$|I {{have been}} wounded myself {{so often that}} I {{have to stop and}} think before I can tell you the exact number of times. I have been hit by musket balls, by pistol bullets, and by {{bursting}} shells, besides being pierced by bayonet, lance, sabre, and finally by a brad-awl, which was the most painful of any. Yet out of all these injuries I have never known the same deadly sickness as came over me when I felt the poor, silent, patient creature, which I had come to love {{more than anything in the}} world except my mother and the Emperor, reel and stagger beneath me. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> second pistol from my holster and fired point-blank between the fellow's broad shoulders. He slashed his horse across the flank with his whip, and for a moment I thought that I had missed him. But then on the green of his chasseur jacket I saw an ever-widening black smudge, and he began to sway in his saddle, very slightly at first, but more and more with every bound, until at last over he went, with his foot caught in the stirrup, and his shoulders thud-thud-thudding along the road, until the drag was too much for the tired horse, and I closed my hand upon the foam-spattered bridle-chain. As I pulled him up it eased the stirrup leather, and the spurred heel clinked loudly as it fell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't good at tellin' things," [...] began Lewis. [...] "I reckon I've {{seen some}} strange sights. I kin {{tell you about}} the only redskin I ever let off. Three years ago I was takin' a fall hunt over on the Big Sandy, and I run into a party of Shawnees. I plugged a chief and started to run. There was some good runners and I couldn't shake 'em in the open country. Comin' to the Ohio I jumped in and swum across, keepin' my rifle and powder dry by holdin' 'em up. I hid in some bulrushes and waited. Pretty soon along comes three Injuns, and when they saw where I had taken to the water they stopped and held a short pow-wow. Then they all took to the water. This was what I was waitin' for. When they got nearly acrosst I shot the first redskin, and loadin' quick got a bullet into the others. The last Injun did not sink. I watched him go floatin' down stream expectin' every minute to see him go under as he was hurt so bad he could hardly keep his head above water. He floated down a long ways and the current carried him to a pile of {{driftwood}} which had lodged against a little island. I saw the Injun crawl up on the drift. I went down stream and by keepin' the island between me and him I got out to where he was. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> tomahawk and went around the head of the island and found the redskin leanin' against a big log. He was a young brave and a fine lookin strong feller. He was tryin' to stop the blood from my bullet-hole in his side. When he saw me he tried to get up, but he was too weak. He smiled, pointed to the wound and said: 'Deathwind not heap times bad shot.' Then he bowed his head and waited for the tomahawk. Well, I picked him up and carried him ashore and made a shack by a spring. I staid there with him. When he got well enough to stand a few days' travel I got him across the river and givin' him a hunk of deer meat I told him to go, and if I ever saw him again I'd make a better shot.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> up <b>my</b> pony {{and stared}} at her, feeling very shy and {{not knowing what to}} say. For a while she stared back at me, being afflicted, presumably, with the same complaint, then spoke with an effort, in a voice that was very soft and pleasant.|$|R
