A smooth surface and excellent gap-filling into the patterns covered with thermal SiO 2 were observed on the O 3 -TEOS film formation by ethanol treatment.

Our analysis of the chondrochloren gene cluster by targeted gene inactivation coupled with assays in vitro has shed significant light on the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Chlorination of tyrosine occurs early in the pathway, likely on a peptidyl carrier protein-bound intermediate, whereas decarboxylation to the styryl moiety appears to be accomplished by an unprecedented oxidative decarboxylase. We also show that the chondrochloren B <b>ethoxy</b> <b>group</b> arises from initial incorporation by the polyketide synthase of hydroxy malonate as an extender unit, methylation in cis by an O-methyltransferase, followed by a second methylation.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and reactions}} of ethanol on Ru(0001) were studied with temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). Ethanol {{was found to}} adsorb intact onto Ru(0001) below 100 K. Heating to 250 K resulted in formation of <b>ethoxy</b> <b>groups,</b> which undergo further decarbonylation to CO, hydrogen, and surface carbon. No evidence {{for the formation of}} significant amounts of other molecules, such as methane, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes or higher alcohols was found. This suggests that the decarbonylation takes place via beta-hydrogen abstraction, involving an oxametallacycle intermediate, similar to the previously identified decarbonylation mechanism of ethanol on Rh(111) and Co. The deposited surface carbon acts as a poison for subsequent cycles of ethanol decarbonylation, as evidenced by a decreasing CO yield in TPD and RAIRS after an increasing number of adsorption-desorption cycles. Quantification of the TPD results suggests that the reaction of a full monolayer (ML) of adsorbed ethanol results in a CO yield of about 0. 1 ML in the first reaction cycle. This limited CO yield can be attributed to desorption of molecular ethanol at temperatures below 250 K.

EAN and PAN have a sponge-like nanostructure {{that consists of}} interpenetrating charged and apolar domains. This study reveals that the ILs solvate the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the amphiphiles differently. The <b>ethoxy</b> <b>groups</b> are dissolved in the polar region of both ILs by means of hydrogen bonds. The environment is remarkably water-like and, as in water, the solubility of the <b>ethoxy</b> <b>groups</b> in EAN decreases on warming, which underscores the critical role of the IL hydrogen-bond network for solubility. In contrast, amphiphile alkyl chains are not preferentially solvated by the charged or uncharged regions of the ILs. Rather, they experience an average IL composition and, as a result, partitioning from dodecane into the IL increases as the cation alkyl chain is lengthened from ethyl to propyl, because the IL apolar volume fraction increases. Together, these results show that surfactant dissolution in ILs is related to structural compatibility between the head or tail group and the IL nanostructure.
