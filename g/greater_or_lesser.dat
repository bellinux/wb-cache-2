Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall.

5|$|What may be {{revealed}} by Hori's {{attack on the}} way in which some Ramesside scribes felt obliged to demonstrate their <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> acquaintance with ancient literature is the conception that these venerable works were meant to be known in full and not to be misused as quarries for popular sayings mined deliberately from the past. The classics of the time were to be memorized completely and comprehended thoroughly before being cited.|$|E

In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy's parents suggested Kirsten Dunst or Emily Watson as possible actresses who could play their daughter.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to outline the necessity for a subject philosophical basis for Industrial Psychology. The paper offers a number of examples of issues which might effect a shift of interest from everyday practice of science to the essential nature of Industrial Psychology as a subject discipline - that is, ultimately, a subject philosophical grounding of Industrial Psychology. The issues that are raised therefore do touch, to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> a <b>lesser</b> extent, on the presuppositions on which the subject Industrial Psychology rests...|$|R
5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> reliability but at least true in substance, suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E

Trump’s or Farage’s triumph does not necessarily reflect the rise of populism or demagogy – the spectre of this has always lurked within societies to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> a <b>lesser</b> extent.

40|$|Much {{academic}} {{theory about}} legal reasoning greatly exaggerates {{the extent to}} which reason can settle what is <b>greater</b> good <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> evil, and minimizes the need for authoritative sources which, so far as they are clear and respect the few absolute moral rights and duties, are to be respected as the only rational basis for judicial reasoning and decision, in relation to the countless issues which do not directly involve those absolute rights and duties. A natural law theory in the classical tradition makes no pretense that natural reason can determine the one right answer to those countless questions which arise for the judge who finds the sources unclear...|$|R
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than}} the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E

He is not restricted to one path of magic (<b>Greater</b> Path <b>or</b> <b>Lesser</b> Path) but is a follower of all paths. He acted as a mentor to Pug. Details of his life are revealed throughout the series and he recites an autobiography to Pug and Tomas in A Darkness at Sethanon. He claimed to have been born on a distant planet and to have lived for time immemorial.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{carried out}} in 21 {{patients}} have shown {{for the first time}} that alternation of the pulse pres-sure in man can occur independently in either the <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> the <b>lesser</b> circulation without appear-ing in the other. Even when bilateral alternation exists, this cyclic variation may disappear in one circulation while persisting in the other. Mechanisms responsible for pulsus alternans, in particular variations in stroke volume and vascular pressures, are considered, and no single explanation satisfies the facts revealed in this study. SINCE Traube's original description in 1872, the term pulsus alternans has been used to describe a special type of cyclic variation in systemic pulse pressure. Consider-able clinical importance has since been attached to this circulatory sign, particularly since it is readily elicited with a simple sphygmomanom-eter. Although much laboratory investigation has been devoted to this subject,'- 5 clinical exploration has been limited to studies of the systemic arteries in man until the advent of cardiac catheterization, when the exploration of both greater and lesser circulations could be made. 6 - 8 Prior to the present study, it had been more or less assumed that alternation in arterial pulse pressure was accompanied by alternation of both ventricular chambers simultaneously and synchronously. It is the purpose of this presen-tation to show, first, that alternation of the pulse pressure in man can occur independently in either the <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> the <b>lesser</b> circulation and, secondly, to demonstrate that the effect...|$|R
25|$|In several cases, the Chinese {{used the}} terms li 裡 (internal) and wai 外 (external) to {{indicate}} the <b>greater</b> (nei) <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> (wai) degree of proximity of a location. There was even an intermediate degree {{with the use of}} zhong 中 (middle) for places located between these two extremes. There remains several place names in Shanghai that are linked to this practice. The Chinese name of the Garden Bridge – waibaidu qiao 外白渡橋 – is such a case. The name makes sense only in relation with another bridge called libaidu qiao 裡白渡橋 that was located further inside the Soochow Creek, whereas the Garden Bridge was located {{at the mouth of the}} creek where it merges into the Huangpu river.|$|R
