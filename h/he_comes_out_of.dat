5|$|Months later, a {{man known}} as Yukishiro Enishi starts attacking {{all the people}} Kenshin meets {{as an act of}} revenge for the death of his sister Yukishiro Tomoe. At this point, it is {{revealed}} that Kenshin was married to Tomoe in the Bakumatsu, but accidentally killed her while trying to rescue her from a group of assassins. When Enishi learns of Kenshin's feelings towards Kaoru, he sets out to kidnap her. He succeeds and leaves behind a professionally made decoy of Kaoru with a sword in her heart, making everyone believe that she has been murdered. Kenshin falls into a severe depression and runs off to a village of wanderers to mourn. However, <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his depression after his friends discover Kaoru is alive. The group goes to rescue her on Enishi's island. A battle between Kenshin and Enishi follows. When Kenshin wins, he and Kaoru return home. Afterwards, Kenshin learns that since the Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū is only suitable for a wide-framed muscular build like that of Seijūrō's, his body will eventually begin to deteriorate and he will soon be unable to use it again. Five years later, Kenshin is married to Kaoru and has a son named Kenji. After an encounter with Kaoru's student Myōjin Yahiko, Kenshin gives his sakabatō to him as a gift for his coming-of-age.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward {{are told}} by the young surfers in the island {{that the only way}} to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there; {{unfortunately}} they do not know how to.

500|$|In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the water}} {{he sees the}} Holy Spirit {{descending}} to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son (...) [...] This {{is one of two}} events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus [...] "Son", the other being the Transfiguration. The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan (...) [...] Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest (...) [...] Jesus' baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, [...] "I need to be baptized by you" [...] (...) [...] Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism [...] "to fulfill all righteousness" [...] (...) [...] Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (...) [...] In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying (...) [...] John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him [...] ). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E
