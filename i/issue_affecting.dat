25|$|The Mullum Mullum Creek {{suffers from}} many of the {{problems}} inherent in the development of urban environments and pollution in and around the creek is unfortunately quite prominent. Two of the most significant problems affecting the creek is sewage spills after heavy rain and leakage of septic tank effluent from residential properties into watercourses and subsequently, the creek itself. This is a problem that extends to the Yarra River and has become a major <b>issue</b> <b>affecting</b> the ecology of central Victoria and state politics.|$|E
25|$|Because Lloyd's was a {{tax shelter}} {{as well as}} an {{insurance}} market, the second <b>issue</b> <b>affecting</b> Lloyd's was an increase in its external membership: {{by the end of the}} 1970s, the number of passive investors dwarfed the number of underwriters working in the market. Third, during the decade a number of scandals had come to light, including the collapse of the Sass syndicate, which had highlighted both the lack of regulation and the lack of legal powers of the Committee of Lloyd's (as it was then) to manage the Society.|$|E
25|$|Conventionally, {{caesarean}} sections {{are classified}} as being either an elective surgery or an emergency operation. Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important {{and is based on}} many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman. Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important <b>issue</b> <b>affecting</b> this decision.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Chile {{is a serious}} <b>issue</b> <b>affecting</b> {{a large percentage of}} the population, especially among lower income demographics. The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address {{violence in}} the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005. A 2004 SERNAM study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse. According to another study from 2004, 90 percent of low-income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence. Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal. The legalization of divorce in 2004 won the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned about domestic violence, as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws.|$|E

500|$|A broad <b>issue</b> <b>affecting</b> the {{neutrality}} {{of science}} concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, {{what part of}} the world and man is studied by science. Philip Kitcher in his [...] "Science, Truth, and Democracy" [...] argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.|$|E

After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands, in a settlement proposed by the committee. A major <b>issue</b> <b>affecting</b> Massachusetts Republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing, which favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party. When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.|$|E
