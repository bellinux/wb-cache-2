5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{men with}} the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though both}} Junker Ove and Hilda suspect {{that they are}} in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E
25|$|Blair's {{academic}} performance reports {{suggest that he}} neglected his academic studies, but during his time at Eton he worked with Roger Mynors to produce a College magazine, The Election Times, joined {{in the production of}} other publications – College Days and Bubble and Squeak – and participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents could not afford to send him to a university without another scholarship, and they concluded from his poor results {{that he would not be}} able to win one. Runciman noted that he had a romantic <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> East, and the family decided that Blair should join the Imperial Police, the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination. His father had retired to Southwold, Suffolk, by this time; Blair was enrolled at a crammer there called Craighurst, and brushed up on his Classics, English, and History. He passed the entrance exam, coming seventh out of the 26 candidates who exceeded the pass mark.|$|E

500|$|The {{case was}} the first {{instance}} of a court defining the concept now known as [...] "initial interest confusion".

500|$|Graham {{originally}} {{suggested a}} story about a man who had the ability to drain Earth of its beauty, but Davies preferred his own <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> eerie nature of paintings or illustration. The Isolus was inspired by the villains in the 1978 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Early drafts of this episode were titled [...] "Chloe Webber Destroys the Earth", and later, [...] "You're a Bad Girl, Chloe Webber", with one such draft having the episode take place on another planet. Both of these titles were rejected by Davies as they were too long.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the episode was pitched by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who {{thought it would be}} {{interesting}} to see an episode in which Bart would run into a retired Western film star in the neighborhood and [...] "think he was the coolest guy in the world", although the actor had seen better days. Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode. Swartzwelder also pitched the plot <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The title track, [...] "Hasta la Raíz", {{was written}} by Lafourcade and Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel García, {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} collaborated on her album Mujer Divina and on García's album Todas Mías (2012). García had an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song; they then wrote the music together. Laforcade referred to this collaboration as [...] "magical", saying the song was an anthem to human strength, and about not forgetting one's roots. García played a huapango riff, and Lafourcade started singing along while producer Cachorro López recorded everything, and the final result is from that session.|$|E

The film was directed by Shinde, her second directorial after the comedy-drama film English Vinglish (2012). When Shinde was asked {{in an interview with}} The Indian Express, whether there is a personal story to Dear Zindagi, she replied, [...] "Dear Zindagi is inspired by life in general. It started with an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> connections we make in our lives and how such connections can impact us. That’s something that interested me and I tried to develop a story around the philosophy." [...] In August 2015, Shinde revealed that she had [...] "almost" [...] completed working on the screenplay.|$|E
500|$|The General Prosecutor {{followed}} up travel bans and frozen bank accounts on former ministers {{and government officials}} including former Minister of Trade and Industry Rachid Mohamed Rachid. He told Al Arabiya that [...] "I returned from Davos to Egypt because of the current situation in Egypt. The new Prime Minister had contacted me for the same position in the new cabinet, I refused because I want fresh blood." [...] Regarding the travel ban, he commented, [...] "I had no <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> accusations, I served for six and half years and I am completely ready to face any accusation. No one had informed me of this decision and I heard it from the news." [...] He was considered a possible candidate for Prime Minister before the protests.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Duerr {{once again}} criticises the {{approach}} of Western society and its anthropologists to studying [...] "archaic" [...] spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact {{that we can not}} be only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are not, and that we can only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E

500|$|Knauf did {{not release}} a {{detailed}} run-down of intended future plots to fans, explaining that his stories are a collaboration of writers, directors and actors alike. He and the producers did, however, answer {{a few basic}} details about the immediate fate of major characters who were left in near-fatal situations in the final episode of Season 2. Knauf additionally provided in-depth information regarding the underlying fictional laws of nature that the writers {{had not been able}} to fully explore in the first two seasons. June 2007 however marked the first time that a comprehensive work of detailed character backgrounds was made public. Following a fundraising auction, Knauf offered fans a so-called [...] "Pitch Document," [...] a summary of Carnivàle first season.

[...] The production of the album posed as a challenge to the record company, [...] "how to market a group whose gore-soaked, extreme music is anathema to radio programmers." [...] It is the company's first attempt to [...] "hit the thrash band's core-audience of rabid enthusiasts with a fan-orientated marketing assault." [...] Araya related: [...] "We decided to take more time to bring this one together. We actually went into the studio with more written material than the past. We completed three out of seven songs outside the studio. We all sort of felt it was important to do it slowly. After the last tour, we had the intention to take the break." ...|$|E
500|$|In early June before {{starting}} recording, Orbit met Madonna {{at her house}} in New York, and she played him the music she had worked on with other producers up to May 1997, which he felt sounded [...] "slick". They visited the Hit Factory later that week, where Madonna invited the producer to work on Ray of Light. Orbit then sent her a tape of musical snippets he was working on, which were usually eight or sixteen-bar phrases and stripped down versions of tracks that would later be heard on the album. Madonna listened to the samples, over and over again, until she was inspired to write lyrics. Once she had an <b>idea</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lyrical direction of the song, she would take her ideas back to Orbit, and they would expand on the original music ideas. As most of the tracks pre-existed, Madonna worked on the lyrics while at home or while travelling.|$|E
