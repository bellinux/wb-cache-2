5|$|After brief stints in Washington DC and Fort Benning as {{a liaison}} officer, Waddy was posted to the British Embassy in Saigon as a defence advisor in 1970. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able {{to witness the}} Vietnam War first hand before {{returning}} to Britain in 1972 and joining the Joint Warfare Establishment at Old Sarum near Salisbury in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|In AD 515 Eutharic {{answered}} a summons by Theoderic the Great {{and moved to}} the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna in Italy. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given in marriage Amalasuintha, the daughter of the king. It was Theoderic's intention that this union would create a long-lasting dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths. Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, {{which ended}} the war, he {{returned}} to Lithuania. Upon his return, he wed Teresa Woynianka-Jasieniecka, but their marriage ended abruptly with her death not long afterward. The union, however, raised his social status. In 1700, he participated in the Lithuanian Civil War as {{a supporter of the}} Sapieha family, fighting in the Battle of Olkieniki. <b>Here,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> captured, but managed to escape, and he later served as Sapieha's emissary to Charles XII, king of Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Bleak {{entered the}} Army on 1 November 1950, and {{attended}} basic combat training at Fort Riley, Kansas. <b>Here,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> selected for medical duty. After {{the completion of}} his training, Bleak was assigned to a medical company attached to the 223rd Infantry Regiment, 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. Shortly after Bleak {{was assigned to the}} unit, it was selected for deployment to the Korean War. He was moved to Camp Cooke in Lompoc, California for advanced medical training in preparation for his deployment.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{recovery}} {{from the effects of}} his gassing, and aided by the temporary presence of his wife Minnie, Hart returned to England and was placed in command of the New Zealand reserves at Sling Camp in Bulford. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the training of reinforcements and casualties who were regaining fitness. On 3 June, his leadership of the 4th Brigade was honoured with an appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, although he took little personal satisfaction in the recognition.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{then moved}} to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old {{apprentice}} builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the London Mechanics Institute. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen and of Thomas Paine. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.|$|E

5|$|At Remagen the 47th Regiment {{was given}} the mission of {{guarding}} the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River. Twenty five years later the 47th would once again guard this bridge during World War II. The regiment remained here until given orders to return home in mid-summer 1919. Before his departure from Europe, Middleton was summoned {{to report to the}} Third Army Chief of Staff in Koblenz. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there. Middleton sailed out of Brest in mid-July, met his wife in New York, and together they traveled to Columbus, Georgia by way of Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Edwards's fortifications {{were tested}} in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule, the first major insurrection since the conquest. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the {{introduction}} of taxation, and Madog had considerable popular support. By {{the end of the}} year, Edward had returned to Wales with a large army and marched west from Chester, reaching his castle at Conwy by Christmas. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trapped and besieged until January 1295, supplied only by sea, before forces arrived to relieve him in February. Harlech was also besieged but was saved from defeat by the arrival of supplies by sea from Ireland. Caernarfon, however, was still only partially completed and was stormed by Welsh forces and the castle and town set alight. In Anglesey, Welsh forces killed the royal sheriff. In the spring Edward pressed home his counterattack with a force of 35,000 soldiers, putting down the uprising and killing Madog.|$|E
5|$|Loper {{attended}} the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from August 1939 to February 1940. On graduation, he was posted to the 7th Engineer Battalion at Fort McClellan, Alabama. He was Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, and then Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, of the 5th Infantry Division. In June 1940, he became Assistant Chief of the Intelligence Division at the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC, and then chief. <b>Here,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> promoted to major on 1 July 1940, lieutenant colonel on 18 September 1941, and colonel on 8 June 1942. In May 1942, he negotiated the Loper-Hotline Agreement, under which responsibility for military mapping and {{survey of the}} globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom. The agreement also specified technical features such as grids, scales and formats, so Allied servicemen everywhere would have common maps. For his services in this post, {{he was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal on 28 May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{travelled}} through Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia {{before arriving}} in Chalcedon. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> arrested, his guise revealed {{after he had}} sent requests for money. Men dispatched by Elagabalus apprehended Macrinus and brought him to Cappadocia. Diadumenian was also captured elsewhere while {{on his way to}} Parthia, and then killed by the centurion Cladius Pollio in Zeugma. French author Jean-Baptiste Crevier comments that Macrinus threw himself out of the carriage at Cappadocia when he received the news of the death of his son, breaking his shoulder doing so. Macrinus was executed in Archemais in Cappadocia after attempting to escape; Dio mentions that the centurion Marcianus Taurus was responsible for his execution. Thus, the reign of Macrinus as emperor of Rome ended after nearly fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|William Penn {{stayed in}} Wells shortly {{before leaving for}} America (1682), {{spending}} a night at The Crown Inn. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> briefly arrested for addressing a large crowd in the market place, but released on {{the intervention of the}} Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting only one day, over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 1944, Welter was {{transferred}} to II. Gruppe/Nachtjagdgeschwader 11 (NJG11), a reformation of his former unit. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given command of a special Kommando subordinate to II./NJG11, set up on 11 November 1944 at Erprobungsstelle Rechlin's southern Lärz airbase (2 November 1944 – 28 January 1945), and dedicated to performing nocturnal interception with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter of RAF Mosquitos attacking the Berlin area. According to some sources, Oberleutnant Welter added a Lancaster to his growing list of Mosquitos {{on the night of}} 12 December 1944, the first night victory by a jet fighter. Other sources state that his first aerial victory flying the Me 262 was claimed either on the night of 2 January 1945 or 5 January 1945. On 28 January 1945, the unit initially known as Sonderkommando Stamp, named after its founder Major Gerhard Stamp and then Sonderkommando Welter, was re-designated 10. Staffel/NJG11 and transferred to the airfield at Burg near Magdeburg (28 January 1945 – 12 April 1945). The unit was equipped with Me 262 jet fighters, and tasked with intercepting Mosquito bomber aircraft of No. 8 Group RAF in the Berlin area. The Me 262 were not fitted with radar and used the aid of ground control and the searchlight defences, partially a Wilde Sau form of night combat. Welter had claimed three aerial victories while flying the Me 262 by early February 1945.|$|E

25|$|Leavis's {{criticism}} {{is difficult to}} directly classify, {{but it can be}} grouped into four chronological stages. The first is that of his early publications and essays including New Bearings in English Poetry (1932) and Revaluation (1936). <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned primarily with reexamining poetry from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, and this was accomplished under the strong influence of T. S. Eliot. Also during this early period Leavis sketched out his views about university education.|$|E
