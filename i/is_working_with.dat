5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E

5|$|The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions {{weighing}} {{upwards of}} , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power. The breed {{is found in}} many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and {{is known to be}} gentle and easy to handle. Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction.|$|E
