50|$|Many <b>floats,</b> {{along with}} their drive train, include {{computer-controlled}} robotic mechanisms to animate the <b>floats.</b> Most <b>float</b> drivers can only see the ground below them.

Each <b>float</b> has a Tournament Member (<b>Float</b> Liaison) assigned to it who shepherds the <b>float</b> from the <b>float</b> barn to the formation area and down the parade route.

5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge.

5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was most likely a simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it <b>floated</b> above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at the proclamation of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 pm, the British barges {{carrying}} artillery <b>floated</b> {{down the}} La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between {{an island in}} the La Chute and the shore.

Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.|$|E

50|$|A {{woodworking}} <b>float,</b> {{also called}} a planemaker's <b>float,</b> is a tapered, flat, single cut file of two types: edge <b>float</b> and the flat sided <b>float</b> which are traditional woodworking tools generally used when making a wooden plane.

40|$|Nowadays, marine {{structures}} such as <b>floating</b> breakwaters, <b>floating</b> berths, <b>floating</b> platforms, etc. {{are used}} widely. <b>Floating</b> structures have some advantages such as more compatibility with marine environment, easier and faster transportation for temporary works and capability to install at any depth. The most commonly used type of <b>floating</b> breakwaters are rectangular ones as they have simple and rapid installation and also their deck can be used. For behavior study of <b>floating</b> breakwater, mostly structural response and transmission coefficient are considered.

40|$|Abstract Plastic <b>floats</b> from fishing nets are {{commonly}} found {{washed up on}} beaches in southern Brazil. They are usually broken and show signs of having been repaired. Characteristics of <b>floats</b> and interviews with fishermen suggest two main causes of <b>float</b> loss. First, collisions between active gear, bottom trawl nets for shrimp, and passive gear, drift nets for fish, destroy nets and release fragments of them, including <b>floats.</b> Second, the difficulty with which <b>floats</b> are inserted on the <b>float</b> rope of the nets when they are used near the surface. <b>Floats</b> are inserted to replace damaged or lost <b>floats,</b> {{or they may be}} removed if it is desired that the nets be used in deeper waters. <b>Floats</b> may thus be poorly fixed to the cables and lost.
