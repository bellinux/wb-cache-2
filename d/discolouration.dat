Two compounds that have been identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter is responsible for the brownish <b>discolouration</b> upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|Variety queletiformis can be {{distinguished}} from the main form by the reddish <b>discolouration</b> of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh. Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson red cap, while var. lupiniformis has a pale yellow or dirty ochre cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.|$|E

5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although <b>discolouration</b> was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow <b>discolouration</b> of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|The {{likewise}} {{very common}} Lactarius deliciosus {{is similar in}} appearance. Lactarius deterrimus differs basically from the first because its flesh becomes reddish within 10minutes and in about 30minutes dark maroon, caused by the <b>discolouration</b> of the milk. The milk of L.deterrimus stays orange or becomes reddish within 30minutes. Also, the milk of the latter tastes mild, while the milk of the first distinctly bitter. The cap of L.deterrimus changes its colour in old age or if injured distinctly greenish and is common only under spruces, while L.deterrimus is native under pines.|$|E

5|$|The {{wings are}} {{transparent}} with black or brown veins and a brown-black patch {{at the base}} of apical cells 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black <b>discolouration.</b> The basal cell is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures, about 200nm in height, separated by about 180nm. These are thought to aid in anti-reflective camouflage, anti-wetting and self-cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance. In general, L.vinosus can be distinguished by the more vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, the more distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. L.vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness. Another potential lookalike, L.semisanguifluus, has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to L.sanguifluus, the fruit bodies of L.semisanguifluus are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish <b>discolouration</b> with age.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor <b>discolouration</b> on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of plant root system images {{plays an important}} role in the diagnosis of plant health state, the detection of possible diseases and growth distortions. This paper describes an initial stage of automatic analysis—the segmentation method for scanned images of Ni-treated wheat roots from hydroponic culture. The main roots of a wheat fibrous system are placed separately in the scanner view area on a high chroma background (blue or red). The first stage of the method includes the transformation of a scanned RGB image into the HCI (Hue-Chroma-Intensity) colour space and then local thresholding of the chroma component to extract a binary root image. Possible chromatic <b>discolourations,</b> different from background colour, are added to the roots from blue or red chroma subcomponent images after thresholding. At the second stage, dark <b>discolourations</b> are extracted by local fuzzy c-means clustering of an HCI intensity image within the binary root mask. Fuzzy clustering is applied in local windows around the series of sample points on roots medial axes (skeleton). The performance of the proposed method is compared with hand-labelled segmentation for a series of several root systems...|$|R

5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{came close}} to going bankrupt, Blumenthal sold his house, his car {{and many of his}} possessions {{in order to keep the}} restaurant afloat. After four years, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list. Blumenthal worked with Professor Peter Barham of the University of Bristol, and developed a menu of dishes through experimentation such as slow-cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in the meat and causing them to seize. By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their <b>discolouration,</b> and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness. In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star, and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap <b>discolouration,</b> while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue <b>discolouration</b> upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{purpose of}} the work {{was to examine the}} impact of {{microwave}} radiation on formation of potato tuber parenchyma defects (inhomogeneity, <b>discolourations,</b> glassiness, rusty dark spots and hollow hearts). Research, which was carried out in 2008 - 2010 included very early potato cultivars: Felka Bona, Rosara, Velox and Lord. A device operating with the power of 100 W, generating microwave radiation of 2. 45 GHz frequency was used in the ex-periment.

40|$|Abstract: Plastinated {{specimens}} are {{a relatively}} new and unique type of teaching aids obtained from natural specimens preserved by replacing all the body fluids and fats with plastic polymers. In a previous study a procedure was adapted from the standard S 10 procedure by using locally available silicone paste and hardener as substitutes to the standard onesto plastinatea bovine heart and kidneys. The hardener {{was applied to the}} specimens at the post impregnation stage. The plastinates maintained their general shapes but with various degrees of <b>discolourations</b> and shrinkages. In this study the adapted procedure was modified to minimise degree of <b>discolourations</b> and shrinkages by eliminating the washing-out stage, and by applying hardener to specimens at pre-impregnation instead of post-impregnation. Shrinkage was 5. 62 % – 8. 48 % and 5. 23 % – 9. 41 % in the hearts and kidneys respectively with optimum shrinkages at dehydration. Shrinkages were not significantly different (p> 0. 05) among plastinated hearts but varied significantly (p≤ 0. 05) among plastination stages. For the kidneys, shrinkage varied significantly (p≤ 0. 05) among samples and among stages of plastination. Levels of shrinkages of the hearts did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) from the kidneys. Mean shrinkage in this study did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) from that of the 2012 study. Just as in the 2012 study the plastinated hearts and kidneys maintained their general shapes, were hard, dry and light brown in colour. Omitting the washing-out stage, and applying the hardener to specimens at pre-impregnation did not yield better quality plastinates than when washing-out was done and hardener applied at postimpregnation...|$|R
50|$|When {{tap water}} is not {{sufficiently}} alkaline, or is even acidic and {{is unsatisfactory for}} blueing haematoxylin, a tap water substitute consisting of 3.5 g NaHCO3 and 20 g MgSO4.7H2O in one litre of water with thymol (to inhibit formation of moulds), is used to accelerate blueing of thin paraffin sections. Addition of a trace of any alkali to tap or distilled water also provides an effective blueing solution; {{a few drops of}} strong ammonium hydroxide or of saturated aqueous lithium carbonate, added immediately before use, are sufficient for a 400 ml staining dish full of water. Use of very cold water slows down the blueing process, whereas warming accelerates it. In fact, the use of water below 10 °C for blueing sections may even produce pink artifact <b>discolourations</b> in the tissue.|$|R
