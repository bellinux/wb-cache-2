50|$|Inductive pickup coils (also {{referred}} as <b>inductive</b> <b>sensor)</b> measure the magnetization by detecting the current induced in a coil {{due to the}} changing magnetic moment of the sample. The sample’s magnetization can be changed by applying a small ac magnetic field (or a rapidly changing dc field), as occurs in capacitor-driven pulsed magnets. These measurements require differentiating between the magnetic field produced by the sample and that from the external applied field. Often a special arrangement of cancellation coils is used. For example, half of the pickup coil is wound in one direction, {{and the other half}} in the other direction, and the sample is placed in only one half. The external uniform magnetic field is detected by both halves of the coil, and since they are counter-wound, the external magnetic field produces no net signal.|$|E
