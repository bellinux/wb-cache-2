40|$|During development, Sonic {{hedgehog}} (Shh) {{regulates the}} proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in part via expression of Nmyc. We present evidence supporting a novel role for the Mad family member Mad 3 in the Shh pathway to regulate Nmyc expression and <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Mad 3 mRNA is transiently expressed in <b>GNPs</b> during <b>proliferation.</b> Cultured <b>GNPs</b> express Mad 3 in response to Shh stimulation in a cyclopamine-dependent manner. Mad 3 is necessary for Shh-dependent <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and Nmyc expression. Furthermore, Mad 3 overexpression, but not that of other Mad proteins, is sufficient to induce <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> {{in the absence of}} Shh. Structure-function analysis revealed that Max dimerization and recruitment of the mSin 3 corepressor are required for Mad 3 -mediated <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Surprisingly, basic-domain-dependent DNA binding of Mad 3 is not required, suggesting that Mad 3 interacts with other DNA binding proteins to repress transcription. Interestingly, cerebellar tumors and pretumor cells derived from patched heterozygous mice express high levels of Mad 3 compared with adjacent normal cerebellar tissue. Our studies support a novel role for Mad 3 in cerebellar <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> and possibly tumorigenesis, and they challenge the current paradigm that Mad 3 should antagonize Nmyc by competition for direct DNA binding via Max dimerization...|$|R
40|$|Modulation of {{the sonic}} {{hedgehog}} (SHH) pathway {{is a crucial}} factor in cerebellar morphogenesis. Stimulation of granule neuron progenitor (<b>GNP)</b> <b>proliferation</b> is a central function of SHH signalling, but how this is controlled locally is not understood. We show that two sequentially expressed members of the contactin (CNTN) family of adhesion molecules, TAG 1 and F 3, act antagonistically to control SHH-induced proliferation: F 3 suppresses SHH-induced <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> and induces differentiation, whereas TAG 1 antagonises F 3. Production of GNPs in TAG 1 -null mice is delayed and reduced. F 3 and TAG 1 colocalise on GNPs with the related L 1 -like adhesion molecule NrCAM, and F 3 fails to suppress the SHH-induced <b>proliferation</b> of NrCAM-deficient <b>GNPs.</b> We show that F 3 and SHH both primarily affect a group of intermediate GNPs (IPs), which, though actively dividing, also express molecules associated with differentiation, including β-tubulin III (TuJ 1) and TAG 1. In vivo, intermediate progenitors form a discrete layer {{in the middle of}} the external germinal layer (mEGL), while F 3 becomes expressed on the axons of postmitotic granule neurons as they leave the inner EGL (iEGL). We propose, therefore, that F 3 acts as a localised signal in the iEGL that induces SHH-stimulated cells in the overlying mEGL to exit cell cycle and differentiate. By contrast, expression of TAG 1 on GNPs antagonises this signal in the mEGL, preventing premature differentiation and sustaining GNP expansion in a paracrine fashion. Together, these findings indicate that CNTN and L 1 -like proteins play a significant role in modulating SHH-induced neuronal precursor proliferation...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{environmental contaminant}} 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlor-odibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) {{has been linked}} to developmental neurotoxicity associated with abnormal cerebellar maturation in both humans and rodents. TCDD mediates toxicity via binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and growth regulatory molecules. Our previous studies demonstrated that cerebellar granule neuron precursor cells (GNPs) express transcriptionally active AhR during critical developmental periods. TCDD exposure also impaired <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> and survival in vitro. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that TCDD exposure disrupts cerebellar development by interfering with GNP differentiation. In vivo experiments indicated that TCDD exposure on postnatal day (PND) 6 resulted in increased expression of a mitotic marker and increased thickness of th...|$|R
50|$|The miR-17-92 Cluster {{has been}} implicated in Medulloblastoma (MB) {{which is the most}} common {{paediatric}} malignant brain tumour. It arises when cerebellar granule neurone progenitor (GNP) cells fail to properly migrate and differentiate. MB can be induced by 2 inherited cancer syndromes, one of which is called the Gorlin syndrome and is caused by a mutated PATCHED(PTCH) gene. PTCH is the receptor for Sonic hedgehog (SHH). This SHH signalling pathway is crucial during early development and SSH is the major mitogen for <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Turcots's syndrome can give rise to MB as well, resulting from a mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (a member of the wingless (WNT signalling pathway). But only Gorlin syndrome and the SHH pathway is thought to incorporate the mode of action of the miR-17-92 cluster.|$|R
40|$|A {{subset of}} medulloblastomas, {{the most common}} brain tumor in children, is {{hypothesized}} to originate from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in which the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is over-activated. MXD 3, a basic helix-look-helix zipper transcription factor of the MAD family, {{has been reported to}} be upregulated during postnatal cerebellar development and to promote <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> and MYCN expression. Mxd 3 is upregulated in mouse models of medulloblastoma as well as in human medulloblastomas. Therefore, we hypothesize that MXD 3 plays a role in the cellular events that lead to medulloblastoma biogenesis. In agreement with its proliferative role in GNPs, MXD 3 knock-down in DAOY cells resulted in decreased proliferation. Sustained overexpression of MXD 3 resulted in decreased cell numbers due to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Structure-function analysis revealed that the Sin 3 interacting domain, the basic domain, and binding to E-boxes are essential for this activity. Microarray-based expression analysis indicated up-regulation of 84 genes and down-regulation of 47 genes. Potential direct MXD 3 target genes were identified by ChIP-chip. Our results suggest that MXD 3 is necessary for DAOY medulloblastoma cell proliferation. However, increased level and/or duration of MXD 3 expression ultimately reduces cell numbers via increased cell death and cell cycle arrest...|$|R
40|$|Granule neuron {{progenitors}} (GNPs) are {{the most}} abundant neuronal type in the cerebellum. <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> and thus cerebellar development require Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted from Purkinje cells. Shh signaling occurs in primary cilia originating from the mother centriole. Centrioles replicate only once during a typical cell cycle and are responsible for mitotic spindle assembly and organization. Recent studies have linked cilia function to cerebellar morphogenesis, but the role of centriole duplication in cerebellar development is not known. Here we show that centrosomal protein Cep 120 is asymmetrically localized to the daughter centriole through its interaction with Talpid 3 (Ta 3), another centrosomal protein. Cep 120 null mutant mice die in early gestation with abnormal heart looping. Inactivation of Cep 120 in {{the central nervous system}} leads to both hydrocephalus, due to the loss of cilia on ependymal cells, and severe cerebellar hypoplasia, due to the failed <b>proliferation</b> of <b>GNPs.</b> The mutant GNPs lack Hedgehog pathway activity. Cell biological studies show that the loss of Cep 120 results in failed centriole duplication and consequently ciliogenesis, which together underlie Cep 120 mutant cerebellar hypoplasia. Thus, our study for the first time links a centrosomal protein necessary for centriole duplication to cerebellar morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In the {{developing}} cerebellum, proliferation of granular neuroprogenitor (GNP) cells lasts {{until the early}} postnatal stages when terminal maturation of the cerebellar cortex occurs. GNPs are considered cell targets for neoplastic transformation, and disturbances in cerebellar <b>GNP</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> {{may contribute to the}} development of pediatric medulloblastoma. At the molecular level, <b>proliferation</b> of <b>GNPs</b> is regulated through an orchestrated action of the SHH, NOTCH, and WNT pathways, but the underlying mechanisms still need to be dissected. Here, we report that expression of the E 2 F 1 transcription factor in rat GNPs is inversely correlated with cell proliferation rate during postnatal development, as opposed to its traditional SHH-dependent induction of cell cycle. <b>Proliferation</b> of <b>GNPs</b> peaked at postnatal day 3 (P 3), with a subsequent continuing decrease in proliferation rates occurring until P 12. Such gradual decline in proliferating neuroprogenitors paralleled the extent of cerebellum maturation confirmed by histological analysis with cresyl violet staining and temporal expression profiling of SHH, NOTCH 2, and WNT 4 genes. A time course analysis of E 2 F 1 expression in GNPs revealed significantly increased levels at P 12, correlating with decreased cell proliferation. Expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p 18 (Ink 4 c), a target of E 2 F 1, was also significantly higher at P 12. Conversely, increased E 2 F 1 expression did not correlate with either SMAC/DIABLO and BCL 2 expression profiles or apoptosis of cerebellar cells. Altogether, these results suggest that E 2 F 1 may also be involved in the inhibition of <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation</b> during rat postnatal development despite its conventional mitogenic effects.

40|$|Development {{requires}} {{a delicate balance}} of proliferation and differentiation. Too little proliferation can result in dysfunctional tissues, while prolonged or heightened proliferation can result in tumor formation. This is clearly seen with the granule neuron precursors (GNPs) of the cerebellum. Too little proliferation of these cells during development results in ataxia, whereas too much proliferation results in the cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma. While these cells are known to proliferate in response to Shh, {{it is not clear}} what controls the differentiation of these cells in vivo. Previous work from our lab has identified basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as a candidate differentiation factor for these cells. In this thesis, I characterize some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in FGF-mediated inhibition (FMI) of Shh-induced <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation.</b> In addition, I employ FGFR knockouts and a bFGF gain-of-function mouse to determine whether FGF signaling is necessary and/or sufficient for differentiation of GNPs during cerebellar development. Finally, the question of whether bFGF can be effective as a therapeutic agent for in vivo tumor treatment is tested in a transplant model. 	These experiments indicate that FGF signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for GNP differentiation during cerebellar development. However, transplanted tumors are potently inhibited by bFGF treatment. Furthermore, FMI is shown to occur around the level of Gli 2 processing in the Shh pathway, implying that such a treatment has promise to be widely effective in treatment of Shh-dependent medulloblastomas.

40|$|Disruption of {{cerebellar}} granular neuronal precursor (GNP) maturation {{can result}} in defects in motor coordination and learning, or in medulloblastoma, the most common childhood brain tumor. The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway is important for GNP proliferation; however, the factors regulating the extent and timing of <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation,</b> as well as GNP differentiation and migration are poorly understood. The p 53 tumor suppressor {{has been shown to}} negatively regulate the activity of the Shh effector, Gli 1, in neural stem cells; however, the contribution of p 53 to the regulation of Shh signaling in GNPs during cerebellar development has not been determined. Here, we exploited a hypomorphic allele of Mdm 2 (Mdm 2 (puro)), which encodes a critical negative regulator of p 53, to alter the level of wild-type MDM 2 and p 53 in vivo. We report that mice with reduced levels of MDM 2 and increased levels of p 53 have small cerebella with shortened folia, reminiscent of deficient Shh signaling. Indeed, Shh signaling in Mdm 2 -deficient GNPs is attenuated, concomitant with decreased expression of the Shh transducers, Gli 1 and Gli 2. We also find that Shh stimulation of GNPs promotes MDM 2 accumulation and enhances phosphorylation at serine 166, a modification known to increase MDM 2 -p 53 binding. Significantly, loss of MDM 2 in Ptch 1 (+/-) mice, a model for Shh-mediated human medulloblastoma, impedes cerebellar tumorigenesis. Together, these results place MDM 2 at a major nexus between the p 53 and Shh signaling pathways in GNPs, with key roles in cerebellar development, GNP survival, cerebellar foliation, and MB tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|Conditional N-Myc {{deletion}} {{limits the}} proliferation of granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), perturbs foliation, and leads to reduced cerebellar mass. We show that c-Myc mRNA levels increase in N-Myc-null GNPs and that simultaneous deletion of both c- and N-Myc exacerbates defective cerebellar development. Moreover, N-Myc loss {{has been shown to}} trigger the precocious expression of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, Kip 1 and Ink 4 c, in the cerebellar primordium. We now further demonstrate that the engineered disruption of the Kip 1 and Ink 4 c genes in N-Myc-null cerebella partially rescues <b>GNP</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> and cerebellar foliation. These results provide definitive genetic evidence that expression of N-Myc and concomitant down-regulation of Ink 4 c and Kip 1 contribute to the proper development of the cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hedgehog (HH) {{signaling}} {{is critical}} {{for the expansion of}} granule neuron precursors (GNPs) within the external granular layer (EGL) during cerebellar development. Aberrant HH signaling within GNPs is thought to give rise to medulloblastoma (MB) - the most commonly-observed form of malignant pediatric brain tumor. Evidence in both invertebrates and vertebrates indicates that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) antagonizes HH signalling. Receptors specific for the neuropeptide pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP, gene name ADCYAP 1) are expressed in GNPs. PACAP has been shown to protect GNPs from apoptosis in vitro, and to interact with HH signaling to regulate <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation.</b> PACAP/ ptch 1 double mutant mice exhibit an increased incidence of MB compared to ptch 1 mice, indicating that PACAP may regulate HH pathway-mediated MB pathogenesis. Methods Primary MB tumorsphere cultures were prepared from thirteen ptch 1 +/- /p 53 +/- double mutant mice and treated with the smoothened (SMO) agonist purmorphamine, the SMO antagonist SANT- 1, the neuropeptide PACAP, the PKA activator forskolin, and the PKA inhibitor H 89. Gene expression of gli 1 and [3 H]-thymidine incorporation were assessed to determine drug effects on HH pathway activity and proliferation, respectively. PKA activity was determined in cell extracts by Western blotting using a phospho-PKA substrate antibody. Results Primary tumor cells cultured for 1 -week under serum-free conditions grew as tumorspheres and were found to express PAC 1 receptor transcripts. Gli 1 gene expression was significantly reduced by SANT- 1, PACAP and forskolin, but was unaffected by purmorphamine. The attenuation of gli 1 gene expression by PACAP was reversed by the PKA inhibitor H 89, which also blocked PKA activation. Treatment of tumorsphere cultures with PACAP, forskolin, and SANT- 1 for 24 or 48 hours reduced proliferation. Conclusions Primary tumorspheres derived from ptch 1 +/- /p 53 +/- mice exhibit constitutive HH pathway activity. PACAP antagonizes HH signalling in these cells in a manner blocked by the PKA antagonist H 89. PACAP and pharmacological activation of PKA also inhibited proliferation. Our data suggests that regulation of HH signaling by PACAP/PKA signaling may provide an alternative to SMO inhibition for the treatment of MB. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cerebellar {{development}} {{involves a}} spurt of proliferation in external granule layer (EGL) {{in response to}} shh, causing granule neuron precursors (GNPs) to proliferate. These cells subsequently differentiate into granule neurons in the inner granule layer (IGL). F 3, a CNTN family molecule, can interact with NrCAM to switch <b>GNPs</b> from <b>proliferation</b> to differentiation. We aim to identify the role of NrCAM in the sonic hedgehog response in GNPs. Methods: GNPs were extracted from wildtype and NrCAM mutant P 5 cerebella using Percoll gradient centrifugation. Proliferation response to shh was measured using EdU in presence/absence of F 3 -Fc. GNPs treated with shh/SAG were stained with antibodies against Arl 13 b and smo to look for differences in cilia size and smo occupancy after different treatment times. Results: NrCAM-/- and wildtype GNPs both proliferated equally in response to shh. F 3 was found to block the proliferation response in wildtype but not in NrCAM-/- GNPs. F 3 also failed to affect proliferation in SmoA 1 GNPs with a constitutively active smo suggesting that the F 3 -NrCAM mediated block lay upstream of Smo. NrCAM was detected in wildtype cilia and Smo localization was affected in NrCAM-/- GNPs. No differences in cilia length were observed. Conclusion: Our results suggest that NrCAM affects shh-mediated proliferation by controlling smo movement into the cilium...|$|R
40|$|During development, {{the precise}} {{regulation}} of the processes of proliferation, migration, and differentiation is required to establish proper organ structure and function and to prevent the deregulation {{that can lead to}} disease, such as cancer. Improved understanding of the signals that regulate these processes is therefore necessary to both gain insight into the mechanisms by which organ development proceeds and to identify strategies for treating the consequences of de{{regulation of the}}se processes. In the cerebellum, some of the factors that regulate these processes have been identified but remain incompletely understood. Our studies have focused on the signals that regulate the migration of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) and the contribution of the SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 signaling axis to postnatal cerebellar development. Using conditional knockout mice to delete CXCR 4 specifically in GNPs, we show that loss of CXCR 4 results in premature migration of a subset of GNPs throughout postnatal development that are capable of proliferation and survival outside of their normal mitogenic niche. Loss of CXCR 4 also causes a reduction in the activity of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway (the primary mitogen for GNPs) but does not affect <b>GNP</b> <b>proliferation,</b> differentiation, or capacity for tumor formation. Our data suggest that while other factors likely contribute, SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 signaling is necessary for proper migration of GNPs throughout cerebellar development. In addition to understanding the signals that regulate normal development, the identification of vulnerabilities of established tumors is also necessary to improve cancer treatment. One strategy to improve treatment involves targeting the cells that are critical for maintaining tumor growth, known as tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). In the context of the cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma (MB), we have previously identified a population of TPCs in tumors from patched mutant mice that express the cell surface carbohydrate antigen CD 15 /SSEA- 1. Here, we employed multiple approaches in an effort to target these cells, including a biochemical approach to identify molecules that carry the CD 15 carbohydrate epitope as well as an immunotoxin approach to specifically target CD 15 -expressing cells. Unfortunately, these strategies were ultimately unsuccessful, but an alternative approach that recognized a vulnerability of CD 15 + cells was identified. We show that CD 15 + cells express elevated levels of genes associated with the G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle, progress more rapidly through the cell cycle than CD 15 - cells, and contain an increased proportion of cells in G 2 /M. Exposure of tumor cells to inhibitors of Aurora and Polo-like kinases, key regulators of G 2 /M, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy, and treatment of tumor-bearing mice with these agents significantly inhibits tumor progression. Importantly, cells from human patient-derived MB xenografts are also sensitive to Aurora and Polo-like kinase inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting G 2 /M regulators may represent a novel approach for the treatment of human MB. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} toxicity effects of gold nanoparticles (<b>GNPs)</b> on the <b>proliferation</b> and differentiation of a progenitor cell line, MG 63 osteoblast-like cells, was investigated. These cells were treated for 20 hours with two media that contained 10 nm GNPs at concentrations of 1 ppm and 10 ppm. The mitosis of the GNP-treated MG 63 was observed after at least 21 hours using dark-field and fluorescence microscopy. The TEM, LSCM and dark-field hyperspectral images {{indicated that the}} late endosomes in cells that contained aggregated GNPs were caused by vesicle fusion. Subsequently, after 21 days of being cultured in fresh medium, the specific nodule-like phenotypes and bone-associated gene expression of the treated MG 63 cells exhibited the same behaviors {{as those of the}} control group. Statistically, after 21 days, the viability of the treated cells was identical to that of the untreated ones. During the cell death program analysis, the apoptosis and necrosis percentages of cells treated for 8 or fewer days were also observed to exhibit no significant difference with those of the untreated cells. In summary, our experiments show that the {{long-term toxicity}} of GNPs on the osteogenetic differentiation of MG 63 is low.
