40|$|AbstractHousehold wastewater, {{especially}} from conventional septic systems, {{is a major}} contributor to nitrogen pollution. Alternative household wastewater management technologies provide similar sewerage management services but their life cycle costs and nitrogen flow implications remain uncertain. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) what are the total costs, nitrogen mitigation potential, and cost-effectiveness of a range of conventional and alternative municipal wastewater treatment technologies, and (2) what uncertainties influence these outcomes and how can we improve our understanding of these technologies? We estimate a household nitrogen mass balance for various household wastewater treatment systems and combine this mass balance with life cycle cost assessment to calculate the cost-effectiveness of nitrogen mitigation, which we define as nitrogen removed from the local watershed. We apply our methods to Falmouth, MA, where failing septic systems have caused heightened eutrophication in local receiving water bodies. We find that flushing and dry (composting) urine-diversion toilets paired with conventional septic systems for greywater management demonstrate the lowest life cycle cost and highest cost-effectiveness (dollars per <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> removed from the watershed). Composting toilets are also attractive options in some cases, particularly best-case nitrogen mitigation. Innovative/advanced septic systems designed for high-level nitrogen removal are cost-competitive options for newly constructed homes, except at their most expensive. A centralized wastewater treatment plant is the most expensive and least cost-effective option in all cases. Using a greywater recycling system with any treatment technology increases the cost without adding any nitrogen removal benefits. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results are robust considering a range of cases and uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} cycling {{of nitrogen}} has critical implications for all life on earth. The Haber-Bosch process (1909) {{paved the way}} for the industrial fixation of NH 3 from unreactive atmospheric dinitrogen, a phenomenon previously restricted to the enzyme nitrogenase and to a lesser extent lightning. Perhaps the most profoundly catalytic invention of the 20 th century, Haber-Bosch has greatly increased the global anthropogenic throughput of nitrogen that now rivals the 160 million metric tons fixed annually via nitrogenase. Notably 40 % of the world's 6 billion people alive today owe their body's <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> to synthetic fertilizer created via the Haber-Bosch process (Smil 2001). The intensification of agriculture and the growth of urban centers during the 20 th century has also resulted in substantive increases in nitrogen loads to the environment. Nitrogen transported by surface and groundwater is ultimately concentrated in rivers and coastal areas, with consequences such as eutrophication and the "dead zones" of hypoxia found throughout the world. Microbial metabolism of nitrogen via the nitrification and denitrification pathways also produces N 20, a potent greenhouse gas currently responsible for 5 % of total atmospheric radiative forcing. (cont.) This thesis examines the environmental implications of increased nitrogen throughput and the regulatory frameworks that are evolving to cope with nitrogen pollution. A case study of the Aberjona river, draining a heavily polluted urban watershed north of Boston, is examined in terms of the correlation between urban intensity and nitrogen yields (r 2 = 0. 79), the internal processing of nitrogen via major biological pathways, and the role of legacy pollutants as a source of nitrogen. The high fraction of organic nitrogen (34 % of TOT N export) suggests that the effects of urban intensification are not limited to the export of inorganic species, and should be included in urban nitrogen budgets for effective watershed management. by Matthew Orosz.

40|$|The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) {{suite of}} models {{was used to}} predict {{dynamics}} in water and nitrogen in soil, {{as well as the}} growth and yield of sequential crops of wheat and barley in pasture–wheat–barley rotations, between 1995 and 1997 at Roseworthy, South Australia. The NWHEAT model satisfactorily predicted above-ground dry matter, leaf area index and grain yields for both crops in rotations with either grassy (Grass) or medic (Medic) pastures, including the lack of significant response of yield to nitrogen fertiliser applied to wheat at sowing. Simulation data for soil water, from SOILWAT 2, was consistent with measured data. Simulation with SOILN 2, however, largely underestimated soil nitrogen, due to excessive uptake by the simulated wheat during the season when nitrogen was abundant and water supply readily available. Thus, the soil nitrate had to be reset at sowing for the following barley crop; simulated soil nitrate agreed with the measured data in this season when this nutrient was low. For most variables of crop growth and soil water, the simulated data were mostly within 2 standard errors of the measured means. Prediction of grain protein was underestimated in all cases, including where nitrogen in the shoot was overestimated. This was possibly due to inadequate remobilisation of nitrogen from the straw and roots to the grain by the simulated crop. A satisfactory prediction of dry matter, grain yield and grain weight was obtained for wheat when the models were extended to other trials at Roseworthy (Lower North), Minnipa (Upper Eyre Peninsula) and Wunkar (Murray Mallee), based on limited soil data. Long-term simulations of wheat yields showed that, with early sowing in the Lower North, median wheat yield increased by 50 kg/ha for every <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> applied at sowing, up to a maximum nitrogen rate of 50 kg/ha. In the drier districts of the Upper Eyre Peninsula and the Murray Mallee, nitrogen fertiliser of no more than 25 kg/ha, applied at sowing, was enough to achieve yield benefits in any given season. At these drier sites, crop failures occurred in 5 % (Upper Eyre Peninsula) and 10 % (Murray Mallee) of the seasons simulated. Median sowing dates from these simulations were 15 May for the Lower North, 30 May for the Upper Eyre Peninsula and 24 May for Murray Mallee. This suggested that sowing could be conducted at least a week earlier than currently practised in the 3 environments. This study demonstrated the capability of APSIM to predict growth and grain yield of wheat and barley, as well as the associated dynamics of soil water in the main cereal belts of South Australia...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{of three}} essays that address {{different aspects of}} agriculture in Malawi using a two-wave panel data collected by the National Statistical Office of Malawi {{with support from the}} World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study – Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) program. Each essay stands alone as an independent study because of differences in research questions and the methodologies used in addressing the questions. ^ The first essay analyzes the micro-level welfare impacts of agricultural productivity. Welfare is measured by various dimensions of poverty and food insecurity; and agricultural productivity is measured by maize yield and value of crop output per hectare. Depending on the measure of welfare, the impact of agricultural productivity was estimated with a household fixed effects estimator, a two-part estimator or a correlated-random effects ordered probit estimator. The results indicate that increasing agricultural productivity has the expected statistically significant welfare improving effect, but the magnitude of the effect is small given the attention that agriculture usually receives. Efforts to effectively improve the welfare of rural agricultural households should therefore go beyond increasing agricultural productivity. ^ The second essay estimates the profitability of inorganic fertilizer use in maize production using fixed effects and multilevel models. The study finds that fertilizer use is generally unprofitable at prevailing market conditions when one assumes farmers incur positive transaction costs in the use of fertilizer. The main factor that drives low fertilizer profitability is low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) which is estimated to range from 9. 24 kg to 12. 09 kg on average, depending on the model specification. In order for fertilizer use to be profitable on average, the NUE would have to increase by at least 137 % if maize output is valued at the farm gate price and by 50 % if maize is valued at the lean season market price. ^ Essay three provides guidance for the targeting of Malawi’s Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) by estimating the difference in inorganic fertilizer use efficiency and crowing out of commercial fertilizer by subsidized fertilizer between poor and non-poor households. The difference in inorganic fertilizer use efficiency is estimated with a multilevel model of maize yield while the difference in crowding out is estimated with a double hurdle model of demand for commercial, inorganic fertilizer. The results indicate that non-poor farmers are significantly more efficient in the use of inorganic fertilizer, but have significantly higher levels of crowding out, compared to poor. This suggests that there is a trade-off between targeting the non-poor farmers and targeting poor farmers. Further analysis of the trade-off however indicates that targeting non-poor farmers instead of poor farmers, after accounting for the difference in crowding out, would result in an overall yield gain of 3. 14 - 4. 33 kg per <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Therefore the food security objective of Malawi’s farm input subsidy program would be better served if non-poor farmers are targeted instead of poor farmers. ...|$|E
40|$|China is {{experiencing}} intense air pollution caused {{in large part}} by anthropogenic emissions <b>of</b> reactive <b>nitrogen.</b> These emissions result in the deposition <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>nitrogen</b> (N) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with implications for human and ecosystem health, greenhouse gas balances and biological diversity. However, information on the magnitude and environmental impact of N deposition in China is limited. Here we use nationwide data sets on bulk N deposition, plant foliar N and crop N uptake (from long-term unfertilized soils) to evaluate N deposition dynamics and their effect on ecosystems across China between 1980 and 2010. We find that the average annual bulk deposition of N increased by approximately 8 <b>kilograms</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> per hectare (P < 0. 001) between the 1980 s (13. 2 <b>kilograms</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> per hectare) and the 2000 s (21. 1 <b>kilograms</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> per hectare). Nitrogen deposition rates in the industrialized and agriculturally intensified regions of China are as high as the peak levels of deposition in northwestern Europe in the 1980 s, before the introduction <b>of</b> mitigation measures. <b>Nitrogen</b> from ammonium (NH 4 +) is the dominant form of N in bulk deposition, but the rate of increase is largest for deposition of N from nitrate (NO 3 -), in agreement with decreased ratios of NH 3 to NO x emissions since 1980. We also find that the impact of N deposition on Chinese ecosystems includes significantly increased plant foliar N concentrations in natural and semi-natural (that is, non-agricultural) ecosystems and increased crop N uptake from long-term-unfertilized croplands.

Sweet potato yield was lowest in plots with previous gliricidia, but there were no differences in yield between previous piper and imperata.

Two OWS were conventional style, two were surface discharge sand filter systems and one was a low-pressure pipe system. Septic tank, groundwater from the piezometers, sand filter effluent, and surface waters down-gradient from the OWTS were sampled for nitrogen concentrations. Data shows that total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations in groundwater beneath the drainfield trenches of conventional style OWS and in the effluent of surface discharge sand filters were on average 93 % and 81 % lower than septic tank effluent concentrations, respectively. Therefore, the conventional style OWTS were contributing lower concentrations of TDN to surface waters than the surface discharge sand filters.

40|$|Dutch manure policy {{tries to}} limit the harmful {{environmental}} impact of agriculture. This {{is in line with}} international agreements on fertilizer use. The European Nitrates Directive prescribes Member States {{to limit the}} use of animal manure to 170 kg nitrogen per hectare. Farms with at least 80 percent of grassland may, under certain conditions, use more manure from grazing animals such as cows and sheep (derogation). Over the last 10 years, nitrate leaching from the manure to the upper groundwater has decreased or remained the same for these farms. By 2015, on average, the concentration is in all regions below the EU standard of 50 milligrams of nitrate per liter. This is according to the annual report by RIVM and Wageningen Economic Research. They follow agricultural practices and the effects on water quality at 300 derogation farms and report their results to the EU annually. This report describes the situation in 2015 and the development between 2006 and 2016 (trend). Management.

On average, derogation companies have used 238 <b>kilograms</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> from animal manure per hectare in 2015. The amount <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> that can leached as nitrate to groundwater is determined, among others, by the so-called nitrogen soil surplus.

On the average, farms in the Clay region and the Peat region had lower nitrate concentrations in leaching water (22 and 13 mg/l respectively). The difference between the regions can be explained by the proportion of soils prone to nitrate leaching.

However, when a culture does not have a tradition of reusing or handling human waste, what would motivate a household within that culture to recycle and reuse their waste? More specifically, how do the agricultural value of the material from an ecosan toilet and user perspectives on ecosan systems influence households' adoption of ecosan toilets? On average, households in the study area produce 4 <b>kilograms</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and 0. 6 <b>kilograms</b> <b>of</b> phosphorous per year from urine collected in the skyloo toilet, the type of urine-diverting ecosan toilet available in the study area in the Nyanza Province, Kenya. These nutrients are the equivalent of a cost savings of about US $ 12 per year (the GDP per capita in Kenya in 2004 was US $ 1 100). About two-thirds of the households reuse the processed feces and urine in household gardens. Users reported additional major benefits such as the absence of foul odors, inexpensive construction costs (partly due to a materials subsidy by the promoting NGO), and the aesthetic value/social status that the facility brings to the owners' homes. (cont.) The major negative factors included problems with construction and design of the facility, training new users-especially children-how to use the toilet, and handling human excrement. The findings suggest that ecosan is a viable sanitation option that fills a niche within this region of Kenya. Ecosan's comparative advantages seem to be significant enough to outweigh negative cultural sentiments regarding the handling of human excrement to some user groups. Such user groups include the very poor who practice household agriculture (those who have trouble affording commercial fertilizer and also have reason to want it), those who live in areas with high nutrient loads to natural waters, households with an exceptional environmental conscious, and households in which adverse hydrogeologic conditions (such as a high water table or loose soils) make pit latrines an environmental and human health hazard. In addition to household-level advantages, the niche that ecosan fills has the potential to make headway towards the Millennium Development Goals' provision of sanitation, and to be a valuable contribution to integrated water resource management strategies. by Brian E.

Either olone or in the mixtures costor pomace yielded better than the mineral sources; where applied alone, its effect reached + 5. 46 tons to the hectare. The soils studied were high in organic matter, and apparently no leaching <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> occurred under the conditions of the experiments. The superior performance of castor pomace is attributed to two factors: 1) only its nitrogen content was considered in the calculation of the doses to be used, so that in the treatments with it the quantities of PK were higher than in those which received ammonium sulfate or Chilean nitrate; 2) on the other hand, while the entire dose of castor pomace was side-placed by planting time, only half of the ammonium and nitrate doses was applied in that way, the other halves being top-dressed one month after the emergence of the shoots, apparently too late for efficient use by the potato plants. Owing to the exaggerated price of castor pomace, the profits that it and its mixtures gave were relatively low. In this sense the mixture of ammonium sulfate and Chilean nitrate was much better. Such results emphasize the need for studying a suitable method <b>of</b> applying mineral <b>nitrogen</b> under the particular conditions of the potato-growing in the Paraíba Valley...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} whether a detectable impact of climate change is apparent in Austrian forests. In regions of complex terrain such as most of Austria, climatic trends over the past 50 years show marked geographic variability. As climate is one of the key drivers of forest growth, a comparison of growth characteristics between regions with different trends in temperature and precipitation can give insights into the impact of climatic change on forests. This study uses data from several hundred climate recording stations, interpolated to measurement sites of the Austrian National Forest Inventory (NFI). Austria as a whole shows a warming trend over the past 50 years and little overall change in precipitation. The warming trends, however, vary considerably across certain regions and regional precipitation trends vary widely in both directions, which cancel out on the national scale These differences allow the delineation of 2 ̆ 7 climatic change zones 2 ̆ 7 with internally consistent climatic trends that differ from other zones. This study applies the species-specific adaptation of the biogeochemical model BIOME-BGC to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) across a range of Austrian climatic change zones, using input data from a number of national databases. The relative influence of extant climate change on forest growth is quantified, and compared with the far greater impact of non-climatic factors. At the national scale, climate change is found to have negligible effect on Norway spruce productivity, due in part to opposing effects at the regional level. The magnitudes of the modeled non-climatic influences on aboveground woody biomass increment increases are consistent with previously reported values of 20 - 40 kg of added stem carbon sequestration per <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>nitrogen</b> deposition, while climate responses are of a magnitude difficult to detect in NFI data...|$|R
