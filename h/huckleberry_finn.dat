5|$|Although {{details of}} his life story may have been forgotten, Emperor Norton was immortalized in literature. Mark Twain, who resided in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's public life, modeled the {{character}} of the King in Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> on Joshua Norton.|$|E
5|$|Bart's {{character}} traits of rebelliousness and disrespect for authority have {{been compared to}} that of America's founding fathers, and he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|Charlton married Pat Kemp on 6 January 1958, and {{his brother}} Bobby acted as his best man. They have three children: John (born in January 1959), Deborah (born 1961) and Peter, who was born just after Charlton senior played in the 1966 World Cup final. During the 1960s he ran two clothes shops in Leeds, and he also later {{operated}} the souvenir shop at Elland Road. Charlton is a keen amateur fisherman and also takes part in field sports. He appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1972 and 1996, and chose to take with him The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> by Mark Twain, the Encyclopaedia of How to Survive, a spyglass, and a fishing rod. Charlton {{was the subject of}} This Is Your Life in 1973 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E
5|$|The hobo's third tale {{tells the}} story of Tom Sawyer, whom Bart portrays, and <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> whom Nelson portrays. Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings from the rafters which they have big smiles on their faces, until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies lowered into the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E
5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E

25|$|A later {{version of}} the act was wonderfully {{described}} by Mark Twain in Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> and other variations on it survive today in several contemporary equestrian routines, particularly those of the Hanneford family.|$|E
25|$|Many {{novels are}} narrated by children, whose {{inexperience}} can impair their judgment {{and make them}} unreliable. In Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> (1884), Huck's innocence leads him to make overly charitable judgments about {{the characters in the}} novel.|$|E
25|$|Mark Twain {{resided in}} his {{innovative}} Hartford home from 1871 until 1891, {{during which time}} he published The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn.</b> He lived in Redding from 1908 {{until his death in}} 1910.|$|E
25|$|Clemens wrote {{many of his}} best-known works {{while living}} there, {{including}} The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Prince and the Pauper, Life on the Mississippi, Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> A Tramp Abroad, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript {{off and on for}} the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E
25|$|The book {{is noted}} for its {{colorful}} description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about 20 years before the work was published, Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.|$|E
25|$|Mark Twain was a {{self-described}} fan of Moore (though {{not for the}} reasons Moore would have liked). Twain alluded to her work in Following the Equator, and it is widely assumed that Moore served as a literary model for the character of Emmeline Grangerford in Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Twain's {{next major}} {{publication}} was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which draws on his youth in Hannibal. Tom Sawyer was modeled on Twain as a child, with traces of schoolmates John Briggs and Will Bowen. The book also introduces <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> in a supporting role, based on Twain's boyhood friend Tom Blankenship.|$|E
25|$|Twain wrote many of {{his classic}} novels during his 17 years in Hartford (1874–1891) and over 20 summers at Quarry Farm. They include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), The Prince and the Pauper (1881), Life on the Mississippi (1883), Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> (1885), and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).|$|E
25|$|Twain {{began his}} career writing light, humorous verse, but he became a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies, and murderous acts of mankind. At mid-career, he {{combined}} rich humor, sturdy narrative, and social criticism in <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn.</b> He was a master of rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive American literature built on American themes and language.|$|E
25|$|Ōe's {{next phase}} {{moved away from}} sexual content, {{shifting}} this time toward the violent fringes of society. The works which he published between 1961 and 1964 are influenced by existentialism and picaresque literature, populated with more or less criminal rogues and anti-heroes whose position {{on the fringes of}} society allows them to make pointed criticisms of it. Ōe's admission that Mark Twain's <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> is his favorite book can be said to find a context in this period.|$|E
25|$|Mitchell's first {{professional}} stage role was <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> in a 1985 Organic Theater adaptation at Chicago's Goodman Theatre. His first New York acting role was Huck Finn in the Broadway musical Big River (1985). He originated {{the role of}} Dickon on Broadway in The Secret Garden, and appeared in the original cast of the Off Broadway musical Hello Again. He received Drama Desk nominations for both roles, and can be heard on the original cast recordings for each.|$|E
25|$|The Prince and the Pauper {{was not as}} well received, {{despite a}} storyline that is common in film and {{literature}} today. The book {{tells the story of}} two boys born on the same day who are physically identical, acting as a social commentary as the prince and pauper switch places. Twain had started Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> (which he consistently had problems completing) and had completed his travel book A Tramp Abroad, which describes his travels through central and southern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Missouri is {{the native}} state of Mark Twain. His novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> {{are set in}} his boyhood {{hometown}} of Hannibal. Authors Kate Chopin, T. S. Eliot and Tennessee Williams were from St. Louis. Kansas City-born writer William Least Heat-Moon resides in Rocheport. He {{is best known for}} Blue Highways, a chronicle of his travels to small towns across America, which was on the New York Times Bestseller list for 42 weeks in 1982–1983.|$|E
25|$|Demand for {{the book}} spread outside of the United States. Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> was {{eventually}} published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States. The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble's picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps' groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.|$|E
25|$|Mark Twain (the pen name used by Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835–1910) was {{the first}} major American writer to be born away from the East Coast – in the border state of Missouri. His {{regional}} masterpieces were the memoir Life on the Mississippi and the novels Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn.</b> Twain's style – influenced by journalism, wedded to the vernacular, direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous – changed the way Americans write their language. His characters speak like real people and sound distinctively American, using local dialects, newly invented words, and regional accents.|$|E
25|$|In The Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> Tom {{is only a}} minor {{character}} and {{is used as a}} foil for Huck, particularly in the later chapters of the novel after Huck makes his way to Uncle Phelps's plantation. Tom's immaturity, imagination, and obsession with stories put Huck's planned rescue of the runaway slave Jim in great jeopardy — and ultimately make it unnecessary, since he knows Jim's owner has died and freed him in her will. Throughout the novel, Huck's intellectual and emotional development is a central theme, and by re-introducing a character from the beginning (Tom), Twain is able to highlight this evolution in Huck's character.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{invested}} heavily in the typesetting machine invented by James W. Paige. He also formed the firm Charles L. Webster & Company which published his writings, along with Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs. Its first publication was Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> in 1884. The company went bankrupt in 1894, leaving Twain with {{a large amount of}} debt; Paige's typesetting machine never functioned properly and was overcome by competition from the linotype machine developed by Whitlaw Reid. The losses from these investments as well as several bank panics led the Clemens family to move to Europe in 1891 where the cost of living was more affordable. He began lecturing across the continent to recoup some money for their family.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of modern}} {{scholarship}} of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn</b> {{has focused on}} its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars {{have argued that the}} book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism. Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim. According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Amanda Palmer, singer/pianist of the 'Brechtian Punk Cabaret' duo The Dresden Dolls, has Kurt Weill's name on {{the front}} of her {{keyboard}} (a pun with the name of the instrument maker Kurzweil) as a tribute to the composer. In 1991, seminal Swiss Industrial music band The Young Gods released their album of Kurt Weill songs, The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill. Weill was also often cited as an influence on Goldfrapp's Felt Mountain. In 2008, Weill's songs were performed by Canadian musicians (including Sarah Slean and Mary Margaret O'Hara) in a tribute concert as part of the first annual Canwest Cabaret Festival in Toronto. In 2009 Duke Special released an EP, <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> of five songs from an unfinished musical by Kurt Weill based on the novel by Mark Twain.|$|E
25|$|Expanding his horizons he {{went into}} {{producing}} his own shows and often {{had more than one}} tour going on at the same time. He wanted to move on from his circus clowning and reinvented himself as a gentleman. He started to take up politics and would often have Democratic undertones in his shows. He was then regarded as not only a multi-talented performer, but a smart and noble man who was to be looked up to. He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists including that of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. Mark Twain paid him homage in his description of a circus in <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> and it is likely a boyhood Twain actually saw Rice perform when his circus came to Hannibal for a show.|$|E
25|$|When he was four, Twain's {{family moved}} to Hannibal, Missouri, a port town on the Mississippi River that {{inspired}} the fictional town of St.Petersburg in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and the Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn.</b> Slavery was legal in Missouri at the time, {{and it became a}} theme in these writings. His father was an attorney and judge, who died of pneumonia in 1847, when Twain was 11. The next year, Twain left school after the fifth grade to become a printer's apprentice. In 1851 he began working as a typesetter, contributing articles and humorous sketches to the Hannibal Journal, a newspaper that Orion owned. When he was 18, he left Hannibal and worked as a printer in New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, joining the newly formed International Typographical Union, the printers trade union. He educated himself in public libraries in the evenings, finding wider information than at a conventional school.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the Toronto visits was to secure Canadian and British {{copyrights}} for his upcoming book Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> {{to which he had}} alluded in his Montreal visit. The {{reason for the}} Ottawa visit had been to secure Canadian and British copyrights for Life on the Mississippi. Publishers in Toronto had printed unauthorized editions of his books at the time, before an international copyright agreement was established in 1891. These were sold in the United States as well as in Canada, depriving him of royalties. He estimated that Belford Brothers' edition of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer alone had cost him ten thousand dollars. He had unsuccessfully attempted to secure the rights for The Prince and the Pauper in 1881, in conjunction with his Montreal trip. Eventually, he received legal advice to register a copyright in Canada (for both Canada and Britain) prior to publishing in the United States, which would restrain the Canadian publishers from printing a version when the American edition was published. There was a requirement that a copyright be registered to a Canadian resident; he addressed this by his short visits to the country.|$|E

The second segment shows Lisa as Connie Appleseed, a female version of the American pioneer nurseryman Johnny Appleseed who introduced apple trees to large parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. [...] "Tom and Huck" [...] features Bart as Tom Sawyer and Nelson as <b>Huckleberry</b> <b>Finn,</b> both of whom are characters in Mark Twain's 1876 novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
