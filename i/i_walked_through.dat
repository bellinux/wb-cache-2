500|$|Years {{later as}} {{an elderly man}} {{near the end of}} his life, Marques de Sousa would fondly recall his advancement: [...] "Never in my life had I judged myself so great, nor {{experienced}} such ineffable rejoicing... as in the day I placed my fists into the cuffs of alferes. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> all the streets of the city, looking at myself, conceited, believing that everyone looking with admiration envied my luck, that all enamored ladies vied for my hand." [...] For the remainder of the conflict he was stationed in the defense of Montevideo. The conquest of the Banda Oriental was ended in July 1821, when Portugal declared it a province of Brazil with the name of Cisplatina.|$|E

She also says that living overseas for most of her life has made her a foreigner in the US. She said, [...] "I'm scared to walk through Harlem... more scared than you, because if <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> Harlem with the weird shoes and the weird accent, I'd get my butt kicked faster than you.

2500|$|The actress Lucy Speed – {{seventeen}} at {{the time}} – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, {{they thought it was}} the quality they were looking for…Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the door. So I got the part.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E

60|$|Kite and {{revolver}} {{had gone}} now, {{and all my}} hot and narrow past, its last vestiges had shriveled and vanished in the whirling gusts of the Beltane fires.

60|$|I can {{remember}} that as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the fields {{the grass was}} damp with the rain of the morning, {{and the air was}} heavy with the smell of the fresh-turned earth.
