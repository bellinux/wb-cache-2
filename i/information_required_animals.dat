40|$|The {{olfactory}} system in rodents serves a critical function in social, reproductive, and survival behaviors. Processing of chemosensory signals {{in the brain}} is dynamically regulated in part by an animal's physiological state. We previously reported that type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M 3 -Rs) physically interact with odorant receptors (ORs) to promote odor-induced responses in a heterologous expression system. However, {{it is not known}} how M 3 -Rs affect the ability of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to respond to odors. Here, we show that an M 3 -R antagonist attenuates odor-induced responses in OSNs from wild-type, but not M 3 -R-null mice. Using a novel molecular assay, we demonstrate that the activation of M 3 -Rs inhibits the recruitment of β-arrestin- 2 to ORs, resulting in a potentiation of odor-induced response in OSNs. These results suggest a role for acetylcholine in modulating olfactory processing at the initial stages of signal transduction in the {{olfactory system}}. The olfactory system allows animals to interact with their environment and respond to signals of predation, mating, and feeding. The type of olfactory <b>information</b> <b>animals</b> <b>require</b> drastically differs depending on their behavioral state, for example, during hunting, mate...|$|R

40|$|Creative {{problem solving}} and {{innovative}} tool use in animals are often seen as indicators of advanced intelligence because they seem to imply causal reasoning abilities [1]. However, complex behavior can also arise from relatively simple mechanisms [2, 3], and the cognitive operations underlying seemingly "insightful" behavior are rarely examined [4]. By controlling and varying prior experience, {{it is possible to}} determine the minimum <b>information</b> <b>animals</b> <b>require</b> to solve a given problem [5]. We investigated how pretesting experience affects the performance of New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) when facing a novel problem. The task (developed by Bird and Emery [6]) required dropping stones into a vertical tube to collapse an out-of-reach platform in a transparent box and release a food reward. After establishing that the birds had no preexisting tendency to drop stones into holes, subjects were assigned to two experimental groups that were given different kinds of experience with the affordances of the apparatus. Crows that had learned about the mechanism (collapsibility) of the platform without the use of stones passed the task, just like the subjects that had previously been trained to drop stones. This demonstrates that successful innovation was also possible after acquaintance with just the functional properties of the task...|$|R
