500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} {{myself from}} my previous letters when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> {{about taking a}} 'break'. What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ... It's cool when you look at someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E
500|$|Irene Kacandes, {{professor}} of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Dartmouth College, calls Rosa's internal monologues apostrophes, or [...] "intrapsychic witnessing", in which [...] "a character {{witnesses to the}} self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes {{she would not be}} able to internalise anything if she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, [...] "If you knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says [...] "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{biography}} Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness, written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early {{attachment to the}} story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, [...] "He was so real that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him." [...] Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of Ebony magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character: ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about when I wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|During the October 15, 1973 session, drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens {{contributed to}} the tracks [...] "Peace Go with You", [...] "Rivers of My Fathers", [...] "Back Home", and [...] "The Bottle". Adams, however, was {{disappointed}} that [...] "H²Ogate Blues" [...] was to be left off the album. The song originally served as an opening monologue concerning the Watergate incident used by Scott-Heron at his concerts, and it contains proto-rap and talking blues elements, in which rhythmic speech or near-speech {{is accompanied by a}} free melody and strict rhythm. The studio version, which was recorded during the album's sessions, was not intended to be for the album prior to Adams' objection, as Scott-Heron said that [...] "nobody outside of Washington seemed to know what the hell <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about." [...] Scott-Heron later revisited the experience in the liner notes of the album's 1998 reissue. On Adams' opinion of [...] "H²Ogate Blues", he wrote that [...] "His reply was that even if people didn’t understand the politics it’s still funny as hell." [...] On the recording, Scott-Heron stated: ...|$|E
500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

500|$|Abrams {{contacted}} Pegg by e-mail, {{offering him}} the part. To achieve Scotty's accent, Pegg was assisted {{by his wife}} Maureen, who is from Glasgow, although Pegg said that Scotty was from Linlithgow and that he therefore wanted his accent to sound more East Coast Scottish. As a result, the accent he used {{is a mixture of}} both, although it leans more towards the West sound. He was also aided by James Doohan's son, Chris, and Tommy Gormley, the film's Glaswegian first assistant director. Pegg described Scotty as a positive Scottish stereotype, noting [...] "Scots are the first people to laugh at the fact that they drink and fight a bit", and that Scotty comes {{from a long line of}} Scots with technical expertise, such as John Logie Baird and Alexander Graham Bell. Years before, Pegg's character on Spaced joked that every odd-numbered Star Trek film being [...] "shit" [...] was a fact of life. Pegg noted [...] "Fate put me in the movie to show me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> out of my ass." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

They do have a nuclear capability. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about their total nuclear capability." ...|$|E

What {{we want to do}} – and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with a number of senators today – is to try to get some of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about what I have to tell myself {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really is frightening to step out and do something different.

2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for {{young men and women}} who want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 September 2006, Habibie {{explained}} to reporters {{that far from}} dismissing Singapore in 1998, he had meant to highlight Singapore's achievements despite its small size.

He said that he had told them: [...] "If you look at the map of South-east Asia, you [...] are so big, and Singapore is just a dot. But if you come to Singapore, you see people with vision."

2500|$|Ever since 1986, it {{is common}} for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona's name as a token of recognition, even in remote places. The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England. In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms {{reserved}} for legends. In the Argentine film El Hijo de la Novia ("Son of the Bride"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron, [...] "They idolized him and then crucified him." [...] When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about Maradona." [...] He is the subject of the film El Camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. [...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about him, but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{has been}} a lifelong {{supporter}} of Accrington Stanley F.C., and played for them during the 1960s.

He stated to the Accrington Observer that [...] "I love football and always have. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Eric Whalley about it the other day and he said he wanted to sell and I wish I could afford to buy the club off him.
