40|$|I {{consider}} the non-equilibrium DC transport of electrons through a quantum {{system with a}} thermoelectric response. This system may be any nanostructure or molecule modeled by the nonlinear scattering theory which includes Hartree-like electrostatic interactions exactly, and certain dynamic interaction effects (decoherence and relaxation) phenomenologically. This theory {{is believed to be}} a reasonable model when single-electron charging effects are negligible. I derive three fundamental bounds for such quantum systems coupled to multiple macroscopic reservoirs, one of which may be superconducting. These bounds affect nonlinear heating (such as Joule heating), work and entropy production. Two bounds correspond to the first law and second law of thermodynamics in classical physics. The third bound is quantum (wavelength dependent), and {{is as important as the}} thermodynamic ones in limiting the capabilities of mesoscopic <b>heat-engines</b> and refrigerators. The quantum bound also leads to Nernst's unattainability principle that the quantum system cannot cool a reservoir to absolute zero in a finite time, although it can get exponentially close.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear scattering theory for quantum systems with strong Seebeck and Peltier effects, and consider their use as <b>heat-engines</b> and refrigerators with finite power outputs. This article gives detailed derivations {{of the results}} summarized in Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 130601 (2014). It shows {{how to use the}} scattering theory to find (i) the quantum thermoelectric with maximum possible power output, and (ii) the quantum thermoelectric with maximum efficiency at given power output. The latter corresponds to a minimal entropy production at that power output. These quantities are of quantum origin since they depend on system size over electronic wavelength, and so have no analogue in classical thermodynamics. The maximal efficiency coincides with Carnot efficiency at zero power output, but decreases with increasing power output. This gives a fundamental lower bound on entropy production, which means that reversibility (in the thermodynamic sense) is impossible for finite power output. The suppression of efficiency by (nonlinear) phonon and photon effects is addressed in detail; when these effects are strong, maximum efficiency coincides with maximum power. Finally, we show in particular limits (typically without magnetic fields) that relaxation within the quantum system does not allow the system to exceed the bounds derived for relaxation-free systems, however, a general proof of this remains elusive.

2500|$|The French {{mathematician}} Lazare Carnot {{proposed in}} his 1803 paper Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement {{that in any}} machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of moment of activity. In other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son Sadi Carnot published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire which posited that in all <b>heat-engines,</b> whenever [...] "caloric" [...] (what {{is now known as}} heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He made the analogy with that of how water falls in a water wheel. This was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th century [...] "Newtonian hypothesis" [...] that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of Count Rumford who showed (1789) that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined. Carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state {{at the end of a}} complete engine cycle, that [...] "no change occurs in the condition of the working body".|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of heat to work {{conversion}} has been re-invigorated by nanotechnology. Steady-state devices do this conversion without any macroscopic moving parts, through steady-state flows of microscopic particles such as electrons, photons, phonons, etc. This review aims to introduce some of the theories used to describe these steady-state flows {{in a variety of}} mesoscopic or nanoscale systems. These theories are introduced in the context of idealized machines which convert heat into electrical power (<b>heat-engines)</b> or convert electrical power into a heat flow (refrigerators). In this sense, the machines could be categorized as thermoelectrics, although this should be understood to include photovoltaics when the heat source is the sun. As quantum mechanics is important for most such machines, they fall into the field of quantum thermodynamics. In many cases, the machines we consider have few degrees of freedom, however the reservoirs of heat and work that they interact with are assumed to be macroscopic. This review discusses different theories which can take into account different aspects of mesoscopic and nanoscale physics, such as coherent quantum transport, magnetic-field induced effects (including topological ones such as the quantum Hall effect), and single electron charging effects. It discusses the efficiency of thermoelectric conversion, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. More specifically, the theories presented are (i) linear response theory with or without magnetic fields, (ii) Landauer scattering theory in the linear response regime and far from equilibrium, (iii) Green-Kubo formula for strongly interacting systems within the linear response regime, (iv) rate equation analysis for small quantum machines with or without [...] .

40|$|Based on a {{model of}} a two-heat-reservoir <b>heat-engine</b> cycle with a finite {{high-temperature}} source and bypass heat-leak, in which the maximum work output can be obtained under a given cycle time is determined with the considerations of heat-leak, finite heat-capacity high-temperature source and infinite heat-capacity low-temperature heat-sink with another linear heat-transfer law QÂ [is proportional to]Â [Delta](T- 1). The <b>heat-engine</b> cycles considered are: (1) infinite low-and high-temperature reservoirs without heat-leak; (2) infinite low- and high-temperature reservoirs with heat-leak; (3) finite high-temperature source and infinite low-temperature sink without heat-leak and (4) finite high-temperature source and infinite low-temperature sink with heat-leak. It is assumed that the heat-transfer between the working fluid and the reservoirs obeys another linear heat-transfer law, i. e., the linear phenomenological heat-transfer law, QÂ [is proportional to]Â [Delta](T- 1). It is shown that the existence of heat-leak does not affect the configuration of a cycle with an infinite high-temperature source. The finite heat-capacity of the high-temperature source without heat-leak makes the cycle a generalized Carnot <b>heat-engine</b> cycle. There exists a great difference of the cycle configurations for the finite high-temperature source with heat-leak and the former three cases.

This study extends the recent flurry of publications in <b>heat-engine</b> efficiency under the maximum power condition by incorporating the optima of heat conductance and heat capacitance ratios. While maximizing the instantaneous power output, it is shown that there is an optimum balance between the sizes of heat exchangers, between the heat capacity rates of heating and cooling fluid as well as temperature differences between the engine and thermal reservoirs. The results indicate that power output increases significantly with the increase in heat capacity rate of the heating fluid, but the thermal efficiency at maximum power remains constant. The effects of thermal conductance of the hot-side heat-exchanger on the power output and thermal efficiency are insignificant.
