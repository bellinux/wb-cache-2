5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E

5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's lure did {{not stop}} at that. On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent to the}} Allied {{headquarters}} at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> occupy the Heights.|$|E

Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|The Victoria Cross for New Zealand (VC) is a {{military}} decoration awarded for valour or gallantry {{in the presence of}} the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> members of the New Zealand Armed Forces. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the Governor-General of New Zealand during an investiture held at Government House, Wellington. As the highest award for gallantry in New Zealand it takes precedence over all other postnominals and medals.|$|E
5|$|To make it {{difficult}} for the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> track him he changed course frequently. Ranger operations depended on surprise, but it had clearly been lost. The clouds were thinning out and visibility was improving. Braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home. While flying over Funen island he spotted a building with a big Swastika flag draped from a pole. A car was parked outside the entrance. Believing it might contain someone of importance, he dived to attack, strafing the building and destroyed the car.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} Procopius in the De Bello Gothico (the section of the De Bellis regarding the Gothic War), Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, {{which may have been}} voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of Calluc, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the loss to the Gepids of Dacia ripensis (Serbia) and Singidunum (Belgrade). Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> set them against in the Lombards.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E

5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner now {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} French. Being impatient, {{he did not}} wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the French back and not give them time to construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted heavy losses on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of friendly fire incidents were very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported heavy losses during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed.|$|E

5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an <b>enemy</b> <b>to</b> cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. In the bag is an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E
