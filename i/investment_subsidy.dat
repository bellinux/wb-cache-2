25|$|Financing and Subsidies Urban {{water and}} {{sanitation}} systems do not receive direct subsidies and are financed through the capital market, and ultimately through user fees. However, Chile has an innovative system of means-tested subsidies that allows qualifying poor households to receive a subsidy administered by the municipalities to pay parts of their {{water and sanitation}} bills. Rural water systems receive a partial <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> that is defined in the Ley del Subsidio al Agua Potable y Saneamiento. By law, the subsidy can cover 25-85 percent of a household's water and sewer bill up to 15m³ per month. The client pays {{the rest of the}} bill. Beyond 15m³, households are charged full price. The subsidy is meant to target only those households that are unable to buy water at a subsistence level and is based on willingness to pay. In 1998, about 13% of households benefited at a level of ~$10 per month. The total cost of the program in 1998 was US $36million. Opponents argue this subsidy program can act as a regressive policy and actually hurt the poor because a false assumption is made that high consumption is positively correlated to high income. On the contrary, poor families {{do not have access to}} efficient methods of using water in cooking, cleaning, and washing.|$|E

Due to a cap on the tariffs, the development ofPV in Austria remained quite low, with a market below 100 MW until 2011. With 176 MW in 2012 and 263 MW in 2013, the market progressed faster. Off-grid development amounted to 0,5 MW installed in 2013. Systems below 5 kW are incentivized through a financial incentive that can be increased for BIPV installations. Above 5 kW, the Green Electricity Act provides a FiT that was reduced in 2013. The FiT is guaranteed during 13 years and financed by a contribution of electricity consumers. Some financial grants can be added for specific buildings. In addition to federal incentives, most provinces are providing additional incentives through investment subsidies.

The data set comprises 3, 423 projects that were granted public <b>investment</b> <b>subsidies</b> between 2001 and 2003.

The literature generally suggests {{the use of an}} <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> rather than a reduced tax rate. However, this study shows that, depending on the degree of present-biasedness, it may be more advantageous for the government to set a lower tax rate. The government, in fact, when selecting the instrument to be used for speeding up investment, trades off the immediate and certain cost of a subsidy against the random tax revenues accruing from the investment. Hence, from the short-sighted perspective of current government, a lower tax rate may appear optimal as long as the consideration given to the earnings of future governments is small and/or the current government’s duration is short...|$|E

40|$|Improved energy {{efficiency}} and greenhouse gas mitigation could be achieved by replacing resistance heaters with district heating system. In 2005, only about 8 % of the Swedish detached houses had district heating system. The expansion of such systems largely depends on homeowners' adoption decisions. And, to motivate homeowners to adopt district heating, {{it is essential to}} understand their decision-making process. In this context, in June 2005 we carried out a questionnaire survey of about 700 homeowners who lived in the city of Östersund in houses with resistance heaters (baseline survey). About 84 % of the respondents did not intend to install a new heating system. Since then these homeowners were influenced by (a) an <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> by the Swedish government to replace resistance heaters with district heating, a brine/water-based heat pump, or a biomass-based heating system and (b) a marketing campaign by the municipality-owned district heating company. This paper analyses how these two measures influenced about 78 % of the homeowners to adopt the district heating system. For this purpose we carried out a follow-up survey of the same homeowners in December 2006 (resurvey). Results showed that the <b>investment</b> <b>subsidy</b> and the marketing campaign created a need among the homeowners to adopt a new heating system.
