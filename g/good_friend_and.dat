5|$|Even Larsson's <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> biographist Georg Nordensvan {{joined the}} critics, {{but he could}} not sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest.

The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E
