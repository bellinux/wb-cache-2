5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an <b>electrical</b> <b>relay</b> station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
25|$|The Z2 {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of an electromechanical relay computer, and was created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939.

25|$|On 8 May 1985, Reyat {{bought a}} Micronta digital {{automobile}} clock at the Radio Shack store in Duncan. Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, {{it could also}} be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer, but he returned a week later for an <b>electrical</b> <b>relay</b> after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls between Parmar's residence in Vancouver and Reyat from either his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island that month, which got Reyat added to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003 when at first {{he said he did not}} know what three clocks he had bought could be used for. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. In that case, the relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a blasting cap which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives such as dynamite.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dawn of the}} {{electrical}} age brought many innovative and advanced control systems. As early as the 1920s two aspects of engineering, control theory and control systems, converged to make large-scale integrated systems possible. In those early days controls systems were commonly used in the industrial environment. Large process facilities started using process controllers for regulating continuous variables such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate. <b>Electrical</b> <b>relays</b> built into ladder-like networks {{were one of the}} first discrete control devices to automate an entire manufacturing process.|$|R

50|$|High voltage {{interface}} relays, a.k.a., interface relays: or coupling relays or insulating interfaces is {{a special}} class of <b>electrical</b> <b>relays</b> designed to provide informational and electrical compatibility between functional components isolated {{from each other and}} not allowing for a direct connection due to a high difference of potentials. A common design principle of these devices {{is a special}} galvanic isolation module between the input (control) and the output (switching) circuits of the relay. Interface relays are widely used in control and protection systems of high voltage (10-100 kV) electronic and electrophysical equipment and in high power installations.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{difficulties}} associated with multivariable, non-linear control systems {{is the problem}} of assessing closed-loop stability. Of particular interest is the class of non-linear systems controlled with on/off actuators, such as spacecraft thrusters or <b>electrical</b> <b>relays.</b> With such systems, standard describing function techniques are typically too conservative, and time-domain simulation analysis is prohibitively extensive, This paper presents an open-loop analysis technique for this class of non-linear systems. The technique is centered around an innovative use of multivariable signal transmission theory to quantify the plant response to worst case control commands. The technique has been applied to assess stability of thruster controlled flexible space structures. Examples are provided for Space Shuttle attitude control with attached flexible payloads...|$|R
25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which <b>electrical</b> <b>relays</b> engage <b>electrical</b> contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|R

There are many well-qualified engineers in the region, and firms in the republic produce a wide variety of devices, including controllers and regulators of technological processes, electronic drive equipment, circuit boards, aircraft electronics, medical equipment, and textile machinery.

5000|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{features}} of early Youth for Christ Bible quizzing was {{the challenge to}} participants to jump to their feet from a sitting position to win the right to answer each question.
