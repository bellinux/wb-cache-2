50|$|Since its introduction, {{the chair}} {{has been in}} {{continuous}} production by Herman Miller in America. Later, Vitra (in cooperation with the German furniture company Fritz Becker KG) began producing the chair for the European market. It was licensed in the UK for 10 years to Hille International LTD from 1957. Immediately following its release, other furniture companies began to copy the chair's design. Some made <b>direct</b> <b>copies,</b> others were merely 'influenced' by the design. Most notably the former Plycraft Company issued dozens of chairs that were <b>direct</b> <b>copies</b> of or in-the-style-of the Eames 670. Later Chinese and European companies began making <b>direct</b> <b>copies.</b> However, Herman Miller and Vitra remain the only two companies to produce these chairs with the Eames name attached.|$|R

25|$|After the {{formation}} of the People's Republic of China (the PRC) in 1949, the Soviet Union sent many T-34s and T-34-85s to the PRC's People's Liberation Army (the PLA). The T-34s were phased out by the end of 1960, while the T-34-85 was put into production locally by the PRC and was known as the Type 58 medium tank, although the production of the Type 58 was ended soon after once the PRC received T-54 main battle tanks from the Soviet Union and began to build the Type 59 tank, which was a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of the T-54.|$|E

Perhaps most intriguingly, many of her ideas were represented in various sections of the Encyclopédie of Diderot and D'Alembert, {{and some of the}} articles in the Encyclopédie are a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of her work (this is an active area of current academic research - the latest research can be found at , a Duke University research initiative).|$|E

25|$|The London tablet {{contains}} {{the text of}} the first seven lines of the Small Santiago tablet, although as a paraphrase rather than a <b>direct</b> <b>copy.</b> Because of the frequent repetition of glyph 380.1, which he interpreted as a tangata rongorongo (rongorongo chanter) with a kouhau (staff), Barthel (1958:310) believed K was a catalog of other kohau rongorongo texts. Fischer also believes it to be a list of some kind, and notes that the simplicity of the repeated glyph on this recent tablet, compared to 380.1+3 of G and 380.1+52 of N, suggests a compositional simplification over time. However, the two patterns are mixed on some tablets.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 2005 Australia {{defeated}} New Zealand in {{the first}} men's full international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also sported moustaches/beards and hair styles popular in the 1980s {{taking part in a}} competition amongst themselves for best retro look, {{at the request of the}} Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and umpires took things less seriously – Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card (red cards are not normally used in cricket) in response.|$|E

Features Digital Research removed from GEM {{as a result of}} the lawsuit included disk drive icons on the desktop, movable and resizable windows in the file manager, shading in the title bars, and window open/close animations. In addition, visual elements including the scrollbar thumbs and the window close button were changed to be less similar to those in the Mac GUI.|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} to stop {{the success of the}} former company salesman, Ellwood and Washburn-Moen filed for an {{injunction}} to stop the business of Southern Wire Company. The suit, filed in U. S. District Court, claimed the machines Gates and Clifford used in the production of their product were a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of those used by Washburn-Moen. [...] The suit also called for Gates and Clifford to pay US$100,000 in damages to the company. As they avoided process servers, Gates and Clifford made a plan to save their company. [...] They were able to rent a building in East St. Louis, Illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark. [...] After they crossed the Mississippi River, the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the St. Louis U. S. District Court and were back in business the next day. When Clifford and Gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court, the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by Southern Wire Company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by Ellwood and Washburn-Moen.|$|E
500|$|Brabham cars competed at the Indianapolis 500 {{from the}} mid-1960s {{to the early}} 1970s. After an {{abortive}} project in 1962, MRD was commissioned in 1964 to build an Indycar chassis powered by an American Offenhauser engine. The resultant BT12 chassis was raced by Jack Brabham as the [...] "Zink-Urschel Trackburner" [...] at the 1964 event and retired with a fuel tank problem. The car was entered again in 1966, taking a third place for Jim McElreath. From 1968 to 1970, Brabham returned to Indianapolis, at first with a 4.2-litre version of the Repco V8 the team used in Formula One—with which Peter Revson finished fifth in 1969—before reverting to the Offenhauser engine for 1970. The Brabham-Offenhauser combination was entered again in 1971 by J.C. Agajanian, finishing fifth {{in the hands of}} Bill Vukovich II. Although no Brabham car ever won at Indianapolis, McElreath won four United States Automobile Club (USAC) races over 1965 and 1966 in the BT12. The [...] "Dean Van Lines Special" [...] in which Mario Andretti won the 1965 USAC national championship was a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of this car, made with permission from Brabham by Andretti's crew chief Clint Brawner. Revson took Brabham's final USAC race win in a BT25 in 1969, using the Repco engine.|$|E
500|$|The first family, [...] "α", {{takes its}} name from a now-lost source and {{includes}} manuscripts G and L. G, dating from the late 10th to the 11th century, was found at the monastery of Gembloux in Brabant, in modern-day Belgium; L, from the library of Leipzig, was probably written around the mid-11th century and has many corrections made by a scribe. Housman argues that L is the superior of the two, as it was probably copied straight from α, whereas G was probably derived from a copy of a copy. The second family, [...] "β", takes {{its name from}} the now-lost archetype and includes manuscript M, which itself is a direct descendant of the manuscript that Poggio Bracciolini rediscovered near Constance during a break in the Council of Constance c.141617 (i.e. the aforementioned manuscript β). M had been transcribed by a German amanuensis on Bracciolini's request, but due to the scribe's incompetence the resultant manuscript was riddled with mistakes, prompting Bracciolini to sarcastically remark that the new copy had to be [...] "divined rather than read" [...] (divinare oportet non legere). Although poorly written, M has been singled out as possibly the most important surviving manuscript, because it is apparently a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of the archetype (β), whereas G and L are derived from a different copy (α) of the archetype.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{establishment}} of the Australian Air Board on 9November 1920, Williams and his fellow AAC officers dropped their army ranks in favour of those based on the Royal Air Force. Williams, now a wing commander, personally compiled and tabled the Air Board's submissions to create the Australian Air Force (AAF), a service independent of both the Army and the Royal Australian Navy. Though {{the heads of the}} Army and Navy opposed the creation of an independent air arm for fear that they would be unable to find air cover for their operations, support from Prime Minister Billy Hughes, as well as prominent parliamentary figures including Treasurer Joseph Cook and Defence Minister George Pearce allowed the proposal to succeed. The AAF was duly formed on 31March 1921; Williams deliberately chose this day rather than 1 April, the founding date of the RAF three years earlier, [...] "to prevent nasty people referring to us as 'April Fools'". The [...] "Royal" [...] prefix was added five months later. Williams proposed an ensign for the AAF in July 1921, based on the Royal Air Force flag but featuring the five stars of the Southern Cross within the RAF roundel and the Commonwealth Star in the lower hoist quarter. This design was not adopted for the RAAF, the government employing instead a <b>direct</b> <b>copy</b> of the RAF ensign until 1949, when a new design using the stars of the Australian Flag was chosen.|$|E

D. C. Parker rehearsed Lake's views who thought 209 to have been the parent of 205, and then Parker rehearses Josef Schmid's (1956) views who considered 2866 and 205 to be daughters of 209's lost sister.|$|E
