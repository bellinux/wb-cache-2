When one worked something on their computer and wanted to do something with their work, pressing the <b>enter</b> <b>key</b> would do the command they ordered. Another function is to create a space for next paragraph. When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing.|$|E

25|$|Numeric {{keyboards}} contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} function keys. They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and <b>Enter</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the <b>enter</b> <b>key</b> is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E

500|$|It {{displays}} only {{in scientific}} notation, with a five digit mantissa and a two digit exponent, although a sixth digit of the mantissa was stored internally. Because {{of the way}} the processor was designed, it uses Reverse Polish notation (RPN) for inputting calculations. RPN meant that the difficult implementation of brackets, and the associated recursive logic, was not necessary to implement in the hardware, but the effort was instead offloaded to the user. Instead of an [...] "Equals" [...] button, there is an [...] "Enter" [...] button that tells the calculator when a value has been entered, and then the operators are entered in after the operands. For example, on some devices to evaluate [...] "(1+2) x 3", the sequence entered would be [...] "3 enter 2 enter 1 + x."
