5|$|As aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes Alcazar's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{war with}} {{neighbouring}} Nuevo Rico over the oil-rich Gran Chapo, and is framed as a traitor {{by the international}} oil and weapon companies. He escapes imprisonment {{with the aid of}} the mercenary Pablo; and decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbayas, in the hope that they can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish. From a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue.|$|E
5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge was a matter for Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced {{by the arrival of}} victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E
50|$|The Guns of August thus {{provides}} {{a narrative of}} the earliest stages of World War I, from the <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war, up until {{the start of the}} Franco-British offensive that stopped the German advance into France. The result was four years of trench warfare. In the course of her narrative Tuchman includes discussion of the plans, strategies, world events, and international sentiments before and during the war.|$|R
40|$|The cap on {{tuition fees}} {{will rise to}} £ 9, 000 in 2012. Gill Wyness reviews the {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} past fee increases on young people’s <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university and finds that tuition fees, grants and loans have all had limited impacts on participation which is determined more by prior educational attainment. However, current analytical modelling cannot adequately control for the rate of increase set to be ushered in next year and questions remain as to whether debt-aversion will significantly put off bright young people from poor backgrounds...|$|R

25|$|In April 2007, Wilkerson was {{featured}} in VPRO's Tegenlicht Dutch documentary The Israel Lobby. He said that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was highly influential in the Bush Administration's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war in Iraq. He also cited, as {{to the extent of}} their influence, an occasion in which he was threatened with censure when he criticized Israel in a lecture he was giving.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} in Italy was divided: former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was furious over Italy's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war against its former allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary. Giolitti claimed that Italy would fail in the war, predicting {{high numbers of}} mutinies, Austro-Hungarian occupation of even more Italian territory and that the failure would produce a catastrophic rebellion that would destroy the liberal-democratic monarchy and the liberal-democratic secular institutions of the state.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{allegations}} that <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war in Iraq were motivated {{at least partially}} by oil interests; for example, British newspaper The Independent reported that the [...] "Bush administration is heavily involved in writing Iraq's oil law" [...] which would [...] "allow Western oil companies contracts to pump oil out of Iraq up to 30 years, and the profits would be tax-free." [...] Whether motivated by it or not, U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East appears to much of the world as to be motivated by an oil rationale.|$|R

5000|$|Lindsay {{is known}} for his left wing {{political}} beliefs, usually describing himself as a staunch socialist, and has marched in the past in support of miners. He was a passionate supporter of the Labour Party. He was an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Tony Blair's <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war in Afghanistan and Iraq; he then stopped supporting Labour and stated that he was [...] "furious" [...] and now feels disillusioned with mainstream politics: [...] "You see those images of Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon, don't you? And I suspect somewhere, when he goes home at night and the kids are in bed, he must go, 'Jesus, what have I done?'" ...|$|R

25|$|The film's {{conclusion}} presents {{two different}} endings. One version shows Lilja being sent {{back in time}} after killing herself to when she made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Sweden with Andrei. However, this time she rejects Andrei's offer to go to Sweden, and she and Volodya are shown to presumably live happier lives. In the other ending, Lilya and Volodya are both angels happily playing basketball {{on the roof of}} a tenement building.|$|E
25|$|Clarke came to {{widespread}} public attention {{for his role}} as counter-terrorism czar in the Clinton and Bush administrations in March 2004, when he appeared on the 60 Minutes television news magazine, released his memoir about his service in government, Against All Enemies, and testified before the 9/11 Commission. In all three instances, Clarke was sharply critical of the Bush administration's attitude toward counter-terrorism before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and of the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with Iraq.|$|E

25|$|De Forest soon {{felt that}} Smythe and Freeman were holding him back, {{so in the}} fall of 1901 he made the bold <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> New York to compete {{directly}} with Marconi in transmitting race results for the International Yacht races. Marconi had already made arrangements to provide reports for the Associated Press, which he had successfully done for the 1899 contest.

25|$|Ritter {{went back}} to college in Oshkosh. While he was there, he read a geology {{textbook}} by Joseph LeConte, {{a professor at the}} University of California, Berkeley. Ritter was so impressed by the book, and its thoughtful, unbiased perspectives, that he made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the University of California and study with Joseph LeConte. He graduated with a teaching certificate from Oshkosh in 1884, and then moved to California to finish his BA at the University.|$|E
25|$|An audacious {{plan was}} {{formulated}} whose {{goal was to}} lay siege on the Sassanid capital city of Ctesiphon and definitively secure the eastern border. Yet the full motivation for this ambitious operation is, at best, unclear. There was no direct necessity for an invasion, as the Sassanids sent envoys {{in the hope of}} settling matters peacefully. Julian rejected this offer. Ammianus states that Julian longed for revenge on the Persians and that a certain desire for combat and glory also played a role in his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war.|$|E
50|$|For instance, in {{the theory}} of just war, the {{government}} of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the <b>decision</b> whether <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war is therefore a prudential judgment.|$|R

50|$|Fired: Alex Thomason - for not {{contributing}} {{much to the}} task, his five-week losing streak, {{and also}} for saying he had only lost once as Project Manager—Donald Trump viewed Alex's statement as dishonest {{because he has been}} a losing PM twice, although Alex claimed that he had forgotten about being project manager last week with Bren, as they had shared responsibilities on the task (but {{the fact that they were}} disorganized and lost that task badly didn't help Alex's case either). Tana was criticized for making some blatant <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Staten Island. However, although both Tana & Alex failed to mention at marketing in their sales segment, Tana brought up with numerous ideas and did most of the sales. Trump fired Alex instead for waiting Tana to make loads of mistakes from this task.|$|R
25|$|At the time, Zhou Yu was in Poyang Commandery (鄱陽郡; around present-day Poyang County, Jiangxi), so Lu Su advised Sun Quan {{to quickly}} recall Zhou back {{to discuss their}} plans on how to counter Cao Cao's {{impending}} invasion. When Zhou Yu returned, he also urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. This resulted in Sun Quan arriving at his final <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with Cao Cao. Sun Quan put Zhou Yu in command of his military forces and appointed Lu Su as Colonel Who Praises the Army (贊軍校尉) to assist Zhou Yu in formulating the battle plan.|$|E
25|$|Over 7,000 Canadian {{soldiers}} and support personnel {{were involved in}} the second Boer war from October 1899 to May 1902. With approximately 7,368 soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the Great War. Eventually, 270 soldiers died {{in the course of the}} Boer War. The Canadian public was initially divided on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many Anglophone citizens were pro-Empire, and wanted the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to support the British in their conflict. On the other hand, many Francophone citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British Imperialism to their national sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Another {{milestone}} {{was reached}} in the following year, when Stanford won the Pac-10 regular season, the first (of many) conference championships. They earned a two seed in the NCAA tournament, and played to their seed, losing to Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional Final. The pieces came together in 1990, with one key being Jennifer Azzi. The 1990 Final Four would be held in Knoxville, Tennessee. Azzi was from Oak Ridge, not far from Knoxville. VanDerveer had traveled to Knoxville in 1985, {{to try to persuade}} this potential star to play for Stanford. Azzi made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Stanford, and now, four years later, brought the team to her parents house after beating Arkansas in the West Regional, reaching their first Final Four and a trip to Knoxville.|$|E

40|$|Governments are {{aiming to}} expand the intake to higher education, so it is {{important}} to understand what motivates students to enter university and choose a particular programme. The aim of this study was to see whether a motivational orientation framework, developed to explain motivation to study, could also be applied to motivation to enrol in a selected university programme. Data were collected through individual open interviews with 36 undergraduate students at three universities in Hong Kong. Analysis used a grounded theory approach. The motivational orientation framework consists of six continua, labelled: compliance, individual goal setting, university lifestyle, sense of belonging, career and interest. It was possible to interpret data on <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university and to pick particular programmes with the framework. Students could be allocated to a position on each continuum, which then characterised their initial motivation for study. © 2010 Society for Research into Higher Education. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Pei Songzhi, who {{annotated}} Zhou Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi, {{commented that}} Lu Su {{was actually the}} first person who urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. Zhou Yu was at Poyang (鄱陽) before Sun Quan held the discussion with his subjects, and Lu Su suggested to Sun to recall Zhou back for the meeting. Zhou Yu and Lu Su gave similar advice to Sun Quan, which resulted in Sun arriving at his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with Cao Cao. Pei felt that it was unfair to Lu Su because Zhou Yu's biography gave full credit to Zhou for being the only person to urge Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao, and failed to mention that Lu Su had already advocated resisting Cao Cao before Zhou Yu did.|$|E
25|$|In late 208, the {{northern}} warlord Cao Cao {{launched a campaign}} aimed at wiping out opposing forces in southern China. He successfully pressured Liu Cong, who had succeeded Liu Biao as the Governor of Jing Province, into surrendering. A few months later, Cao Cao assembled a force of 800,000 at Jiangling (江陵; in present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), where countless warships and weapons were stored, and sent an envoy to intimidate Sun Quan to give up resistance. Sun Quan eventually hardened his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with Cao Cao after Lu Su and Zhou Yu convinced him. He then formed an alliance with another warlord, Liu Bei, to resist Cao Cao. Ling Tong, under Zhou Yu's command, participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs, in which the combined armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei dealt Cao Cao's massive fleet a crushing defeat at Wulin (烏林).|$|E
25|$|The sultan was {{the head}} of state and among his powers and {{responsibilities}} were issuing and enforcing specific legal orders and general rules, making the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war, levying taxes for armed campaigns, ensuring the proportionate distribution of food supplies throughout the sultanate and, in some cases, overseeing the investigation and punishment of alleged criminals. A Mamluk sultan or his appointees led the annual Hajj pilgrimage caravans from Cairo and Damascus in the capacity of amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan). Starting with Qalawun, the Mamluks also monopolized the tradition of providing the annual decorated covering of the Kaaba, in addition to patronizing Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. Another prerogative, at least of the early Bahri sultans, was to import as many mamluks as possible into the sultanate, preferring those who originated from the territories of the Mongols. However, the Mamluks' enemies, such as the Mongol powers and their Muslim vassals, the Armenians and the Crusaders, successfully disrupted the flow of mamluks into the sultanate. Unable to meet the military's need for new mamluks, the sultans often resorted to turning Ilkhanid deserters or prisoners of war into soldiers, sometimes while the war the prisoners were captured in was still ongoing.|$|E
