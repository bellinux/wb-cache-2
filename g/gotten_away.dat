Meanwhile, The Judge passes sentence on another victim—a slumlord whose negligence caused a tenant's death. Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team {{is called}} {{to the scene of}} a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has <b>gotten</b> <b>away.</b> They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is filled with the metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E

25|$|Hakim and Bet-Zuri {{ran out of}} the yard, {{jumped on}} their rented bicycles, and began {{pedaling}} down the street away from the scene. Major Hughes-Onslow rushed to the sentry box and raised the alarm. Hearing it, Hakim and Bet-Zuri turned onto a side street. They had very nearly <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> when an Egyptian motorcycle policeman, El-Amin Mahomed Abdullah, caught up to them. Hakim and Bet-Zuri were determined not to injure any Egyptians in their operation, and so did not attempt to shoot him off his motorcycle. Rather, Bet-Zuri fired a volley of warning shots in his direction, which he ignored. Abdullah then dismounted and ordered him to drop his weapon. Bet-Zuri attempted to shoot out the motorcycle's tires, but found that his pistol had run out of ammunition, and as he attempted to reload it, Abdullah fired, hitting Bet-Zuri in the chest. Hearing the commotion, Hakim turned back to help Bet-Zuri, and within minutes, another policeman appeared, and the two were placed under arrest.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Archduke John of Austria was assigned to command the army in the Tyrol and the Vorarlberg. He was directed to detach forces under Franz Jellacic and Franz Xavier von Auffenberg to the Danube army. Auffenberg's division was mauled at the Battle of Wertingen and later surrendered at the Battle of Ulm. Jellacic was required to guard the south flank of the Danube army near Lake Constance. Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps ran him to earth in the Vorarlberg. Jellacic surrendered with his infantry on 14 November in the Capitulation of Dornbirn, his cavalry having <b>gotten</b> <b>away.</b> Another brigade of the Tyrol army under Prince Louis Victor Rohan-Guéméné became separated in the retreat and slipped away to the south where it made a dash for Venice. On 24 November Rohan's 4,400 troops were caught between the divisions of Jean Reynier and Saint-Cyr at the Battle of Castelfranco Veneto and forced to surrender. John managed to escape to the east with about 20,000 soldiers and fought a successful rear guard action against Nicolas Bernard Guiot de Lacour's dragoons near the upper Isonzo at Bovec on 19 November 1805.|$|E

500|$|Criticism arose {{as soon as}} Coddington {{returned}} to Rhode Island with his commission. [...] In September 1651, William Arnold summed up the feelings {{of many of the}} Providence settlers when he wrote, [...] "Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Road Iland and Conimacuke Iland to himself, he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went under the name of Providence, because he have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> the greater part of that colonie." [...] Clarke voiced his opposition to Coddington's rule of the island, and he was commissioned as the island's agent to England on 15 October 1651. [...] The following month, he and William Dyer were sent to England to get the Coddington commission revoked. [...] Simultaneously, the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick sent Roger Williams on a similar errand, and the three men sailed for England in November 1651, just a few months after Clarke had been released from prison. [...] The men did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652 because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch.|$|E

500|$|Chief Wiggum's order {{during the}} suspect line-up to [...] "send in the clowns" [...] is {{an allusion to}} the Stephen Sondheim song [...] "Send in the Clowns" [...] from the 1973 musical A Little Night Music. The Sondheim musical took its name from Mozart's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, Eine kleine Nachtmusik, which is the theme tune to Sideshow Bob's show. The close up shot of Krusty's face behind bars in the {{beginning}} of act two is a reference of the closing credit motif of the British television series The Prisoner from the 1960s. The background music in that scene resembles the theme of the television series [...] at one point. The line [...] "The Day the Laughter Died", shown during the newscast, is a reference to the Andrew Dice Clay album released the previous month. Sideshow Bob is reading [...] by Alexander Dumas to the studio audience. [...] The song [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" [...] by Cole Porter is featured in the episode. Following Sideshow Bob's arrest, he mutters: [...] "I would've <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> with it too, if it weren't for these meddling kids.", which is a reference to a catchphrase from Hanna-Barbera's animated television show Scooby-Doo which was airing on ABC as A Pup Named Scooby-Doo when this episode aired.|$|E
500|$|Nikki and Paulo {{were killed}} off due to being disliked by much of Losts fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof {{admitted}} that the couple were [...] "universally despised" [...] by fans. Lindelof explained that [...] "back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had {{to clean up the}} mess." [...] The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006. It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast. Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive. Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia. Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro {{said in an interview with}} Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season. Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.|$|E
500|$|Aged thirteen, Mao left Shaoshan Primary School, {{pleased to}} have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> from {{what he saw as}} its oppressive atmosphere. The {{decision}} had been made by his father, who wanted Mao to devote his attentions to the family business by working on the farm and managing the financial accounts. However, relations between him and his father became increasingly strained. Mao continued to read in his free time, often staying up late at night in his bedroom to read by candle light; this angered his father, who saw recreational reading as an unproductive pursuit. At this point he read a book which inspired his interest in politics: Zheng Guanying's Sheng-shih Wei-yen ("Words of Warning to an Affluent Age"). Published in 1893, the book lamented the deterioration of Chinese power in East Asia, and argued for technological, economic and political reform, believing that China could be strengthed if it abandoned its absolute monarchy and politically modelling itself on the representative democracies and constitutional monarchies of the Western world. His political views were shaped by protests [...] led by the Gelaohui, or Elder Brother Society [...] which erupted following a famine in Hunanese capital Changsha; Mao supported the protesters' demands, but the armed forces suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders. The famine spread to Shaoshan, where starving peasants seized his father's grain; disapproving of their actions as morally wrong, Mao nevertheless claimed sympathy for their situation.|$|E
