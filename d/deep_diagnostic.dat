40|$|Even though {{lacking of}} solid {{experimental}} verifications, X-ray polarimetry is strongly {{established as a}} <b>deep</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tool for probing the emission mechanisms in astronomical sources of high energy radiation. The recent development of new, more efficient instrumentation, {{as well as the}} renewed interest of the theoreticians, has drawn a significant attention to the field. Particularly, the exploitation of the photoelectric effect for deriving polarization information seems to promise a great advance in sensitivity with respect to the conventional techniques. To this aim we have designed, produced and tested a CMOS VLSI array of 2101 pixels (with 80 pm pitch), to be directly used as the charge collecting anode of a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). Each pixel is fully covered by a hexagonal metal electrode and each of these electrodes is individually connected to a full electronics chain, built immediately below it; in this sense detector and read-out electronics become virtually the same thing. Even though we focus our attention on the polarimetric applications, our achievements are highly significant for the whole field of development of gas detectors, which for the first time reach the level of integration and resolution typical of solid state detectors...|$|E
40|$|In {{an era of}} {{unprecedented}} sensitivity to cosmic gamma rays, it is timely to study possible signatures rising from Dark Matter (DM) particle interactions. The aim of the present thesis is precisely devoted to that. We start by presenting a broad study on physically motivated Galactic diffuse emission models. These derive from the interaction of Galactic cosmic rays with the interstellar medium and describe the bulk of photons imprinted in the observed gamma-ray sky. We show how gamma-ray data offer a complementary <b>deep</b> <b>diagnostic</b> of the standard paradigm for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation, usually tuned on local cosmic-ray observables. We present a self-contained discussion about the inferred radial gradients in the gamma-ray data relative to the Galactic plane region, and interpret them as a strong hint {{in favor of a}} spatially varying diffusion rate for cosmic rays in the Galaxy. We corroborate this study with a set of distinctive predictions, embracing the available information on TeV high-energy photon data and the expectations for a detection of Galactic neutrino fluxes on the basis of current and future neutrino observatory sensitivities. We, then, scrutinize the claim of a gamma-ray signal from DM particle annihilation observed in the innermost central part of our Galaxy, analyzing the gamma-ray data coming from few tens of degrees around the Galactic center. We show that a spherical excess [...] interpretable as the annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles in the Galactic halo [...] does not stand out in the data any longer when the effect of the observationally inferred high star-formation rate in this complex astrophysical environment is considered. Accounting properly for that in the injection source distribution of cosmic rays, we show that most of the "GeV excess" has a simple explanation in terms of well-motivated cosmic-ray physics. We remark, in particular, that with this correction, counts in the residual map are not only drastically reduced, but also do not spatially correlate anymore with an approximately spherical morphology. Finally, we critically reassess the DM content in the satellites of the Milky Way. In order to do that, we develop a new method, mainly based on the kinematics of the stars in these galaxies, that in the end provides a conservative estimate of the line-of-sight integrated halo profile squared for these objects, the so-called J-factor. After carrying out in detail the study case of Ursa Minor, we present here [...] as last original contribution in the thesis [...] a similar conservative analysis of the J-factor for the whole set of classical satellites of the Milky Way. In light of our novel approach, we conclude that these galaxies offer to us a reliable "DM laboratory" where we can probe the freeze-out mechanism of cold thermal relics in a robust and unique way...|$|E

However, the biomedical application of NIR QDs was not satisfactory {{due to their}} toxicity. Ag 2 S QDs {{was reported to have}} negligible toxicity in organisms. Therefore, the appropriate narrow bandgap and low toxicity of Ag 2 S QDs facilitated them to be a promising contrast agent for fluorescence imaging. Here, a low toxicity, stable and highly luminescent NIR Ag 2 S QDs were prepared by one-step aqueous method using 2 -mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) as the coating layers. Emission wavelength of Ag 2 S QDs could be tuned between 780 and 950 nm. MTT assay results indicated that there was no significant biotoxicty for Ag 2 S QDs. These NIR QDs exhibited excellent biocompatibility in tumor cells. The cellular uptake and localization of Ag 2 S QDs was studied using laser confocal scanning microscopy.

We identify three dominant modes of SSS variability.

The third mode of SSS variability, {{which has not been}} discussed hith-erto, represents the salinity exchanges between the shelf and the <b>deep</b> ocean. A <b>diagnostic</b> study using floats and passive tracers identifies the pathways taken by the freshwater plumes. During the austral winter (JJA), the plumes leave the shelf region north of the BMC. During the austral summer (DJF), the plumes are entrained more directly into the BMC. A sensitivity study indicates that the high-frequency component of the wind stress forcing controls the vertical structure of the plumes while the low-frequency component of the wind stress forcing and the interannual variations of the RdlP discharge controls the horizontal structure of the plumes. Dynamical analysis reveals that the cross-shelf flow has a dominant barotropic structure and, therefore, the SS...|$|R
40|$|Sporadic {{cerebral}} {{small vessel}} {{disease is a}} major cause of cognitive impairment. MRI is an important tool for detecting and mapping cerebral small vessel disease in vivo. Lacunes and white matter changes are recognized as characteristic MRI manifestations of small vessel disease. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) - small, perivascular haemorrhages seen as well-demarcated, hypointense, rounded lesions on MRI sequences sensitive to magnetic susceptibility - are a more recently recognized MRI marker of small vessel pathology. CMBs are increasingly found in various patient populations and disease settings, including first-ever and recurrent ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, vascular cognitive impairment and healthy elderly individuals. Increasing evidence suggests that the anatomical distribution of CMBs (lobar or <b>deep)</b> may have <b>diagnostic</b> value in detecting small vessel disease subtypes including hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. However, the relevance of CMBs for cognitive impairment remains uncertain. The study of CMBs and cognition in populations with cerebrovascular disease presents a special challenge as they coexist and correlate with other cerebrovascular pathologies. This review updates current thinking on how CMBs may be relevant in the study of cognitive impairment in populations with cerebrovascular disease, and how they can contribute in understanding the links between cerebrovascular and degenerative pathologies. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background: Proximal lung tumors, {{though not}} discernable {{by means of}} transthoracic {{ultrasound}} (US), may cause varying degrees of pulmonary collapse and postobstructive pneumonitis which may {{give rise to a}} 'drowned lung' appearance on chest computed tomography (CT) and US. The diagnostic yield for malignancy of US-assisted transthoracic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of these areas of drowned lung is unknown. Objectives: We aimed to explore the feasibility of US-assisted FNA in this setting by prospectively investigating its diagnostic yield and safety. Methods: We enrolled 31 patients (aged 59. 4 ± 9. 7 years, 17 males) with central tumors and secondary drowned lung on CT scan. A respiratory physician performed transthoracic US to identify the target drowned lung tissue. Three US-assisted superficial FNA passes (≤ 20 mm from the pleura) were followed by 3 deeper FNA passes (> 20 mm) aimed {{in the direction of a}} visible or approximated central mass. Rapid on-site evaluation of specimens was used. Results: Superficial FNA was diagnostic in 11 patients (35. 5 %), whereas <b>deeper</b> FNA was <b>diagnostic</b> in 23 patients (74. 2 %, p = 0. 002). Deeper FNA confirmed malignancy in all cases with diagnostic superficial FNA. We observed no pneumothoraces or major hemorrhage. All patients were ultimately diagnosed with malignancy (bronchogenic carcinoma, n = 30; lymphoma, n = 1). Conclusions: US-assisted FNA of drowned lung has an acceptable diagnostic yield and is safe.

This study examines the genetic events initiating leukemia and details the clinical progression of disease across multiple families harboring germ-line CEBPA mutations. Clinical {{data were collected from}} 10 CEBPA-mutated families, representing 24 members with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whole-exome (WES) and deep sequencing were performed to genetically profile tumors and define patterns of clonal evolution. Germline CEBPA mutations clustered within the N-terminal and were highly penetrant, with AML presenting at a median age of 24. 5 years (range, 1. 75 - 46 years). In all diagnostic tumors tested (n = 18), double CEBPA mutations (CEBPAdm) were detected, with acquired (somatic) mutations preferentially targeting the C-terminal. Somatic CEBPA mutations were unstable throughout the disease course, with different mutations identified at recurrence. <b>Deep</b> sequencing of <b>diagnostic</b> and relapse paired samples confirmed that relapse-associated CEBPA mutations were absent at diagnosis, suggesting recurrence was triggered by novel, independent clones. Integrated WES and deep sequencing subsequently revealed an entirely new complement of mutations at relapse, verifying the presentation of a de novo leukemic episode. The cumulative incidence of relapse in familial AML was 56 % at 10 years (n = 11), and 3 patients experienced ≥ 3 disease episodes over a period of 17 to 20 years. Durable responses to secondary therapies were observed, with prolonged median survival after relapse (8 years) and long-term overall survival (10 -year overall survival, 67 %).

This condition constitutes a background for dysplasia and thereby carcinoma. Detection of exact histopathology of inflammatory process is necessary in biopsy specimen.

Materials and Methods: Gastric biopsy specimen of children who suffered from gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms was sent in 10 &#x 0025; formalin to our laboratory. After routine processing, three slides with several sections on them were taken from the specimen: t 0 he first was named the superficial section, the second was stained by Giemsa and the third was named deep section (further sections after this slide will diminish in size). The slides were not taken exactly consecutively but several sections were discarded between them.

Results: In 1062 specimens the results of superficial section and deep section were the same (87. 1 &#x 0025;) and in 158 specimens the results were different. In 88 (7. 2 &#x 0025;) specimens <b>deep</b> section was <b>diagnostic.</b> The difference was seen usually as normal tissue in superficial sections but presence of lymphoid follicle in deep sections.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen a steady rise in the {{occurrence}} and sophistication of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Volume-based attacks aggregate at a target’s access router, suggesting that (i) detection and mitigation is best done by providers in their networks; and (ii) attacks are most readily detectable at access routers, where their impact is strongest. In-network detection presents a tension between scalability and accuracy. Specifically, accuracy of detection dictates fine grained traffic monitoring, while performing such monitoring for the tens or {{hundreds of thousands of}} access interfaces in a large provider network presents serious scalability issues. In this work we investigate the design space for in-network DDoS detection and present a triggered, multi-stage approach that addresses both scalability and accuracy. Each successive stage can access finer resolution data sets, and can perform <b>deeper,</b> more expensive <b>diagnostics</b> if required. We argue that this approach is applicable to any economically feasible, large scale, DDoS detection system. Our second contribution is the design and implementation of an operational instance of our triggered, multi-stage approach. The attractiveness of this system {{lies in the fact that}} it makes use of data that is readily available to an ISP. Specifically, SNMPbased anomalies trigger the collection of Netflow data for detailed attack analysis. Aggregation and compression on the flow data is used to generate alarms concerning possible attack targets. We evaluate the system using SNMP and Netflow data collected from a large tier- 1 ISP and compare the results with alarms generated by a commercial DDoS detection system.

40|$|Introduction. There is an {{increasing}} interest in balanced propofol sedation (BPS) for colonoscopy in outpatient settings. Propofol is a potent anesthetic agent for this purpose and has a narrow therapeutic range, which increases a risk of cardiovascular and respiratory complications in case of improper administration. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare patients’ safety and comfort of endoscopists in two methods of BPS targeting deep sedation - propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) and manual intravenous titration technique (MT) - during colonoscopy. Methods. This prospective randomized controlled trial included 90 patients (class I or II of the American Society of Anesthesiologists) deeply sedated with propofol, coadministered with small doses of midazolam and fentanyl. Propofol was given by MT technique (45 patients) or by TCI (45 patients). The following adverse effects were recorded: hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypoxemia, bradypnea, apnea, hiccupping, and coughing, as well as endoscopist’s comfort during colonoscopy by means of a questionnaire. Results. The MT group compared to the TCI group had a lower mean arterial pressure in the 10 th minute after the beginning (p = 0. 017), and at the end of colonoscopy (p = 0. 006), higher oxygen saturation in the fifth minute (p = 0. 033), and in the 15 th minute (p = 0. 008) after the beginning of colonoscopy, and lower heart rate at the beginning of the procedure (p = 0. 001). There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events. Endoscopist’s comfort during colonoscopy was high 95. 6 % in the TCI group vs. 88. 9 % in the MT group (p = 0. 069). Conclusion. MT is clinically as stable as TCI of propofol for deep sedation during colonoscopy, and endoscopists experienced the same comfort during colonoscopy in both groups. Thus, both combinations are suitable for <b>deep</b> sedation during <b>diagnostic</b> colonoscopy...|$|R

We compute T-e from the Hi Paschen discontinuity and from He I lines. For each object, T-e(H I) is, in general, consistent with T-e derived from CELs, although it has a very large error. Values of T-e(He I) are systematically lower than the T-e derived from CELs. When comparing T-e(H I) and T-e(He I) it is unclear whether the behaviour of both temperatures agrees with the predictions of the temperature fluctuations paradigm, owing to the large errors in T-e(H I).

40|$|ColoPulse tablets are an {{innovative}} {{development in the}} field of oral drug delivery and are characterized by a colon-specific release. Until now ColoPulse dosage forms (only capsules) have been studied in healthy volunteers having a standardized breakfast three hours after administration but not in specific patient groups and not with a shorter interval between administration and breakfast. Information on bioavailability and release characteristics of ColoPulse tablets in Crohn's patients and the influence of food and time of food intake is a prerequisite to properly design future clinical studies with active substances in these patients. In the current cross-over study bioavailability and drug release characteristics of ColoPulse tablets were compared in healthy volunteers and in Crohn's patients in remission. Furthermore the influence of food and time of food intake on the in vivo drug release behavior of ColoPulse tablets was investigated. In this study the dual label isotope strategy was used which means that a ColoPulse tablet containing C- 13 -urea and an uncoated, immediate release tablet containing N- 15 (2) -urea were taken simultaneously. Breath and urine samples were collected during the test day for isotope analysis. The appearance of the stable isotopes in breath and/or urine provides information on the site of release from the dosage form, release characteristics and bioavailability. Both tablets were administered on two different days in a cross-over design: the first day with a breakfast (non-standardized) one hour after administration and the second day with a standardized breakfast three hours after administration of the tablets. There was no difference in instructions for administration between both days. Results of 16 healthy volunteers and 14 Crohn's patients were evaluated. At least 86 % (51 out of 59) of all ColoPulse tablets administered in this study released their contents at the desired intestinal region. There {{was no significant difference in}} bioavailability between healthy volunteers and Crohn's patients on both days (day 1 75. 8 % vs 90. 2 %, p = 0. 070 and day 2 83. 4 % vs 91. 4 %, p = 0. 265). There was also no significant influence of food and time of food intake on bioavailability in healthy volunteers (75. 8 % and 83. 4 %, p = 0. 077) and in Crohn's patients (90. 2 % and 91. 4 %, p = 0. 618) when day 1 and day 2 were compared. Release characteristics did not significantly differ between healthy volunteers and Crohn's patients. However, food and time of food intake had some, clinically non-relevant, influence on the release characteristics within both groups which is in line with the fact that food affects gastrointestinal transit times. This study shows that ColoPulse tablets enable the site-specific delivery of drugs or other compounds (e. g. <b>diagnostics)</b> <b>deep</b> in the ileo-colonic region of the intestine of Crohn's patients in a comparable amount and rate as in healthy volunteers. Food and time of food intake had no relevant influence on bioavailability. In conclusion ColoPulse delivery systems are promising and deserve further research for local therapy with immunosuppressive drugs in Crohn's patients in the near future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
