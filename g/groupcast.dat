40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has become more active with the emergence of low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), which has the advantages of low-power and long communication distance. Among the various LPWAN technologies, long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN, or LoRa) is considered as the most mature technology. However, since LoRa performs uplink-oriented communication to increase energy efficiency, there is a restriction on the downlink function from the network server to the end devices. In this paper, we propose cooperative downlink listening to solve the fundamental problem of LoRa. In particular, the proposed scheme can be extended to various communication models such as <b>groupcasting</b> and geocasting by combining with the data-centric model. Experiments also show that the proposed technology not only significantly reduces network traffic compared to the LoRa standard, but also guarantees maximum energy efficiency of the LoRa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{success of}} Internet {{telephony}} services like Skype illustrates {{the feasibility of}} utilizing unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) networks as an economical platform for supporting group communication applications. However, the ad-hoc nature of these networks poses significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of the group communication services. This paper presents the design and implementation of <b>GroupCast</b> − a utility-aware middleware architecture for scalable and efficient P 2 P group communications. The <b>GroupCast</b> design is characterized by three unique features. First, we present the utility function for quantifying the role of unicast links in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of the group communication applications. This utility function provides a careful {{combination of the two}} most important performance factors, namely relative network locations and resource capabilities of the end hosts. Second, we develop a utility-aware distributed spanning tree construction algorithm for efficiently propagating group communication messages. It dynamically creates and maintains the group communication channels by optimizing the utility value of the group communication spanning trees. Third, we propose a utility-based overlay management protocol for constructing and maintaining low-diameter overlay networks to further enhance the performance of the group communication services. We evaluate the effectiveness of the <b>GroupCast</b> middleware architecture through analytical and experimental analysis of {{the costs and benefits of}} the proposed techniques. Our experimental results show that the Group-Cast system can improve the scalability of wide-area group communication services by one to two orders of magnitude.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>groupcast</b> message test was to measure the RTD of <b>groupcast</b> {{messages}} (including the corresponding acknowledgements by all group members), for different sizes of groups, where the group members were simulated by MN-Simulator (MS-i) programs executed on the remote machines served by the different ISPs. Because we performed this experiment on a different day and from other remote machines, we named these programs MS- 6 to MS- 11 to clarify that the RTD times of this and previous experiments cannot be compared. In this experiment, the common ping delay was approximately 25 ms (except for MS- 11, which was 444 ms). The down- and uplinks varied between 1.59 and 1.2 Mbps and 0.93 and 0.33 Mbps, respectively. It {{should be noted that}} MS- 11 was a machine connected in Europe, and therefore, its RTD is much higher than those of the other vehicles executed on the Brazilian machines. For this experiment, we turned off the induced mobile-initiated handover behaviour of the simulated MNs (HO_P= 0), i.e., they would only switch to another Gateway if their MR-UDP connection in fact failed.|$|E
40|$|The index coding {{problem is}} studied from an {{interference}} alignment perspective providing new results {{as well as}} new insights into, and generalizations of, previously known results. An equivalence is established between the capacity of multiple unicast index coding (where each message is desired by exactly one receiver), and <b>groupcast</b> index coding (where a message can be desired by multiple receivers), which settles the heretofore open question of insufficiency of linear codes for the multiple unicast index coding problem by equivalence with <b>groupcast</b> settings, where this question has previously been answered. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the achievability of rate half per message in the index coding problem are shown to be a natural consequence of interference alignment constraints, and generalizations to feasibility of rate 1 /(L+ 1) per message when each destination desires at least L messages, are similarly obtained. Finally, capacity optimal solutions are presented to a series of symmetric index coding problems inspired by the local connectivity and local interference characteristics of wireless networks.

This paper generalizes the cache-aided coded multicast problem to a source compression with distributed side information problem that specifically accounts for the correlation among the content files. It is shown how joint file compression during the caching and delivery phases can provide load reductions that go beyond those achieved with existing schemes.

Most DDS studies present comparisons between and benchmarks of different DDS vendors’ implementations, such as [26 – 28], but none of them mention wireless networks or mobile DDS deployments. Among the few works that focus on mobile devices, we found the DDS-based middleware proposed in [4], named DDSS. DDSS includes a specific architectural element that supports mobile nodes and ensures reliable data delivery even for mobile subscribers that switch their wireless access points during system operation, similar to the handovers supported in SDDL. In the proposed architecture, all mobile devices are required to execute a lightweight version of DDS, the Mobile DDS Client, whereas stationary nodes on the fixed communication network run full-fledged DDS nodes and are responsible for the routing and delivery of data to all nodes. Due to DDS connectivity and Firewall/NAT traversal restrictions (unless a VPN is created), all these Mobile DDS Clients must run in a single network domain and rely on stable wireless connectivity. Moreover, the authors present no data about the communication performance over wireless networks, and there is apparently no support for context-defined groups and <b>groupcast</b> communication.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of caching networks has received considerable {{attention in the}} past few years. A particularly studied setting is the shared link caching network, in which a single source with access to a file library communicates with multiple users, each having the capability to store segments (packets) of the library files, over a shared multicast link. Each user requests one file from the library according to a common demand distribution and the server sends a coded multicast message to satisfy all users at once. The problem consists of finding the smallest possible average codeword length to satisfy such requests. In this paper, we consider the generalization to the case where each user places L >= 1 independent requests according to the same common demand distribution. We propose an achievable scheme based on random vector (packetized) caching placement and multiple <b>groupcast</b> index coding, shown to be order-optimal in the asymptotic regime in which the number of packets per file B goes to infinity. We then show that the scalar (B = 1) version of the proposed scheme can still preserve order-optimality when the number of per-user requests L is large enough. Our results provide the first order-optimal characterization of the shared link caching network with multiple random requests, revealing the key effects of L on the performance of caching-aided coded multicast schemes.

40|$|Mención Internacional en el título de doctorWhile the IEEE 802. 11 {{protocol}} has fostered ubiquitous connectivity for wireless users, {{it was not}} {{originally designed}} to efficiently handle voice or video traffic, which nowadays accounts {{for most of the}} Internet traffic. Voice traffic handling is extremely inefficient in existing WLANs due to the large overhead of the protocol and the time spent in contention. Video multicast streaming is both ineffective and inefficient, as its transmissions lack reliability and use a low Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS). The more robust, but slower, transmission rates result in the well-known performance anomaly problem that degrades network performance. In this thesis we analyze, design and implement solutions to improve the network performance and efficiency when voice and video traffic are present. We first design and experimentally validate a simple yet very effective scheme (VoIPiggy) to improve the efficiency of WLANs with voice traffic. The key idea of VoIPiggy is to piggyback voice frames onto MAC layer acknowledgments, hereby reducing both the frame overhead and the number of times to access the medium, i. e., the time spent in contention as stations aggregate two frames into a single transmission. To quantify the gains of our proposal, we perform an analysis in terms of capacity and delay. Our experimental and analytical results show a dramatic performance improvement, doubling the number of voice conversations that can be allocated in WLANs. Second, we explore a set of mechanisms included in the 802. 11 aa standard (namely, Direct Multicast Sequence, <b>Groupcast</b> with Retries Unsolicited Retries and Block Acknowledgment), which allow efficient and robust multicast transmission in WLANs. To that aim, we first perform extensive simulations to understand the trade-offs resulting from using the proposed mechanisms. Our results quantify these trade-offs in terms of robustness, resource consumption and complexity, and provide a set of recommended guidelines for their use according to the network scenario. Finally, we develop the first open source implementation of these mechanisms over commodity hardware. We assess their performance under a variety of real-life scenarios, and outline their effectiveness and efficiency when delivering video traffic. Our results provide key insights on which mechanism results more appropriate for a given scenario, this being specified in terms of number of stations, background traffic and video bandwidth.

40|$|While much recent {{progress}} on interference networks has come about {{under the assumption}} of abundant channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), a complementary perspective is sought in this work through the study of interference networks with no CSIT except a coarse knowledge of the topology of the network that only allows a distinction between weak and significant channels and no further knowledge  of the channel coefficients' realizations. Modeled as a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) study of a partially connected interference network with no CSIT, the problem is {{found to have a}} counterpart in the capacity analysis of wired networks with arbitrary linear network coding  at intermediate nodes, under the assumption that the sources are aware only of the end to end topology of the network. The network capacity (wired) and DoF (wireless) region, expressed in dimensionless units as multiples of the capacity (wired) and DoF (wireless) of a single link, are found to be bounded above by the capacity of an index coding problem where the antidotes graph is the complement of the interference graph of the original network and the bottleneck link capacity is normalized to unity. The problems are shown to be equivalent under linear solutions. An interference alignment perspective is then used to translate the existing index coding solutions into the wired network capacity and wireless network DoF solutions, as well as to find new  and unified solutions to different classes of all three problems. For networks with $K$ messages, a study of the extremes [...] when each message achieves half the cake, and when each message can achieve no more than $ 1 /K$ of the cake, reveals the necessary and sufficient conditions for each, in terms of alignment graphs and demand graphs, respectively. Half the cake per message is achievable if and only if the alignment graph has no internal conflicts. No more than $ 1 /K$ of the cake is achievable if and only if the network can be relaxed into a $K$-unicast setting with an acyclic demand graph. For half-rate-feasible networks, best case capacity (DoF) improvements over the best orthogonal (TDMA) and multicast (CDMA) solutions are explored for multiple <b>groupcast</b> and multiple unicast settings, and shown to be of polynomial order in the number of messages. For intermediate cases where neither half the cake, nor $ 1 /K$ of the cake per message is capacity (DoF) optimal, the interference alignment perspective is used to characterize the symmetric capacity (DoF) of all cases where each  alignment set either does not contain a cycle or does not contain a fork. A study of linear feasible rates shows duality properties that are used to extend the scope of previous results. For wireless networks, extensions to multiple antenna networks are made in symmetric settings where all nodes are equipped with the same number of antennas.
