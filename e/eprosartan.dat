2500|$|The {{effects of}} drug-related dysgeusia {{can often be}} {{reversed}} by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with valsartan.

Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking <b>eprosartan</b> on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension.

50|$|Structure-activity {{relationship}} (SAR)Most of the ARBs {{have the}} same pharmacophore so the difference in their biochemical and physiological effects is mostly due to different substituents. Activity of a drug is dependent of its affinity for the substrate site {{and the length of}} time it binds to the site.Lipophilic substituents like the linear alkyl group at the 2-position on the imidazole ring together with the biphenyl-methyl group, associate with hydrophobic pockets of the receptor. An acidic group like tetrazole, CO2H or NHSO2CF3 at the 1-position of the biphenyl-methyl group will bind to a basic position in the receptor and are required for potent antagonistic activity. In valsartan, the imidazole ring of losartan has been replaced with an acylated amino acid.Several substituents have been tried at the 4- and 5- positions on the imidazole ring. The chloro and hydroxymethyl groups connected to these positions in losartan are probably not of much importance in receptor binding since the other ARBs do not possess these functional groups and have comparable or better binding affinities than losartan. Irbesartan has a carbonyl group at the 5-position, functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor in place of the hydroxymethyl group of losartan, resulting in a longer binding to the receptor. The structure of <b>eprosartan</b> is the one that differs most from the other ARBs, the usual biphenyl-methyl group {{has been replaced by a}} carboxy benzyl group that mimics more closely the phenolic moiety of Tyr4 group of Ang II. This change results in a stronger binding to the receptor but the biochemical and physiological effects are not significantly improved. Telmisartan has a carboxylic acid at the 2-position of the biphenyl-methyl group and is more potent than the tetrazole analogue. It has been reported that imidazoles that have hydroxymethyl and carboxy groups at the 4- and 5 position, possessed potent antagonistic activity, caused by the hydrogen bonding and hydrophilicity of the hydroxymethyl group.It has also been reported that an hydroxy group in the 4-position on the imidazole ring, plays an important role in the binding affinity and compensates for the disadvantage of lipophilicity of the bulky alkyl group.These results show that a medium-sized hydroxy alkyl group, such as CHMeOH and CMe2OH, is favorable for the substituent of the 4-position on the imidazole ring. Furthermore, the ionizable group is favorable for the binding affinity.|$|E

40|$|Background: Persistent {{activation}} of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is known to occur in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) despite treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) therapy. When added to ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) antagonists may allow more complete blockade of the RAAS and preserve the beneficial effects of bradykinin accumulation not seen with AT 1 receptor blockade alone. Methods: Thirty-six patients with stable New York Heart Association class II-IV CHF receiving ACE inhibitor therapy were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive either <b>eprosartan,</b> a specific competitive AT 1 receptor antagonist (400 to 800 mg daily, n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) for 8 weeks.

40|$|Abstract: Rationale. The goal of {{antihypertensive}} {{treatment is}} to reduce risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Apart from blood pressure lowering per se, also reducing {{the activities of the}} renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system appears to be important.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the inhibitory potency of two selective angiotensin AT, receptor antagonists, <b>eprosartan</b> and candesartan, at the level of the sympathetic nerve terminal and the vascular smooth muscle. Male New Zealand White rabbits, weighing 2100 - 2550 g, were used. To study <b>eprosartan</b> and candesartan at the neuronal angiotensin AT, receptor, we investigated their influence on the angiotensin II-enhanced, electrical field stimulation-evoked sympathetic transmission in the rabbit isolated thoracic aorta in a noradrenaline spillover model. To study both antagonists at the vascular angiotensin AT(1) receptor, concentration-response curves for angiotensin II were constructed in the presence or absence of the two angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II (10 nM) caused a significant increase by 107 +/- 11. 1 % of the stimulation-evoked sympathetic outflow, which was concentration-dependently inhibited by both <b>eprosartan</b> (pIC(50) 7. 91 +/- 0. 12) and candesartan (pIC(50) 10. 76 +/- 0. 13). Angiotensin II (1 nM- 0. 3 muM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in contractile force (E-max 20. 62 +/- 2. 24 mN, pD(2) 8. 16 +/- 0. 04). Both <b>eprosartan</b> (pA(2) 8. 90 +/- 0. 11, pIC(50) 8. 87 +/- 0. 12 (10 nM angiotensin II)) and candesartan (pD(2) ' 10. 80 +/- 0. 13) counteracted the contractions evoked by cumulative concentrations of angiotensin II. Candesartan proved a more potent antagonist than <b>eprosartan</b> at both the pre- and postjunctional angiotensin AT(1) receptor. For <b>eprosartan,</b> vascular inhibitory concentrations were 10 -fold lower than sympatho-inhibitory concentrations, whereas for candesartan, inhibitory concentrations at both sites were similar.

BackgroundExperimental data in humans on {{the contribution of}} angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers to the nitric oxide system of the renal vasculature are inconsistent. Enalapril and <b>eprosartan,</b> alone and in combination, {{were used to determine}} their short-term effects on the renal nitric oxide system and renal hemodynamics of human subjects with essential hypertension. MethodsTwenty male, white patients (27 ± 1 years) with mild essential hypertension (143 ± 11 / 95 ± 6 mm Hg) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fourfold cross-over study with placebo, enalapril (20 mg/day), <b>eprosartan</b> (600 mg/day), or combination of both drugs (10 and 300 mg/day, respectively) each over a one week period followed by a two-week washout phase. After each study phase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were determined. Basal nitric oxide synthesis of the renal vasculature was assessed by the decrease in RPF after inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 4. 25 mg/kg). ResultsAfter one week of therapy, the combination therapy decreased casual blood pressure by 5 ± 2 / 3 ± 1 mm Hg versus placebo (P ! 0. 01). Neither enalapril alone (- 2 ± 2 / 1 ± 2 mm Hg, NS vs. placebo) nor <b>eprosartan</b> alone (- 1 ± 1 / 0 ± 2 mm Hg, NS vs. placebo) had a clear-cut significant effect on casual blood pressure. In the combination phase, RPF increased by 123 ± 36 mL/min (P ! 0. 01). Neither enalapril alone (+ 59 ± 46 mL/min, P = 0. 21) nor <b>eprosartan</b> alone (+ 113 ± 51 mL/min, P = 0. 06) had a clear-cut significant effect on RPF. Changes of RPF induced by treatment correlated with the L-NMMA induced decrease in RPF in the combination (r = 0. 70, P ! 0. 01) and <b>eprosartan</b> phase (r = 0. 86, P ! 0. 001), but not in the enalapril phase (r = - 0. 44, P = 0. 10). Renal vascular resistance was reduced by each active treatment with the most prominent reduction in the combination phase. GFR was unaffected by any treatment. ConclusionsIn contrast to the effects of either substance alone, a combination of half the dose of <b>eprosartan</b> with half the dose of enalapril had a prominent effect on renal perfusion. The effects of <b>eprosartan</b> on RPF are mediated, at least in part, by an increased bioavailability of nitric oxide in the renal vasculature...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the cost-utility of <b>eprosartan</b> versus enalapril (primary prevention) and versus nitrendipine (secondary prevention) {{on the basis}} of head-to-head evidence from randomized controlled trials. MethodsThe HEALTH model (Health Economic Assessment of Life with Teveten® for Hypertension) is an object-oriented probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model. It combines a Framingham-based risk calculation with a systolic blood pressure approach to estimate the relative risk reduction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events based on recent meta-analyses. In secondary prevention, an additional risk reduction is modeled for <b>eprosartan</b> according to the results of the MOSES study (“Morbidity and Mortality after Stroke—Eprosartan Compared to Nitrendipine for Secondary Prevention”). Costs and utilities were derived from published estimates considering European country-specific health-care payer perspectives. ResultsComparing <b>eprosartan</b> to enalapril in a primary prevention setting the mean costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were highest in Germany (€ 24, 036) followed by Belgium (€ 17, 863), the UK (€ 16, 364), Norway (€ 13, 834), Sweden (€ 11, 691) and Spain (€ 7918). In a secondary prevention setting (<b>eprosartan</b> vs. nitrendipine) the highest costs per QALY gained have been observed in Germany (€ 9136) followed by the UK (€ 6008), Norway (€ 1695), Sweden (€ 907), Spain (€− 2054) and Belgium (€− 5767). ConclusionsConsidering a € 30, 000 willingness-to-pay threshold per QALY gained, <b>eprosartan</b> is cost-effective as compared to enalapril in primary prevention (patients ≥ 50 years old and a systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg) and cost-effective as compared to nitrendipine in secondary prevention (all investigated patients) ...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{angiotensin}} H type I (AT(1)) receptor antagonists <b>eprosartan</b> and candesartan and AT(2) receptor antagonist PD 123319 on Ana II-induced facilitation of noradrenergic neurotransmission {{were investigated}} in isolated rabbit mesenteric artery under isometric conditions. Sympathoinhibitory potency of AT(1) blockers was {{compared with their}} potency concerning inhibition of direct vasoconstrictor effect of Ana II. To investigate blockade of presynaptic AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, effects of Ang II on electrical field stimulation (EFS) -induced contractions in {{presence or absence of}} <b>eprosartan,</b> candesartan. or PD 123319 were studied. To investigate blockade of postsynaptic AT, receptors, effects of either <b>eprosartan</b> or candesartan on concentration-response curves of Ana II were studied. In addition, effect of Ana 11 on postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated responses was studied using noradrenaline. EFS (1, 2, and 4 Hz) caused an increase of contractile force. At stimulation frequencies of 1, 2, and 4 Hz, a subpressor concentration of Ana II (0. 5 nM) increased stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses by 2. 8 +/- 0. 5, 2. 4 +/- 0. 4. and 1. 6 +/- 0. 1 of control values, respectively (p < 0. 05 compared with control for all frequencies). The enhancement could be antagonized by <b>eprosartan</b> (1 nM- 0. 1 muM) and candesartan (1 nM- 0. 1 muM). The AT(2) antagonist PD 123319 (10 nM) did not influence Ang II-induced facilitation of stimulation-induced contractions. Contractile responses to exogenous noradrenaline were unaltered in presence of Ana 11 0. 5 nM. Ana 11 (1 nM- 0. 3 muM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in contractile force, which could be antagonized by <b>eprosartan</b> (pD(2) ' 8. 8 +/- 0. 19) and candesartan (pD(2) ' 11. 3 +/- 0. 23). Thus, the facilitating effect of Ana II on noradrenergic neurotransmission is mediated by presynaptically located AT, receptors and not by AT(2) receptors. For <b>eprosartan,</b> sympathoinhibition was achieved at concentrations that also block AT, receptors on vascular smooth muscle. In contrast, for candesartan, presynaptic inhibitory concentrations were considerably higher than those required for postsynaptic inhibitio...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of hypertension and in renal disease, particularly in patients with diabetes, has become increasingly evident. Pharmacological blockade of the RAAS offers potential for the therapeutic management of these pathologies. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor blockers {{have been shown to}} exhibit effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension. AII receptor blockers have a renal protective effect owing to their ability to reduce systemic blood and intraglomerular pressures. <b>Eprosartan</b> is a chemically distinct AII blocker, which displays a dual mode of action whereby it blocks both pre- and postsynaptic AT 1 receptors, potentially benefiting patients with hypertension and renal disease. In addition, evidence suggests that <b>eprosartan</b> is well tolerated by both healthy subjects and patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, such that the dose {{does not need to be}} - modified in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Results from preliminary studies demonstrate that <b>eprosartan</b> doses well below those required for blood pressure control have a pronounced effect on the kidney and do not compromise renal autoregulatory mechanisms. Therefore, <b>eprosartan</b> may have a benefit in the prevention or delay of renal damage in hypertensive patients with renal impairment, although this remains to be determined in a clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|Rationale. The goal of {{antihypertensive}} {{treatment is}} to reduce risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Apart from blood pressure lowering per se, also reducing {{the activities of the}} renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system appears to be important. Angiotensin II receptor blocker drugs (ARBs) have provided a useful class of anti-hypertensive drugs. <b>Eprosartan</b> is a relatively new ARB which is chemically distinct (non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole) from all other ARBs (biphenyl tetrazoles). An analysis has been made on available experimental and clinical data on <b>eprosartan</b> which not only is an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agent, but also lowers the activities of the renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system. Experimental and pharmacokinetic studies on <b>eprosartan</b> have shown differences with the other ARBs. The distinct properties of this non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole ARB might be relevant in the effort to reduce cardiovascular risk, also beyond its blood pressure lowering capacity...|$|E
