5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first class record (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> match and was persuaded to step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E
5|$|Parker was the {{youngest}} son of Joseph Parker and his wife Jane Shannon, and the great-nephew of Ohio Governor Wilson Shannon. He was raised on the family farm near Barnesville, Ohio. He attended Breeze Hill Primary School, followed by the Barnesville Classical Institute, a private school. He taught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> primary school {{to pay for his}} secondary education. At 17, he began an apprenticeship in law, and passed the Ohio bar exam in 1859.|$|E
5|$|The Diet of 1468 {{authorized}} Matthias to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax {{to finance the}} new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf {{that he would not}} demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county,</b> the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|As a boy Smith {{trained with}} Millwall, Sheffield United, {{who had a}} base in Amersham, and Watford, who he was with {{until the age of}} 12. After only playing for Comets Sports club in Sunday league {{football}} for two years, he was given a chance by his father at Watford <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> trial at the age of 14 and signed with them again. Manager Graham Taylor gave Smith his debut for Watford on 18 November 1997, bringing him on as a substitute in a 2–1 Second Division win over Oldham Athletic. Smith did not play another league game in 1997–98, but made eight appearances for Watford as they qualified for the play-offs in the 1998–99 season, where the club gained promotion to the Premiership. He established himself in the team during the club's first Premier League season, making 23 appearances and scoring two goals, including one at Vicarage Road against Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Before {{returning}} {{to play for}} Somerset, Mitchell-Innes once again featured for the Gentlemen at Lord's, though in a low-scoring match, he was dismissed for less than 20 runs in each innings. In six matches for Somerset in July and August, Mitchell-Innes scored 499 runs, and his average of 55.44 was the county's best that season. He scored 182, his best score for Somerset, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>County</b> Championship match against Worcestershire, and followed it up with another century in the next match, against Lancashire. In all, 1936 was statistically Mitchell-Innes' best season; he scored 1,438 runs {{at an average of}} 44.93.|$|E

5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a Democrat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was summoned}} to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and {{subsequently}} offered {{a contract with the}} ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship—a player had to be born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Trescothick {{impressed}} Glamorgan coach Duncan Fletcher <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county</b> {{match at}} Taunton, by scoring 167 in a low-scoring match where the next-highest innings was 50. When England opening batsman Nick Knight sustained a finger injury in 2000, Fletcher, {{who had been}} appointed England coach, called on Trescothick to make his England debut in the NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. Trescothick's regular selection for England meant that he was rarely available for domestic selection between 2000 and 2006, often playing only a few matches for Somerset {{at the start of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|Norman Stewart Mitchell-Innes {{was born}} in Calcutta on 7 September 1914, where {{his father was a}} {{businessman}} of Scottish descent. Both his father, also named Norman, and his grandfather, Gilbert, were keen golfers. The former was the All India Amateur Golf Champion in 1893 and 1894, while the latter captained Prestwick Golf Club. He moved to England with his family at the age of five to live in Minehead, Somerset, and gained a scholarship to Sedbergh School based in Cumbria. At Sedbergh he developed quickly as a cricketer, first playing for the school's first team aged 15. The subsequent year, he scored 302 not out in a house match in one afternoon. In the summer of 1931, after scoring two half-centuries for Sedbergh against Durham School and Stonyhurst College, Mitchell-Innes was called up to play for Somerset County Cricket Club <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>County</b> Championship match against Warwickshire. He had to travel down from Scotland by overnight train for the fixture at the County Ground, Taunton. He took two wickets, and scored 23 runs in the match, which was drawn.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day, Perot {{finished}} {{in third place}} behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% {{of the vote in}} Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>county,</b> winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska and Loving County, Texas with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} and second Tests, Willis went back to Warwickshire to face Gloucestershire <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>County</b> Championship match, {{grabbing}} three wickets. He returned to face Australia on 2 July for the second Test, and England batting first. Thanks to 82 from Peter Willey, and a second half-century from Gatting, together with five runs from Willis, England reached 311 – though Geoff Lawson took seven wickets. Australia surpassed this and were dismissed for 345, with three wickets for Willis and three for Dilley. The England bowlers suffered from no balls, Willis alone bowling 28. England declared late in the game on 265/8, and Willis picked up another wicket as Australia reached 90/4 at the close of play. Botham, who had captained the side until then, was sacked and replaced by Brearley. Willis, who was struggling for fitness and had a chest infection, was dropped from the side. He sat out a Warwickshire county match and after speaking to Alec Bedser was given back his place in the team on the condition that he played in a 40-over match, played a Second XI game, and bowled 12 overs in the nets. He succeeded in these tasks, and was tentatively let back into the squad over a spinner.|$|E
