However, some challenges are facing in fabrication and {{assembly of the parts}} with composite materials.

40|$|Abstract—The {{improvement}} of light <b>extraction</b> <b>efficiency</b> of InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using microsphere arrays with various refractive indices was analyzed. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations {{show that the}} use of micro-sphere (nm) arrays with refractive indices of 1. 8 and 2. 5 led to increase in light <b>extraction</b> <b>efficiency</b> of InGaN LEDs by 1. 9 times and 2. 2 times, respectively. The enhancement in light <b>extraction</b> <b>efficiency</b> is attributed to the decrease in the Fresnel reflection and increase in effective photon escape cone due to graded refractive index and curvature formed between microsphere and free space. The maximum enhancement of light <b>extraction</b> <b>efficiency</b> of InGaN quantum well LEDs was achieved by employing the refractive index matched anatase-TiO mi-crosphere arrays.

30|$|Many qPCR {{approaches}} for the quantification of microbial communities {{rely on the}} knowledge of the DNA <b>extraction</b> <b>efficiency,</b> the number of gene copies per genome and the number of genome copies per organism. However, such data is not always available in genomic databases and may show broad variation (Kim et al. [2013]; Malandrin et al. [1999]; Mileyko et al. [2008]). Another factor of uncertainty is a varying DNA <b>extraction</b> <b>efficiency.</b> As a result, the conversion of DNA copy numbers to actual biomass concentrations is often a vague procedure. The here presented quantification method overcomes these limitations because the native qPCR signal is directly linked to the biomass concentration of the species of interest.
